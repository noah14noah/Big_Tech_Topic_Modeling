The investigation is long overdue, he said, and Congress must determine whether the antitrust laws \"are equipped for the competition problems of our modern economy.\"</p><p>Mr. Cicilline noted the steep layoffs in the news industry in recent years, saying the dominant position of the online platforms in the advertising market has created \"an economic catastrophe for news publishers, forcing them to cut back on their investments in quality journalism.\" At the same time, he said, tech platforms that are gateways to news online \"have operated with virtual immunity from the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>As a partial solution, Mr. Cicilline proposed legislation to establish an antitrust exemption that would allow news companies to band together to negotiate revenue rates with big tech platforms. He called it \"a life support measure, not the remedy for long-term health\" of the news business.</p><p>The senior Republican on the full committee, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, said he backs Mr. Cicilline's proposal.</p><p>Addressing the broader question of antitrust, however, he said, \"Big is not necessarily bad,\" adding that lawmakers need to proceed cautiously.</p><p>The head of an association that represents technology and telecom companies said the government scrutiny of successful companies is appropriate. However, an antitrust exemption for the news industry wouldn't solve the problem, said Matt Schruer, vice-president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.</p><p>Before the internet, \"news publishers received an exemption to deal with previous competitors like radio and TV news [and they] have not worked,\" Mr.Schruer said. \"The results were fewer choices for readers and less competition among news outlets.\"</p><p>Stepping ahead of the criticism, Google LLC's vice-president of news Richard Gingras said the company has \"worked for many years to be a collaborative and supportive technology and advertising partner to the news industry.\"</p><p>\"Every month, Google News and Google Search drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue,\" he said in a statement Tuesday.</p><p>With regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission apparently pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook Inc., Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com, and several state attorneys-general exploring bipartisan action of their own, the tech industry finds itself in a precarious moment - with the dreaded M-word increasingly used to describe their way of doing business. Mr. Cicilline has flatly called them monopolies.</p><p>Politicians on the left and right have differing gripes about the tech giants. Some complain of aggressive conduct that squashes competition. Others perceive a political bias or tolerance of extremist content. Still others are upset by the industry's harvesting of personal data.</p><p>Several Democratic presidential candidates think they have the solution: breaking up the companies on antitrust grounds.</p><p>Mr. Cicilline has called that \"a last resort,\" but the idea has currency with both major political parties, including at the White House.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump noted the huge fines imposed by European regulators on the biggest tech companies.</p><p>\"We are going to be looking at them differently,\" he said in an interview Monday on CNBC.</p><p>\"We should be doing what [the Europeans] are doing,\" Mr.Trump said. \"Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\"</p><p>The tech giants have mostly declined to comment on the antitrust investigations.</p><p>Google has said that scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators \"often improves our products and the policies that govern them,\" and that in some areas, such as data protection, laws need to be updated.</p><p>Facebook executives have been calling broadly for regulation while explicitly rejecting the idea of breaking up \"a successful American company.\" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has called for new rules in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.</p><p>When Democratic presidential contender Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted in April that tech giants like Amazon should be broken up, Amazon tweeted back, \"Walmart is much larger.\"</p><p>And Apple has countered a legal challenge to its management of the App Store by saying it \"will prevail when the facts are presented and the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.\"</p><p>In hearings and closed-door work over coming months, lawmakers in the House aim to unpeel the complex onion of the tech industry's dominance. They are expected to summon the CEOs of the major companies to appear before the panel. Not showing up, as some CEOs have done in the past, is unlikely to be tolerated.</p><p>\"There could be something really useful\" to emerge as legislation, said Allen Grunes, who led merger investigations at the Justice Department as an antitrust attorney.</p><p>Lawmakers could address, for example, the galloping acquisition of small companies by the tech giants or craft an update of antitrust laws to apply better to complex tech behemoths, suggested Mr. Grunes, a co-founder and attorney at the Konkurrenz Group in Washington.</p><p>\"It's not illegal to be a monopoly,\" he said. \"But it's wrong for someone at the top of the hill to kick the people off who are trying to climb it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20190612rbibcongresstech</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB0-FH51-F06S-301Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"987\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

The FTC's Bureau of Competition will put some 17 staff attorneys on the task force, which will consult on tech-related merger reviews, investigations and reviews of consummated tech deals. \"It makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition,\" FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement. </p><p>The agency's Bruce Hoffman, head of the Bureau of Competition, did not rule out taking action to undo a consummated deal if anticompetitive behavior was found, but declined to discuss specific transactions. Unwinding a deal after it has closed is \"very rare,\" said Henry Su of the law firm Constantine Cannon LLP. Facebook, already under investigation by the FTC, is accused of violating a 2011 consent decree regarding privacy by allowing the personal information of 87 million users to end up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, a Britain-based political consulting firm hired by President Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. election campaign. Facebook's shares pared modest gains after the FTC task force announcement, closing down about 0.3 percent at US$164.13. Advocacy groups, such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, have urged the FTC to require Facebook to unwind its purchases of Instagram, used to share photos, and WhatsApp, a private messaging app. The App Association, which represents app makers, said it looked forward to the task force's work. \"A robust, competitive environment allows small businesses to fully participate in this economy, with new opportunities emerging at a rapid pace,\" association president Morgan Reed said in a statement. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents brick and mortar stores whose businesses have been disrupted by online retailers, said creation of the task force will \"bring needed scrutiny to the relatively few technology platforms that control a growing share of modern commerce.\" (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Susan Thomas) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11292458</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHJ-GB51-DYWP-R1SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"370\"/><timeReceived>10:21 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

This is FIRST MOVE, and here's your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retail rebound. U.S. consumer spending surges almost 18 percent in May.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Beijing's battle. China extends lockdown measures as COVID-19 spreads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And ready to reopen. Singapore's Foreign Minister talks timing, COVID tracing, and the road to recovery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Tuesday. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. Good to be with you as always. It's a day where the power of Powell -- Jay Powell, I mean -- of the Federal Reserve is on display as he testifies in Congress just a day after announcing that the bank will be buying individual company's debt. We'll discuss later on in the show, but I'll tell you what, the mighty U.S. consumer also fighting for the top spot and the spotlight here, too.</p><p>Let me walk you through the numbers. U.S. retail sales, as I mentioned, spiking almost 18 percent in May after falling by more than 16 percent in April and over eight percent in March. So, admittedly, bouncing back from a low base, but that's double what analysts had been expecting in May.</p><p>Now, pent-up demand may be at play here, too. We had people receiving stimulus checks and of course, them spending them in many cases. The big question now though, of course, how quickly can spending continue to recover when you've got millions of Americans unemployed? You've got enhanced jobless benefits running out next month if Congress don't act. You can expect Jay Powell to argue for more support today, yet again.</p><p>All of the details on these numbers coming up.</p><p>In the meantime, as you can imagine, futures are well and truly in positive territory. We've been higher earlier on yet more stimulus chatter. Bloomberg reporting that the White House is now eyeing a $1 trillion Infrastructure Spending Bill to help support the economy. Support and stimulus are the buzzwords globally once again today and that means lots of green arrows.</p><p>The European Central Bank, an official there suggesting they could consider expanding their corporate bond buying program to include bonds that have lost their investment grade rating, so more risky companies we're talking about.</p><p>The Bank of Japan today leaving rates unchanged, but they also said they were open to fresh support if needed. As you can see there, Japan and South Korean stocks rallying some five percent in the session.</p><p>Plenty to discuss as always. The good news is, Christine Romans joins me now. Christine, I wasn't sure where we were going to start, but that number did it for me. That's a bounce back, and it's happening again quicker than we expected.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: And you know, it's interesting, too, because when you look at the prior month, it was a little shallower than we had expected. They revised that one to 14.7 percent, the previous decline, so this bounce back, bigger than economists had been expecting is leading to a lot of chatter that the worst is behind us.</p><p>And consumers, armed with all those stimulus checks and some of them going back to work, 2.5 million jobs added, are starting to spend again. Online spending, of course, big here, but look at clothing spending, up 188 percent. Furniture spending up big.</p><p>We know that some of the malls have been opening. Macy's and GAP and others with social distancing and with no open changing rooms have been beginning to open very carefully, so you're seeing that consumers are following suit.</p><p>Now, I don't want to sound like an Economics Professor, but I will for a moment.</p><p>There's the level and then there's the direction of change, and the direction of change clearly important here. It shows a bounce. But we are still at pre-pandemic levels, bouncing from a very, very low base.</p><p>There was a lot of damage done and the consumer essentially stopped for a couple of months and now is starting to peek back out there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And therein lies the key. Pent-up demand. All the things that people weren't able to buy for a few months, in addition to all the money, the stimulus checks, the bump up in unemployment, and I raise the question at the top of the show, and I'll pose it to you here, too.</p><p>What next? Can we bring jobs back? What happens with the money? All of this is going to be determinative of how the consumer reacts from here.</p><p>ROMANS: And I think that there's an assumption here and a need that there's a next phase of nurturing along this economic recovery, right? You've got this Bloomberg article talking about a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending. That would be under the guise of, you know, a Transportation Bill, but put a lot of stimulus in there on 5G and rural broadband and the like. That's an interesting play that people are talking about now.</p><p>You've got, of course, the Democrats who want to spend a lot of money to help state and local budgets. Those are going to have to be addressed in the weeks and months ahead, no question.</p><p>[09:05:07]</p><p>ROMANS: There's talk of new stimulus checks. Will we do more of those? What happens to those enhanced unemployment benefits? Is there some sort of reward for going back to work? A payment for going back to work?</p><p>We're seeing the contours, really, of what the next phase of recovery will look like.</p><p>You know, and depending on the player, there are different objectives and goals and tools for this, but we know the Fed is doing things it has never done before to support this economy. We're assuming that Congress knows it's going to have to do more to support this economy and maybe Jay Powell from the Fed is going to make that point again today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'm sure he will, to your exact point, don't let good news in the bounce back phase here distract you from the need to do more and the risk that we double dip in the U.S. economy. Never mind anywhere else.</p><p>ROMANS: No more.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Christine Romans. Yes. Thank you. Yes, we have that habit.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. All right. A new reminder, we're not out of the woods yet with coronavirus, we're clearly not.</p><p>After nearly two months with no reports of fresh infections, the City of Beijing has now locked down dozens of neighborhoods to tackle a widening outbreak.</p><p>More than a hundred cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in just the last five days. Ivan Watson joins us now. Ivan, Beijing authorities clearly not shy of taking stringent measures to try and lock down the spread of this virus. What's the latest?</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they haven't completely shut down the Chinese capital, but we are seeing the incremental tightening of activities and of movements in the city as the outbreak does continue to grow.</p><p>Now, if you look at the bigger picture, as of now, in a five-day period, the Chinese authorities say they have detected only 106 locally transmitted cases of coronavirus in a five-day period. Compared to what china saw in January and February in the City of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic, that's relatively small.</p><p>But they're clearly concerned that this could continue to grow and spiral out of control. They don't want a repeat of that, a Wuhan 2.0 as one Chinese journalist put it.</p><p>The infections have spread to at least three other Chinese provinces, so you have had an expansion of the number of residential compounds that have been locked down, where residents are not allowed to leave, where food is being delivered to those compounds that the residents can then purchase food at.</p><p>We have seen postponement of the reopening of elementary schools, that sports and cultural entertainment events have been canceled, and there's a massive testing binge of tens of thousands of people as the Chinese authorities also try to contact trace some 200,000 people that were believed to have moved through this enormous Xinfadi Wholesale Food Market where the cluster is first believed to have emerged.</p><p>Since then, the authorities have had to shut down two other food markets and disinfect, as they say, tens of thousands of restaurants.</p><p>One of the key questions here, Julia, is how did this cluster of infections begin in the first place? And we haven't gotten an answer from the Chinese authorities on that yet.</p><p>This food market supplies more than 70 percent of the fresh produce to the Chinese capital, and there's a constant motion, until it was shut on Saturday, of people delivering produce, leaving, and motion through this crowded place.</p><p>So, it's going to be very hard to figure out who could have brought this virus back into this market -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just one of the questions, to your point, I think, the other -- this is a relatively aggressive response. Is that what it takes in order to lock this down? Or, again, are we getting all the information on what they're tackling here in terms of numbers? It will remain a question.</p><p>Ivan, great to have you with us. Ivan Watson, thank you for that update there.</p><p>North Korea has blown up an office building that was used for joint liaison talks with South Korea. North Korean state media said it's retaliation after northern defectors used balloons to drop propaganda leaflets across the border into the north. It prompted this warning from the South Korean government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIM YOU-GEUN, SOUTH KOREAN DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER (through translator): It is an action that broke the expectations of all people who hoped for the development of inter-Korean relations and lasting peace on the peninsula.</p><p>We sternly warn that we will respond strongly if North Korea continues to take measures to aggravate the situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Will Ripley is live in Hong Kong for us. Will, the South Koreans are saying it's a betrayal, too, of all those that were hoping for peace on the peninsula. Why now? And what next?</p><p>[09:10:02]</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think that the reason why now is certainly complicated. North Korea says it was these propaganda leaflets that were infuriating, and they are, certainly. Whenever North Korean defectors drop leaflets down on North Korean border towns that defame, in their view, the Kim regime, that's truly upsetting to the North Koreans.</p><p>But this goes deeper than that, Julia. This is frustration over the lack of progress of more than two years of diplomacy, and this inter-Korean liaison office is a physical symbol of that diplomacy.</p><p>So, how else could North Korea send a very strong message that, in their mind, diplomacy is dead than to blow up the building? It's a way to get a lot of attention, and yet to not take things so far that they're actually creating a military situation, because remember, this building, although it was shared by the North and South, it sits in the North, paid for by the South, but it sits in the North.</p><p>So, they blew up a building on their own territory. They didn't fire shells over the border at the sites where those leaflets were sent from. And they haven't, as of now, brought troops with weapons back to areas where, you know, the troops had been patrolling over the last two years without weapons as the symbol of this kind of new era of peace.</p><p>But this certainly does, basically, bring us back to where we were before. You know, the two Koreas signed that agreement back in the spring of 2018 that led to the agreement with the United States that President Trump signed with Kim Jong-un, all of that now feels like a distant memory and we're now back in this repeating cycle of history with North Korea at the moment trying to ratchet up tensions to get what they want, which is sanctions relief and attention at a time that the world's eyes were largely turned away because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, so what response is trying to be provoked here as well, Will? Just to be clear, because we were just showing pretty dramatic pictures of this building exploding. It was empty due to the pandemic, there was no one in the building, we believe?</p><p>RIPLEY: It's been empty since late January, Julia, because of, you know, social distancing measures and the fact that North Korea quickly shut down its borders at the onset of this pandemic.</p><p>So, there was never any danger to anybody inside the building. In fact, where it sits, the Kaesong Industrial Complex, that has been largely empty for a number of years now.</p><p>It used to be a place where North Korean workers would work for South Korean companies. There actually are a lot of other empty buildings in that particular area.</p><p>If the two Koreas did decide to revive their relationship yet again. I'm sure they could find another office. But yes, this is a very significant setback to any sort of diplomatic process between the North and South.</p><p>It seems that right now what the North is doing is trying to ramp up military tensions to get what it wants. Interestingly, it's Kim Jong-un's younger sister, Kim Yo-jong who has been the public face of a lot of this.</p><p>It's almost as if she is being positioned to play the bad cop, maybe so that Kim Jong-un, who still holds on to some sort of friendship with President Trump, maybe he can play the good cop and they try to salvage all of this.</p><p>Because clearly, yes, the North is aiming its messaging at the South, but this is an attempt to get the United States's attention without doing something far more provocative like a missile launch.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, also potentially stamping her mark as a potential leader one day, too. Interesting. Will Ripley, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Now, on to another story making headlines around the world. With protests continuing across the United States to demand police reform, including this one in Atlanta on Monday, President Trump is expected to sign an Executive Order later.</p><p>It's designed to encourage higher standards in police departments, though the President is expected to leave more detailed reforms to Congress.</p><p>John Harwood is in Washington and joins us now. John, always great to have you on the show. I think the President also expected to walk a fine line here between responding to the uproar over brutality, but without demonizing the police force. Is that what we get today?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Exactly. It's action, but it's modest action. It's not mandates, but it's more encouragement to local departments using the carrot of Federal funds to improve their practices in a couple of ways.</p><p>One is certification requirements that would be linked to the discouragement of chokeholds, which are controversial, but it doesn't outright ban chokeholds as some of the legislation on Capitol Hill does.</p><p>It would encourage police departments to share information about use of force complaints against officers, so if somebody left a job in one department, tried to get hired at another, the new department would have access to information about that officer's record. That doesn't exist under current practices.</p><p>And third, to try to provide police officers some assistance with particular kinds of calls that they may not have the expertise to deal with, things involving mental health issues.</p><p>So, you might have mental health experts accompany officers on those calls. This is something that the President will sign today. It will be something that he could say, I responded to the protests, but the real heavy action, if it's going to take place, is likely to occur on Capitol Hill.</p><p>[09:15:16]</p><p>HARWOOD: Negotiations will accelerate this week once Senate Republicans lay out their proposal. House Democrats have a more aggressive proposal. Not certain that they can reach a deal this year, and Democrats might want to wait until next year where they think they're going to have a Democratic Senate and a Democratic President to take more ambitious action.</p><p>But we're going to have to wait and see on that, not just whether action occurs, but when it occurs, whether the Senate is going to act before the Fourth of July.</p><p>Julia, I need to add one other thing in the news department. That is, Vice President Pence has just indicated a few minutes ago in an interview on Fox that the White House is considering shifting its rally, the first big rally of the President's re-election campaign, outdoors in Tulsa.</p><p>This is something that public health authorities think would be safer than an indoor rally where masks are not required. It's not a done deal, but the Vice President having talked to the Oklahoma Governor last night, having heard appeals from the public health authorities in Tulsa, is considering a shift in venue for that rally.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, in a state where cases are rising. John Harwood, thank you for bringing us that news and we'll continue to track that outcome. Thank you.</p><p>Still to come, Singapore gets ready to lift a host of restrictions on movement and commerce this week. We'll be speaking to the Foreign Minister next.</p><p>And General Mills joins the call for police reform, the CEO on what that might look like. Stay with FIRST MOVE</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a look at what we're seeing for stock markets this moment, and it is a positive open expected.</p><p>We've had that stronger than expected retail sales number as well from the United States rising almost 18 percent last month, a huge turnaround from March and April and almost double what consensus was expecting.</p><p>It's the largest monthly gain in U.S. retail sales ever. Remember, we made that point earlier, though. You're bouncing from incredibly low levels and it's also about the what-next.</p><p>[09:20:13]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Also, I think, helping sentiment here, too, Fed's corporate bond buying, the hopes for a long-delayed Infrastructure Spending Bill as well potentially coming from the United States. Bloomberg reporting that, also adding to sentiment.</p><p>The message here is that Congress plans to do more, it seems. The question on timing is when.</p><p>All right, let's move on. Singapore is entering the second phase of reopening its economy, which means from Friday, people could go to the shops and eat at restaurants.</p><p>But the government has dropped its plan to use a contact tracing system developed by Apple and by Google, saying it's not suited to local conditions.</p><p>Last month, Singapore warned GDP could shrink as much as seven percent this year. That was the third time the nation downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast, so plenty to discuss.</p><p>Joining us now, Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, he is Singapore's Foreign Minister and also head of the country's Smart Nation Initiative.</p><p>Minister, fantastic to have you on FIRST MOVE. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>The hope and the expectation here is that you will be pretty much fully reopened by the end of this month, admittedly with conditions attached to that. Is that still the plan?</p><p>DR. VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN, SINGAPOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Well, we are well on the road and it's going to be a long and careful road to recovery.</p><p>The number of infections are down. We've ramped up our medical capacity, contact tracing, and testing have all been reached -- have reached new heights, so we're confident, we're ready, but we need to be vigilant.</p><p>If you look at what's happening in other parts of the world, you know that you cannot take this for granted. But we are definitely on the right track.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Part of that vigilance, Minister, is about tracking, it's about tracing. I mentioned there the decision not to use the system that Apple and Google have put together, but your own version with a token and an app- based system.</p><p>Explain why your system is superior.</p><p>BALAKRISHNAN: No, I will not make a claim of superiority. I think the key point is that if you are going to open up and you know that the virus is endemic, the only way you can open up safely is to have sufficient testing capacity and the ability to trace efficiently, quickly, and at scale.</p><p>Without that, opening up is just going to lead to another second and third wave, so that's the first point.</p><p>The second point is that every society has to find the right balance between protecting public health on one hand and to balance that with respect for personal privacy on the other hand.</p><p>And I think every society, depending on its own circumstances, will have a slightly difference balance point. In our case, we have a system which still depends on human beings making human judgment and decisions, and technology is only a supplement.</p><p>So for instance, if you are positive or you're a close contact of a positive person, we want a human being to inform you of the options and of the implications.</p><p>So in our case, our system provides a little additional information to the human contact base, in particular, it will provide information on how, when, and where and from whom you got the infection from or whom you may have passed the infection to.</p><p>It's that ability to trace the chain of transmission, and in fact, if you think about it, in the case of COVID-19, we know there's a significant pool of asymptomatic patients and potential carriers, and in that case, again, the ability to track transmission chains in detail is the only way you're going to find asymptomatic carriers in your population.</p><p>So, for that reason, we've embarked on a voluntary exercise using technology to supplement human contact tracing, and I'm glad to say right now, today, we have about 1.9 million people who have downloaded the app on a voluntary basis.</p><p>The purpose of having a token is for digital inclusion, because even in this day and age, there are still people who don't have a smartphone or who may not have the latest smartphone. And yet, we need to offer them the protection that contact tracing offers.</p><p>So, that's really what we're doing, just rolling it out, making it available. Nobody is excluded. But it's voluntary, and this gives you the added level of protection and confidence to open and in particular to get your economy going again.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All critical features. What we saw in Singapore was the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia and it threw a spotlight, I think, on the migrant population.</p><p>Will these tokens or apps be mandatory rather than voluntary for this subset of the population?</p><p>[09:25:08]</p><p>BALAKRISHNAN: Well, first of all, the impact of this pandemic in the migrant worker population was aggravated by the fact that they live in close proximity. In fact, it goes beyond living in close proximity.</p><p>Because, whether you live in a dormitory or in a six-star luxury cruise line or an aircraft carrier, the fact is if people interact, work, eat, cook, socialize, and go for picnics together, you know that it's going to set up a situation where you are at risk. So that's what happened in our case.</p><p>Now, these migrant workers are essential for us, and in fact, they would be going back to work right now as well, and we need to make sure they also have access to this protection.</p><p>Many of them do not have smartphones which will work with these new technologies, so we will have to make some of these additional tokens available to them as well.</p><p>And we do need to protect them because if you think about it, if you have an outbreak in one work site, if you don't have more detailed proximity data, the risk is you'll have to shut down the whole site again, and it causes enormous impact on the livelihoods --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So that sounds like you are saying it will be mandatory. Tokens will be mandatory for these workers, as you point out, they are essential.</p><p>BALAKRISHNAN: Some form of contact tracing, either an app on a phone if they have it or if they don't have a phone, then we'll offer them a token.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'm just trying to get a sense of what the future is going to look like. This is great, but I want to move on if you don't mind and talk to you about economic recovery at this stage, because this is also vital to how Singapore looks over the coming years.</p><p>The Prime Minister said that jobs are the priority. The sense here, though, is that jobs for Singaporeans are the priority at the expense of what is a large proportion, not only of migrants, but expat workers as well.</p><p>Is that the reality now, that Singaporeans will be prioritized?</p><p>BALAKRISHNAN: Well, let's take a step back. COVID-19 has not altered the course of history, but it has accelerated trends which are already in play beforehand.</p><p>What do I mean by that? For instance, the trade war between United States and China didn't begin or end with COVID-19. The pushback against globalization, against free trade, is something which, in fact, has been going on for years.</p><p>The digital revolution and its impact on jobs also began years ago. But what COVID-19 has done is that it has accelerated all these trends. We are now at a confluent point where suddenly you have not only a crisis, but you have an opportunity.</p><p>Now, my take on it is that all of us, all countries everywhere, have to focus on jobs, jobs, jobs. But it's not just a matter of protecting yesterday's job, because we all know that there are new jobs emerging. There are old jobs which are disappearing. Creative destruction is going to occur at a massive scale.</p><p>And it's not a matter of who is in or who is out, but who has the skills, who has the networks, and which countries have positioned themselves well in terms of policy, in terms of infrastructure, in terms of finance to capture and harvest these new opportunities.</p><p>So, what we are doing, to use the 3Rs as an example, we are trying to reboot the economy, reskill our population, and restructure the economy.</p><p>Now, in this new configuration, obviously, our priority has to be citizens, because citizenship has privilege. Having said that, there will be a role for expatriates and foreigners because no one country has a monopoly on skills, on the entrepreneurship, on the fervor and the risk that comes with this new economy.</p><p>So, I wouldn't --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Less of a role right now.</p><p>BALAKRISHNAN: I think some jobs are -- let's walk through a few examples. Construction will depend upon the pace of construction in a post-COVID world.</p><p>In the case of Singapore, we still need construction for activities to continue. We still need construction workers. But if, in other sectors, where you're going to get a cutback, obviously, our employers, like employers everywhere in the world, will favor our own locals and I don't think that's an unreasonable position to take.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: No. I think many nations would understand that, to be honest, Minister, particularly at this point in time.</p><p>I'm running out of time with you so I want to ask specifically about what we saw overnight between North Korea and South Korea. What's the Singaporean government's response to that?</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>BALAKRISHNAN: Well, we're not directly involved in that. I think it's a rather, how shall I put it -- dramatic gesture. It's a call for attention.</p><p>It's a symptom that underline all this significant communication that's going on and this is just one of many trouble spots all over the world.</p><p>So in summary, I think we're facing a period of creative destruction. We're facing a disrupted world. We're facing a world where risk against peace has gone up. We're facing a world where there's a pushback against trade and globalization.</p><p>But the answer is not for us to fragment. It's not for us to stop talking. The answer is for us to look forward, to work together, to believe in the rules-based international order, to negotiate agreements, to seek peace, and to look for prosperity, because there is money to be made. There is a future to be harvested. And we need to get our eyes focused forward and to work together, and I --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Minister, I have to cut you off because I'm going to lose you because we have to take a break. It was fantastic to speak to you. Please come back on and talk to us again. And I apologize. We had a few I.T. issues before the interview began. Fantastic to chat to you. Thank you.</p><p>The market open is next.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and the market open where the bulls are off to the races this Tuesday after the release of what we'd call a blockbuster report on U.S. retail sales, admittedly from a low base. You can see stocks are rallying across the board in early trade.</p><p>Futures were higher, in fact, though all morning on news that the Fed is expanding its corporate bond-buying program to include individual company debt as well as hopes for fresh U.S. infrastructure spending.</p><p>The sentiment was also given that further boost by the U.S. retail sales numbers spiking 18 percent last month, the highest jump on record.</p><p>[09:35:08]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're chalking it up to pent-up demand after huge sales drops in March and April.</p><p>In terms of stocks, airlines, banks, retail -- shares that have seen big price swings in recent weeks on economic uncertainty are some of the biggest gainers today.</p><p>Take a look at some of the airlines as well. They are advancing on word that major carriers will be allowed to resume limited flights to China.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jay Powell's testimony before Congress today will be key too and that begins at the top of the next hour. No shortage of things to discuss.</p><p>Great news is, we're joined by Brian Belski, Managing Director and Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital Markets. Brian, great to have you on the show. What do you make of the retail sales number?</p><p>BRIAN BELSKI, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Well, pretty darn good. I mean, we were basically at zero and, you know, one of the things that we cautioned people in February and March, Julia, is not to be too negative, and we saw some very, I like to say it, bombastically negative forecasts from people just claiming that we weren't going to spend any money.</p><p>I mean, what we know -- we know a couple of things. We know for sure that the U.S. loves to spend money and the consumer is strong and we also know that the consumer, through COVID, did not stop spending. They just spent a little bit differently.</p><p>And so I think that some of these forecasts were way too negative and way set up to under-promise and over deliver. Forecasts in general with respect to economic data is really beginning to turn into this, what we like to call second derivative math, meaning less negatives.</p><p>Clearly not positive overall for the longer term, but we're starting to see that major turn with respect to the economy that, of course, we have been calling for since the beginning of this, and we just think people were way too negative in February and March, really set up the broader, stronger rebound in stocks.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The counter to that, I guess, would be that we knew a lot of stimulus cash, whether that's from Jay Powell at the Federal Reserve or the money from Congress was sloshing around in the system. Stimulus checks bumped up. Unemployment benefits. That all ends in August.</p><p>Do we need to see more money coming from Congress in order to fuel a further rally here? What's in the price?</p><p>BELSKI: Great question. You know, we think that 20 times earnings of markets are decently valued here. We still think that there's upside. We have a 3,400 target on the S&amp;P by the end of March of next year.</p><p>We still see that as being very, very likely. I think the key thing for the second half of the year, Julia, is that earnings are actually going to be able to know what earnings are.</p><p>First and second quarter earnings were obviously excessively negative and how these companies are going to operate. With respect to unemployment, we have nowhere to go but up.</p><p>Clearly, we had a surprisingly positive employment report. People seemed to have forgotten about that already and I think the trend is going to be recovering from there.</p><p>There are jobs and retraining of jobs and remember, too, you mentioned in your hit prior to this that there's an Infrastructure Bill potentially on the docket, which is something that we've talked about in the United States for several years, if not since 2016 especially.</p><p>So with this potential theme of on shoring, repatriation of companies coming back to the United States, there's going to be jobs available and I don't think people are thinking about that right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it is interesting. And I know you're a much longer- term player and you said, look, we're in a 20-year bull market. You said that back in 2010, so the sort of short-term and the medium and the long- term has to be considered here, but when we look at the second half of this year, we've got election risk. We have got second wave risk, which the markets seem to care about for 24 hours at the back end of last weekend into this week. How do you view those risks?</p><p>BELSKI: It's a great question. And you know what's really interesting with the headlines with respect to second wave and the election, tend to really increase in terms of their volume when the market is down. It's just such an interesting thing.</p><p>Especially last week, I was just inundated with questions from clients around the world talking about the second wave. First of all, we don't know what the second wave is going to be and the government here in the United States has basically said we're not going to shut down again with respect to the economy and that was really the big threat in terms of how we've gotten into this in the first place, in terms of shutting the economy down and people not being able to spend.</p><p>But in terms of the election, you know, our take is this. It's way too early. I think fortunes in terms of what's going to happen in the election are going to be very volatile heading into the fall. We have the conventions coming up.</p><p>And like you said, we have the potential for a second wave. We have held that the shape of this economic recovery clearly is going to have an impact with respect to the election. We're not going to know anything until the fall.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But it does perhaps put the emphasis on Republicans and clearly on the White House to want to spend more, which is stimulative either way.</p><p>BELSKI: I think so, but also, too, you have got to remember that the growth we've seen in the economy was due to less regulation, in tax cuts in the first place and then we started saber rattling with the tariffs with China and that kind of steam rolled that. and now, we're kind of back into how we are going to get business going and growth going overall.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, message to investors? What do you buy?</p><p>BELSKI: Message to investors. What do you buy?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>[09:40:06]</p><p>BELSKI: You buy those -- don't be a growth or a value investor, be both. You want to buy those companies that were leading prior to COVID, during COVID and after COVID. That includes some of the big tech companies. It includes the Amazons and Costcos of the world, but it also includes, don't be too negative with respect to the big banks, especially the Bank of Americas, JPMorgans, and some of the Canadian banks that do very strong business in the United States because we need money and these stocks have gone through massive secular change in the last ten years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. This is such an important point because the divergence between an Amazon versus a JPMorgan here tells a tale of two halves for Wall Street versus Main Street and you're saying actually that gap, arguably, should be narrower.</p><p>BELSKI: Right and you don't want to own either/or. I think you want to own both and you want to be selective on when you own it, but from a longer term perspective, have these stocks as part of your portfolio.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Makes perfect sense. Brian, always great to chat. Brian Belski, Managing Director and Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>All right. We're going to take a break here on FIRST MOVE, but coming up, 100 brands in 100 countries. That's a corporate voice that's hard to ignore.</p><p>The CEO of General Mills tells us what needs to be done to heal America's racial divisions.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Later today in Washington, we'll see President Trump sign an Executive Order addressing police conduct.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Minnesota, where George Floyd died, business leaders want lawmakers to consider their demands to improve accountability, transparency, and police conduct.</p><p>At its heart is a simple message, to make the sanctity of human life a core value for the police force.</p><p>Jeff Harmening, the CEO of General Mills, he is a member of the Minnesota Business Partnership and he joins us now from Minneapolis.</p><p>Jeff, fantastic to have you on the show. The tragedy of George Floyd, personal for Minnesota, but I think it's become personal for the entire world as we've seen protests gather.</p><p>As the CEO of a big business, have you ever felt such pressure to respond to a societal issue like this?</p><p>[09:45:13]</p><p>JEFF HARMENING, CEO, GENERAL MILLS: Well, Julia, first, thank you for having me on the show, and you know, I wouldn't call it pressure to respond. I would say, I feel a need to respond.</p><p>Now, as do all other business leaders in Minnesota and I think what we see with the death of George Floyd is that it is bigger than just Minnesota, as you've noted.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's one in a long list of tragedies and racial injustice at the hands of police, and that's why you see the outpouring of grief and demonstrations across not only U.S. cities, but across the world, and now is the time for us to act.</p><p>But importantly, we can't act alone, either as business leaders or politicians or community leaders, because when you have something systemic injustice like we have here and racism, it is a complex problem which requires all those groups to come together.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Leadership comes in all shapes and sizes, in all forms, too. I mentioned the President today. What do you want to hear from the President?</p><p>HARMENING: Well, we just need to make sure that we continue to unite. I mean, it's what I talk about in our company all the time, is that we want a company of inclusion and belonging and we need the same thing across the United States as well.</p><p>We need to make sure that we're all working together because as I said, the social injustice is deep rooted and it is complex and it can't be solved by one person or one group alone. It has to be all of us working together.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, businesses can play their part, clearly, though, when they look at what their diversity mix is within their company when it comes down to some of the lowest paid workers in the company.</p><p>How do you think General Mills is doing?</p><p>HARMENING: Well, for a long time, General Mills has really fostered a culture of belonging and inclusion. If you look at our Board of Directors, it's very diverse.</p><p>We have five of our 11 directors are women. We have people of color on our Board of Directors, the same with our leadership team, and we have -- we have had a Black Champions Network internally at General Mills for more than two decades.</p><p>And interestingly, about three or four years ago, we started hosting what we call Courageous Conversations at General Mills where we took on tough issues, whether it's the LGBTQ-Plus community or whether it's racism, and we had one recently after the death of George Floyd and it's interesting.</p><p>We had more than 3,000 employees participate voluntarily on company time all across the world, and participate in and a big group discussion and small group discussions. So it's very clear to me that General Mills has been leading in this for a long time and one of the things we're doing now is taking what we have learned internally over more than two decades and helping apply that to the broader Twin Cities community and making sure that we're helping convene different companies and making sure that we lend our voice to legislation as you mentioned earlier.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting. We spoke to a nonprofit last week, the CEO Year Up that tries to foster retraining and provide people with year-long training programs, and he said to us, if companies and CEOs like yourself would talk to their HR Department and work out where you could drop the four-year degree requirement, you would automatically, in many cases, bring back 86 percent of Latinos that are excluded, 79 percent of African-Americans.</p><p>Does this sound like something really proactive that you could apply at General Mills that perhaps would open up the pool of potential talent?</p><p>HARMENING: Well, I'm not sure about that specifically, but what I can tell you is that we have been opening up the pool of talent at General Mills for a long time and whether it's in our offices or in our manufacturing locations or our sales organization, we have been hiring people of color, whether it's Latinx or black, and we have been hiring women at a very high rate and not only for entry level jobs, but also into our executive ranks. I'm really proud of what we have done.</p><p>And so whether that particular proposal would work or not, I'll leave it to the policymakers to decide. But I am very proud for what we have done at General Mills.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Your Board certainly is a credit to you.</p><p>I want to move on and talk what we are seeing as far as the U.S. economy is concerned. We've clearly had strong retail sales data today. The jobs market seems to be picking up perhaps, quicker, but there's huge challenges ahead. What's your assessment of the outlook?</p><p>HARMENING: Well, the jobs market has been tough. It is picking up due to quite a bit of proactivity on the part of the Fed and some economic stimulus, Federal stimulus, and -- but I think we're in for a long road of recovery when it comes to the economy. We certainly see that in our business.</p><p>We saw that in our China business, particularly as it relates to how people eat, and so even though the economy is certainly getting better, I think it's still going to be a long road to get back to full recovery.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just talk to me about what you're seeing now in China. We're clearly watching this very closely in terms of what recovery looks like, the speed and of course, the ongoing challenge of trying to tackle outbreaks there of COVID-19. What are you seeing in your business there?</p><p>[09:50:03]</p><p>HARMENING: Well, in our business in China, we have two separate businesses. One is a food away from home business, which is Haagen Daaz Ice Cream and the other is an at home business, Wanchai Ferry Frozen Dumplings, and we've seen two very different businesses.</p><p>In our Haagen Daaz business, what we have seen is that it has taken many months to recover. In fact, at one point in February, all of our Haagen Daaz shops were closed and now they're all open, but they're still only operating at about 70 percent of what they were before COVID.</p><p>On the other hand, our Wanchai Ferry Dumplings business, we can barely fulfill all the demand for Wanchai Ferry Dumplings, which are primarily at home, and we see this all over the world is that some people think that a recovery happens and we say we can go back to restaurants and everybody floods back, but that hasn't been our experience.</p><p>People come back slowly to restaurants and continue eating food at home, which we see happening in Europe and which we think will play out the same in the United States.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such an important point. Reopening doesn't necessarily mean full re-engagement at this stage.</p><p>Jeff, fantastic to have you with us. Thank you so much for sharing your views on diversity as well and what you guys are doing at General Mills. It's great to see.</p><p>HARMENING: Thank you for having me this morning.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. Jeff Harmening, the CEO of General Mills.</p><p>All right, up next, the CEO of Japanese drinks giant, Suntory on what the post-COVID world looks like for his business.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: As we've discussed throughout the show, consumers around the world are key to economic recovery. One of Japan's biggest drinks companies says more than 20 percent of the nation's restaurants will not survive because consumers won't want to go out. Kaori Enjoji reports from Tokyo.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAORI ENJOJI, JOURNALIST: From Michelin star to street food like this, Japan's food scene is known the world over, but people are still afraid to go out, despite being told that it's safe.</p><p>I asked the CEO of Suntory Holdings, one of the country's largest beverage makers, how many of these are going to survive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAKESHI NIINAMI, CEO, SUNTORY HOLDINGS: I don't think that will come back to 100 percent. Eight percent even -- 80 percent is optimistic. Because the people feel so anxious about the future. And they can't move around and reactivate their businesses.</p><p>So definitely, the government has to increase the number of testing, both PCR and antigen. So, that is must for us to reactivate our economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ENJOJI: It's a sobering reality that has forced Suntory to rethink its supply chain and reconsider ways to bring production back home.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIINAMI: Supply chain is very much famous for just in time. But we have to now change our policy toward just in case. That means we have the over reliance on certain countries, so we are shifting to some other countries to produce and plus, we are bringing production facilities or supply chain or ingredients to be produced in Japan.</p><p>Produce in Japan may be a good option now instead of just talking about only going abroad to produce our products.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:55:27]</p><p>ENJOJI: Niinami says he is faced with falling gross margins as people stay in and economize, and while other CEOs maybe talking about a post- coronavirus world, he says that's still three if not four years away.</p><p>In Tokyo, I am Kaori Enjoji.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow, and the emphasis on staying home, exactly what the General Mills CEO was saying, too.</p><p>All right, a quick look at the markets. We are stronger this morning, boosted by those retail sales and optimism over further support.</p><p>All right. That just about wraps up the show. I'm Julia Chatterley. Stay safe as always, and I'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020061601cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6053-YPP1-JB20-G1T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7616\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 16, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC00075WG</classCode><className>SA DAY MANUFACTURING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000DAH9</classCode><className>BANK OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC2899 CHEMICALS &amp;

The focus on 'fixing' bias has swayed the regulatory conversation in favour of technical fixes to AI, rather than looking at how its deployment changes governance of public sector functions and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/16/digital-welfare-state-big-tech-allowed-to-target-and-surveil-the-poor-un-warns\">essential services</url>, leads to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/business/london-police-facial-recognition.html\">mass surveillance</url>, and exacerbates racialised       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/5/21120404/police-departments-artificial-intelligence-public-records\">over-policing</url>.</p><p>Focusing on 'bias' locates AI's problems with flawed individuals who embed their prejudices into the systems they build. Whilst bias is <url normalizedValue=\"http://gendershades.org/\">real</url>, this framing lends itself to the dangerous argument that deep, structural inequalities can simply be 'fixed'. This is a red herring and skips a necessary first step: a democratic conversation about the uses of AI we find acceptable and the ones we don't. If we don't debate this, we allow a profit-motivated industry to decide the answer.</p><p>Instead, we need to proactively define limits for the use of AI. Truly protecting people and prioritising human rights requires a focus on what is termed by the Algorithmic Justice League as \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajlunited.org/learn-more\">impermissible use</url>.\" They argue that \"justice requires that we prevent AI from being used by those with power to increase their absolute level of control, particularly where it would automate long-standing patterns of injustice.\" European policymakers need to help set those boundaries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where do we draw the (red) line?</emphasis></p><p>AI is being designed, deployed and promoted for myriad functions touching almost all areas of our lives.

We cannot shy away from discussing the need for legal limits for AI and bans on impermissible uses which clearly violate human rights.</p><p>Yet this is only a first step-the beginning of a conversation.

Because there is a new study that says they may be good for our hearts. Research published in the journal Heart found that adults who took one or two daytime naps a week had a forty-eight percent lower risk of cardiovascular problems than non-nappers. The length of the nap, though, did not influence the findings.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Fix-- fixed.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Everybody here is.</p><p>GAYLE KING: A lot of companies though actually have nap rooms which I think is a good idea.

Indeed.</p><p>GAYLE KING: It`s good to know.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Okay.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: All right. The mayor-- the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, is taking the concept of bringing your child to work to a whole new level. Jorge Elorza has taken his one-year-old son Omar to news conferences and meetings. He`s also held the toddler in his lap while testifying at the State House. Elorza says he made the decision with his wife partly because the cost of day care is too high for their budget, something most Americans can get behind. The move is prompting a debate though about double standards. Providence City council president and mother Sabina Matos said, quote, \".if a female elected official was doing the same thing, the amount of pushback that we would be getting would be huge.\"</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: I think she is right about that.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Really?</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: I-- I think she makes a point.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: All right. Elorza told our Providence affiliate--</p><p>GAYLE KING: She is right.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: --WPRI that he agrees. He agrees with that and he hopes to be an ally in combating that double standard.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: What do you-- I mean, you guys are parents.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, I mean the-- the bar for dads is very low.

Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said. </p><p>The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance. </p><p>USDA estimates that 1.7 million households, or 3.1 million people, \"will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule.\" That would result in a net savings of $9.4 billion over five years. </p><p>An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the effect,  saying it \"may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.\" </p><p>Trump sues House panel, NY</p><p> to protect his state tax returns </p><p>NEW YORK - President Donald Trump on Tuesday sued the House Ways and Means committee and New York  officials to prevent his state tax returns from being turned over to the congressional committee. </p><p>The suit seeks an injunction to block the application of a new New York state law that could allow the panel to obtain the returns. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, comes amid a  White House attempt to prevent Trump's tax returns to wind up in Democratic hands. \"We have filed a lawsuit today in our ongoing efforts to end presidential harassment,\" said Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lawyers</p><p> The state's attorney general, Letitia James, said the act \"will shine a light on the president's finances and finally offer transparency to millions of Americans yearning to know the truth.\" </p><p>Agreement affirms N. Carolina transgender restroom rights </p><p>RALEIGH, N.C. - A federal judge approved a legal settlement Tuesday affirming transgender people's right to use restrooms matching their gender identity in many North Carolina public buildings. </p><p>The consent decree between the state's Democratic governor and transgender plaintiffs covers numerous state-owned buildings including facilities run by executive branch agencies that oversee the environment, transportation and Medicaid, among others. In return, the plaintiffs have agreed to drop pending legal action against the governor and other defendants. </p><p>The agreement was signed by Judge Thomas Schroeder after a three-year legal battle challenging North Carolina's so-called bathroom bill and the law that replaced it. </p><p>Charges tossed again in 2015 Amtrak crash in Philadelphia</p><p>PHILADELPHIA - For the second time, a Philadelphia judge dismissed all charges Tuesday against an Amtrak engineer in a high-speed derailment in Philadelphia that killed eight and injured about 200 people. </p><p>The decision followed defense arguments that any mistakes made by Brandon Bostian do not amount to crimes. </p><p>\"The law recognizes we're all human,\" Common Pleas Judge Barbara McDermott said in tossing the involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment charges. </p><p>Two judges and the city's district attorney have now concluded that no criminal charges should be filed against Bostian in the 2015 derailment. </p><p>The state attorney general's office will appeal, said spokeswoman Jacklin Rhoades. </p><p>CEO: Schools reject $22K offer to pay lunch bills </p><p>The president of a Pennsylvania school board whose district had warned parents behind on lunch bills that their children could end up in foster care has rejected a CEO's offer to cover the cost, the businessman said Tuesday. </p><p>Todd Carmichael, chief executive and co-founder of Philadelphia-based La Colombe Coffee, said he offered to give Wyoming Valley West School District $22,000 to wipe out bills that generated the recent warning letter to parents. But school board President Joseph Mazur rejected the offer Monday, Carmichael spokesman Aren Platt said Tuesday. Mazur argued that money is owed by parents who can afford to pay, Platt said. </p><p>\"The position of Mr. Carmichael is, irrespective of affluence, irrespective of need, he just wants to wipe away this debt,\" Platt said. </p><p>Mazur did not return a phone message. </p><p>DOJ launches an antitrust investigation</p><p> of Big Tech </p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. </p><p>It comes as a  number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up the companies, which have come under scrutiny after a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy. </p><p>President Donald Trump also has criticized the big tech companies. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that Facebook and Google are biased against conservative politicians. </p><p>The Justice Department did not name specific companies. The focus of the investigation mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. </p><p>Aspirin study: Millions of people who take aspirin to prevent a heart attack may need to rethink the pill-popping, Harvard researchers reported Monday. </p><p>A daily low-dose aspirin is recommended for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke and for those diagnosed with heart disease. </p><p>But for the otherwise healthy, that advice has been overturned. Guidelines released this year ruled out routine aspirin use for many older adults who don't  have heart disease - and said it's only for certain younger people under doctor's orders. </p><p>\"Many patients are confused about this,\" said Dr. Colin O'Brien, a senior internal medicine resident at Beth Israel who led the study.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNSEN-FL0098404049</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNSEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-PWW1-DY37-F36S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.

Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said. </p><p>The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance. </p><p>USDA estimates that 1.7 million households, or 3.1 million people, \"will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule.\" That would result in a net savings of $9.4 billion over five years. </p><p>An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the effect,  saying it \"may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.\" </p><p>Trump sues House panel, NY</p><p> to protect his state tax returns </p><p>NEW YORK - President Donald Trump on Tuesday sued the House Ways and Means committee and New York  officials to prevent his state tax returns from being turned over to the congressional committee. </p><p>The suit seeks an injunction to block the application of a new New York state law that could allow the panel to obtain the returns. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, comes amid a  White House attempt to prevent Trump's tax returns to wind up in Democratic hands. \"We have filed a lawsuit today in our ongoing efforts to end presidential harassment,\" said Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lawyers</p><p> The state's attorney general, Letitia James, said the act \"will shine a light on the president's finances and finally offer transparency to millions of Americans yearning to know the truth.\" </p><p>Agreement affirms N. Carolina transgender restroom rights </p><p>RALEIGH, N.C. - A federal judge approved a legal settlement Tuesday affirming transgender people's right to use restrooms matching their gender identity in many North Carolina public buildings. </p><p>The consent decree between the state's Democratic governor and transgender plaintiffs covers numerous state-owned buildings including facilities run by executive branch agencies that oversee the environment, transportation and Medicaid, among others. In return, the plaintiffs have agreed to drop pending legal action against the governor and other defendants. </p><p>The agreement was signed by Judge Thomas Schroeder after a three-year legal battle challenging North Carolina's so-called bathroom bill and the law that replaced it. </p><p>Charges tossed again in 2015 Amtrak crash in Philadelphia</p><p>PHILADELPHIA - For the second time, a Philadelphia judge dismissed all charges Tuesday against an Amtrak engineer in a high-speed derailment in Philadelphia that killed eight and injured about 200 people. </p><p>The decision followed defense arguments that any mistakes made by Brandon Bostian do not amount to crimes. </p><p>\"The law recognizes we're all human,\" Common Pleas Judge Barbara McDermott said in tossing the involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment charges. </p><p>Two judges and the city's district attorney have now concluded that no criminal charges should be filed against Bostian in the 2015 derailment. </p><p>The state attorney general's office will appeal, said spokeswoman Jacklin Rhoades. </p><p>CEO: Schools reject $22K offer to pay lunch bills </p><p>The president of a Pennsylvania school board whose district had warned parents behind on lunch bills that their children could end up in foster care has rejected a CEO's offer to cover the cost, the businessman said Tuesday. </p><p>Todd Carmichael, chief executive and co-founder of Philadelphia-based La Colombe Coffee, said he offered to give Wyoming Valley West School District $22,000 to wipe out bills that generated the recent warning letter to parents. But school board President Joseph Mazur rejected the offer Monday, Carmichael spokesman Aren Platt said Tuesday. Mazur argued that money is owed by parents who can afford to pay, Platt said. </p><p>\"The position of Mr. Carmichael is, irrespective of affluence, irrespective of need, he just wants to wipe away this debt,\" Platt said. </p><p>Mazur did not return a phone message. </p><p>DOJ launches an antitrust investigation</p><p> of Big Tech </p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. </p><p>It comes as a  number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up the companies, which have come under scrutiny after a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy. </p><p>President Donald Trump also has criticized the big tech companies. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that Facebook and Google are biased against conservative politicians. </p><p>The Justice Department did not name specific companies. The focus of the investigation mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. </p><p>Aspirin study: Millions of people who take aspirin to prevent a heart attack may need to rethink the pill-popping, Harvard researchers reported Monday. </p><p>A daily low-dose aspirin is recommended for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke and for those diagnosed with heart disease. </p><p>But for the otherwise healthy, that advice has been overturned. Guidelines released this year ruled out routine aspirin use for many older adults who don't  have heart disease - and said it's only for certain younger people under doctor's orders. </p><p>\"Many patients are confused about this,\" said Dr. Colin O'Brien, a senior internal medicine resident at Beth Israel who led the study.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HTCOUN-HC0098404341</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HTCOUR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-PWW1-DY37-F3BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Hartford Courant Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hartford Courant</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001P9K</classCode><className>NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORP (AMTRAK)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FOOD STAMP PROGRAM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS482111 LINE-HAUL RAILROADS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4011 RAILROADS, LINE-HAUL OPERATING</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Public Health &amp;

Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said. </p><p>The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance. </p><p>USDA estimates that 1.7 million households, or 3.1 million people, \"will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule.\" That would result in a net savings of $9.4 billion over five years. </p><p>An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the effect,  saying it \"may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.\" </p><p>Trump sues House panel, NY</p><p> to protect his state tax returns </p><p>NEW YORK - President Donald Trump on Tuesday sued the House Ways and Means committee and New York  officials to prevent his state tax returns from being turned over to the congressional committee. </p><p>The suit seeks an injunction to block the application of a new New York state law that could allow the panel to obtain the returns. The lawsuit, filed in Washington, comes amid a  White House attempt to prevent Trump's tax returns to wind up in Democratic hands. \"We have filed a lawsuit today in our ongoing efforts to end presidential harassment,\" said Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lawyers</p><p> The state's attorney general, Letitia James, said the act \"will shine a light on the president's finances and finally offer transparency to millions of Americans yearning to know the truth.\" </p><p>Agreement affirms N. Carolina transgender restroom rights </p><p>RALEIGH, N.C. - A federal judge approved a legal settlement Tuesday affirming transgender people's right to use restrooms matching their gender identity in many North Carolina public buildings. </p><p>The consent decree between the state's Democratic governor and transgender plaintiffs covers numerous state-owned buildings including facilities run by executive branch agencies that oversee the environment, transportation and Medicaid, among others. In return, the plaintiffs have agreed to drop pending legal action against the governor and other defendants. </p><p>The agreement was signed by Judge Thomas Schroeder after a three-year legal battle challenging North Carolina's so-called bathroom bill and the law that replaced it. </p><p>Charges tossed again in 2015 Amtrak crash in Philadelphia</p><p>PHILADELPHIA - For the second time, a Philadelphia judge dismissed all charges Tuesday against an Amtrak engineer in a high-speed derailment in Philadelphia that killed eight and injured about 200 people. </p><p>The decision followed defense arguments that any mistakes made by Brandon Bostian do not amount to crimes. </p><p>\"The law recognizes we're all human,\" Common Pleas Judge Barbara McDermott said in tossing the involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment charges. </p><p>Two judges and the city's district attorney have now concluded that no criminal charges should be filed against Bostian in the 2015 derailment. </p><p>The state attorney general's office will appeal, said spokeswoman Jacklin Rhoades. </p><p>CEO: Schools reject $22K offer to pay lunch bills </p><p>The president of a Pennsylvania school board whose district had warned parents behind on lunch bills that their children could end up in foster care has rejected a CEO's offer to cover the cost, the businessman said Tuesday. </p><p>Todd Carmichael, chief executive and co-founder of Philadelphia-based La Colombe Coffee, said he offered to give Wyoming Valley West School District $22,000 to wipe out bills that generated the recent warning letter to parents. But school board President Joseph Mazur rejected the offer Monday, Carmichael spokesman Aren Platt said Tuesday. Mazur argued that money is owed by parents who can afford to pay, Platt said. </p><p>\"The position of Mr. Carmichael is, irrespective of affluence, irrespective of need, he just wants to wipe away this debt,\" Platt said. </p><p>Mazur did not return a phone message. </p><p>DOJ launches an antitrust investigation</p><p> of Big Tech </p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. </p><p>It comes as a  number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up the companies, which have come under scrutiny after a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy. </p><p>President Donald Trump also has criticized the big tech companies. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that Facebook and Google are biased against conservative politicians. </p><p>The Justice Department did not name specific companies. The focus of the investigation mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. </p><p>Aspirin study: Millions of people who take aspirin to prevent a heart attack may need to rethink the pill-popping, Harvard researchers reported Monday. </p><p>A daily low-dose aspirin is recommended for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke and for those diagnosed with heart disease. </p><p>But for the otherwise healthy, that advice has been overturned. Guidelines released this year ruled out routine aspirin use for many older adults who don't  have heart disease - and said it's only for certain younger people under doctor's orders. </p><p>\"Many patients are confused about this,\" said Dr. Colin O'Brien, a senior internal medicine resident at Beth Israel who led the study.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ORSENT-OS0098403660</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ORSENT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-PWW1-DY37-F3HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.

Other analysts point out that Section 230 has enabled the internet to thrive and that modifying it could be devastating for the internet and online speech.</p><p>\"The services that we enjoy the most exist because of Section 230,\" said Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University.</p><p>Goldman said Section 230 has become a \"proxy\" for the frustrations with Facebook and Google but that \"American consumers would be the losers\" if the law is weakened.</p><p>Corynne McSherry of the Electronic Frontier Foundation told a congressional hearing in October that Section 230 protects not only major tech platforms, but any online activity -- from forwarding an email to commenting in a news forum to sharing pictures and videos of friends -- from \"third party liability.\"</p><p>McSherry said that without Section 230, tech firms such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter would not exist in their current form because they would not be able to host user content without fear of a lawsuit.</p><p>She argued that eliminating Section 230 would \"cement the dominance\" of these firms, because it would mean higher costs to filter and moderate content that new startups could not afford.</p><p>According to Katherine Oyama, Google's head of intellectual property policy, the internet would be a far different experience without the liability shield.</p><p>\"Without Section 230, platforms could face liability for decisions around removal of content from their platforms,\" she told lawmakers.</p><p>\"Review sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor or Angie's List might be sued for defamation claims brought by a restaurant, hotel or an electrician trying to suppress their negative reviews.\"</p><p>Oyama said the current law encourages sites to filter content, but that without the legal protection they might stop all content moderation or simply block anything potentially harmful.</p><p>- 'Healthier' internet? -</p><p>Danielle Citron, a Boston University law professor specializing in online speech, said Section 230 has failed to live up to its promise and that modifying it could lead to a \"healthier\" internet.</p><p>\"Section 230's overbroad interpretation means that platforms have little legal incentive to combat online abuse,\" Citron told the hearing.</p><p>She said that while it has allowed some platforms to moderate content, \"they also have been shielded from responsibility even when they solicit illegal activities, deliberately leave up unambiguously illegal content that causes harm, and sell dangerous products.\"</p><p>Citron said the law should be revised \"to condition the legal shield on reasonable content moderation practices.\"</p><p>It remains to be seen if lawmakers will move on the law, with a solid bloc of digital rights and industry groups opposing a change.</p><p>Ed Black of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group representing many tech firms, said that inserting these provisions in a North American trade pact \"is critical to ensure that the agreement is updated to reflect the needs of the internet economy.\"</p><p>Goldman said the inclusion of the protection makes sense for both economics and free speech.</p><p>\"Section 230 is not just about free speech, it's about improving information flows in the marketplace,\" he said.</p><p>\"It creates new opportunities for entrepreneurs to build businesses and also creates opportunities for marketplaces to be more efficient.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-US debate on internet liabilty spills over to global trade deals </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP9-WKM1-JBV1-X0CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><timeReceived>1:48 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In the 1980s, they did the same to the telephone monopoly AT&amp;T. Now, Big Tech is in their sights. The Department of Justice antitrust investigation announced last week could be a turning point for companies that have gone from plucky start-ups to key drivers of digital innovation to alleged threats to privacy and competition in the digital world \u2014 and beyond. The DoJ\u2019s short statement said it would look at online platforms which have \u201creduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers\u201d, and \u201cproceed appropriately\u201d if they have broken the law.</p><p>The decision could yet be an important step towards structural reform. It came just after the Federal Trade Commission levied a record-breaking $5bn fine against Facebook for its reckless data protection practices, as well as establishing ways for the company to better protect user privacy. The FTC\u2019s decision failed, however, to assuage fears around the power wielded by the largest tech companies. If it wants to change this, the DoJ should adjust the bar for antitrust legislation. It should also engage with other bodies to maximise its impact.</p><p>Enshrining the new Brandeis school of antitrust thinking in law would provide a potent tool for competition. Since the 1980s, the standard for antitrust legislation has been whether customers are spending more than they should. This is no longer fit for purpose, given digital services increasingly cost long-term privacy rather than money.</p><p>Modern antitrust should centre on welfare and the threats posed by some of the largest online platforms to users\u2019 political, economic and personal lives. Facebook\u2019s purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram offered troves of data for targeting adverts while eliminating potential competition. Given these platforms are used for sharing news, it also increased Facebook\u2019s power over what people read and watch.</p><p>The DoJ would do well to draw lessons from the EU, which has been ahead of the curve: it is two years since the European Commission fined Google \u20ac2.42bn for abusing its dominance as a search engine. This April, a report commissioned by the EU called for lower bars on antitrust rules targeting \u201cdominant players\u201d, showing the nuance necessary to protect smaller companies. US president Donald Trump has lambasted European commissioner Margrethe Vestager for pursuing Silicon Valley groups, arguing it is a matter for US regulators. The DoJ should ignore his incendiary language. Alongside European counterparts, it can build a multilateral antitrust framework and combat the splintering of internet regulations.</p><p>Co-operation between the DoJ and FTC will also be vital. An agreement was reached at the start of the month for the DoJ to focus on Google and Apple, while the FTC would study Facebook and Amazon. Last week, Facebook confirmed it was under investigation by the FTC on antitrust grounds. At present, it is unclear how the two investigations will interact. Clarity is needed to reduce duplication of labour. Close communication will also reduce the risk of the separate investigations reaching different conclusions.</p><p>Defenders of Big Tech companies have argued the groups are being punished for their success. They are wrong to see antitrust legislation as retribution, however. It is about ensuring the next generation of competitors has a fighting chance and reducing the power held by a few companies over millions of users. Scale matters, but bigger is not inherently better.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-fca13e16ae3211e98030530adfa879c2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNV-C4C1-DXP9-93CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 28, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For example, just two firms take in the lion's share of online ad spending. \"<br/> Delrahim said factors that must be considered include \"network effects\" - when a business attains so much market share that barriers to entry for competitors are prohibitively high.<br/> And he said acquisitions of nascent competitors can be anti-competitive in the digital realm, including when they protect a monopoly or \"otherwise harm competition by reducing consumer choice, increasing prices, diminishing or slowing innovation or reducing quality.\"<br/> Delrahim said another factor that must be weighed in the digital economy is services that are, at least ostensibly, free. That would include Google's search and email, and Facebook and its subsidiaries Instagram and WhatsApp, which generate profits by gathering data from users' behaviour that is then provided to advertisers.<br/> Delrahim also said that, by protecting competition, his department \"can have an impact on privacy and data protection.\"<br/> He said, \"two companies can compete to expand privacy protections for products or services.\"<br/> Econ One Research managing director Hal Singer, in a Twitter post, called it fiction that platforms can compete on privacy, interpreting Delrahim as suggesting that no new regulations are needed to make such companies as Facebook and Google more responsive to user data privacy.<br/> Delrahim took stock in his speech of historic anti-trust actions against Standard Oil, AT&amp;T and Microsoft and said there's no need for new anti-trust laws; those on the books suffice for the new digital arena where the world's most valuable companies are in the tech sector.<br/> A spokesman for Delrahim confirmed Tuesday that he had received a letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren asking him to recuse himself from any investigations into Google or Apple because he previously lobbied on behalf of both tech giants.<br/> Delrahim lobbied on behalf of Google in 2007 when it faced anti-trust scrutiny over its acquisition of DoubleClick, a competitor in digital advertising, according to Warren's letter.<br/> The Massachusetts senator and presidential hopeful said he lobbied on behalf of Apple in 2006 and 2007 on patent-related issues.<br/> Warren says Amazon, Facebook and Google are monopolies and should be split up.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n11049389</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCR-MMV1-JBYT-H3J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 20, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The conference, which is in Detroit for the first time, will showcase the connected car technology that NHTSA will regulate in the future.</p><p>Local suppliers expected to demonstrate technologies include Southfield-based Denso International America Inc., Troy-based Valeo North America Inc., Troy-based Delphi Automotive plc, Van Buren Township-based Visteon Corp.and Northville-based IAV Automotive Engineering Inc.</p><p>The federal government plans to roll out requirements on some key safety features.</p><p>Just two of the possible features that rely on vehicle-to-vehicle technology - one that warns drivers if they don't have enough time to make a left turn and another that urges them to stop if another car is about to run a red light - could prevent 25,000 to 592,000 crashes and save 49 to 1,083 lives annually when the entire U.S. vehicle fleet has the technology, according to the report.</p><p>\"Safety is our top priority, and V2V technology represents the next great advance in saving lives,\" Transportation Secretary <person><nameText>Anthony Foxx </nameText></person>said in an announcement. \"This technology could move us from helping people survive crashes to helping them avoid crashes altogether.\"</p><p>The report also included a draft version of standards that Foxx has vowed to propose by the time President Barack Obama leaves office in 2017. They would be known as Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 150 and would set minimum requirements for the V2V transmitters and messages.</p><p>The current V2V system is set up in such a way that cars swap messages 10 times per second about their position in space, which direction they are headed and how quickly they are moving in that direction. If two cars are on a collision course, the driver can be presented a warning.</p><p>NHTSA said its rules would require new cars to have the underlying V2V equipment but would not mandate any specific safety features. The decision of which features to activate would be up to automakers, depending on their engineering capabilities and their level of comfort with the new technology.</p><p>Eight major automakers - Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Honda Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Co., Daimler AG, Nissan Motor Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG - have been developing V2V technology with the government through a group called the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership, or CAMP. Despite the cost of the technology, automakers have embraced it as a way to make driving safer.</p><p>\"NHTSA's kickoff of the rule-making process for V2V communications demonstrates the country is well on its way to deploying this lifesaving technology,\" said John Bozzella, CEO of the Washington, D.C., lobbying group Global Automakers.</p><p>Each of the CAMP group's members provided cars for a pilot project in Ann Arbor that ran from mid-2012 until late 2013. About 3,000 drivers drove V2V-enabled vehicles on ordinary city streets to test the capabilities and limits of the communications system.</p><p>Cisco Systems Inc. is another of the big tech firms offering V2V communications equipment and software to the industry.</p><p>NHTSA said that cars in the pilot project were able to transmit and receive messages from one another despite being made by different car companies. These cars were given credentials through a security management system so only legitimate messages could be received.</p><p>NHTSA still needs to figure out who will manage this security network and how it will be paid for. The agency said it plans to put out a solicitation asking if any private entities have an interest in running it.</p><p>From Automotive News</p><p>Crain's Detroit Business reporter Dustin Walsh contributed to this story.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DETBUS-3592349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DETBUS2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D13-5F51-JC0G-41CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146156</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Crain Communications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crain's Detroit Business <br/>Print Version</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23751\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 30</volume><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>August 25, 2014</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002QLB</classCode><className>VISTEON CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC0003W6F</classCode><className>DENSO INTERNATIONAL AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC00091SI</classCode><className>IAV AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000D2GO</classCode><className>DELPHI AUTOMOTIVE PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002FSY</classCode><className>VALEO SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS336390 OTHER MOTOR VEHICLE PARTS MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS336350 MOTOR VEHICLE TRANSMISSION &amp;

It is unprecedented for a Supreme Court nominee to be named by a  president who is an unindicted co-conspirator.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D), NEW JERSEY:  I sincerely believe that the public  deserves to know this nominee's record.  In this particular case, his  record on issues of race and the law.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an \"I am  Spartacus\" moment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST:  More on that in a moment.</p><p>Welcome to the JOURNAL: EDITORIAL REPORT.  I'm David Asman, in for Bob  Gigot.</p><p>That was just a taste of this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee,  Brett Kavanaugh, who faced, at times, hysterical grilling from Democrats,  from anything from abortion rights to presidential powers.  The hearings  also looking a lot like the kickoff of the 2020 Democratic presidential  campaign.  But the party's base is apparently not pleased with how the  Kavanaugh resistance is going.  More than a dozen progressive groups  releasing a letter on Wednesday accusing Senate Minority Leader Chuck  Schumer of, quote, \"failing\" in his efforts to stop the confirmation of  President Trump's second Supreme Court pick.  </p><p>Let's bring in the panel.  We have \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and  deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnists Kim Strassel and Bill McGurn, and  assistance editorial page editor, James Freeman.  </p><p>Good to have you all here.</p><p>Dan, let me start with the Spartacus moment, as he, himself, described it.   Senator Cory Booker, turned out, his willingness to fall on the sword, as  he was putting it, was all an act, that he had permission to release the  papers that he claimed he was going to release in a very self-sacrificing  mode.  He had permission to release those the night before.  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIT &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  Yes, we all remember Kirk Douglas  in \"Spartacus.\"  Cory Booker was about as far as you can get from the  bravery of that movie.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>He's running for president.  But you know, it was one thing after another.   It was Cory Booker or Kamala Harris, who is probably also running for  president.  David, people complain all of the time about the degree of  polarization and partisanship in our politics, and they ask, where is it  coming from.  We had a two-day display by the Democrats on the committee on  what the basis of this partisanship and polarization is.  It was  relentless.  There was absolutely no effort to engage the nominee in  anything serious.  It was once speech after another.  Senator Blumenthal  calling the president an unindicted co-conspirator. </p><p>ASMAN:  Which is not true.</p><p>HENNINGER:  It is not true.  So the parties have just been driven that far  apart and there's no way to see them come together after a display like  that.  </p><p>ASMAN:  But, Bill, it was so transparent.  There is a difference between  taking a stand and grandstanding, and I think Americans saw the difference.  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Yes, and I think you hinted at it in the  introduction.  For most Americans, this was a hearing about a Supreme Court  nominee.  For the Democrats, especially Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, this  was the first primary of the 2020 season.  </p><p>Look, the progressives that complained, the groups, they actually  specifically claimed to Chuck Schumer that he was a bad leader because he  hadn't got all Democrats to vote no.  The problem is, even if you've got  all Democrats to vote no, Brett Kavanaugh is still going to be confirmed  because this is a lot of sound and fury signifying one thing, they don't  have the votes.  </p><p>ASMAN:  James, I'm wondering if they would have been better off doing what  some had said they should have done, which was just walking out at the  beginning of the hearings.  They could have spared not only themselves  embarrassment but the rest of us a lot of our time.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Well, I think if they  declined to participate in the U.S. Senate, they may invite a change in the  rules, which allows Mitch McConnell's majority to have even more freedom of  action.  </p><p>But I would like to speak up for Mr. Booker and grandstanding in general  here.  I think we have been so concerned about Democratic politicians  drifting toward the Bernie Sanders left, embracing truly radical policy  positions, but this is kind of nice if he's just pretending to be radical.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think that's better for the country than someone who is actually radical.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Well, it may be.  On the other hand, I don't know if hysteria is  good at all for anybody.</p><p>Kim, there was this sense of a hysterical tone during some of the hearing  here.  And I'm getting a sense and a lot of it is because there's so much  disappoint on the part of Democrats that they're not getting things that  they thought they were entitled to.  Starting with the election, they  thought they were entitled to have the election.  Then the Russian  collusion story, they thought they had that nailed down.  And of course,  Supreme Court justices, and ultimately an impeachment.  That's also what  they think they're entitled to.  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Well, all of that was driving this.   But it gets to the question of, what was the purpose, what were they trying  to accomplish here.  In a smarter world, they would have been trying to  attempt to persuade a couple of Republicans that is this guy wasn't  confirmable, that he shouldn't be on the court.  Of course, he is so well  qualified, that wasn't likely to happen.  Instead, they decided on  theatrics.  The question is, does those theatrics help them in any way?  It  might help Mr. Booker or Ms. Harris, who are heading themselves for a  presidential run.  But in the hearing now, what they have done elevate the  question into a litmus test, as we were talking about with the progressive  groups, and they have put their most vulnerable Senators, those who are up  for reelection this fall in states that Trump won, in an impossible  position.  Because they are upping the pressure on them to have to vote no,  and for many of them, that no vote could prove decisive and may seal their  fate in reelection bids this fall.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  Who thought it would come down to Supreme Court?  </p><p>Dan, there was a little bit of substance.  Senator Whitehouse, I believe it  was, tried to prove that a lot of Kavanaugh's decisions were based on  personal prejudice, whether it dealt with an abortion decision, an under- age immigrant or certain business decisions he made because he was so- called pro-business.  That was rejoined by Senator Cornyn, who came in and  found -- explained that this is a man who was right in the heart of  Washington, D.C., during 9/11.  He was evacuated from the White House along  with other Bush members, the Bush administration.  And yet, at one point he  was -- he had to decide on the fate of Osama bin Laden's driver.  I think  his name was Hamdi (ph).  And he actually ruled in favor of Hamdi (ph) in  that decision, despite his personal background on 9/11.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.  One of the primary reasons that Brett Kavanaugh was  nominated was the quality of his legal mind.  And he made it clear in  answering questions like that by citing specific precedence that were basis  of opinions that these results were not because of his personal prejudices  on any of the issues, but because the law prescribed.  And that's the  definition of an Originalist and that's why Brett Kavanaugh is ascending to  the Supreme Court.  </p><p>ASMAN:  I will tell you that Hamdi (ph) decision is a perfect example of  that.  </p><p>Still ahead, we are going to be talking to President Trump's chief economic  adviser.  Larry Kudlow is going to be here to talk about another strong  job's report this week.  </p><p>But, first, questions of presidential power taking center stage in this  week's Supreme Court hearings amid talk of presidential subpoenas and  pardons in the Mueller probe.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  Let me just ask you this.  Can a  sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FEINSTEIN:  Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?  </p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  I can't give you an answer on  that hypothetical question.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN:  You can't give me an answer on whether a president has to  respond to a subpoena from a court of law?  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  Each of the eight judges currently sitting on the Supreme  Court, when they are sitting in my seat, declined to decide potential  hypothetical cases.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  Questions of presidential power taking center stage with this  week's hearings with Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, refusing to  say whether he believes a sitting president can be subpoena.  The hot- button issue as lawyers for President Trump continue to negotiate with  Special Counsel Robert Mueller over the terms of a potential interview in  the ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Former Justice Department prosecutor, James Trusty, joins me now.</p><p>Good to see you, Jim.  Thank you for being here.  </p><p>JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTOR:  Sure.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Obviously, he's been charged, Kavanaugh, as being appointed or  being nominated specifically because he's seen as being favorable to the  executive.  Did you get a sense one way or the other whether Democrats hit  a sore spot this week?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  No, I think it's pretty well established at this point that a  Supreme Court nominee is not going to give their final formulated opinions  about whether they would get on hot-button issues.  I think Judge Kavanaugh  was entirely within his rights to basically beg off answering the question.   The funny question is it's a difficult question even if you had the  restriction.  It's not clear that a sitting president should be subjected  to a subpoena.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Right.  I think because of all of the suspicion the Democrats have  put out there about this, he did seem to say that -- that there was --  there were moments at which judicial power was much stronger than executive  power and where the executive had to give in because the rule of law  affects everybody even if you're president.  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Yes, Judge Kavanaugh has a lengthy record of court opinions.  He  also has old, you know, law review articles where he specifically talks  about the fact that there are going to be times in our country's history  where an independent counsel or a special counsel is going to be needed.   He recognizes that there's limits on all three branches of government and  articulates it in a pretty clear and pretty well-spoken way.  </p><p>ASMAN:  You mentioned the subpoena.  What about the power to indict a  president?  Do you think that that could be in the mix during his term as  Supreme Court justice?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Well, it certainly could be in the mix.  Remember, at this point,  the president has only been identified as a subject.</p><p>ASMAN:  Sure.</p><p>TRUSTY:  So it doesn't look like it's red hot that he's about to face  indictment.  But again, the founding fathers may not have anticipated that  exactly issue, or maybe they did, but the Constitution doesn't make it 100  percent clear whether a sitting president can be indicted or not.  It at  least suggests to a lot of people that the political fallout from criminal  activity ends up in impeachment proceedings, not with separate criminal  prosecutions brought by individual prosecutors.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Notwithstanding all of the fireworks that went on this week, and  there were quite a few, what -- did you get a better sense of what kind of  justice you think Mr. Kavanaugh is going to be?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Well, you know, I look at it more as a lawyer than a partisan.</p><p>ASMAN:  Sure.</p><p>TRUSTY:  And I think the guy is pretty impressive.  I mean, he comes off  very measured, very judicious in his temperament.  He's citing Federalist  Papers like I might cite a \"Family Guys\" episode.  He definitely knows his  history of this country and its jurisprudence.  And I don't think you can  realistically say that he's been caught up or trapped or hurt in any way  politically or elsewise.  I think he comes off as a pretty smooth operator,  a pretty good judge.  And I can't see anybody really changing their minds  through this process --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  The question that I have, and I think, frankly everybody knows he's  basically conservative, but whether he's going to be a moderate  conservative, the Kennedy style, or a hard-nosed Libertarian like Scalia  was.  Any sense there from what he said this week?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  No, I think it's a wait and see.  But, you know, that's kind of  the beauty of this process in a weird way.  It's nice to have judges where  you can't predict with absolute certainty where they are going to go.  And  I take him at his word when he says he waits for the dispute to be  crystallized in front of him, he doesn't prejudge anything.  That's really  what we want from a judge at any level.  </p><p>ASMAN:  He does have strong record in terms of business decisions, arguing  against government regulators who might have overstepped their bounds,  which they very often do, these bureaucrats.  He has more than 70 decisions  in which he sided against the government regulators.  Does that give you a  sense that he is going to be more pro-business than perhaps a lot of the  justices?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  It certainly gives you that opening prediction.  But everything  can change when they go back into chambers, and that's what you really  don't know, is exactly how persuasive will be the people who may not be  like-minded or whether he feels additional strength in that position from  some of his colleagues.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.</p><p>TRUSTY:  And so, you know, at end of the day, you can guess a little bit  and you can say that he looks like he might be pro-business, anti- regulatory, but how that actually plays out in the individual case is yet  to be seen.  </p><p>ASMAN:  And, Jim, finally, you had the unenviable job, as prosecutors and  lawyers do, of trying to talk to juries about legal decisions, which is  very difficult because sometimes legal decisions are filled with all kinds  of stuff that -- that normal people can't understand, only you lawyers can.   I think that he cut through a lot of that.  And that's one of the jobs of  the Supreme Court is to cut through the legal jargon and go directly to the  American people and say, this is what makes sense based on the decision.  I  sense that he has that ability, did you?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Yes, I think his history and just the way he speaks at either  nominations or now confirmation hearings makes it clear that he's got a  little bit of a teacher in him, which is a good quality for an attorney.   It means that he can take something that's very complex and break it down  into the basic building blocks in a way that's either persuasive or  instructive or humorous or all the above.  So I think that's a real skill  for any justice to have and any attorney to have.  </p><p>ASMAN:  James Trusty.  Great to see you, Jim.  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Sure.</p><p>ASMAN:  Thank you very much for being here.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Still ahead, President Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow,  joining the show.  </p><p>But, first, claims of chaos in the West Wing.  So how should the president  respond to this week's \"New York Times\" op-ed and a forthcoming book about  his White House as well?  We ask our panel, coming next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York Times\"  has an anonymous editorial.  Can you believe it?  Anonymous, meaning  gutless, a gutless editorial.  We are doing a great job.  The poll numbers  are through the roof.  Our poll numbers are great.  And guess what, nobody  is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because of what we've done.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  President Trump on Wednesday touting his administration's  accomplishments amid opposition claims of an uprising that is boiling up  within his administration.  One specific charge coming from this anonymous  author of a \"New York Times\" op-ed claiming to be a rebellious senior  member of the administration.  All this, just ahead of the release of new  book of \"Washington Post\" reporter, Bob Woodward.  So is this a White House  with an internal rebellion going on?  </p><p>All right, Bill, you worked in the Bush administration.  There's always  discontent.  I've talked to people in administrations.  I don't know if I  talked to you in the administration.</p><p>MCGURN:  And malcontents.</p><p>ASMAN:  And malcontents.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But this goes way beyond that?  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  In some sense, this is no different from the game most days  in the West Wing.  When you look at the \"Washington Post\" and you try to  figure out which of the colleagues leaked the story that he shouldn't have  done, right, this takes it to the end degree.  It is extraordinary the  claims that -- look, when you work for a president, you have to decide, are  you for him or against him, can you stomach all the things.  Because I  wrote a lot of pro ethanol speeches, you know, for my sins, but I supported  president Bush on the war and larger issues, the economy and life and so  forth.  And if you can't serve a president honestly, I think, the course is  an honorable resignation.  And for a man to say, I'm a staffer and I'm  steering the president in the right direction, well, the American people  get to make that decision --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGURN:  -- at the election.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Kim, also in terms of the impact on President Trump, it might  actually turn out to be a positive because this kind of -- this kind of  holds up, bolsters his point that there's the deep state against him within  the bureaucracy.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  Well, that, too.  And also the fact that, you know, when you  read this op-ed, it's very easy to doubt the sincerity of the writer.   Look, because if he or she was doing as they claim they are, that they are  there to try to keep the president in check and temper his worst  inclinations, why would you go write op-ed that's waving a red flag in  front of a bull --</p><p>ASMAN:  Precisely.</p><p>STRASSEL:  -- and cause all the more outburst.  Of course, you would  quietly continue on your way doing what you've been doing instead of  flagging it publicly.  So it looks insincere.  As you said, it does - it  will -- his supporters -- he's mentioning it, getting huge applause lines  when he talks about how he's fighting not just Democrats in Washington but  even within his own administration.  He has to take them all on.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Right, right.</p><p>And, James, then there is the switch, the focus of the \"New York Times\"  itself publishing this thing, an anonymous source with a lead editorial  like this, what do you think of that?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I guess we should applaud them for this time putting them  in opinion pages rather than the -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ASMAN:  Rather than - although, it was on the front page, but that's  another story.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Anonymous insults of the president, I don't really see the value  of this.  I think --</p><p>ASMAN:  Is it journalism?  I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the editor, even of  an editorial page, have to respect the viewer enough to share with them  details of who is writing the piece.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Generally, if you're going to allow this kind of anonymous shot,  it is for a -- an extreme very-specific circumstance, an Iranian dissident  who will be shot if their identity is revealed.  Someone else in a  situation where the only way that the truth can come out is by concealing  the identity.  I don't see how that applies here.  And the underlying truth  is kind of a nothing story.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  In the 90's, there was a time when the \"Wall Street Journal\" had  the editorial of woman who had been raped and did not want to be identified  for obvious reasons.  There are these moments.  But this does not seem to  be one of them.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes, and I think the American public is increasingly mystified  by what is going on.  What is going on, David, is this is basically the  seven-year's war between the Washington press corps and President Trump.   It's like the press has surrounded the White House.  They have the  catapults set up.  They are throwing boiling water and oil in there all of  the time.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The president is firing back at them.  And people are saying, what the heck  is going on.   We thought the press was supposed to report the news.  All  they report on is Donald Trump and his ragings.  </p><p>Look, any White House is going to have a president who says things that the  administration officials don't carry out.  Lyndon Johnson was famous for  that.  Richard Nixon was famous for that.  This is no different.  But as  Larry Kudlow is pointing out in the show, you've got an administration  that, policy-wise, is having a lot of success, despite what this anonymous  writer is saying.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  That's got to be the last word.</p><p>Still ahead, a better-than-expected job's report giving Republicans more  economic news to run on in the midterms.  As we just heard from Dan, we  will be talking next to White House chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow.   That is next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Thanks to Republican leadership, our economy is booming like never  before in our history.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST:  More really good news for the U.S. economy with  employers adding a better-than-expected 201,000 jobs in August.  This, as  yearly wage growth hits a nine-year high.</p><p>Let's bring in White House chief economic adviser and good friend, Larry  Kudlow.</p><p>Larry, congratulations.</p><p>What would you say the headline of the story is today?  </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER:  You know, I think here  is the broader headline, the single biggest news story in 2018 by far is an  economic boom that almost everyone believed to be impossible.  That, to me,  is the story, not all this other stuff that pops up periodically.  The  economy is booming on all cylinders.  There's been a big change in policy  and attitude and confidence.  </p><p>And let me add to that, this is -- this is middle-class-working folks,  better paychecks-kind of stuff.  And it's not over.  It's not one quarter  or two quarters.  Every reading I have -- I used to do it for a living --  it's going to go on for quite some time.  That's the story, David, an  economic boom folks said couldn't happen.  </p><p>ASMAN:  It is extraordinary.  When you look back at some of the comments --  I mean, Paul Krugman, on the night of the election, suggesting that we were  going to go into a crisis that we never recover from.  But after the tax  cut was put forth, you had Nancy Pelosi saying it was going to lead to an  economic apocalypse.  All the predictions.  I mean, there are political  ramifications to this economic success that you have.  I mean, you have to  recognize that.  You have played both sides of that coin.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't want to politicize this.  Here is what I want to say  -- you can buy my book or not -- JFK, the Democrat, lowered marginal tax  rates, kept the dollar sound, minimized regulations, and we had a seven or  eight-year boom without inflation.  Years later, Ronald Reagan, a former  Democrat, then Republican, followed JFK's advice, incentivized the economy  with lower marginal rates, keep the dollar sound, minimize regulations.   These are different individuals.  I'm not here to say that President Trump  is like Ronald Reagan or like JFK, except he is following a very similar  economic policy path, and it is working as the others worked.  We wrote  about this.  So we will see.  I know I have critics, I know there are folks  who don't agree, and I respect their point of view.  But that model, OK,  low tax rates, sound money, less regulation, et cetera, we've all talked  about this for a long time, it appears to be working.  And at the very  least -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, it's not rocket science.  You are one of the smartest people  I know, as are a lot of the people you work with.  But it's not rocket  science.  It's very simple.  You make it cheaper for businesses to do  business and you will have more business.  You make it cheaper by  deregulation, lowering taxes, onerous taxes, and -- and you do the right  things and business will respond.  Incentives matter.  That's the simple  message, no?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  It is.  Art Laffer was in yesterday.  He spoke to our NEC cabinet  lunch.  He also spoke, I don't know, 20 or 25 minutes with the president,  walking through a lot of these themes.  I know, you know, President Trump,  there's all kinds controversies.  We can get into that if you care to.  All  I'm saying is the president, from day one, has followed sound economic  policies, and the growth effects are kicking in.  Again, at the risk of  being -- 2018, the big story, not -- not phony editorials in the \"New York  Times.\"  I'm sorry.  It's an economic boom and the recovery of the United  States, and that includes the recovery of the middle class.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Let me ask about one thing that some critics are harping on, that  the labor force participation did come down a little bit.  Does that bother  you?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  No, but it has more room to rise and we are keeping an eye on  that.  And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Why do you think it went down?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  On a month-to-month basis, it's impossible to tell.  </p><p>ASMAN:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I would only suggest this, part of that calculation is wages.  And  we are seeing improvement in wages.  Very important, middle-income wages.   In the report today, average hourly earnings up 2.9 for the 12 months.  Our  Kevin Hassett, from the C.A., did a terrific study to  recalculate.  After  taxes, after inflation and benefits, and so forth, real wages for worker  much stronger --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Household income is up and the attitude of people, the people feel  more comfortable going out and buying things, which also helps the economy.   I just want to ask you something a little -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Confidence, just one quickie on that.  </p><p>ASMAN:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The confidence thing is phenomenal.  And that has to do with the  change.  We are not punishing business and investors right now and we are  promoting entrepreneurship.  Inside the numbers -- I don't want to get into  the weeds but you guys are weed people.  You look at those numbers today,  average hourly earnings, yes, up 2.9 percent, terrific.  But to do that  right, David, for working folks, you to multiply that times hours worked.   And so what you've got, on a 12-month basis, is a 5 percent increase, OK,  in middle-class wages, 5 percent.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Very good.  Very important.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I just knocked out 2 percent inflation.  </p><p>ASMAN:  I have 30 seconds, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes.</p><p>ASMAN:  I have to hit on one thing that's beyond our borders, down in  Argentina.  A country that you and I visited together once many years ago.   We love it.  They are in deep trouble.  They've had to go to IMF in order  to get an emergency loan for the trouble they're in.  The IMF has demanded  that, in exchange for their loan, they have to raise their export taxes,  which is going to hurt their economy.  I know the Argentines.  I know some  of the people in the government.  They hate IMF's medicine.  They actually  hate IMF to be honest.  They would much rather be dealing with the U.S.  Treasury in some form.  Is there any chance that that could happen?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes.  The treasury is deeply involved in this discussion, deeply  involved, which is a great thing.  And as you and I learned, and others,  the only way out of Argentina's dilemma is to set up currency board, the  peso links to the dollar, but you can create a single new peso.  No money  creation unless you have a dollar reserve behind it.  That worked in the  90's.  It brought down inflation and kept prosperity.  That's what they  need to do it again.  And you know what, Treasury Department people are on  it.  They are on it, David.  So keep hope alive on that point.  </p><p>ASMAN:  There's hope for Argentina.  That's great to hear.</p><p>Larry, great to see you.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN:  Great to see you doing so well.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thanks you.</p><p>ASMAN:  God bless you.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN:  And God bless your heart.  I know you had a little issue but it's  all over now.  Thank you, my friend.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Still ahead, amid accusations of anti-competitive behavior and political  bias, Twitter and Facebook executives face a grilling on Capitol Hill.  So  can government regulation of big tech be far behind?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER:  I want to start by making something very clear.   We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives, or party affiliation  in any of our policies or enforcement decisions, period.  Impartiality is  our guiding principle.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey defending himself this week against  accusations of political bias.  Twitter and Facebook executives were  grilled on Capitol Hill on Wednesday amid the growing debate over whether  conservative viewpoints are suppressed on social media platforms and  in  search functions.  </p><p>The Justice Department announced on Wednesday that Jeff Sessions will meet  with state attorneys general later this month to discuss concerns that tech  companies may be, quote, \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas  on their platforms.\"</p><p>Well, James, the market didn't think much of Mr. Dorsey's comments because  Twitter was way down on the day that he testified.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Yes, and I'm not sure any  of us should think too much of them.  They have had to change the algorithm  that they wrote with their opinions that was exerting some bias against  conservatives.  But I don't think Jeff Sessions has the right idea either.   There's a problem here.  There's an extreme left-wing bias among a lot of  these Silicon Valley companies.  But I think there's a market solution.   And I think the real danger here is if you get a deal with Silicon Valley  giants and Washington politicians to make the Federal Trade Commission some  giant Internet regulator.  I think we would all regret it forever.  So I  hope that's not where this is going.</p><p>ASMAN:  I think you may be right.  </p><p>Well, Kim, the bias does appear to be real.  Congressman Jim Jordan and  others were talking about how they were shadow banned by Twitter, an  expression that means a way that they can ban, kind of a subtle banning of  what they do.  What should government do, if anything?  The president,  himself, said earlier that he doesn't want regulation of the Internet, but  he says he wants things to change.  How do you change things if you don't  regulate?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Well, look, one thing is keeping  attention on it, like they did with the hearings, which in my mind is the  best way forward.  If there's enough pressure on them, they will  eventually, hopefully, change their practices before government acts.  But  history shows that if they don't act on their own, the American people will  ask government to do it, and they will find themselves in a much more worse  situation if that's where they end up.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Dan, there's competition.  To James point, you don't have to go to  Google.  By the way, Google was a no-show at the conference.  They didn't  show up at all because they wanted to present a secondary figure.  The  Senators wanted somebody more primary.  But you can go to Bing.  Bing is  owned by Microsoft, a competitor to Google.  And I, for what it's worth,  when I put in a search request with Bing, they are different from the  search responses you get from Google.  I think a little less biased.  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  Well, I don't know.  I mean,  Google and Facebook control the markets they're in.  If you can put a  search term in Google, the algorithm immediately goes through billions of  web pages.  Facebook has billions of users.  These two companies have got  their arms around the ocean.  It's like trying to regulate or control the  movement of the waves in the ocean.  And they have got to come to grips  with the fact that, on the one hand, they have the huge unprecedentedly  large companies making extraordinary amounts of money off politics and off  the news, and they can't just stand there and say, we are nothing more than  a conveyer belt funneling all of this stuff out with neutral algorithms,  because nobody believes that entirely.  </p><p>ASMAN:  They are different.</p><p>Bill, we have the whole Alex Jones thing, which he has been banned for life  -- a term I haven't heard since Soviet Union existed -- from Twitter.  Fair  enough, this is not a government.  This is a private company and they can  do what they want.  But it shows a certain contempt for the concept of  freedom of thought and freedom of speech.  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Well, look, I'm less concerned about Alex Jones.   And one of the problems I think they have is, if you rely on human judgment  for a lot of this, it's beyond their control.  These algorithms, you may be  aiming at Alex Jones and hit others.  I will give you a perfect example.   Elizabeth Heng is Republican running in California, family were refugees  from Cambodia.  She put up a campaign ad talking about her parents fleeing  the killing fields and it was banned by both Twitter and Facebook as  offensive or inappropriate content.  That's the problem.  A lot of  conservatives get hit by this.  I agree, I don't want the federal  government regulating them, but I think that they will have to answer to  this.  </p><p>ASMAN:  And 30 seconds with the answer, James?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of it is the courts just implementing existing law.   They've interpreted this shield they have on the premise, a liability  shield on the premise that they are just neutral operators of the tech  platform.  The more they start editing, editing out some voices and not  others, the more legal problem they should have.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>Gentlemen, lady, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, Nike courts controversy with the choice of Colin  Kaepernick as the new face of its marketing campaign.  Our panel's thoughts  on that and the politics surrounding the NFL's new season, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  As the NFL kicked off its regular season on Thursday night, all  eyes were on the commercial breaks with Nike launching an ad featuring  Colin Kaepernick as the new face of its \"Just Do It\" campaign.  Nike's  choice of Kaepernick, who set off the wave of kneeling protests in the NFL,  has caused an outcry with some even burning Nike shoes and sportswear in  protest.</p><p>President Trump weighed in on the controversial pick Wednesday tweeting  out, quote, \"Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone way down, Nike is  getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.  I wonder if they had  any idea that it would be this way.  As far as the NFL is concerned, I find  it hard to watch, and I always will until they stand for the flag.\"  </p><p>And, Dan, this vindicates you.  You had a piece, months and months ago,  saying that baseball is the only all-American sport we have left.  Does  this prove that?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Absolutely.  It's the only apolitical sport we have.  Does  Donald Trump tweet about baseball players?  Not at all.  I mean -- </p><p>ASMAN:  That's a good point.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  -- we spent this entire program talking about politics, the war  between the \"New York Times\" and Donald Trump.  By Sunday afternoon, what  do most of us want to do?  Just sit down and watch a good athletic contest  and not be exposed to the politics of these NFL players and fighting with  the president of the United States.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Bill, to be picky, this ad campaign says that he sacrificed nothing  to stand up for what he believes in.  He got paid millions.  We don't know  how much.  He got paid a lot of money for this.  </p><p>MCGURN:  It makes me wonder whether Nike has within its ranks the senior  executives and anonymous trying to do Donald Trump's work.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Look, they are betting that their audience is more woke and they'll have  younger audience.  There's a morning consult poll that showed his  favorability was down, even in groups targeted, Millennials and African- Americans and so forth.  There's a lot of history of companies getting  edgier than their customers.  So we'll see in the end.</p><p>ASMAN:  And this guy, James, as a role model.  The fact is he was a losing  quarterback.  He had terrible seasons.  He was on his way out as a starting  quarterback anyway.  This is a time when he decided to make his move.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  He had some good years, too.  He's certainly a talented guy.</p><p>Just to Dan's point about being able to enjoy a game on a Sunday, and I  think without a lot of the politics brought in, I think people actually do  prefer football.  I know I do.  And I think maybe this is -- this is the  way back to that, where this wasn't a highly political or radical ad.  It  was really Kaepernick sort of standing up for a bunch of underdogs and  maybe this is the beginning of the end of the controversy.  </p><p>ASMAN:  But you know, Kim, I can't get beyond those socks.  It's very  simple for me.  I don't like anybody kneeling for the flag, certainly.   I've got a son in the military.  But the socks that he wore that portray  cops as pigs, that was what just did it for me.  I can't even look at the  guy anymore.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  No, and a lot of people who look at this ad are going to be put  off by it.  It's probably going to put more people off of watching the NFL.   That's one of the league's problems.  Ratings have been falling.  It's  predicted to fall again this year.  You kind of have to wonder if they  don't wish they had done what George Steinbrenner did for the Yankees in  the '70s when he set up his \"no facial-hair\" policy and there was no  arguing with it.  You want to play for the Yankees, this is what you're  going to do.  One and done and get it over with.  Because this just keeps  dragging on and it's not helping the NFL or the players.  </p><p>ASMAN:  You bring up a great point, Kim.  You're an employee.  You're an  employee.  It's not the question of citizenship.  It's a question of what  you have to do in order to stay and play.  </p><p>There's the question of whether Nike is -- may in the end, some people say,  could benefit from this.  Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, retired now,  but he still takes active job in participating with the company's future.   He would always push the edgiest stuff possible because we're talking about  it, folks, and that's part of the reason they did it, right?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Nike's sales were down and they needed to do something.  Please  don't groan.  But Phil Knight and Nike are throwing a Hail Mary with Colin  Kaepernick.  They needed to become a conversation piece again.  And they  have succeeded at that.  It was a marketing ploy.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  And we are talking about them.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes, and so is President Trump.  It might be good for Nike, but  for the NFL to pick this one man.  Nike supplies the NFL with uniforms,  too.  We will not hear the last from Donald Trump.  </p><p>ASMAN:  We are a month away from baseball season.  I will spend a lot of  months wishing we were back in it or at least hoping that we get there  soon.</p><p>Thank you, folks.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Two months.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Appreciate it.</p><p>We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  And it is time for the \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week.</p><p>Kim, first to you.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  David, this is a hit for Senator John Kyle, who has agreed to  temporarily fill the seat of the recently departed John McCain.  Senator  Kyle was in the Senate for 18 years.  He's immensely respected.  He left in  2013 well before the Trump hoopla.  He likely has no interest coming back  to do that.  And he says he's not going to do it long term.  He said he  wanted to see that business got done.  That's something that we should  admire him for, especially in light of the circus we saw there this week.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes, it was an inspired pick.  And Cindy McCain, by the way, gave  her approval to it as well.  </p><p>James, hits or misses?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  David, we have been talking about how all players stand for the  anthem this weekend.  I would like to salute another group of people at the  game who will be both sitting and standing.  Those are American tailgaters  who really haven't gotten enough credit for all the innovations in recent  years.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Like?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  You have gone from a few sandwiches and a cooler and maybe a  thermos of coffee to amazing multi-course grilling, couches, even satellite  television at some tailgates.  It's been exciting.  </p><p>ASMAN:  We wish them the very best.  </p><p>Bill, what do you have?  </p><p>MCGURN:  A hit to Britain, which, this week, charged two Russians with  poisoning an ex-Russian spy and his daughter on British soil earlier this  year.  The spy who was poison was hit with nerve agent.  It also  inadvertently killed a British woman who accidentally came in contact with  it.  The British are not likely to get the two men that they've accused,  but Britain's security minister puts the blames squarely on Vladimir Putin  and he warns that Britain will respond with both overt and covert measures.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Wow.</p><p>All right, Dan?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, David, I'm going to get hit to Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell, who doesn't get that many hits these days as a matter of  fact.  </p><p>ASMAN:  No.</p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, he and the Senate have just recently confirmed Donald  Trump's 60th judicial nominee, adding 33 to the district court and 26  appellate court nominees.  One of President Trump's primary promises during  the campaign and Mitch McConnell is delivering on it.  </p><p>ASMAN:  It's extraordinary when you think where they came from.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.</p><p>ASMAN:  They were so far behind and they've caught up and now exceeded the  normal.  </p><p>Thank you, everybody.  That was a great show.</p><p>Remember, if you have your own \"Hits &amp; Misses,\" be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.</p><p>That's it for the show this week.  I'm David Asman.  You can catch me on  the weekdays on \"After the Bell\" on the FOX Business Network, at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern time.  Paul is back next week.  We hope to see you then. </p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

KAMALA HARRIS, (D), CALIFORNIA: Judge Kavanaugh, I am concerned whether you would treat every American equally or, instead, show allegiance to the political party and the conservative agenda that has shaped and built your career.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D), CONNECTICUT: We are in unchartered territory here. It is unprecedented for a Supreme Court nominee to be named by a president who is an unindicted co-conspirator.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D), NEW JERSEY: I sincerely believe that the public deserves to know this nominee's record. In this particular case, his record on issues of race and the law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an \"I am Spartacus\" moment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST: More on that in a moment.</p><p>Welcome to the JOURNAL: EDITORIAL REPORT. I'm David Asman, in for Bob Gigot.</p><p>That was just a taste of this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who faced, at times, hysterical grilling from Democrats, from anything from abortion rights to presidential powers. The hearings also looking a lot like the kickoff of the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign. But the party's base is apparently not pleased with how the Kavanaugh resistance is going. More than a dozen progressive groups releasing a letter on Wednesday accusing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of, quote, \"failing\" in his efforts to stop the confirmation of President Trump's second Supreme Court pick.</p><p>Let's bring in the panel. We have \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnists Kim Strassel and Bill McGurn, and assistance editorial page editor, James Freeman.</p><p>Good to have you all here.</p><p>Dan, let me start with the Spartacus moment, as he, himself, described it. Senator Cory Booker, turned out, his willingness to fall on the sword, as he was putting it, was all an act, that he had permission to release the papers that he claimed he was going to release in a very self-sacrificing mode. He had permission to release those the night before.</p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIT &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, we all remember Kirk Douglas in \"Spartacus.\" Cory Booker was about as far as you can get from the bravery of that movie.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>He's running for president. But you know, it was one thing after another. It was Cory Booker or Kamala Harris, who is probably also running for president. David, people complain all of the time about the degree of polarization and partisanship in our politics, and they ask, where is it coming from. We had a two-day display by the Democrats on the committee on what the basis of this partisanship and polarization is. It was relentless. There was absolutely no effort to engage the nominee in anything serious. It was once speech after another. Senator Blumenthal calling the president an unindicted co-conspirator.</p><p>ASMAN: Which is not true.</p><p>HENNINGER: It is not true. So the parties have just been driven that far apart and there's no way to see them come together after a display like that.</p><p>ASMAN: But, Bill, it was so transparent. There is a difference between taking a stand and grandstanding, and I think Americans saw the difference.</p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Yes, and I think you hinted at it in the introduction. For most Americans, this was a hearing about a Supreme Court nominee. For the Democrats, especially Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, this was the first primary of the 2020 season.</p><p>Look, the progressives that complained, the groups, they actually specifically claimed to Chuck Schumer that he was a bad leader because he hadn't got all Democrats to vote no. The problem is, even if you've got all Democrats to vote no, Brett Kavanaugh is still going to be confirmed because this is a lot of sound and fury signifying one thing, they don't have the votes.</p><p>ASMAN: James, I'm wondering if they would have been better off doing what some had said they should have done, which was just walking out at the beginning of the hearings. They could have spared not only themselves embarrassment but the rest of us a lot of our time.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Well, I think if they declined to participate in the U.S. Senate, they may invite a change in the rules, which allows Mitch McConnell's majority to have even more freedom of action.</p><p>But I would like to speak up for Mr. Booker and grandstanding in general here. I think we have been so concerned about Democratic politicians drifting toward the Bernie Sanders left, embracing truly radical policy positions, but this is kind of nice if he's just pretending to be radical.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think that's better for the country than someone who is actually radical.</p><p>ASMAN: Well, it may be. On the other hand, I don't know if hysteria is good at all for anybody.</p><p>Kim, there was this sense of a hysterical tone during some of the hearing here. And I'm getting a sense and a lot of it is because there's so much disappoint on the part of Democrats that they're not getting things that they thought they were entitled to. Starting with the election, they thought they were entitled to have the election. Then the Russian collusion story, they thought they had that nailed down. And of course, Supreme Court justices, and ultimately an impeachment. That's also what they think they're entitled to.</p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Well, all of that was driving this. But it gets to the question of, what was the purpose, what were they trying to accomplish here. In a smarter world, they would have been trying to attempt to persuade a couple of Republicans that is this guy wasn't confirmable, that he shouldn't be on the court. Of course, he is so well qualified, that wasn't likely to happen. Instead, they decided on theatrics. The question is, does those theatrics help them in any way? It might help Mr. Booker or Ms. Harris, who are heading themselves for a presidential run. But in the hearing now, what they have done elevate the question into a litmus test, as we were talking about with the progressive groups, and they have put their most vulnerable Senators, those who are up for reelection this fall in states that Trump won, in an impossible position. Because they are upping the pressure on them to have to vote no, and for many of them, that no vote could prove decisive and may seal their fate in reelection bids this fall.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes. Who thought it would come down to Supreme Court?</p><p>Dan, there was a little bit of substance. Senator Whitehouse, I believe it was, tried to prove that a lot of Kavanaugh's decisions were based on personal prejudice, whether it dealt with an abortion decision, an under- age immigrant or certain business decisions he made because he was so- called pro-business. That was rejoined by Senator Cornyn, who came in and found -- explained that this is a man who was right in the heart of Washington, D.C., during 9/11. He was evacuated from the White House along with other Bush members, the Bush administration. And yet, at one point he was -- he had to decide on the fate of Osama bin Laden's driver. I think his name was Hamdi (ph). And he actually ruled in favor of Hamdi (ph) in that decision, despite his personal background on 9/11.</p><p>HENNINGER: Yes. One of the primary reasons that Brett Kavanaugh was nominated was the quality of his legal mind. And he made it clear in answering questions like that by citing specific precedence that were basis of opinions that these results were not because of his personal prejudices on any of the issues, but because the law prescribed. And that's the definition of an Originalist and that's why Brett Kavanaugh is ascending to the Supreme Court.</p><p>ASMAN: I will tell you that Hamdi (ph) decision is a perfect example of that.</p><p>Still ahead, we are going to be talking to President Trump's chief economic adviser. Larry Kudlow is going to be here to talk about another strong job's report this week.</p><p>But, first, questions of presidential power taking center stage in this week's Supreme Court hearings amid talk of presidential subpoenas and pardons in the Mueller probe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA: Let me just ask you this. Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FEINSTEIN: Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?</p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question.</p><p>FEINSTEIN: You can't give me an answer on whether a president has to respond to a subpoena from a court of law?</p><p>KAVANAUGH: Each of the eight judges currently sitting on the Supreme Court, when they are sitting in my seat, declined to decide potential hypothetical cases.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: Questions of presidential power taking center stage with this week's hearings with Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, refusing to say whether he believes a sitting president can be subpoena. The hot- button issue as lawyers for President Trump continue to negotiate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller over the terms of a potential interview in the ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Former Justice Department prosecutor, James Trusty, joins me now.</p><p>Good to see you, Jim. Thank you for being here.</p><p>JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTOR: Sure.</p><p>ASMAN: Obviously, he's been charged, Kavanaugh, as being appointed or being nominated specifically because he's seen as being favorable to the executive. Did you get a sense one way or the other whether Democrats hit a sore spot this week?</p><p>TRUSTY: No, I think it's pretty well established at this point that a Supreme Court nominee is not going to give their final formulated opinions about whether they would get on hot-button issues. I think Judge Kavanaugh was entirely within his rights to basically beg off answering the question. The funny question is it's a difficult question even if you had the restriction. It's not clear that a sitting president should be subjected to a subpoena.</p><p>ASMAN: Right. I think because of all of the suspicion the Democrats have put out there about this, he did seem to say that -- that there was -- there were moments at which judicial power was much stronger than executive power and where the executive had to give in because the rule of law affects everybody even if you're president.</p><p>TRUSTY: Yes, Judge Kavanaugh has a lengthy record of court opinions. He also has old, you know, law review articles where he specifically talks about the fact that there are going to be times in our country's history where an independent counsel or a special counsel is going to be needed. He recognizes that there's limits on all three branches of government and articulates it in a pretty clear and pretty well-spoken way.</p><p>ASMAN: You mentioned the subpoena. What about the power to indict a president? Do you think that that could be in the mix during his term as Supreme Court justice?</p><p>TRUSTY: Well, it certainly could be in the mix. Remember, at this point, the president has only been identified as a subject.</p><p>ASMAN: Sure.</p><p>TRUSTY: So it doesn't look like it's red hot that he's about to face indictment. But again, the founding fathers may not have anticipated that exactly issue, or maybe they did, but the Constitution doesn't make it 100 percent clear whether a sitting president can be indicted or not. It at least suggests to a lot of people that the political fallout from criminal activity ends up in impeachment proceedings, not with separate criminal prosecutions brought by individual prosecutors.</p><p>ASMAN: Notwithstanding all of the fireworks that went on this week, and there were quite a few, what -- did you get a better sense of what kind of justice you think Mr. Kavanaugh is going to be?</p><p>TRUSTY: Well, you know, I look at it more as a lawyer than a partisan.</p><p>ASMAN: Sure.</p><p>TRUSTY: And I think the guy is pretty impressive. I mean, he comes off very measured, very judicious in his temperament. He's citing Federalist Papers like I might cite a \"Family Guys\" episode. He definitely knows his history of this country and its jurisprudence. And I don't think you can realistically say that he's been caught up or trapped or hurt in any way politically or elsewise. I think he comes off as a pretty smooth operator, a pretty good judge. And I can't see anybody really changing their minds through this process --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN: The question that I have, and I think, frankly everybody knows he's basically conservative, but whether he's going to be a moderate conservative, the Kennedy style, or a hard-nosed Libertarian like Scalia was. Any sense there from what he said this week?</p><p>TRUSTY: No, I think it's a wait and see. But, you know, that's kind of the beauty of this process in a weird way. It's nice to have judges where you can't predict with absolute certainty where they are going to go. And I take him at his word when he says he waits for the dispute to be crystallized in front of him, he doesn't prejudge anything. That's really what we want from a judge at any level.</p><p>ASMAN: He does have strong record in terms of business decisions, arguing against government regulators who might have overstepped their bounds, which they very often do, these bureaucrats. He has more than 70 decisions in which he sided against the government regulators. Does that give you a sense that he is going to be more pro-business than perhaps a lot of the justices?</p><p>TRUSTY: It certainly gives you that opening prediction. But everything can change when they go back into chambers, and that's what you really don't know, is exactly how persuasive will be the people who may not be like-minded or whether he feels additional strength in that position from some of his colleagues.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes.</p><p>TRUSTY: And so, you know, at end of the day, you can guess a little bit and you can say that he looks like he might be pro-business, anti- regulatory, but how that actually plays out in the individual case is yet to be seen.</p><p>ASMAN: And, Jim, finally, you had the unenviable job, as prosecutors and lawyers do, of trying to talk to juries about legal decisions, which is very difficult because sometimes legal decisions are filled with all kinds of stuff that -- that normal people can't understand, only you lawyers can. I think that he cut through a lot of that. And that's one of the jobs of the Supreme Court is to cut through the legal jargon and go directly to the American people and say, this is what makes sense based on the decision. I sense that he has that ability, did you?</p><p>TRUSTY: Yes, I think his history and just the way he speaks at either nominations or now confirmation hearings makes it clear that he's got a little bit of a teacher in him, which is a good quality for an attorney. It means that he can take something that's very complex and break it down into the basic building blocks in a way that's either persuasive or instructive or humorous or all the above. So I think that's a real skill for any justice to have and any attorney to have.</p><p>ASMAN: James Trusty. Great to see you, Jim.</p><p>TRUSTY: Sure.</p><p>ASMAN: Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it.</p><p>Still ahead, President Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, joining the show.</p><p>But, first, claims of chaos in the West Wing. So how should the president respond to this week's \"New York Times\" op-ed and a forthcoming book about his White House as well? We ask our panel, coming next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The failing \"New York Times\" has an anonymous editorial. Can you believe it? Anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial. We are doing a great job. The poll numbers are through the roof. Our poll numbers are great. And guess what, nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because of what we've done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: President Trump on Wednesday touting his administration's accomplishments amid opposition claims of an uprising that is boiling up within his administration. One specific charge coming from this anonymous author of a \"New York Times\" op-ed claiming to be a rebellious senior member of the administration. All this, just ahead of the release of new book of \"Washington Post\" reporter, Bob Woodward. So is this a White House with an internal rebellion going on?</p><p>All right, Bill, you worked in the Bush administration. There's always discontent. I've talked to people in administrations. I don't know if I talked to you in the administration.</p><p>MCGURN: And malcontents.</p><p>ASMAN: And malcontents.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But this goes way beyond that?</p><p>MCGURN: Yes. In some sense, this is no different from the game most days in the West Wing. When you look at the \"Washington Post\" and you try to figure out which of the colleagues leaked the story that he shouldn't have done, right, this takes it to the end degree. It is extraordinary the claims that -- look, when you work for a president, you have to decide, are you for him or against him, can you stomach all the things. Because I wrote a lot of pro ethanol speeches, you know, for my sins, but I supported president Bush on the war and larger issues, the economy and life and so forth. And if you can't serve a president honestly, I think, the course is an honorable resignation. And for a man to say, I'm a staffer and I'm steering the president in the right direction, well, the American people get to make that decision --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGURN: -- at the election.</p><p>ASMAN: Kim, also in terms of the impact on President Trump, it might actually turn out to be a positive because this kind of -- this kind of holds up, bolsters his point that there's the deep state against him within the bureaucracy.</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, that, too. And also the fact that, you know, when you read this op-ed, it's very easy to doubt the sincerity of the writer. Look, because if he or she was doing as they claim they are, that they are there to try to keep the president in check and temper his worst inclinations, why would you go write op-ed that's waving a red flag in front of a bull --</p><p>ASMAN: Precisely.</p><p>STRASSEL: -- and cause all the more outburst. Of course, you would quietly continue on your way doing what you've been doing instead of flagging it publicly. So it looks insincere. As you said, it does - it will -- his supporters -- he's mentioning it, getting huge applause lines when he talks about how he's fighting not just Democrats in Washington but even within his own administration. He has to take them all on.</p><p>ASMAN: Right, right.</p><p>And, James, then there is the switch, the focus of the \"New York Times\" itself publishing this thing, an anonymous source with a lead editorial like this, what do you think of that?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I guess we should applaud them for this time putting them in opinion pages rather than the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ASMAN: Rather than - although, it was on the front page, but that's another story.</p><p>FREEMAN: Anonymous insults of the president, I don't really see the value of this. I think --</p><p>ASMAN: Is it journalism? I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the editor, even of an editorial page, have to respect the viewer enough to share with them details of who is writing the piece.</p><p>FREEMAN: Generally, if you're going to allow this kind of anonymous shot, it is for a -- an extreme very-specific circumstance, an Iranian dissident who will be shot if their identity is revealed. Someone else in a situation where the only way that the truth can come out is by concealing the identity. I don't see how that applies here. And the underlying truth is kind of a nothing story.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN: In the 90's, there was a time when the \"Wall Street Journal\" had the editorial of woman who had been raped and did not want to be identified for obvious reasons. There are these moments. But this does not seem to be one of them.</p><p>HENNINGER: Yes, and I think the American public is increasingly mystified by what is going on. What is going on, David, is this is basically the seven-year's war between the Washington press corps and President Trump. It's like the press has surrounded the White House. They have the catapults set up. They are throwing boiling water and oil in there all of the time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The president is firing back at them. And people are saying, what the heck is going on. We thought the press was supposed to report the news. All they report on is Donald Trump and his ragings.</p><p>Look, any White House is going to have a president who says things that the administration officials don't carry out. Lyndon Johnson was famous for that. Richard Nixon was famous for that. This is no different. But as Larry Kudlow is pointing out in the show, you've got an administration that, policy-wise, is having a lot of success, despite what this anonymous writer is saying.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes. That's got to be the last word.</p><p>Still ahead, a better-than-expected job's report giving Republicans more economic news to run on in the midterms. As we just heard from Dan, we will be talking next to White House chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow. That is next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Thanks to Republican leadership, our economy is booming like never before in our history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST: More really good news for the U.S. economy with employers adding a better-than-expected 201,000 jobs in August. This, as yearly wage growth hits a nine-year high.</p><p>Let's bring in White House chief economic adviser and good friend, Larry Kudlow.</p><p>Larry, congratulations.</p><p>What would you say the headline of the story is today?</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER: You know, I think here is the broader headline, the single biggest news story in 2018 by far is an economic boom that almost everyone believed to be impossible. That, to me, is the story, not all this other stuff that pops up periodically. The economy is booming on all cylinders. There's been a big change in policy and attitude and confidence.</p><p>And let me add to that, this is -- this is middle-class-working folks, better paychecks-kind of stuff. And it's not over. It's not one quarter or two quarters. Every reading I have -- I used to do it for a living -- it's going to go on for quite some time. That's the story, David, an economic boom folks said couldn't happen.</p><p>ASMAN: It is extraordinary. When you look back at some of the comments -- I mean, Paul Krugman, on the night of the election, suggesting that we were going to go into a crisis that we never recover from. But after the tax cut was put forth, you had Nancy Pelosi saying it was going to lead to an economic apocalypse. All the predictions. I mean, there are political ramifications to this economic success that you have. I mean, you have to recognize that. You have played both sides of that coin.</p><p>KUDLOW: Look, I don't want to politicize this. Here is what I want to say -- you can buy my book or not -- JFK, the Democrat, lowered marginal tax rates, kept the dollar sound, minimized regulations, and we had a seven or eight-year boom without inflation. Years later, Ronald Reagan, a former Democrat, then Republican, followed JFK's advice, incentivized the economy with lower marginal rates, keep the dollar sound, minimize regulations. These are different individuals. I'm not here to say that President Trump is like Ronald Reagan or like JFK, except he is following a very similar economic policy path, and it is working as the others worked. We wrote about this. So we will see. I know I have critics, I know there are folks who don't agree, and I respect their point of view. But that model, OK, low tax rates, sound money, less regulation, et cetera, we've all talked about this for a long time, it appears to be working. And at the very least --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN: Well, it's not rocket science. You are one of the smartest people I know, as are a lot of the people you work with. But it's not rocket science. It's very simple. You make it cheaper for businesses to do business and you will have more business. You make it cheaper by deregulation, lowering taxes, onerous taxes, and -- and you do the right things and business will respond. Incentives matter. That's the simple message, no?</p><p>KUDLOW: It is. Art Laffer was in yesterday. He spoke to our NEC cabinet lunch. He also spoke, I don't know, 20 or 25 minutes with the president, walking through a lot of these themes. I know, you know, President Trump, there's all kinds controversies. We can get into that if you care to. All I'm saying is the president, from day one, has followed sound economic policies, and the growth effects are kicking in. Again, at the risk of being -- 2018, the big story, not -- not phony editorials in the \"New York Times.\" I'm sorry. It's an economic boom and the recovery of the United States, and that includes the recovery of the middle class.</p><p>ASMAN: Let me ask about one thing that some critics are harping on, that the labor force participation did come down a little bit. Does that bother you?</p><p>KUDLOW: No, but it has more room to rise and we are keeping an eye on that. And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN: Why do you think it went down?</p><p>KUDLOW: On a month-to-month basis, it's impossible to tell.</p><p>ASMAN: OK.</p><p>KUDLOW: I would only suggest this, part of that calculation is wages. And we are seeing improvement in wages. Very important, middle-income wages. In the report today, average hourly earnings up 2.9 for the 12 months. Our Kevin Hassett, from the C.A., did a terrific study to recalculate. After taxes, after inflation and benefits, and so forth, real wages for worker much stronger --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN: Household income is up and the attitude of people, the people feel more comfortable going out and buying things, which also helps the economy. I just want to ask you something a little --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KUDLOW: Confidence, just one quickie on that.</p><p>ASMAN: OK.</p><p>KUDLOW: The confidence thing is phenomenal. And that has to do with the change. We are not punishing business and investors right now and we are promoting entrepreneurship. Inside the numbers -- I don't want to get into the weeds but you guys are weed people. You look at those numbers today, average hourly earnings, yes, up 2.9 percent, terrific. But to do that right, David, for working folks, you to multiply that times hours worked. And so what you've got, on a 12-month basis, is a 5 percent increase, OK, in middle-class wages, 5 percent.</p><p>ASMAN: Very good. Very important.</p><p>KUDLOW: I just knocked out 2 percent inflation.</p><p>ASMAN: I have 30 seconds, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW: Yes.</p><p>ASMAN: I have to hit on one thing that's beyond our borders, down in Argentina. A country that you and I visited together once many years ago. We love it. They are in deep trouble. They've had to go to IMF in order to get an emergency loan for the trouble they're in. The IMF has demanded that, in exchange for their loan, they have to raise their export taxes, which is going to hurt their economy. I know the Argentines. I know some of the people in the government. They hate IMF's medicine. They actually hate IMF to be honest. They would much rather be dealing with the U.S. Treasury in some form. Is there any chance that that could happen?</p><p>KUDLOW: Yes. The treasury is deeply involved in this discussion, deeply involved, which is a great thing. And as you and I learned, and others, the only way out of Argentina's dilemma is to set up currency board, the peso links to the dollar, but you can create a single new peso. No money creation unless you have a dollar reserve behind it. That worked in the 90's. It brought down inflation and kept prosperity. That's what they need to do it again. And you know what, Treasury Department people are on it. They are on it, David. So keep hope alive on that point.</p><p>ASMAN: There's hope for Argentina. That's great to hear.</p><p>Larry, great to see you.</p><p>KUDLOW: Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN: Great to see you doing so well.</p><p>KUDLOW: Thanks you.</p><p>ASMAN: God bless you.</p><p>KUDLOW: Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN: And God bless your heart. I know you had a little issue but it's all over now. Thank you, my friend.</p><p>KUDLOW: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p>ASMAN: Appreciate it.</p><p>Still ahead, amid accusations of anti-competitive behavior and political bias, Twitter and Facebook executives face a grilling on Capitol Hill. So can government regulation of big tech be far behind?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER: I want to start by making something very clear. We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives, or party affiliation in any of our policies or enforcement decisions, period. Impartiality is our guiding principle.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey defending himself this week against accusations of political bias. Twitter and Facebook executives were grilled on Capitol Hill on Wednesday amid the growing debate over whether conservative viewpoints are suppressed on social media platforms and in search functions.</p><p>The Justice Department announced on Wednesday that Jeff Sessions will meet with state attorneys general later this month to discuss concerns that tech companies may be, quote, \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.\"</p><p>Well, James, the market didn't think much of Mr. Dorsey's comments because Twitter was way down on the day that he testified.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Yes, and I'm not sure any of us should think too much of them. They have had to change the algorithm that they wrote with their opinions that was exerting some bias against conservatives. But I don't think Jeff Sessions has the right idea either. There's a problem here. There's an extreme left-wing bias among a lot of these Silicon Valley companies. But I think there's a market solution. And I think the real danger here is if you get a deal with Silicon Valley giants and Washington politicians to make the Federal Trade Commission some giant Internet regulator. I think we would all regret it forever. So I hope that's not where this is going.</p><p>ASMAN: I think you may be right.</p><p>Well, Kim, the bias does appear to be real. Congressman Jim Jordan and others were talking about how they were shadow banned by Twitter, an expression that means a way that they can ban, kind of a subtle banning of what they do. What should government do, if anything? The president, himself, said earlier that he doesn't want regulation of the Internet, but he says he wants things to change. How do you change things if you don't regulate?</p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST: Well, look, one thing is keeping attention on it, like they did with the hearings, which in my mind is the best way forward. If there's enough pressure on them, they will eventually, hopefully, change their practices before government acts. But history shows that if they don't act on their own, the American people will ask government to do it, and they will find themselves in a much more worse situation if that's where they end up.</p><p>ASMAN: Dan, there's competition. To James point, you don't have to go to Google. By the way, Google was a no-show at the conference. They didn't show up at all because they wanted to present a secondary figure. The Senators wanted somebody more primary. But you can go to Bing. Bing is owned by Microsoft, a competitor to Google. And I, for what it's worth, when I put in a search request with Bing, they are different from the search responses you get from Google. I think a little less biased.</p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, I don't know. I mean, Google and Facebook control the markets they're in. If you can put a search term in Google, the algorithm immediately goes through billions of web pages. Facebook has billions of users. These two companies have got their arms around the ocean. It's like trying to regulate or control the movement of the waves in the ocean. And they have got to come to grips with the fact that, on the one hand, they have the huge unprecedentedly large companies making extraordinary amounts of money off politics and off the news, and they can't just stand there and say, we are nothing more than a conveyer belt funneling all of this stuff out with neutral algorithms, because nobody believes that entirely.</p><p>ASMAN: They are different.</p><p>Bill, we have the whole Alex Jones thing, which he has been banned for life -- a term I haven't heard since Soviet Union existed -- from Twitter. Fair enough, this is not a government. This is a private company and they can do what they want. But it shows a certain contempt for the concept of freedom of thought and freedom of speech.</p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST: Well, look, I'm less concerned about Alex Jones. And one of the problems I think they have is, if you rely on human judgment for a lot of this, it's beyond their control. These algorithms, you may be aiming at Alex Jones and hit others. I will give you a perfect example. Elizabeth Heng is Republican running in California, family were refugees from Cambodia. She put up a campaign ad talking about her parents fleeing the killing fields and it was banned by both Twitter and Facebook as offensive or inappropriate content. That's the problem. A lot of conservatives get hit by this. I agree, I don't want the federal government regulating them, but I think that they will have to answer to this.</p><p>ASMAN: And 30 seconds with the answer, James?</p><p>FREEMAN: A lot of it is the courts just implementing existing law. They've interpreted this shield they have on the premise, a liability shield on the premise that they are just neutral operators of the tech platform. The more they start editing, editing out some voices and not others, the more legal problem they should have.</p><p>ASMAN: Absolutely.</p><p>Gentlemen, lady, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, Nike courts controversy with the choice of Colin Kaepernick as the new face of its marketing campaign. Our panel's thoughts on that and the politics surrounding the NFL's new season, next.</p><p>ASMAN: As the NFL kicked off its regular season on Thursday night, all eyes were on the commercial breaks with Nike launching an ad featuring Colin Kaepernick as the new face of its \"Just Do It\" campaign. Nike's choice of Kaepernick, who set off the wave of kneeling protests in the NFL, has caused an outcry with some even burning Nike shoes and sportswear in protest.</p><p>President Trump weighed in on the controversial pick Wednesday tweeting out, quote, \"Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone way down, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way. As far as the NFL is concerned, I find it hard to watch, and I always will until they stand for the flag.\"</p><p>And, Dan, this vindicates you. You had a piece, months and months ago, saying that baseball is the only all-American sport we have left. Does this prove that?</p><p>HENNINGER: Absolutely. It's the only apolitical sport we have. Does Donald Trump tweet about baseball players? Not at all. I mean --</p><p>ASMAN: That's a good point.</p><p>HENNINGER: -- we spent this entire program talking about politics, the war between the \"New York Times\" and Donald Trump. By Sunday afternoon, what do most of us want to do? Just sit down and watch a good athletic contest and not be exposed to the politics of these NFL players and fighting with the president of the United States.</p><p>ASMAN: Bill, to be picky, this ad campaign says that he sacrificed nothing to stand up for what he believes in. He got paid millions. We don't know how much. He got paid a lot of money for this.</p><p>MCGURN: It makes me wonder whether Nike has within its ranks the senior executives and anonymous trying to do Donald Trump's work.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Look, they are betting that their audience is more woke and they'll have younger audience. There's a morning consult poll that showed his favorability was down, even in groups targeted, Millennials and African- Americans and so forth. There's a lot of history of companies getting edgier than their customers. So we'll see in the end.</p><p>ASMAN: And this guy, James, as a role model. The fact is he was a losing quarterback. He had terrible seasons. He was on his way out as a starting quarterback anyway. This is a time when he decided to make his move.</p><p>FREEMAN: He had some good years, too. He's certainly a talented guy.</p><p>Just to Dan's point about being able to enjoy a game on a Sunday, and I think without a lot of the politics brought in, I think people actually do prefer football. I know I do. And I think maybe this is -- this is the way back to that, where this wasn't a highly political or radical ad. It was really Kaepernick sort of standing up for a bunch of underdogs and maybe this is the beginning of the end of the controversy.</p><p>ASMAN: But you know, Kim, I can't get beyond those socks. It's very simple for me. I don't like anybody kneeling for the flag, certainly. I've got a son in the military. But the socks that he wore that portray cops as pigs, that was what just did it for me. I can't even look at the guy anymore.</p><p>STRASSEL: No, and a lot of people who look at this ad are going to be put off by it. It's probably going to put more people off of watching the NFL. That's one of the league's problems. Ratings have been falling. It's predicted to fall again this year. You kind of have to wonder if they don't wish they had done what George Steinbrenner did for the Yankees in the `70s when he set up his \"no facial-hair\" policy and there was no arguing with it. You want to play for the Yankees, this is what you're going to do. One and done and get it over with. Because this just keeps dragging on and it's not helping the NFL or the players.</p><p>ASMAN: You bring up a great point, Kim. You're an employee. You're an employee. It's not the question of citizenship. It's a question of what you have to do in order to stay and play.</p><p>There's the question of whether Nike is -- may in the end, some people say, could benefit from this. Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, retired now, but he still takes active job in participating with the company's future. He would always push the edgiest stuff possible because we're talking about it, folks, and that's part of the reason they did it, right?</p><p>HENNINGER: Nike's sales were down and they needed to do something. Please don't groan. But Phil Knight and Nike are throwing a Hail Mary with Colin Kaepernick. They needed to become a conversation piece again. And they have succeeded at that. It was a marketing ploy.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes. And we are talking about them.</p><p>MCGURN: Yes, and so is President Trump. It might be good for Nike, but for the NFL to pick this one man. Nike supplies the NFL with uniforms, too. We will not hear the last from Donald Trump.</p><p>ASMAN: We are a month away from baseball season. I will spend a lot of months wishing we were back in it or at least hoping that we get there soon.</p><p>Thank you, folks.</p><p>MCGURN: Two months.</p><p>ASMAN: Appreciate it.</p><p>We have to take one more break. When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week.</p><p>ASMAN: And it is time for the \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week.</p><p>Kim, first to you.</p><p>STRASSEL: David, this is a hit for Senator John Kyle, who has agreed to temporarily fill the seat of the recently departed John McCain. Senator Kyle was in the Senate for 18 years. He's immensely respected. He left in 2013 well before the Trump hoopla. He likely has no interest coming back to do that. And he says he's not going to do it long term. He said he wanted to see that business got done. That's something that we should admire him for, especially in light of the circus we saw there this week.</p><p>ASMAN: Yes, it was an inspired pick. And Cindy McCain, by the way, gave her approval to it as well.</p><p>James, hits or misses?</p><p>FREEMAN: David, we have been talking about how all players stand for the anthem this weekend. I would like to salute another group of people at the game who will be both sitting and standing. Those are American tailgaters who really haven't gotten enough credit for all the innovations in recent years.</p><p>ASMAN: Like?</p><p>FREEMAN: You have gone from a few sandwiches and a cooler and maybe a thermos of coffee to amazing multi-course grilling, couches, even satellite television at some tailgates. It's been exciting.</p><p>ASMAN: We wish them the very best.</p><p>Bill, what do you have?</p><p>MCGURN: A hit to Britain, which, this week, charged two Russians with poisoning an ex-Russian spy and his daughter on British soil earlier this year. The spy who was poison was hit with nerve agent. It also inadvertently killed a British woman who accidentally came in contact with it. The British are not likely to get the two men that they've accused, but Britain's security minister puts the blames squarely on Vladimir Putin and he warns that Britain will respond with both overt and covert measures.</p><p>ASMAN: Wow.</p><p>All right, Dan?</p><p>HENNINGER: Well, David, I'm going to get hit to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who doesn't get that many hits these days as a matter of fact.</p><p>ASMAN: No.</p><p>HENNINGER: Well, he and the Senate have just recently confirmed Donald Trump's 60th judicial nominee, adding 33 to the district court and 26 appellate court nominees. One of President Trump's primary promises during the campaign and Mitch McConnell is delivering on it.</p><p>ASMAN: It's extraordinary when you think where they came from.</p><p>HENNINGER: Yes.</p><p>ASMAN: They were so far behind and they've caught up and now exceeded the normal.</p><p>Thank you, everybody. That was a great show.</p><p>Remember, if you have your own \"Hits &amp; Misses,\" be sure to tweet it to us, @JERonFNC.</p><p>That's it for the show this week. I'm David Asman. You can catch me on the weekdays on \"After the Bell\" on the FOX Business Network, at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. Paul is back next week. We hope to see you then.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018090801cb267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T76-05B1-DXH2-62VV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 8, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002E3H</classCode><className>NIKE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NKE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Businesses</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Employment and Unemployment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Argentina</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>IMF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jeff Sessions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S. Justice Department</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Censorship</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alex Jones</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nike</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Colin Kaepernick</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Marketing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Advertising</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NFL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National Anthem</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Scope &amp;

KAMALA HARRIS, (D), CALIFORNIA:  Judge Kavanaugh, I am concerned  whether you would treat every American equally or, instead, show allegiance  to the political party and the conservative agenda that has shaped and  built your career.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D), CONNECTICUT:  We are in unchartered territory  here.  It is unprecedented for a Supreme Court nominee to be named by a  president who is an unindicted co-conspirator.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D), NEW JERSEY:  I sincerely believe that the public  deserves to know this nominee's record.  In this particular case, his  record on issues of race and the law.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an \"I am  Spartacus\" moment.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST:  More on that in a moment.</p><p> Welcome to the JOURNAL: EDITORIAL REPORT.  I'm David Asman, in for Bob  Gigot.</p><p> That was just a taste of this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee,  Brett Kavanaugh, who faced, at times, hysterical grilling from Democrats,  from anything from abortion rights to presidential powers.  The hearings  also looking a lot like the kickoff of the 2020 Democratic presidential  campaign.  But the party's base is apparently not pleased with how the  Kavanaugh resistance is going.  More than a dozen progressive groups  releasing a letter on Wednesday accusing Senate Minority Leader Chuck  Schumer of, quote, \"failing\" in his efforts to stop the confirmation of  President Trump's second Supreme Court pick.  </p><p> Let's bring in the panel.  We have \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and  deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnists Kim Strassel and Bill McGurn, and  assistance editorial page editor, James Freeman.  </p><p> Good to have you all here.</p><p> Dan, let me start with the Spartacus moment, as he, himself, described it.   Senator Cory Booker, turned out, his willingness to fall on the sword, as  he was putting it, was all an act, that he had permission to release the  papers that he claimed he was going to release in a very self-sacrificing  mode.  He had permission to release those the night before.  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIT &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  Yes, we all remember Kirk Douglas  in \"Spartacus.\"  Cory Booker was about as far as you can get from the  bravery of that movie.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> He's running for president.  But you know, it was one thing after another.   It was Cory Booker or Kamala Harris, who is probably also running for  president.  David, people complain all of the time about the degree of  polarization and partisanship in our politics, and they ask, where is it  coming from.  We had a two-day display by the Democrats on the committee on  what the basis of this partisanship and polarization is.  It was  relentless.  There was absolutely no effort to engage the nominee in  anything serious.  It was once speech after another.  Senator Blumenthal  calling the president an unindicted co-conspirator. </p><p> ASMAN:  Which is not true.</p><p> HENNINGER:  It is not true.  So the parties have just been driven that far  apart and there's no way to see them come together after a display like  that.  </p><p> ASMAN:  But, Bill, it was so transparent.  There is a difference between  taking a stand and grandstanding, and I think Americans saw the difference.  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Yes, and I think you hinted at it in the  introduction.  For most Americans, this was a hearing about a Supreme Court  nominee.  For the Democrats, especially Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, this  was the first primary of the 2020 season.  </p><p> Look, the progressives that complained, the groups, they actually  specifically claimed to Chuck Schumer that he was a bad leader because he  hadn't got all Democrats to vote no.  The problem is, even if you've got  all Democrats to vote no, Brett Kavanaugh is still going to be confirmed  because this is a lot of sound and fury signifying one thing, they don't  have the votes.  </p><p> ASMAN:  James, I'm wondering if they would have been better off doing what  some had said they should have done, which was just walking out at the  beginning of the hearings.  They could have spared not only themselves  embarrassment but the rest of us a lot of our time.  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Well, I think if they  declined to participate in the U.S. Senate, they may invite a change in the  rules, which allows Mitch McConnell's majority to have even more freedom of  action.  </p><p> But I would like to speak up for Mr. Booker and grandstanding in general  here.  I think we have been so concerned about Democratic politicians  drifting toward the Bernie Sanders left, embracing truly radical policy  positions, but this is kind of nice if he's just pretending to be radical.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> I think that's better for the country than someone who is actually radical.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Well, it may be.  On the other hand, I don't know if hysteria is  good at all for anybody.</p><p> Kim, there was this sense of a hysterical tone during some of the hearing  here.  And I'm getting a sense and a lot of it is because there's so much  disappoint on the part of Democrats that they're not getting things that  they thought they were entitled to.  Starting with the election, they  thought they were entitled to have the election.  Then the Russian  collusion story, they thought they had that nailed down.  And of course,  Supreme Court justices, and ultimately an impeachment.  That's also what  they think they're entitled to.  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Well, all of that was driving this.   But it gets to the question of, what was the purpose, what were they trying  to accomplish here.  In a smarter world, they would have been trying to  attempt to persuade a couple of Republicans that is this guy wasn't  confirmable, that he shouldn't be on the court.  Of course, he is so well  qualified, that wasn't likely to happen.  Instead, they decided on  theatrics.  The question is, does those theatrics help them in any way?  It  might help Mr. Booker or Ms. Harris, who are heading themselves for a  presidential run.  But in the hearing now, what they have done elevate the  question into a litmus test, as we were talking about with the progressive  groups, and they have put their most vulnerable Senators, those who are up  for reelection this fall in states that Trump won, in an impossible  position.  Because they are upping the pressure on them to have to vote no,  and for many of them, that no vote could prove decisive and may seal their  fate in reelection bids this fall.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Yes.  Who thought it would come down to Supreme Court?  </p><p> Dan, there was a little bit of substance.  Senator Whitehouse, I believe it  was, tried to prove that a lot of Kavanaugh's decisions were based on  personal prejudice, whether it dealt with an abortion decision, an under- age immigrant or certain business decisions he made because he was so- called pro-business.  That was rejoined by Senator Cornyn, who came in and  found -- explained that this is a man who was right in the heart of  Washington, D.C., during 9/11.  He was evacuated from the White House along  with other Bush members, the Bush administration.  And yet, at one point he  was -- he had to decide on the fate of Osama bin Laden's driver.  I think  his name was Hamdi (ph).  And he actually ruled in favor of Hamdi (ph) in  that decision, despite his personal background on 9/11.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Yes.  One of the primary reasons that Brett Kavanaugh was  nominated was the quality of his legal mind.  And he made it clear in  answering questions like that by citing specific precedence that were basis  of opinions that these results were not because of his personal prejudices  on any of the issues, but because the law prescribed.  And that's the  definition of an Originalist and that's why Brett Kavanaugh is ascending to  the Supreme Court.  </p><p> ASMAN:  I will tell you that Hamdi (ph) decision is a perfect example of  that.  </p><p> Still ahead, we are going to be talking to President Trump's chief economic  adviser.  Larry Kudlow is going to be here to talk about another strong  job's report this week.  </p><p> But, first, questions of presidential power taking center stage in this  week's Supreme Court hearings amid talk of presidential subpoenas and  pardons in the Mueller probe.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  Let me just ask you this.  Can a  sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FEINSTEIN:  Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?  </p><p> BRETT KAVANAUGH, U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  I can't give you an answer on  that hypothetical question.  </p><p> FEINSTEIN:  You can't give me an answer on whether a president has to  respond to a subpoena from a court of law?  </p><p> KAVANAUGH:  Each of the eight judges currently sitting on the Supreme  Court, when they are sitting in my seat, declined to decide potential  hypothetical cases.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ASMAN:  Questions of presidential power taking center stage with this  week's hearings with Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, refusing to  say whether he believes a sitting president can be subpoena.  The hot- button issue as lawyers for President Trump continue to negotiate with  Special Counsel Robert Mueller over the terms of a potential interview in  the ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p> Former Justice Department prosecutor, James Trusty, joins me now.</p><p> Good to see you, Jim.  Thank you for being here.  </p><p>JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTOR:  Sure.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Obviously, he's been charged, Kavanaugh, as being appointed or  being nominated specifically because he's seen as being favorable to the  executive.  Did you get a sense one way or the other whether Democrats hit  a sore spot this week?  </p><p> TRUSTY:  No, I think it's pretty well established at this point that a  Supreme Court nominee is not going to give their final formulated opinions  about whether they would get on hot-button issues.  I think Judge Kavanaugh  was entirely within his rights to basically beg off answering the question.   The funny question is it's a difficult question even if you had the  restriction.  It's not clear that a sitting president should be subjected  to a subpoena.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Right.  I think because of all of the suspicion the Democrats have  put out there about this, he did seem to say that -- that there was --  there were moments at which judicial power was much stronger than executive  power and where the executive had to give in because the rule of law  affects everybody even if you're president.  </p><p> TRUSTY:  Yes, Judge Kavanaugh has a lengthy record of court opinions.  He  also has old, you know, law review articles where he specifically talks  about the fact that there are going to be times in our country's history  where an independent counsel or a special counsel is going to be needed.   He recognizes that there's limits on all three branches of government and  articulates it in a pretty clear and pretty well-spoken way.  </p><p> ASMAN:  You mentioned the subpoena.  What about the power to indict a  president?  Do you think that that could be in the mix during his term as  Supreme Court justice?  </p><p> TRUSTY:  Well, it certainly could be in the mix.  Remember, at this point,  the president has only been identified as a subject.</p><p> ASMAN:  Sure.</p><p> TRUSTY:  So it doesn't look like it's red hot that he's about to face  indictment.  But again, the founding fathers may not have anticipated that  exactly issue, or maybe they did, but the Constitution doesn't make it 100  percent clear whether a sitting president can be indicted or not.  It at  least suggests to a lot of people that the political fallout from criminal  activity ends up in impeachment proceedings, not with separate criminal  prosecutions brought by individual prosecutors.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Notwithstanding all of the fireworks that went on this week, and  there were quite a few, what -- did you get a better sense of what kind of  justice you think Mr. Kavanaugh is going to be?  </p><p> TRUSTY:  Well, you know, I look at it more as a lawyer than a partisan.</p><p> ASMAN:  Sure.</p><p> TRUSTY:  And I think the guy is pretty impressive.  I mean, he comes off  very measured, very judicious in his temperament.  He's citing Federalist  Papers like I might cite a \"Family Guys\" episode.  He definitely knows his  history of this country and its jurisprudence.  And I don't think you can  realistically say that he's been caught up or trapped or hurt in any way  politically or elsewise.  I think he comes off as a pretty smooth operator,  a pretty good judge.  And I can't see anybody really changing their minds  through this process --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ASMAN:  The question that I have, and I think, frankly everybody knows he's  basically conservative, but whether he's going to be a moderate  conservative, the Kennedy style, or a hard-nosed Libertarian like Scalia  was.  Any sense there from what he said this week?  </p><p> TRUSTY:  No, I think it's a wait and see.  But, you know, that's kind of  the beauty of this process in a weird way.  It's nice to have judges where  you can't predict with absolute certainty where they are going to go.  And  I take him at his word when he says he waits for the dispute to be  crystallized in front of him, he doesn't prejudge anything.  That's really  what we want from a judge at any level.  </p><p> ASMAN:  He does have strong record in terms of business decisions, arguing  against government regulators who might have overstepped their bounds,  which they very often do, these bureaucrats.  He has more than 70 decisions  in which he sided against the government regulators.  Does that give you a  sense that he is going to be more pro-business than perhaps a lot of the  justices?  </p><p> TRUSTY:  It certainly gives you that opening prediction.  But everything  can change when they go back into chambers, and that's what you really  don't know, is exactly how persuasive will be the people who may not be  like-minded or whether he feels additional strength in that position from  some of his colleagues.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Yes.</p><p> TRUSTY:  And so, you know, at end of the day, you can guess a little bit  and you can say that he looks like he might be pro-business, anti- regulatory, but how that actually plays out in the individual case is yet  to be seen.  </p><p> ASMAN:  And, Jim, finally, you had the unenviable job, as prosecutors and  lawyers do, of trying to talk to juries about legal decisions, which is  very difficult because sometimes legal decisions are filled with all kinds  of stuff that -- that normal people can't understand, only you lawyers can.   I think that he cut through a lot of that.  And that's one of the jobs of  the Supreme Court is to cut through the legal jargon and go directly to the  American people and say, this is what makes sense based on the decision.  I  sense that he has that ability, did you?  </p><p> TRUSTY:  Yes, I think his history and just the way he speaks at either  nominations or now confirmation hearings makes it clear that he's got a  little bit of a teacher in him, which is a good quality for an attorney.   It means that he can take something that's very complex and break it down  into the basic building blocks in a way that's either persuasive or  instructive or humorous or all the above.  So I think that's a real skill  for any justice to have and any attorney to have.  </p><p> ASMAN:  James Trusty.  Great to see you, Jim.  </p><p> TRUSTY:  Sure.</p><p> ASMAN:  Thank you very much for being here.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> Still ahead, President Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow,  joining the show.  </p><p> But, first, claims of chaos in the West Wing.  So how should the president  respond to this week's \"New York Times\" op-ed and a forthcoming book about  his White House as well?  We ask our panel, coming next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York Times\"  has an anonymous editorial.  Can you believe it?  Anonymous, meaning  gutless, a gutless editorial.  We are doing a great job.  The poll numbers  are through the roof.  Our poll numbers are great.  And guess what, nobody  is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because of what we've done.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ASMAN:  President Trump on Wednesday touting his administration's  accomplishments amid opposition claims of an uprising that is boiling up  within his administration.  One specific charge coming from this anonymous  author of a \"New York Times\" op-ed claiming to be a rebellious senior  member of the administration.  All this, just ahead of the release of new  book of \"Washington Post\" reporter, Bob Woodward.  So is this a White House  with an internal rebellion going on?  </p><p> All right, Bill, you worked in the Bush administration.  There's always  discontent.  I've talked to people in administrations.  I don't know if I  talked to you in the administration.</p><p> MCGURN:  And malcontents.</p><p> ASMAN:  And malcontents.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> But this goes way beyond that?  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes.  In some sense, this is no different from the game most days  in the West Wing.  When you look at the \"Washington Post\" and you try to  figure out which of the colleagues leaked the story that he shouldn't have  done, right, this takes it to the end degree.  It is extraordinary the  claims that -- look, when you work for a president, you have to decide, are  you for him or against him, can you stomach all the things.  Because I  wrote a lot of pro ethanol speeches, you know, for my sins, but I supported  president Bush on the war and larger issues, the economy and life and so  forth.  And if you can't serve a president honestly, I think, the course is  an honorable resignation.  And for a man to say, I'm a staffer and I'm  steering the president in the right direction, well, the American people  get to make that decision --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCGURN:  -- at the election.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Kim, also in terms of the impact on President Trump, it might  actually turn out to be a positive because this kind of -- this kind of  holds up, bolsters his point that there's the deep state against him within  the bureaucracy.  </p><p> STRASSEL:  Well, that, too.  And also the fact that, you know, when you  read this op-ed, it's very easy to doubt the sincerity of the writer.   Look, because if he or she was doing as they claim they are, that they are  there to try to keep the president in check and temper his worst  inclinations, why would you go write op-ed that's waving a red flag in  front of a bull --</p><p> ASMAN:  Precisely.</p><p> STRASSEL:  -- and cause all the more outburst.  Of course, you would  quietly continue on your way doing what you've been doing instead of  flagging it publicly.  So it looks insincere.  As you said, it does - it  will -- his supporters -- he's mentioning it, getting huge applause lines  when he talks about how he's fighting not just Democrats in Washington but  even within his own administration.  He has to take them all on.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Right, right.</p><p> And, James, then there is the switch, the focus of the \"New York Times\"  itself publishing this thing, an anonymous source with a lead editorial  like this, what do you think of that?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I guess we should applaud them for this time putting them  in opinion pages rather than the -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> ASMAN:  Rather than - although, it was on the front page, but that's  another story.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Anonymous insults of the president, I don't really see the value  of this.  I think --</p><p> ASMAN:  Is it journalism?  I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the editor, even of  an editorial page, have to respect the viewer enough to share with them  details of who is writing the piece.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Generally, if you're going to allow this kind of anonymous shot,  it is for a -- an extreme very-specific circumstance, an Iranian dissident  who will be shot if their identity is revealed.  Someone else in a  situation where the only way that the truth can come out is by concealing  the identity.  I don't see how that applies here.  And the underlying truth  is kind of a nothing story.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ASMAN:  In the 90's, there was a time when the \"Wall Street Journal\" had  the editorial of woman who had been raped and did not want to be identified  for obvious reasons.  There are these moments.  But this does not seem to  be one of them.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Yes, and I think the American public is increasingly mystified  by what is going on.  What is going on, David, is this is basically the  seven-year's war between the Washington press corps and President Trump.   It's like the press has surrounded the White House.  They have the  catapults set up.  They are throwing boiling water and oil in there all of  the time.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> The president is firing back at them.  And people are saying, what the heck  is going on.   We thought the press was supposed to report the news.  All  they report on is Donald Trump and his ragings.  </p><p> Look, any White House is going to have a president who says things that the  administration officials don't carry out.  Lyndon Johnson was famous for  that.  Richard Nixon was famous for that.  This is no different.  But as  Larry Kudlow is pointing out in the show, you've got an administration  that, policy-wise, is having a lot of success, despite what this anonymous  writer is saying.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Yes.  That's got to be the last word.</p><p> Still ahead, a better-than-expected job's report giving Republicans more  economic news to run on in the midterms.  As we just heard from Dan, we  will be talking next to White House chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow.   That is next.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Thanks to Republican leadership, our economy is booming like never  before in our history.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST:  More really good news for the U.S. economy with  employers adding a better-than-expected 201,000 jobs in August.  This, as  yearly wage growth hits a nine-year high.</p><p> Let's bring in White House chief economic adviser and good friend, Larry  Kudlow.</p><p> Larry, congratulations.</p><p> What would you say the headline of the story is today?  </p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER:  You know, I think here  is the broader headline, the single biggest news story in 2018 by far is an  economic boom that almost everyone believed to be impossible.  That, to me,  is the story, not all this other stuff that pops up periodically.  The  economy is booming on all cylinders.  There's been a big change in policy  and attitude and confidence.  </p><p> And let me add to that, this is -- this is middle-class-working folks,  better paychecks-kind of stuff.  And it's not over.  It's not one quarter  or two quarters.  Every reading I have -- I used to do it for a living --  it's going to go on for quite some time.  That's the story, David, an  economic boom folks said couldn't happen.  </p><p> ASMAN:  It is extraordinary.  When you look back at some of the comments --  I mean, Paul Krugman, on the night of the election, suggesting that we were  going to go into a crisis that we never recover from.  But after the tax  cut was put forth, you had Nancy Pelosi saying it was going to lead to an  economic apocalypse.  All the predictions.  I mean, there are political  ramifications to this economic success that you have.  I mean, you have to  recognize that.  You have played both sides of that coin.  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Look, I don't want to politicize this.  Here is what I want to say  -- you can buy my book or not -- JFK, the Democrat, lowered marginal tax  rates, kept the dollar sound, minimized regulations, and we had a seven or  eight-year boom without inflation.  Years later, Ronald Reagan, a former  Democrat, then Republican, followed JFK's advice, incentivized the economy  with lower marginal rates, keep the dollar sound, minimize regulations.   These are different individuals.  I'm not here to say that President Trump  is like Ronald Reagan or like JFK, except he is following a very similar  economic policy path, and it is working as the others worked.  We wrote  about this.  So we will see.  I know I have critics, I know there are folks  who don't agree, and I respect their point of view.  But that model, OK,  low tax rates, sound money, less regulation, et cetera, we've all talked  about this for a long time, it appears to be working.  And at the very  least -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ASMAN:  Well, it's not rocket science.  You are one of the smartest people  I know, as are a lot of the people you work with.  But it's not rocket  science.  It's very simple.  You make it cheaper for businesses to do  business and you will have more business.  You make it cheaper by  deregulation, lowering taxes, onerous taxes, and -- and you do the right  things and business will respond.  Incentives matter.  That's the simple  message, no?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  It is.  Art Laffer was in yesterday.  He spoke to our NEC cabinet  lunch.  He also spoke, I don't know, 20 or 25 minutes with the president,  walking through a lot of these themes.  I know, you know, President Trump,  there's all kinds controversies.  We can get into that if you care to.  All  I'm saying is the president, from day one, has followed sound economic  policies, and the growth effects are kicking in.  Again, at the risk of  being -- 2018, the big story, not -- not phony editorials in the \"New York  Times.\"  I'm sorry.  It's an economic boom and the recovery of the United  States, and that includes the recovery of the middle class.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Let me ask about one thing that some critics are harping on, that  the labor force participation did come down a little bit.  Does that bother  you?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  No, but it has more room to rise and we are keeping an eye on  that.  And --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ASMAN:  Why do you think it went down?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  On a month-to-month basis, it's impossible to tell.  </p><p> ASMAN:  OK.</p><p> KUDLOW:  I would only suggest this, part of that calculation is wages.  And  we are seeing improvement in wages.  Very important, middle-income wages.   In the report today, average hourly earnings up 2.9 for the 12 months.  Our  Kevin Hassett, from the C.A., did a terrific study to  recalculate.  After  taxes, after inflation and benefits, and so forth, real wages for worker  much stronger --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ASMAN:  Household income is up and the attitude of people, the people feel  more comfortable going out and buying things, which also helps the economy.   I just want to ask you something a little -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KUDLOW:  Confidence, just one quickie on that.  </p><p> ASMAN:  OK.</p><p> KUDLOW:  The confidence thing is phenomenal.  And that has to do with the  change.  We are not punishing business and investors right now and we are  promoting entrepreneurship.  Inside the numbers -- I don't want to get into  the weeds but you guys are weed people.  You look at those numbers today,  average hourly earnings, yes, up 2.9 percent, terrific.  But to do that  right, David, for working folks, you to multiply that times hours worked.   And so what you've got, on a 12-month basis, is a 5 percent increase, OK,  in middle-class wages, 5 percent.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Very good.  Very important.</p><p> KUDLOW:  I just knocked out 2 percent inflation.  </p><p> ASMAN:  I have 30 seconds, Larry.</p><p> KUDLOW:  Yes.</p><p> ASMAN:  I have to hit on one thing that's beyond our borders, down in  Argentina.  A country that you and I visited together once many years ago.   We love it.  They are in deep trouble.  They've had to go to IMF in order  to get an emergency loan for the trouble they're in.  The IMF has demanded  that, in exchange for their loan, they have to raise their export taxes,  which is going to hurt their economy.  I know the Argentines.  I know some  of the people in the government.  They hate IMF's medicine.  They actually  hate IMF to be honest.  They would much rather be dealing with the U.S.  Treasury in some form.  Is there any chance that that could happen?  </p><p> KUDLOW:  Yes.  The treasury is deeply involved in this discussion, deeply  involved, which is a great thing.  And as you and I learned, and others,  the only way out of Argentina's dilemma is to set up currency board, the  peso links to the dollar, but you can create a single new peso.  No money  creation unless you have a dollar reserve behind it.  That worked in the  90's.  It brought down inflation and kept prosperity.  That's what they  need to do it again.  And you know what, Treasury Department people are on  it.  They are on it, David.  So keep hope alive on that point.  </p><p> ASMAN:  There's hope for Argentina.  That's great to hear.</p><p> Larry, great to see you.</p><p> KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p> ASMAN:  Great to see you doing so well.</p><p> KUDLOW:  Thanks you.</p><p> ASMAN:  God bless you.</p><p> KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p> ASMAN:  And God bless your heart.  I know you had a little issue but it's  all over now.  Thank you, my friend.</p><p> KUDLOW:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Appreciate it.  </p><p> Still ahead, amid accusations of anti-competitive behavior and political  bias, Twitter and Facebook executives face a grilling on Capitol Hill.  So  can government regulation of big tech be far behind?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER:  I want to start by making something very clear.   We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives, or party affiliation  in any of our policies or enforcement decisions, period.  Impartiality is  our guiding principle.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ASMAN:  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey defending himself this week against  accusations of political bias.  Twitter and Facebook executives were  grilled on Capitol Hill on Wednesday amid the growing debate over whether  conservative viewpoints are suppressed on social media platforms and  in  search functions.  </p><p> The Justice Department announced on Wednesday that Jeff Sessions will meet  with state attorneys general later this month to discuss concerns that tech  companies may be, quote, \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas  on their platforms.\"</p><p> Well, James, the market didn't think much of Mr. Dorsey's comments because  Twitter was way down on the day that he testified.  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Yes, and I'm not sure any  of us should think too much of them.  They have had to change the algorithm  that they wrote with their opinions that was exerting some bias against  conservatives.  But I don't think Jeff Sessions has the right idea either.   There's a problem here.  There's an extreme left-wing bias among a lot of  these Silicon Valley companies.  But I think there's a market solution.   And I think the real danger here is if you get a deal with Silicon Valley  giants and Washington politicians to make the Federal Trade Commission some  giant Internet regulator.  I think we would all regret it forever.  So I  hope that's not where this is going.</p><p> ASMAN:  I think you may be right.  </p><p> Well, Kim, the bias does appear to be real.  Congressman Jim Jordan and  others were talking about how they were shadow banned by Twitter, an  expression that means a way that they can ban, kind of a subtle banning of  what they do.  What should government do, if anything?  The president,  himself, said earlier that he doesn't want regulation of the Internet, but  he says he wants things to change.  How do you change things if you don't  regulate?  </p><p> KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Well, look, one thing is keeping  attention on it, like they did with the hearings, which in my mind is the  best way forward.  If there's enough pressure on them, they will  eventually, hopefully, change their practices before government acts.  But  history shows that if they don't act on their own, the American people will  ask government to do it, and they will find themselves in a much more worse  situation if that's where they end up.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Dan, there's competition.  To James point, you don't have to go to  Google.  By the way, Google was a no-show at the conference.  They didn't  show up at all because they wanted to present a secondary figure.  The  Senators wanted somebody more primary.  But you can go to Bing.  Bing is  owned by Microsoft, a competitor to Google.  And I, for what it's worth,  when I put in a search request with Bing, they are different from the  search responses you get from Google.  I think a little less biased.  </p><p> DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  Well, I don't know.  I mean,  Google and Facebook control the markets they're in.  If you can put a  search term in Google, the algorithm immediately goes through billions of  web pages.  Facebook has billions of users.  These two companies have got  their arms around the ocean.  It's like trying to regulate or control the  movement of the waves in the ocean.  And they have got to come to grips  with the fact that, on the one hand, they have the huge unprecedentedly  large companies making extraordinary amounts of money off politics and off  the news, and they can't just stand there and say, we are nothing more than  a conveyer belt funneling all of this stuff out with neutral algorithms,  because nobody believes that entirely.  </p><p> ASMAN:  They are different.</p><p> Bill, we have the whole Alex Jones thing, which he has been banned for life  -- a term I haven't heard since Soviet Union existed -- from Twitter.  Fair  enough, this is not a government.  This is a private company and they can  do what they want.  But it shows a certain contempt for the concept of  freedom of thought and freedom of speech.  </p><p> BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Well, look, I'm less concerned about Alex Jones.   And one of the problems I think they have is, if you rely on human judgment  for a lot of this, it's beyond their control.  These algorithms, you may be  aiming at Alex Jones and hit others.  I will give you a perfect example.   Elizabeth Heng is Republican running in California, family were refugees  from Cambodia.  She put up a campaign ad talking about her parents fleeing  the killing fields and it was banned by both Twitter and Facebook as  offensive or inappropriate content.  That's the problem.  A lot of  conservatives get hit by this.  I agree, I don't want the federal  government regulating them, but I think that they will have to answer to  this.  </p><p> ASMAN:  And 30 seconds with the answer, James?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  A lot of it is the courts just implementing existing law.   They've interpreted this shield they have on the premise, a liability  shield on the premise that they are just neutral operators of the tech  platform.  The more they start editing, editing out some voices and not  others, the more legal problem they should have.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Absolutely.</p><p> Gentlemen, lady, thank you.</p><p> When we come back, Nike courts controversy with the choice of Colin  Kaepernick as the new face of its marketing campaign.  Our panel's thoughts  on that and the politics surrounding the NFL's new season, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ASMAN:  As the NFL kicked off its regular season on Thursday night, all  eyes were on the commercial breaks with Nike launching an ad featuring  Colin Kaepernick as the new face of its \"Just Do It\" campaign.  Nike's  choice of Kaepernick, who set off the wave of kneeling protests in the NFL,  has caused an outcry with some even burning Nike shoes and sportswear in  protest.</p><p> President Trump weighed in on the controversial pick Wednesday tweeting  out, quote, \"Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone way down, Nike is  getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.  I wonder if they had  any idea that it would be this way.  As far as the NFL is concerned, I find  it hard to watch, and I always will until they stand for the flag.\"  </p><p> And, Dan, this vindicates you.  You had a piece, months and months ago,  saying that baseball is the only all-American sport we have left.  Does  this prove that?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Absolutely.  It's the only apolitical sport we have.  Does  Donald Trump tweet about baseball players?  Not at all.  I mean -- </p><p> ASMAN:  That's a good point.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  -- we spent this entire program talking about politics, the war  between the \"New York Times\" and Donald Trump.  By Sunday afternoon, what  do most of us want to do?  Just sit down and watch a good athletic contest  and not be exposed to the politics of these NFL players and fighting with  the president of the United States.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Bill, to be picky, this ad campaign says that he sacrificed nothing  to stand up for what he believes in.  He got paid millions.  We don't know  how much.  He got paid a lot of money for this.  </p><p> MCGURN:  It makes me wonder whether Nike has within its ranks the senior  executives and anonymous trying to do Donald Trump's work.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> Look, they are betting that their audience is more woke and they'll have  younger audience.  There's a morning consult poll that showed his  favorability was down, even in groups targeted, Millennials and African- Americans and so forth.  There's a lot of history of companies getting  edgier than their customers.  So we'll see in the end.</p><p> ASMAN:  And this guy, James, as a role model.  The fact is he was a losing  quarterback.  He had terrible seasons.  He was on his way out as a starting  quarterback anyway.  This is a time when he decided to make his move.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  He had some good years, too.  He's certainly a talented guy.</p><p> Just to Dan's point about being able to enjoy a game on a Sunday, and I  think without a lot of the politics brought in, I think people actually do  prefer football.  I know I do.  And I think maybe this is -- this is the  way back to that, where this wasn't a highly political or radical ad.  It  was really Kaepernick sort of standing up for a bunch of underdogs and  maybe this is the beginning of the end of the controversy.  </p><p> ASMAN:  But you know, Kim, I can't get beyond those socks.  It's very  simple for me.  I don't like anybody kneeling for the flag, certainly.   I've got a son in the military.  But the socks that he wore that portray  cops as pigs, that was what just did it for me.  I can't even look at the  guy anymore.  </p><p> STRASSEL:  No, and a lot of people who look at this ad are going to be put  off by it.  It's probably going to put more people off of watching the NFL.   That's one of the league's problems.  Ratings have been falling.  It's  predicted to fall again this year.  You kind of have to wonder if they  don't wish they had done what George Steinbrenner did for the Yankees in  the '70s when he set up his \"no facial-hair\" policy and there was no  arguing with it.  You want to play for the Yankees, this is what you're  going to do.  One and done and get it over with.  Because this just keeps  dragging on and it's not helping the NFL or the players.  </p><p> ASMAN:  You bring up a great point, Kim.  You're an employee.  You're an  employee.  It's not the question of citizenship.  It's a question of what  you have to do in order to stay and play.  </p><p> There's the question of whether Nike is -- may in the end, some people say,  could benefit from this.  Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, retired now,  but he still takes active job in participating with the company's future.   He would always push the edgiest stuff possible because we're talking about  it, folks, and that's part of the reason they did it, right?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Nike's sales were down and they needed to do something.  Please  don't groan.  But Phil Knight and Nike are throwing a Hail Mary with Colin  Kaepernick.  They needed to become a conversation piece again.  And they  have succeeded at that.  It was a marketing ploy.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Yes.  And we are talking about them.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Yes, and so is President Trump.  It might be good for Nike, but  for the NFL to pick this one man.  Nike supplies the NFL with uniforms,  too.  We will not hear the last from Donald Trump.  </p><p> ASMAN:  We are a month away from baseball season.  I will spend a lot of  months wishing we were back in it or at least hoping that we get there  soon.</p><p> Thank you, folks.  </p><p> MCGURN:  Two months.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Appreciate it.</p><p> We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ASMAN:  And it is time for the \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week.</p><p> Kim, first to you.  </p><p> STRASSEL:  David, this is a hit for Senator John Kyle, who has agreed to  temporarily fill the seat of the recently departed John McCain.  Senator  Kyle was in the Senate for 18 years.  He's immensely respected.  He left in  2013 well before the Trump hoopla.  He likely has no interest coming back  to do that.  And he says he's not going to do it long term.  He said he  wanted to see that business got done.  That's something that we should  admire him for, especially in light of the circus we saw there this week.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Yes, it was an inspired pick.  And Cindy McCain, by the way, gave  her approval to it as well.  </p><p> James, hits or misses?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  David, we have been talking about how all players stand for the  anthem this weekend.  I would like to salute another group of people at the  game who will be both sitting and standing.  Those are American tailgaters  who really haven't gotten enough credit for all the innovations in recent  years.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Like?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  You have gone from a few sandwiches and a cooler and maybe a  thermos of coffee to amazing multi-course grilling, couches, even satellite  television at some tailgates.  It's been exciting.  </p><p> ASMAN:  We wish them the very best.  </p><p> Bill, what do you have?  </p><p> MCGURN:  A hit to Britain, which, this week, charged two Russians with  poisoning an ex-Russian spy and his daughter on British soil earlier this  year.  The spy who was poison was hit with nerve agent.  It also  inadvertently killed a British woman who accidentally came in contact with  it.  The British are not likely to get the two men that they've accused,  but Britain's security minister puts the blames squarely on Vladimir Putin  and he warns that Britain will respond with both overt and covert measures.  </p><p> ASMAN:  Wow.</p><p> All right, Dan?  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Well, David, I'm going to get hit to Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell, who doesn't get that many hits these days as a matter of  fact.  </p><p> ASMAN:  No.</p><p> HENNINGER:  Well, he and the Senate have just recently confirmed Donald  Trump's 60th judicial nominee, adding 33 to the district court and 26  appellate court nominees.  One of President Trump's primary promises during  the campaign and Mitch McConnell is delivering on it.  </p><p> ASMAN:  It's extraordinary when you think where they came from.  </p><p> HENNINGER:  Yes.</p><p> ASMAN:  They were so far behind and they've caught up and now exceeded the  normal.  </p><p> Thank you, everybody.  That was a great show.</p><p> Remember, if you have your own \"Hits &amp; Misses,\" be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.</p><p> That's it for the show this week.  I'm David Asman.  You can catch me on  the weekdays on \"After the Bell\" on the FOX Business Network, at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern time.  Paul is back next week.  We hope to see you then. </p><p> END</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

KAMALA HARRIS, (D), CALIFORNIA:  Judge Kavanaugh, I am concerned  whether you would treat every American equally or, instead, show allegiance  to the political party and the conservative agenda that has shaped and  built your career.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D), CONNECTICUT:  We are in unchartered territory  here.  It is unprecedented for a Supreme Court nominee to be named by a  president who is an unindicted co-conspirator.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D), NEW JERSEY:  I sincerely believe that the public  deserves to know this nominee's record.  In this particular case, his  record on issues of race and the law.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an \"I am  Spartacus\" moment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST:  More on that in a moment.</p><p>Welcome to the JOURNAL: EDITORIAL REPORT.  I'm David Asman, in for Bob  Gigot.</p><p>That was just a taste of this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee,  Brett Kavanaugh, who faced, at times, hysterical grilling from Democrats,  from anything from abortion rights to presidential powers.  The hearings  also looking a lot like the kickoff of the 2020 Democratic presidential  campaign.  But the party's base is apparently not pleased with how the  Kavanaugh resistance is going.  More than a dozen progressive groups  releasing a letter on Wednesday accusing Senate Minority Leader Chuck  Schumer of, quote, \"failing\" in his efforts to stop the confirmation of  President Trump's second Supreme Court pick.  </p><p>Let's bring in the panel.  We have \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and  deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnists Kim Strassel and Bill McGurn, and  assistance editorial page editor, James Freeman.  </p><p>Good to have you all here.</p><p>Dan, let me start with the Spartacus moment, as he, himself, described it.   Senator Cory Booker, turned out, his willingness to fall on the sword, as  he was putting it, was all an act, that he had permission to release the  papers that he claimed he was going to release in a very self-sacrificing  mode.  He had permission to release those the night before.  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIT &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  Yes, we all remember Kirk Douglas  in \"Spartacus.\"  Cory Booker was about as far as you can get from the  bravery of that movie.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>He's running for president.  But you know, it was one thing after another.   It was Cory Booker or Kamala Harris, who is probably also running for  president.  David, people complain all of the time about the degree of  polarization and partisanship in our politics, and they ask, where is it  coming from.  We had a two-day display by the Democrats on the committee on  what the basis of this partisanship and polarization is.  It was  relentless.  There was absolutely no effort to engage the nominee in  anything serious.  It was once speech after another.  Senator Blumenthal  calling the president an unindicted co-conspirator. </p><p>ASMAN:  Which is not true.</p><p>HENNINGER:  It is not true.  So the parties have just been driven that far  apart and there's no way to see them come together after a display like  that.  </p><p>ASMAN:  But, Bill, it was so transparent.  There is a difference between  taking a stand and grandstanding, and I think Americans saw the difference.  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Yes, and I think you hinted at it in the  introduction.  For most Americans, this was a hearing about a Supreme Court  nominee.  For the Democrats, especially Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, this  was the first primary of the 2020 season.  </p><p>Look, the progressives that complained, the groups, they actually  specifically claimed to Chuck Schumer that he was a bad leader because he  hadn't got all Democrats to vote no.  The problem is, even if you've got  all Democrats to vote no, Brett Kavanaugh is still going to be confirmed  because this is a lot of sound and fury signifying one thing, they don't  have the votes.  </p><p>ASMAN:  James, I'm wondering if they would have been better off doing what  some had said they should have done, which was just walking out at the  beginning of the hearings.  They could have spared not only themselves  embarrassment but the rest of us a lot of our time.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Well, I think if they  declined to participate in the U.S. Senate, they may invite a change in the  rules, which allows Mitch McConnell's majority to have even more freedom of  action.  </p><p>But I would like to speak up for Mr. Booker and grandstanding in general  here.  I think we have been so concerned about Democratic politicians  drifting toward the Bernie Sanders left, embracing truly radical policy  positions, but this is kind of nice if he's just pretending to be radical.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think that's better for the country than someone who is actually radical.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Well, it may be.  On the other hand, I don't know if hysteria is  good at all for anybody.</p><p>Kim, there was this sense of a hysterical tone during some of the hearing  here.  And I'm getting a sense and a lot of it is because there's so much  disappoint on the part of Democrats that they're not getting things that  they thought they were entitled to.  Starting with the election, they  thought they were entitled to have the election.  Then the Russian  collusion story, they thought they had that nailed down.  And of course,  Supreme Court justices, and ultimately an impeachment.  That's also what  they think they're entitled to.  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Well, all of that was driving this.   But it gets to the question of, what was the purpose, what were they trying  to accomplish here.  In a smarter world, they would have been trying to  attempt to persuade a couple of Republicans that is this guy wasn't  confirmable, that he shouldn't be on the court.  Of course, he is so well  qualified, that wasn't likely to happen.  Instead, they decided on  theatrics.  The question is, does those theatrics help them in any way?  It  might help Mr. Booker or Ms. Harris, who are heading themselves for a  presidential run.  But in the hearing now, what they have done elevate the  question into a litmus test, as we were talking about with the progressive  groups, and they have put their most vulnerable Senators, those who are up  for reelection this fall in states that Trump won, in an impossible  position.  Because they are upping the pressure on them to have to vote no,  and for many of them, that no vote could prove decisive and may seal their  fate in reelection bids this fall.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  Who thought it would come down to Supreme Court?  </p><p>Dan, there was a little bit of substance.  Senator Whitehouse, I believe it  was, tried to prove that a lot of Kavanaugh's decisions were based on  personal prejudice, whether it dealt with an abortion decision, an under- age immigrant or certain business decisions he made because he was so- called pro-business.  That was rejoined by Senator Cornyn, who came in and  found -- explained that this is a man who was right in the heart of  Washington, D.C., during 9/11.  He was evacuated from the White House along  with other Bush members, the Bush administration.  And yet, at one point he  was -- he had to decide on the fate of Osama bin Laden's driver.  I think  his name was Hamdi (ph).  And he actually ruled in favor of Hamdi (ph) in  that decision, despite his personal background on 9/11.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.  One of the primary reasons that Brett Kavanaugh was  nominated was the quality of his legal mind.  And he made it clear in  answering questions like that by citing specific precedence that were basis  of opinions that these results were not because of his personal prejudices  on any of the issues, but because the law prescribed.  And that's the  definition of an Originalist and that's why Brett Kavanaugh is ascending to  the Supreme Court.  </p><p>ASMAN:  I will tell you that Hamdi (ph) decision is a perfect example of  that.  </p><p>Still ahead, we are going to be talking to President Trump's chief economic  adviser.  Larry Kudlow is going to be here to talk about another strong  job's report this week.  </p><p>But, first, questions of presidential power taking center stage in this  week's Supreme Court hearings amid talk of presidential subpoenas and  pardons in the Mueller probe.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  Let me just ask you this.  Can a  sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FEINSTEIN:  Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?  </p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  I can't give you an answer on  that hypothetical question.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN:  You can't give me an answer on whether a president has to  respond to a subpoena from a court of law?  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  Each of the eight judges currently sitting on the Supreme  Court, when they are sitting in my seat, declined to decide potential  hypothetical cases.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  Questions of presidential power taking center stage with this  week's hearings with Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, refusing to  say whether he believes a sitting president can be subpoena.  The hot- button issue as lawyers for President Trump continue to negotiate with  Special Counsel Robert Mueller over the terms of a potential interview in  the ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Former Justice Department prosecutor, James Trusty, joins me now.</p><p>Good to see you, Jim.  Thank you for being here.  </p><p>JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTOR:  Sure.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Obviously, he's been charged, Kavanaugh, as being appointed or  being nominated specifically because he's seen as being favorable to the  executive.  Did you get a sense one way or the other whether Democrats hit  a sore spot this week?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  No, I think it's pretty well established at this point that a  Supreme Court nominee is not going to give their final formulated opinions  about whether they would get on hot-button issues.  I think Judge Kavanaugh  was entirely within his rights to basically beg off answering the question.   The funny question is it's a difficult question even if you had the  restriction.  It's not clear that a sitting president should be subjected  to a subpoena.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Right.  I think because of all of the suspicion the Democrats have  put out there about this, he did seem to say that -- that there was --  there were moments at which judicial power was much stronger than executive  power and where the executive had to give in because the rule of law  affects everybody even if you're president.  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Yes, Judge Kavanaugh has a lengthy record of court opinions.  He  also has old, you know, law review articles where he specifically talks  about the fact that there are going to be times in our country's history  where an independent counsel or a special counsel is going to be needed.   He recognizes that there's limits on all three branches of government and  articulates it in a pretty clear and pretty well-spoken way.  </p><p>ASMAN:  You mentioned the subpoena.  What about the power to indict a  president?  Do you think that that could be in the mix during his term as  Supreme Court justice?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Well, it certainly could be in the mix.  Remember, at this point,  the president has only been identified as a subject.</p><p>ASMAN:  Sure.</p><p>TRUSTY:  So it doesn't look like it's red hot that he's about to face  indictment.  But again, the founding fathers may not have anticipated that  exactly issue, or maybe they did, but the Constitution doesn't make it 100  percent clear whether a sitting president can be indicted or not.  It at  least suggests to a lot of people that the political fallout from criminal  activity ends up in impeachment proceedings, not with separate criminal  prosecutions brought by individual prosecutors.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Notwithstanding all of the fireworks that went on this week, and  there were quite a few, what -- did you get a better sense of what kind of  justice you think Mr. Kavanaugh is going to be?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Well, you know, I look at it more as a lawyer than a partisan.</p><p>ASMAN:  Sure.</p><p>TRUSTY:  And I think the guy is pretty impressive.  I mean, he comes off  very measured, very judicious in his temperament.  He's citing Federalist  Papers like I might cite a \"Family Guys\" episode.  He definitely knows his  history of this country and its jurisprudence.  And I don't think you can  realistically say that he's been caught up or trapped or hurt in any way  politically or elsewise.  I think he comes off as a pretty smooth operator,  a pretty good judge.  And I can't see anybody really changing their minds  through this process --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  The question that I have, and I think, frankly everybody knows he's  basically conservative, but whether he's going to be a moderate  conservative, the Kennedy style, or a hard-nosed Libertarian like Scalia  was.  Any sense there from what he said this week?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  No, I think it's a wait and see.  But, you know, that's kind of  the beauty of this process in a weird way.  It's nice to have judges where  you can't predict with absolute certainty where they are going to go.  And  I take him at his word when he says he waits for the dispute to be  crystallized in front of him, he doesn't prejudge anything.  That's really  what we want from a judge at any level.  </p><p>ASMAN:  He does have strong record in terms of business decisions, arguing  against government regulators who might have overstepped their bounds,  which they very often do, these bureaucrats.  He has more than 70 decisions  in which he sided against the government regulators.  Does that give you a  sense that he is going to be more pro-business than perhaps a lot of the  justices?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  It certainly gives you that opening prediction.  But everything  can change when they go back into chambers, and that's what you really  don't know, is exactly how persuasive will be the people who may not be  like-minded or whether he feels additional strength in that position from  some of his colleagues.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.</p><p>TRUSTY:  And so, you know, at end of the day, you can guess a little bit  and you can say that he looks like he might be pro-business, anti- regulatory, but how that actually plays out in the individual case is yet  to be seen.  </p><p>ASMAN:  And, Jim, finally, you had the unenviable job, as prosecutors and  lawyers do, of trying to talk to juries about legal decisions, which is  very difficult because sometimes legal decisions are filled with all kinds  of stuff that -- that normal people can't understand, only you lawyers can.   I think that he cut through a lot of that.  And that's one of the jobs of  the Supreme Court is to cut through the legal jargon and go directly to the  American people and say, this is what makes sense based on the decision.  I  sense that he has that ability, did you?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Yes, I think his history and just the way he speaks at either  nominations or now confirmation hearings makes it clear that he's got a  little bit of a teacher in him, which is a good quality for an attorney.   It means that he can take something that's very complex and break it down  into the basic building blocks in a way that's either persuasive or  instructive or humorous or all the above.  So I think that's a real skill  for any justice to have and any attorney to have.  </p><p>ASMAN:  James Trusty.  Great to see you, Jim.  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Sure.</p><p>ASMAN:  Thank you very much for being here.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Still ahead, President Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow,  joining the show.  </p><p>But, first, claims of chaos in the West Wing.  So how should the president  respond to this week's \"New York Times\" op-ed and a forthcoming book about  his White House as well?  We ask our panel, coming next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York Times\"  has an anonymous editorial.  Can you believe it?  Anonymous, meaning  gutless, a gutless editorial.  We are doing a great job.  The poll numbers  are through the roof.  Our poll numbers are great.  And guess what, nobody  is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because of what we've done.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  President Trump on Wednesday touting his administration's  accomplishments amid opposition claims of an uprising that is boiling up  within his administration.  One specific charge coming from this anonymous  author of a \"New York Times\" op-ed claiming to be a rebellious senior  member of the administration.  All this, just ahead of the release of new  book of \"Washington Post\" reporter, Bob Woodward.  So is this a White House  with an internal rebellion going on?  </p><p>All right, Bill, you worked in the Bush administration.  There's always  discontent.  I've talked to people in administrations.  I don't know if I  talked to you in the administration.</p><p>MCGURN:  And malcontents.</p><p>ASMAN:  And malcontents.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But this goes way beyond that?  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  In some sense, this is no different from the game most days  in the West Wing.  When you look at the \"Washington Post\" and you try to  figure out which of the colleagues leaked the story that he shouldn't have  done, right, this takes it to the end degree.  It is extraordinary the  claims that -- look, when you work for a president, you have to decide, are  you for him or against him, can you stomach all the things.  Because I  wrote a lot of pro ethanol speeches, you know, for my sins, but I supported  president Bush on the war and larger issues, the economy and life and so  forth.  And if you can't serve a president honestly, I think, the course is  an honorable resignation.  And for a man to say, I'm a staffer and I'm  steering the president in the right direction, well, the American people  get to make that decision --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGURN:  -- at the election.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Kim, also in terms of the impact on President Trump, it might  actually turn out to be a positive because this kind of -- this kind of  holds up, bolsters his point that there's the deep state against him within  the bureaucracy.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  Well, that, too.  And also the fact that, you know, when you  read this op-ed, it's very easy to doubt the sincerity of the writer.   Look, because if he or she was doing as they claim they are, that they are  there to try to keep the president in check and temper his worst  inclinations, why would you go write op-ed that's waving a red flag in  front of a bull --</p><p>ASMAN:  Precisely.</p><p>STRASSEL:  -- and cause all the more outburst.  Of course, you would  quietly continue on your way doing what you've been doing instead of  flagging it publicly.  So it looks insincere.  As you said, it does - it  will -- his supporters -- he's mentioning it, getting huge applause lines  when he talks about how he's fighting not just Democrats in Washington but  even within his own administration.  He has to take them all on.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Right, right.</p><p>And, James, then there is the switch, the focus of the \"New York Times\"  itself publishing this thing, an anonymous source with a lead editorial  like this, what do you think of that?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I guess we should applaud them for this time putting them  in opinion pages rather than the -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ASMAN:  Rather than - although, it was on the front page, but that's  another story.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Anonymous insults of the president, I don't really see the value  of this.  I think --</p><p>ASMAN:  Is it journalism?  I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the editor, even of  an editorial page, have to respect the viewer enough to share with them  details of who is writing the piece.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Generally, if you're going to allow this kind of anonymous shot,  it is for a -- an extreme very-specific circumstance, an Iranian dissident  who will be shot if their identity is revealed.  Someone else in a  situation where the only way that the truth can come out is by concealing  the identity.  I don't see how that applies here.  And the underlying truth  is kind of a nothing story.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  In the 90's, there was a time when the \"Wall Street Journal\" had  the editorial of woman who had been raped and did not want to be identified  for obvious reasons.  There are these moments.  But this does not seem to  be one of them.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes, and I think the American public is increasingly mystified  by what is going on.  What is going on, David, is this is basically the  seven-year's war between the Washington press corps and President Trump.   It's like the press has surrounded the White House.  They have the  catapults set up.  They are throwing boiling water and oil in there all of  the time.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The president is firing back at them.  And people are saying, what the heck  is going on.   We thought the press was supposed to report the news.  All  they report on is Donald Trump and his ragings.  </p><p>Look, any White House is going to have a president who says things that the  administration officials don't carry out.  Lyndon Johnson was famous for  that.  Richard Nixon was famous for that.  This is no different.  But as  Larry Kudlow is pointing out in the show, you've got an administration  that, policy-wise, is having a lot of success, despite what this anonymous  writer is saying.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  That's got to be the last word.</p><p>Still ahead, a better-than-expected job's report giving Republicans more  economic news to run on in the midterms.  As we just heard from Dan, we  will be talking next to White House chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow.   That is next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Thanks to Republican leadership, our economy is booming like never  before in our history.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST:  More really good news for the U.S. economy with  employers adding a better-than-expected 201,000 jobs in August.  This, as  yearly wage growth hits a nine-year high.</p><p>Let's bring in White House chief economic adviser and good friend, Larry  Kudlow.</p><p>Larry, congratulations.</p><p>What would you say the headline of the story is today?  </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER:  You know, I think here  is the broader headline, the single biggest news story in 2018 by far is an  economic boom that almost everyone believed to be impossible.  That, to me,  is the story, not all this other stuff that pops up periodically.  The  economy is booming on all cylinders.  There's been a big change in policy  and attitude and confidence.  </p><p>And let me add to that, this is -- this is middle-class-working folks,  better paychecks-kind of stuff.  And it's not over.  It's not one quarter  or two quarters.  Every reading I have -- I used to do it for a living --  it's going to go on for quite some time.  That's the story, David, an  economic boom folks said couldn't happen.  </p><p>ASMAN:  It is extraordinary.  When you look back at some of the comments --  I mean, Paul Krugman, on the night of the election, suggesting that we were  going to go into a crisis that we never recover from.  But after the tax  cut was put forth, you had Nancy Pelosi saying it was going to lead to an  economic apocalypse.  All the predictions.  I mean, there are political  ramifications to this economic success that you have.  I mean, you have to  recognize that.  You have played both sides of that coin.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't want to politicize this.  Here is what I want to say  -- you can buy my book or not -- JFK, the Democrat, lowered marginal tax  rates, kept the dollar sound, minimized regulations, and we had a seven or  eight-year boom without inflation.  Years later, Ronald Reagan, a former  Democrat, then Republican, followed JFK's advice, incentivized the economy  with lower marginal rates, keep the dollar sound, minimize regulations.   These are different individuals.  I'm not here to say that President Trump  is like Ronald Reagan or like JFK, except he is following a very similar  economic policy path, and it is working as the others worked.  We wrote  about this.  So we will see.  I know I have critics, I know there are folks  who don't agree, and I respect their point of view.  But that model, OK,  low tax rates, sound money, less regulation, et cetera, we've all talked  about this for a long time, it appears to be working.  And at the very  least -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, it's not rocket science.  You are one of the smartest people  I know, as are a lot of the people you work with.  But it's not rocket  science.  It's very simple.  You make it cheaper for businesses to do  business and you will have more business.  You make it cheaper by  deregulation, lowering taxes, onerous taxes, and -- and you do the right  things and business will respond.  Incentives matter.  That's the simple  message, no?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  It is.  Art Laffer was in yesterday.  He spoke to our NEC cabinet  lunch.  He also spoke, I don't know, 20 or 25 minutes with the president,  walking through a lot of these themes.  I know, you know, President Trump,  there's all kinds controversies.  We can get into that if you care to.  All  I'm saying is the president, from day one, has followed sound economic  policies, and the growth effects are kicking in.  Again, at the risk of  being -- 2018, the big story, not -- not phony editorials in the \"New York  Times.\"  I'm sorry.  It's an economic boom and the recovery of the United  States, and that includes the recovery of the middle class.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Let me ask about one thing that some critics are harping on, that  the labor force participation did come down a little bit.  Does that bother  you?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  No, but it has more room to rise and we are keeping an eye on  that.  And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Why do you think it went down?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  On a month-to-month basis, it's impossible to tell.  </p><p>ASMAN:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I would only suggest this, part of that calculation is wages.  And  we are seeing improvement in wages.  Very important, middle-income wages.   In the report today, average hourly earnings up 2.9 for the 12 months.  Our  Kevin Hassett, from the C.A., did a terrific study to  recalculate.  After  taxes, after inflation and benefits, and so forth, real wages for worker  much stronger --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Household income is up and the attitude of people, the people feel  more comfortable going out and buying things, which also helps the economy.   I just want to ask you something a little -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Confidence, just one quickie on that.  </p><p>ASMAN:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The confidence thing is phenomenal.  And that has to do with the  change.  We are not punishing business and investors right now and we are  promoting entrepreneurship.  Inside the numbers -- I don't want to get into  the weeds but you guys are weed people.  You look at those numbers today,  average hourly earnings, yes, up 2.9 percent, terrific.  But to do that  right, David, for working folks, you to multiply that times hours worked.   And so what you've got, on a 12-month basis, is a 5 percent increase, OK,  in middle-class wages, 5 percent.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Very good.  Very important.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I just knocked out 2 percent inflation.  </p><p>ASMAN:  I have 30 seconds, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes.</p><p>ASMAN:  I have to hit on one thing that's beyond our borders, down in  Argentina.  A country that you and I visited together once many years ago.   We love it.  They are in deep trouble.  They've had to go to IMF in order  to get an emergency loan for the trouble they're in.  The IMF has demanded  that, in exchange for their loan, they have to raise their export taxes,  which is going to hurt their economy.  I know the Argentines.  I know some  of the people in the government.  They hate IMF's medicine.  They actually  hate IMF to be honest.  They would much rather be dealing with the U.S.  Treasury in some form.  Is there any chance that that could happen?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes.  The treasury is deeply involved in this discussion, deeply  involved, which is a great thing.  And as you and I learned, and others,  the only way out of Argentina's dilemma is to set up currency board, the  peso links to the dollar, but you can create a single new peso.  No money  creation unless you have a dollar reserve behind it.  That worked in the  90's.  It brought down inflation and kept prosperity.  That's what they  need to do it again.  And you know what, Treasury Department people are on  it.  They are on it, David.  So keep hope alive on that point.  </p><p>ASMAN:  There's hope for Argentina.  That's great to hear.</p><p>Larry, great to see you.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN:  Great to see you doing so well.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thanks you.</p><p>ASMAN:  God bless you.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN:  And God bless your heart.  I know you had a little issue but it's  all over now.  Thank you, my friend.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Still ahead, amid accusations of anti-competitive behavior and political  bias, Twitter and Facebook executives face a grilling on Capitol Hill.  So  can government regulation of big tech be far behind?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER:  I want to start by making something very clear.   We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives, or party affiliation  in any of our policies or enforcement decisions, period.  Impartiality is  our guiding principle.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey defending himself this week against  accusations of political bias.  Twitter and Facebook executives were  grilled on Capitol Hill on Wednesday amid the growing debate over whether  conservative viewpoints are suppressed on social media platforms and  in  search functions.  </p><p>The Justice Department announced on Wednesday that Jeff Sessions will meet  with state attorneys general later this month to discuss concerns that tech  companies may be, quote, \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas  on their platforms.\"</p><p>Well, James, the market didn't think much of Mr. Dorsey's comments because  Twitter was way down on the day that he testified.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Yes, and I'm not sure any  of us should think too much of them.  They have had to change the algorithm  that they wrote with their opinions that was exerting some bias against  conservatives.  But I don't think Jeff Sessions has the right idea either.   There's a problem here.  There's an extreme left-wing bias among a lot of  these Silicon Valley companies.  But I think there's a market solution.   And I think the real danger here is if you get a deal with Silicon Valley  giants and Washington politicians to make the Federal Trade Commission some  giant Internet regulator.  I think we would all regret it forever.  So I  hope that's not where this is going.</p><p>ASMAN:  I think you may be right.  </p><p>Well, Kim, the bias does appear to be real.  Congressman Jim Jordan and  others were talking about how they were shadow banned by Twitter, an  expression that means a way that they can ban, kind of a subtle banning of  what they do.  What should government do, if anything?  The president,  himself, said earlier that he doesn't want regulation of the Internet, but  he says he wants things to change.  How do you change things if you don't  regulate?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Well, look, one thing is keeping  attention on it, like they did with the hearings, which in my mind is the  best way forward.  If there's enough pressure on them, they will  eventually, hopefully, change their practices before government acts.  But  history shows that if they don't act on their own, the American people will  ask government to do it, and they will find themselves in a much more worse  situation if that's where they end up.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Dan, there's competition.  To James point, you don't have to go to  Google.  By the way, Google was a no-show at the conference.  They didn't  show up at all because they wanted to present a secondary figure.  The  Senators wanted somebody more primary.  But you can go to Bing.  Bing is  owned by Microsoft, a competitor to Google.  And I, for what it's worth,  when I put in a search request with Bing, they are different from the  search responses you get from Google.  I think a little less biased.  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  Well, I don't know.  I mean,  Google and Facebook control the markets they're in.  If you can put a  search term in Google, the algorithm immediately goes through billions of  web pages.  Facebook has billions of users.  These two companies have got  their arms around the ocean.  It's like trying to regulate or control the  movement of the waves in the ocean.  And they have got to come to grips  with the fact that, on the one hand, they have the huge unprecedentedly  large companies making extraordinary amounts of money off politics and off  the news, and they can't just stand there and say, we are nothing more than  a conveyer belt funneling all of this stuff out with neutral algorithms,  because nobody believes that entirely.  </p><p>ASMAN:  They are different.</p><p>Bill, we have the whole Alex Jones thing, which he has been banned for life  -- a term I haven't heard since Soviet Union existed -- from Twitter.  Fair  enough, this is not a government.  This is a private company and they can  do what they want.  But it shows a certain contempt for the concept of  freedom of thought and freedom of speech.  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Well, look, I'm less concerned about Alex Jones.   And one of the problems I think they have is, if you rely on human judgment  for a lot of this, it's beyond their control.  These algorithms, you may be  aiming at Alex Jones and hit others.  I will give you a perfect example.   Elizabeth Heng is Republican running in California, family were refugees  from Cambodia.  She put up a campaign ad talking about her parents fleeing  the killing fields and it was banned by both Twitter and Facebook as  offensive or inappropriate content.  That's the problem.  A lot of  conservatives get hit by this.  I agree, I don't want the federal  government regulating them, but I think that they will have to answer to  this.  </p><p>ASMAN:  And 30 seconds with the answer, James?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of it is the courts just implementing existing law.   They've interpreted this shield they have on the premise, a liability  shield on the premise that they are just neutral operators of the tech  platform.  The more they start editing, editing out some voices and not  others, the more legal problem they should have.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>Gentlemen, lady, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, Nike courts controversy with the choice of Colin  Kaepernick as the new face of its marketing campaign.  Our panel's thoughts  on that and the politics surrounding the NFL's new season, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  As the NFL kicked off its regular season on Thursday night, all  eyes were on the commercial breaks with Nike launching an ad featuring  Colin Kaepernick as the new face of its \"Just Do It\" campaign.  Nike's  choice of Kaepernick, who set off the wave of kneeling protests in the NFL,  has caused an outcry with some even burning Nike shoes and sportswear in  protest.</p><p>President Trump weighed in on the controversial pick Wednesday tweeting  out, quote, \"Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone way down, Nike is  getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.  I wonder if they had  any idea that it would be this way.  As far as the NFL is concerned, I find  it hard to watch, and I always will until they stand for the flag.\"  </p><p>And, Dan, this vindicates you.  You had a piece, months and months ago,  saying that baseball is the only all-American sport we have left.  Does  this prove that?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Absolutely.  It's the only apolitical sport we have.  Does  Donald Trump tweet about baseball players?  Not at all.  I mean -- </p><p>ASMAN:  That's a good point.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  -- we spent this entire program talking about politics, the war  between the \"New York Times\" and Donald Trump.  By Sunday afternoon, what  do most of us want to do?  Just sit down and watch a good athletic contest  and not be exposed to the politics of these NFL players and fighting with  the president of the United States.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Bill, to be picky, this ad campaign says that he sacrificed nothing  to stand up for what he believes in.  He got paid millions.  We don't know  how much.  He got paid a lot of money for this.  </p><p>MCGURN:  It makes me wonder whether Nike has within its ranks the senior  executives and anonymous trying to do Donald Trump's work.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Look, they are betting that their audience is more woke and they'll have  younger audience.  There's a morning consult poll that showed his  favorability was down, even in groups targeted, Millennials and African- Americans and so forth.  There's a lot of history of companies getting  edgier than their customers.  So we'll see in the end.</p><p>ASMAN:  And this guy, James, as a role model.  The fact is he was a losing  quarterback.  He had terrible seasons.  He was on his way out as a starting  quarterback anyway.  This is a time when he decided to make his move.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  He had some good years, too.  He's certainly a talented guy.</p><p>Just to Dan's point about being able to enjoy a game on a Sunday, and I  think without a lot of the politics brought in, I think people actually do  prefer football.  I know I do.  And I think maybe this is -- this is the  way back to that, where this wasn't a highly political or radical ad.  It  was really Kaepernick sort of standing up for a bunch of underdogs and  maybe this is the beginning of the end of the controversy.  </p><p>ASMAN:  But you know, Kim, I can't get beyond those socks.  It's very  simple for me.  I don't like anybody kneeling for the flag, certainly.   I've got a son in the military.  But the socks that he wore that portray  cops as pigs, that was what just did it for me.  I can't even look at the  guy anymore.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  No, and a lot of people who look at this ad are going to be put  off by it.  It's probably going to put more people off of watching the NFL.   That's one of the league's problems.  Ratings have been falling.  It's  predicted to fall again this year.  You kind of have to wonder if they  don't wish they had done what George Steinbrenner did for the Yankees in  the '70s when he set up his \"no facial-hair\" policy and there was no  arguing with it.  You want to play for the Yankees, this is what you're  going to do.  One and done and get it over with.  Because this just keeps  dragging on and it's not helping the NFL or the players.  </p><p>ASMAN:  You bring up a great point, Kim.  You're an employee.  You're an  employee.  It's not the question of citizenship.  It's a question of what  you have to do in order to stay and play.  </p><p>There's the question of whether Nike is -- may in the end, some people say,  could benefit from this.  Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, retired now,  but he still takes active job in participating with the company's future.   He would always push the edgiest stuff possible because we're talking about  it, folks, and that's part of the reason they did it, right?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Nike's sales were down and they needed to do something.  Please  don't groan.  But Phil Knight and Nike are throwing a Hail Mary with Colin  Kaepernick.  They needed to become a conversation piece again.  And they  have succeeded at that.  It was a marketing ploy.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  And we are talking about them.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes, and so is President Trump.  It might be good for Nike, but  for the NFL to pick this one man.  Nike supplies the NFL with uniforms,  too.  We will not hear the last from Donald Trump.  </p><p>ASMAN:  We are a month away from baseball season.  I will spend a lot of  months wishing we were back in it or at least hoping that we get there  soon.</p><p>Thank you, folks.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Two months.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Appreciate it.</p><p>We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  And it is time for the \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week.</p><p>Kim, first to you.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  David, this is a hit for Senator John Kyle, who has agreed to  temporarily fill the seat of the recently departed John McCain.  Senator  Kyle was in the Senate for 18 years.  He's immensely respected.  He left in  2013 well before the Trump hoopla.  He likely has no interest coming back  to do that.  And he says he's not going to do it long term.  He said he  wanted to see that business got done.  That's something that we should  admire him for, especially in light of the circus we saw there this week.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes, it was an inspired pick.  And Cindy McCain, by the way, gave  her approval to it as well.  </p><p>James, hits or misses?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  David, we have been talking about how all players stand for the  anthem this weekend.  I would like to salute another group of people at the  game who will be both sitting and standing.  Those are American tailgaters  who really haven't gotten enough credit for all the innovations in recent  years.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Like?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  You have gone from a few sandwiches and a cooler and maybe a  thermos of coffee to amazing multi-course grilling, couches, even satellite  television at some tailgates.  It's been exciting.  </p><p>ASMAN:  We wish them the very best.  </p><p>Bill, what do you have?  </p><p>MCGURN:  A hit to Britain, which, this week, charged two Russians with  poisoning an ex-Russian spy and his daughter on British soil earlier this  year.  The spy who was poison was hit with nerve agent.  It also  inadvertently killed a British woman who accidentally came in contact with  it.  The British are not likely to get the two men that they've accused,  but Britain's security minister puts the blames squarely on Vladimir Putin  and he warns that Britain will respond with both overt and covert measures.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Wow.</p><p>All right, Dan?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, David, I'm going to get hit to Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell, who doesn't get that many hits these days as a matter of  fact.  </p><p>ASMAN:  No.</p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, he and the Senate have just recently confirmed Donald  Trump's 60th judicial nominee, adding 33 to the district court and 26  appellate court nominees.  One of President Trump's primary promises during  the campaign and Mitch McConnell is delivering on it.  </p><p>ASMAN:  It's extraordinary when you think where they came from.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.</p><p>ASMAN:  They were so far behind and they've caught up and now exceeded the  normal.  </p><p>Thank you, everybody.  That was a great show.</p><p>Remember, if you have your own \"Hits &amp; Misses,\" be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.</p><p>That's it for the show this week.  I'm David Asman.  You can catch me on  the weekdays on \"After the Bell\" on the FOX Business Network, at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern time.  Paul is back next week.  We hope to see you then. </p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

KAMALA HARRIS, (D), CALIFORNIA:  Judge Kavanaugh, I am concerned  whether you would treat every American equally or, instead, show allegiance  to the political party and the conservative agenda that has shaped and  built your career.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D), CONNECTICUT:  We are in unchartered territory  here.  It is unprecedented for a Supreme Court nominee to be named by a  president who is an unindicted co-conspirator.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D), NEW JERSEY:  I sincerely believe that the public  deserves to know this nominee's record.  In this particular case, his  record on issues of race and the law.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an \"I am  Spartacus\" moment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST:  More on that in a moment.</p><p>Welcome to the JOURNAL: EDITORIAL REPORT.  I'm David Asman, in for Bob  Gigot.</p><p>That was just a taste of this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee,  Brett Kavanaugh, who faced, at times, hysterical grilling from Democrats,  from anything from abortion rights to presidential powers.  The hearings  also looking a lot like the kickoff of the 2020 Democratic presidential  campaign.  But the party's base is apparently not pleased with how the  Kavanaugh resistance is going.  More than a dozen progressive groups  releasing a letter on Wednesday accusing Senate Minority Leader Chuck  Schumer of, quote, \"failing\" in his efforts to stop the confirmation of  President Trump's second Supreme Court pick.  </p><p>Let's bring in the panel.  We have \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and  deputy editor, Dan Henninger, Columnists Kim Strassel and Bill McGurn, and  assistance editorial page editor, James Freeman.  </p><p>Good to have you all here.</p><p>Dan, let me start with the Spartacus moment, as he, himself, described it.   Senator Cory Booker, turned out, his willingness to fall on the sword, as  he was putting it, was all an act, that he had permission to release the  papers that he claimed he was going to release in a very self-sacrificing  mode.  He had permission to release those the night before.  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIT &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  Yes, we all remember Kirk Douglas  in \"Spartacus.\"  Cory Booker was about as far as you can get from the  bravery of that movie.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>He's running for president.  But you know, it was one thing after another.   It was Cory Booker or Kamala Harris, who is probably also running for  president.  David, people complain all of the time about the degree of  polarization and partisanship in our politics, and they ask, where is it  coming from.  We had a two-day display by the Democrats on the committee on  what the basis of this partisanship and polarization is.  It was  relentless.  There was absolutely no effort to engage the nominee in  anything serious.  It was once speech after another.  Senator Blumenthal  calling the president an unindicted co-conspirator. </p><p>ASMAN:  Which is not true.</p><p>HENNINGER:  It is not true.  So the parties have just been driven that far  apart and there's no way to see them come together after a display like  that.  </p><p>ASMAN:  But, Bill, it was so transparent.  There is a difference between  taking a stand and grandstanding, and I think Americans saw the difference.  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Yes, and I think you hinted at it in the  introduction.  For most Americans, this was a hearing about a Supreme Court  nominee.  For the Democrats, especially Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, this  was the first primary of the 2020 season.  </p><p>Look, the progressives that complained, the groups, they actually  specifically claimed to Chuck Schumer that he was a bad leader because he  hadn't got all Democrats to vote no.  The problem is, even if you've got  all Democrats to vote no, Brett Kavanaugh is still going to be confirmed  because this is a lot of sound and fury signifying one thing, they don't  have the votes.  </p><p>ASMAN:  James, I'm wondering if they would have been better off doing what  some had said they should have done, which was just walking out at the  beginning of the hearings.  They could have spared not only themselves  embarrassment but the rest of us a lot of our time.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Well, I think if they  declined to participate in the U.S. Senate, they may invite a change in the  rules, which allows Mitch McConnell's majority to have even more freedom of  action.  </p><p>But I would like to speak up for Mr. Booker and grandstanding in general  here.  I think we have been so concerned about Democratic politicians  drifting toward the Bernie Sanders left, embracing truly radical policy  positions, but this is kind of nice if he's just pretending to be radical.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I think that's better for the country than someone who is actually radical.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Well, it may be.  On the other hand, I don't know if hysteria is  good at all for anybody.</p><p>Kim, there was this sense of a hysterical tone during some of the hearing  here.  And I'm getting a sense and a lot of it is because there's so much  disappoint on the part of Democrats that they're not getting things that  they thought they were entitled to.  Starting with the election, they  thought they were entitled to have the election.  Then the Russian  collusion story, they thought they had that nailed down.  And of course,  Supreme Court justices, and ultimately an impeachment.  That's also what  they think they're entitled to.  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Well, all of that was driving this.   But it gets to the question of, what was the purpose, what were they trying  to accomplish here.  In a smarter world, they would have been trying to  attempt to persuade a couple of Republicans that is this guy wasn't  confirmable, that he shouldn't be on the court.  Of course, he is so well  qualified, that wasn't likely to happen.  Instead, they decided on  theatrics.  The question is, does those theatrics help them in any way?  It  might help Mr. Booker or Ms. Harris, who are heading themselves for a  presidential run.  But in the hearing now, what they have done elevate the  question into a litmus test, as we were talking about with the progressive  groups, and they have put their most vulnerable Senators, those who are up  for reelection this fall in states that Trump won, in an impossible  position.  Because they are upping the pressure on them to have to vote no,  and for many of them, that no vote could prove decisive and may seal their  fate in reelection bids this fall.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  Who thought it would come down to Supreme Court?  </p><p>Dan, there was a little bit of substance.  Senator Whitehouse, I believe it  was, tried to prove that a lot of Kavanaugh's decisions were based on  personal prejudice, whether it dealt with an abortion decision, an under- age immigrant or certain business decisions he made because he was so- called pro-business.  That was rejoined by Senator Cornyn, who came in and  found -- explained that this is a man who was right in the heart of  Washington, D.C., during 9/11.  He was evacuated from the White House along  with other Bush members, the Bush administration.  And yet, at one point he  was -- he had to decide on the fate of Osama bin Laden's driver.  I think  his name was Hamdi (ph).  And he actually ruled in favor of Hamdi (ph) in  that decision, despite his personal background on 9/11.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.  One of the primary reasons that Brett Kavanaugh was  nominated was the quality of his legal mind.  And he made it clear in  answering questions like that by citing specific precedence that were basis  of opinions that these results were not because of his personal prejudices  on any of the issues, but because the law prescribed.  And that's the  definition of an Originalist and that's why Brett Kavanaugh is ascending to  the Supreme Court.  </p><p>ASMAN:  I will tell you that Hamdi (ph) decision is a perfect example of  that.  </p><p>Still ahead, we are going to be talking to President Trump's chief economic  adviser.  Larry Kudlow is going to be here to talk about another strong  job's report this week.  </p><p>But, first, questions of presidential power taking center stage in this  week's Supreme Court hearings amid talk of presidential subpoenas and  pardons in the Mueller probe.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D), CALIFORNIA:  Let me just ask you this.  Can a  sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FEINSTEIN:  Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena?  </p><p>BRETT KAVANAUGH, U.S. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE:  I can't give you an answer on  that hypothetical question.  </p><p>FEINSTEIN:  You can't give me an answer on whether a president has to  respond to a subpoena from a court of law?  </p><p>KAVANAUGH:  Each of the eight judges currently sitting on the Supreme  Court, when they are sitting in my seat, declined to decide potential  hypothetical cases.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  Questions of presidential power taking center stage with this  week's hearings with Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, refusing to  say whether he believes a sitting president can be subpoena.  The hot- button issue as lawyers for President Trump continue to negotiate with  Special Counsel Robert Mueller over the terms of a potential interview in  the ongoing probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Former Justice Department prosecutor, James Trusty, joins me now.</p><p>Good to see you, Jim.  Thank you for being here.  </p><p>JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTOR:  Sure.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Obviously, he's been charged, Kavanaugh, as being appointed or  being nominated specifically because he's seen as being favorable to the  executive.  Did you get a sense one way or the other whether Democrats hit  a sore spot this week?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  No, I think it's pretty well established at this point that a  Supreme Court nominee is not going to give their final formulated opinions  about whether they would get on hot-button issues.  I think Judge Kavanaugh  was entirely within his rights to basically beg off answering the question.   The funny question is it's a difficult question even if you had the  restriction.  It's not clear that a sitting president should be subjected  to a subpoena.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Right.  I think because of all of the suspicion the Democrats have  put out there about this, he did seem to say that -- that there was --  there were moments at which judicial power was much stronger than executive  power and where the executive had to give in because the rule of law  affects everybody even if you're president.  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Yes, Judge Kavanaugh has a lengthy record of court opinions.  He  also has old, you know, law review articles where he specifically talks  about the fact that there are going to be times in our country's history  where an independent counsel or a special counsel is going to be needed.   He recognizes that there's limits on all three branches of government and  articulates it in a pretty clear and pretty well-spoken way.  </p><p>ASMAN:  You mentioned the subpoena.  What about the power to indict a  president?  Do you think that that could be in the mix during his term as  Supreme Court justice?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Well, it certainly could be in the mix.  Remember, at this point,  the president has only been identified as a subject.</p><p>ASMAN:  Sure.</p><p>TRUSTY:  So it doesn't look like it's red hot that he's about to face  indictment.  But again, the founding fathers may not have anticipated that  exactly issue, or maybe they did, but the Constitution doesn't make it 100  percent clear whether a sitting president can be indicted or not.  It at  least suggests to a lot of people that the political fallout from criminal  activity ends up in impeachment proceedings, not with separate criminal  prosecutions brought by individual prosecutors.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Notwithstanding all of the fireworks that went on this week, and  there were quite a few, what -- did you get a better sense of what kind of  justice you think Mr. Kavanaugh is going to be?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Well, you know, I look at it more as a lawyer than a partisan.</p><p>ASMAN:  Sure.</p><p>TRUSTY:  And I think the guy is pretty impressive.  I mean, he comes off  very measured, very judicious in his temperament.  He's citing Federalist  Papers like I might cite a \"Family Guys\" episode.  He definitely knows his  history of this country and its jurisprudence.  And I don't think you can  realistically say that he's been caught up or trapped or hurt in any way  politically or elsewise.  I think he comes off as a pretty smooth operator,  a pretty good judge.  And I can't see anybody really changing their minds  through this process --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  The question that I have, and I think, frankly everybody knows he's  basically conservative, but whether he's going to be a moderate  conservative, the Kennedy style, or a hard-nosed Libertarian like Scalia  was.  Any sense there from what he said this week?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  No, I think it's a wait and see.  But, you know, that's kind of  the beauty of this process in a weird way.  It's nice to have judges where  you can't predict with absolute certainty where they are going to go.  And  I take him at his word when he says he waits for the dispute to be  crystallized in front of him, he doesn't prejudge anything.  That's really  what we want from a judge at any level.  </p><p>ASMAN:  He does have strong record in terms of business decisions, arguing  against government regulators who might have overstepped their bounds,  which they very often do, these bureaucrats.  He has more than 70 decisions  in which he sided against the government regulators.  Does that give you a  sense that he is going to be more pro-business than perhaps a lot of the  justices?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  It certainly gives you that opening prediction.  But everything  can change when they go back into chambers, and that's what you really  don't know, is exactly how persuasive will be the people who may not be  like-minded or whether he feels additional strength in that position from  some of his colleagues.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.</p><p>TRUSTY:  And so, you know, at end of the day, you can guess a little bit  and you can say that he looks like he might be pro-business, anti- regulatory, but how that actually plays out in the individual case is yet  to be seen.  </p><p>ASMAN:  And, Jim, finally, you had the unenviable job, as prosecutors and  lawyers do, of trying to talk to juries about legal decisions, which is  very difficult because sometimes legal decisions are filled with all kinds  of stuff that -- that normal people can't understand, only you lawyers can.   I think that he cut through a lot of that.  And that's one of the jobs of  the Supreme Court is to cut through the legal jargon and go directly to the  American people and say, this is what makes sense based on the decision.  I  sense that he has that ability, did you?  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Yes, I think his history and just the way he speaks at either  nominations or now confirmation hearings makes it clear that he's got a  little bit of a teacher in him, which is a good quality for an attorney.   It means that he can take something that's very complex and break it down  into the basic building blocks in a way that's either persuasive or  instructive or humorous or all the above.  So I think that's a real skill  for any justice to have and any attorney to have.  </p><p>ASMAN:  James Trusty.  Great to see you, Jim.  </p><p>TRUSTY:  Sure.</p><p>ASMAN:  Thank you very much for being here.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Still ahead, President Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow,  joining the show.  </p><p>But, first, claims of chaos in the West Wing.  So how should the president  respond to this week's \"New York Times\" op-ed and a forthcoming book about  his White House as well?  We ask our panel, coming next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The failing \"New York Times\"  has an anonymous editorial.  Can you believe it?  Anonymous, meaning  gutless, a gutless editorial.  We are doing a great job.  The poll numbers  are through the roof.  Our poll numbers are great.  And guess what, nobody  is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because of what we've done.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  President Trump on Wednesday touting his administration's  accomplishments amid opposition claims of an uprising that is boiling up  within his administration.  One specific charge coming from this anonymous  author of a \"New York Times\" op-ed claiming to be a rebellious senior  member of the administration.  All this, just ahead of the release of new  book of \"Washington Post\" reporter, Bob Woodward.  So is this a White House  with an internal rebellion going on?  </p><p>All right, Bill, you worked in the Bush administration.  There's always  discontent.  I've talked to people in administrations.  I don't know if I  talked to you in the administration.</p><p>MCGURN:  And malcontents.</p><p>ASMAN:  And malcontents.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But this goes way beyond that?  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes.  In some sense, this is no different from the game most days  in the West Wing.  When you look at the \"Washington Post\" and you try to  figure out which of the colleagues leaked the story that he shouldn't have  done, right, this takes it to the end degree.  It is extraordinary the  claims that -- look, when you work for a president, you have to decide, are  you for him or against him, can you stomach all the things.  Because I  wrote a lot of pro ethanol speeches, you know, for my sins, but I supported  president Bush on the war and larger issues, the economy and life and so  forth.  And if you can't serve a president honestly, I think, the course is  an honorable resignation.  And for a man to say, I'm a staffer and I'm  steering the president in the right direction, well, the American people  get to make that decision --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGURN:  -- at the election.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Kim, also in terms of the impact on President Trump, it might  actually turn out to be a positive because this kind of -- this kind of  holds up, bolsters his point that there's the deep state against him within  the bureaucracy.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  Well, that, too.  And also the fact that, you know, when you  read this op-ed, it's very easy to doubt the sincerity of the writer.   Look, because if he or she was doing as they claim they are, that they are  there to try to keep the president in check and temper his worst  inclinations, why would you go write op-ed that's waving a red flag in  front of a bull --</p><p>ASMAN:  Precisely.</p><p>STRASSEL:  -- and cause all the more outburst.  Of course, you would  quietly continue on your way doing what you've been doing instead of  flagging it publicly.  So it looks insincere.  As you said, it does - it  will -- his supporters -- he's mentioning it, getting huge applause lines  when he talks about how he's fighting not just Democrats in Washington but  even within his own administration.  He has to take them all on.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Right, right.</p><p>And, James, then there is the switch, the focus of the \"New York Times\"  itself publishing this thing, an anonymous source with a lead editorial  like this, what do you think of that?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I guess we should applaud them for this time putting them  in opinion pages rather than the -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ASMAN:  Rather than - although, it was on the front page, but that's  another story.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Anonymous insults of the president, I don't really see the value  of this.  I think --</p><p>ASMAN:  Is it journalism?  I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the editor, even of  an editorial page, have to respect the viewer enough to share with them  details of who is writing the piece.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Generally, if you're going to allow this kind of anonymous shot,  it is for a -- an extreme very-specific circumstance, an Iranian dissident  who will be shot if their identity is revealed.  Someone else in a  situation where the only way that the truth can come out is by concealing  the identity.  I don't see how that applies here.  And the underlying truth  is kind of a nothing story.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  In the 90's, there was a time when the \"Wall Street Journal\" had  the editorial of woman who had been raped and did not want to be identified  for obvious reasons.  There are these moments.  But this does not seem to  be one of them.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes, and I think the American public is increasingly mystified  by what is going on.  What is going on, David, is this is basically the  seven-year's war between the Washington press corps and President Trump.   It's like the press has surrounded the White House.  They have the  catapults set up.  They are throwing boiling water and oil in there all of  the time.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The president is firing back at them.  And people are saying, what the heck  is going on.   We thought the press was supposed to report the news.  All  they report on is Donald Trump and his ragings.  </p><p>Look, any White House is going to have a president who says things that the  administration officials don't carry out.  Lyndon Johnson was famous for  that.  Richard Nixon was famous for that.  This is no different.  But as  Larry Kudlow is pointing out in the show, you've got an administration  that, policy-wise, is having a lot of success, despite what this anonymous  writer is saying.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  That's got to be the last word.</p><p>Still ahead, a better-than-expected job's report giving Republicans more  economic news to run on in the midterms.  As we just heard from Dan, we  will be talking next to White House chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow.   That is next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Thanks to Republican leadership, our economy is booming like never  before in our history.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX HOST:  More really good news for the U.S. economy with  employers adding a better-than-expected 201,000 jobs in August.  This, as  yearly wage growth hits a nine-year high.</p><p>Let's bring in White House chief economic adviser and good friend, Larry  Kudlow.</p><p>Larry, congratulations.</p><p>What would you say the headline of the story is today?  </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER:  You know, I think here  is the broader headline, the single biggest news story in 2018 by far is an  economic boom that almost everyone believed to be impossible.  That, to me,  is the story, not all this other stuff that pops up periodically.  The  economy is booming on all cylinders.  There's been a big change in policy  and attitude and confidence.  </p><p>And let me add to that, this is -- this is middle-class-working folks,  better paychecks-kind of stuff.  And it's not over.  It's not one quarter  or two quarters.  Every reading I have -- I used to do it for a living --  it's going to go on for quite some time.  That's the story, David, an  economic boom folks said couldn't happen.  </p><p>ASMAN:  It is extraordinary.  When you look back at some of the comments --  I mean, Paul Krugman, on the night of the election, suggesting that we were  going to go into a crisis that we never recover from.  But after the tax  cut was put forth, you had Nancy Pelosi saying it was going to lead to an  economic apocalypse.  All the predictions.  I mean, there are political  ramifications to this economic success that you have.  I mean, you have to  recognize that.  You have played both sides of that coin.  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't want to politicize this.  Here is what I want to say  -- you can buy my book or not -- JFK, the Democrat, lowered marginal tax  rates, kept the dollar sound, minimized regulations, and we had a seven or  eight-year boom without inflation.  Years later, Ronald Reagan, a former  Democrat, then Republican, followed JFK's advice, incentivized the economy  with lower marginal rates, keep the dollar sound, minimize regulations.   These are different individuals.  I'm not here to say that President Trump  is like Ronald Reagan or like JFK, except he is following a very similar  economic policy path, and it is working as the others worked.  We wrote  about this.  So we will see.  I know I have critics, I know there are folks  who don't agree, and I respect their point of view.  But that model, OK,  low tax rates, sound money, less regulation, et cetera, we've all talked  about this for a long time, it appears to be working.  And at the very  least -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, it's not rocket science.  You are one of the smartest people  I know, as are a lot of the people you work with.  But it's not rocket  science.  It's very simple.  You make it cheaper for businesses to do  business and you will have more business.  You make it cheaper by  deregulation, lowering taxes, onerous taxes, and -- and you do the right  things and business will respond.  Incentives matter.  That's the simple  message, no?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  It is.  Art Laffer was in yesterday.  He spoke to our NEC cabinet  lunch.  He also spoke, I don't know, 20 or 25 minutes with the president,  walking through a lot of these themes.  I know, you know, President Trump,  there's all kinds controversies.  We can get into that if you care to.  All  I'm saying is the president, from day one, has followed sound economic  policies, and the growth effects are kicking in.  Again, at the risk of  being -- 2018, the big story, not -- not phony editorials in the \"New York  Times.\"  I'm sorry.  It's an economic boom and the recovery of the United  States, and that includes the recovery of the middle class.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Let me ask about one thing that some critics are harping on, that  the labor force participation did come down a little bit.  Does that bother  you?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  No, but it has more room to rise and we are keeping an eye on  that.  And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Why do you think it went down?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  On a month-to-month basis, it's impossible to tell.  </p><p>ASMAN:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I would only suggest this, part of that calculation is wages.  And  we are seeing improvement in wages.  Very important, middle-income wages.   In the report today, average hourly earnings up 2.9 for the 12 months.  Our  Kevin Hassett, from the C.A., did a terrific study to  recalculate.  After  taxes, after inflation and benefits, and so forth, real wages for worker  much stronger --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN:  Household income is up and the attitude of people, the people feel  more comfortable going out and buying things, which also helps the economy.   I just want to ask you something a little -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Confidence, just one quickie on that.  </p><p>ASMAN:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The confidence thing is phenomenal.  And that has to do with the  change.  We are not punishing business and investors right now and we are  promoting entrepreneurship.  Inside the numbers -- I don't want to get into  the weeds but you guys are weed people.  You look at those numbers today,  average hourly earnings, yes, up 2.9 percent, terrific.  But to do that  right, David, for working folks, you to multiply that times hours worked.   And so what you've got, on a 12-month basis, is a 5 percent increase, OK,  in middle-class wages, 5 percent.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Very good.  Very important.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I just knocked out 2 percent inflation.  </p><p>ASMAN:  I have 30 seconds, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes.</p><p>ASMAN:  I have to hit on one thing that's beyond our borders, down in  Argentina.  A country that you and I visited together once many years ago.   We love it.  They are in deep trouble.  They've had to go to IMF in order  to get an emergency loan for the trouble they're in.  The IMF has demanded  that, in exchange for their loan, they have to raise their export taxes,  which is going to hurt their economy.  I know the Argentines.  I know some  of the people in the government.  They hate IMF's medicine.  They actually  hate IMF to be honest.  They would much rather be dealing with the U.S.  Treasury in some form.  Is there any chance that that could happen?  </p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes.  The treasury is deeply involved in this discussion, deeply  involved, which is a great thing.  And as you and I learned, and others,  the only way out of Argentina's dilemma is to set up currency board, the  peso links to the dollar, but you can create a single new peso.  No money  creation unless you have a dollar reserve behind it.  That worked in the  90's.  It brought down inflation and kept prosperity.  That's what they  need to do it again.  And you know what, Treasury Department people are on  it.  They are on it, David.  So keep hope alive on that point.  </p><p>ASMAN:  There's hope for Argentina.  That's great to hear.</p><p>Larry, great to see you.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN:  Great to see you doing so well.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thanks you.</p><p>ASMAN:  God bless you.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>ASMAN:  And God bless your heart.  I know you had a little issue but it's  all over now.  Thank you, my friend.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Still ahead, amid accusations of anti-competitive behavior and political  bias, Twitter and Facebook executives face a grilling on Capitol Hill.  So  can government regulation of big tech be far behind?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER:  I want to start by making something very clear.   We don't consider political viewpoints, perspectives, or party affiliation  in any of our policies or enforcement decisions, period.  Impartiality is  our guiding principle.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASMAN:  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey defending himself this week against  accusations of political bias.  Twitter and Facebook executives were  grilled on Capitol Hill on Wednesday amid the growing debate over whether  conservative viewpoints are suppressed on social media platforms and  in  search functions.  </p><p>The Justice Department announced on Wednesday that Jeff Sessions will meet  with state attorneys general later this month to discuss concerns that tech  companies may be, quote, \"intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas  on their platforms.\"</p><p>Well, James, the market didn't think much of Mr. Dorsey's comments because  Twitter was way down on the day that he testified.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSITANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR:  Yes, and I'm not sure any  of us should think too much of them.  They have had to change the algorithm  that they wrote with their opinions that was exerting some bias against  conservatives.  But I don't think Jeff Sessions has the right idea either.   There's a problem here.  There's an extreme left-wing bias among a lot of  these Silicon Valley companies.  But I think there's a market solution.   And I think the real danger here is if you get a deal with Silicon Valley  giants and Washington politicians to make the Federal Trade Commission some  giant Internet regulator.  I think we would all regret it forever.  So I  hope that's not where this is going.</p><p>ASMAN:  I think you may be right.  </p><p>Well, Kim, the bias does appear to be real.  Congressman Jim Jordan and  others were talking about how they were shadow banned by Twitter, an  expression that means a way that they can ban, kind of a subtle banning of  what they do.  What should government do, if anything?  The president,  himself, said earlier that he doesn't want regulation of the Internet, but  he says he wants things to change.  How do you change things if you don't  regulate?  </p><p>KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST:  Well, look, one thing is keeping  attention on it, like they did with the hearings, which in my mind is the  best way forward.  If there's enough pressure on them, they will  eventually, hopefully, change their practices before government acts.  But  history shows that if they don't act on their own, the American people will  ask government to do it, and they will find themselves in a much more worse  situation if that's where they end up.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Dan, there's competition.  To James point, you don't have to go to  Google.  By the way, Google was a no-show at the conference.  They didn't  show up at all because they wanted to present a secondary figure.  The  Senators wanted somebody more primary.  But you can go to Bing.  Bing is  owned by Microsoft, a competitor to Google.  And I, for what it's worth,  when I put in a search request with Bing, they are different from the  search responses you get from Google.  I think a little less biased.  </p><p>DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST &amp; DEPUTY EDITOR:  Well, I don't know.  I mean,  Google and Facebook control the markets they're in.  If you can put a  search term in Google, the algorithm immediately goes through billions of  web pages.  Facebook has billions of users.  These two companies have got  their arms around the ocean.  It's like trying to regulate or control the  movement of the waves in the ocean.  And they have got to come to grips  with the fact that, on the one hand, they have the huge unprecedentedly  large companies making extraordinary amounts of money off politics and off  the news, and they can't just stand there and say, we are nothing more than  a conveyer belt funneling all of this stuff out with neutral algorithms,  because nobody believes that entirely.  </p><p>ASMAN:  They are different.</p><p>Bill, we have the whole Alex Jones thing, which he has been banned for life  -- a term I haven't heard since Soviet Union existed -- from Twitter.  Fair  enough, this is not a government.  This is a private company and they can  do what they want.  But it shows a certain contempt for the concept of  freedom of thought and freedom of speech.  </p><p>BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST:  Well, look, I'm less concerned about Alex Jones.   And one of the problems I think they have is, if you rely on human judgment  for a lot of this, it's beyond their control.  These algorithms, you may be  aiming at Alex Jones and hit others.  I will give you a perfect example.   Elizabeth Heng is Republican running in California, family were refugees  from Cambodia.  She put up a campaign ad talking about her parents fleeing  the killing fields and it was banned by both Twitter and Facebook as  offensive or inappropriate content.  That's the problem.  A lot of  conservatives get hit by this.  I agree, I don't want the federal  government regulating them, but I think that they will have to answer to  this.  </p><p>ASMAN:  And 30 seconds with the answer, James?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  A lot of it is the courts just implementing existing law.   They've interpreted this shield they have on the premise, a liability  shield on the premise that they are just neutral operators of the tech  platform.  The more they start editing, editing out some voices and not  others, the more legal problem they should have.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>Gentlemen, lady, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, Nike courts controversy with the choice of Colin  Kaepernick as the new face of its marketing campaign.  Our panel's thoughts  on that and the politics surrounding the NFL's new season, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  As the NFL kicked off its regular season on Thursday night, all  eyes were on the commercial breaks with Nike launching an ad featuring  Colin Kaepernick as the new face of its \"Just Do It\" campaign.  Nike's  choice of Kaepernick, who set off the wave of kneeling protests in the NFL,  has caused an outcry with some even burning Nike shoes and sportswear in  protest.</p><p>President Trump weighed in on the controversial pick Wednesday tweeting  out, quote, \"Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone way down, Nike is  getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.  I wonder if they had  any idea that it would be this way.  As far as the NFL is concerned, I find  it hard to watch, and I always will until they stand for the flag.\"  </p><p>And, Dan, this vindicates you.  You had a piece, months and months ago,  saying that baseball is the only all-American sport we have left.  Does  this prove that?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Absolutely.  It's the only apolitical sport we have.  Does  Donald Trump tweet about baseball players?  Not at all.  I mean -- </p><p>ASMAN:  That's a good point.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  -- we spent this entire program talking about politics, the war  between the \"New York Times\" and Donald Trump.  By Sunday afternoon, what  do most of us want to do?  Just sit down and watch a good athletic contest  and not be exposed to the politics of these NFL players and fighting with  the president of the United States.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Bill, to be picky, this ad campaign says that he sacrificed nothing  to stand up for what he believes in.  He got paid millions.  We don't know  how much.  He got paid a lot of money for this.  </p><p>MCGURN:  It makes me wonder whether Nike has within its ranks the senior  executives and anonymous trying to do Donald Trump's work.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Look, they are betting that their audience is more woke and they'll have  younger audience.  There's a morning consult poll that showed his  favorability was down, even in groups targeted, Millennials and African- Americans and so forth.  There's a lot of history of companies getting  edgier than their customers.  So we'll see in the end.</p><p>ASMAN:  And this guy, James, as a role model.  The fact is he was a losing  quarterback.  He had terrible seasons.  He was on his way out as a starting  quarterback anyway.  This is a time when he decided to make his move.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  He had some good years, too.  He's certainly a talented guy.</p><p>Just to Dan's point about being able to enjoy a game on a Sunday, and I  think without a lot of the politics brought in, I think people actually do  prefer football.  I know I do.  And I think maybe this is -- this is the  way back to that, where this wasn't a highly political or radical ad.  It  was really Kaepernick sort of standing up for a bunch of underdogs and  maybe this is the beginning of the end of the controversy.  </p><p>ASMAN:  But you know, Kim, I can't get beyond those socks.  It's very  simple for me.  I don't like anybody kneeling for the flag, certainly.   I've got a son in the military.  But the socks that he wore that portray  cops as pigs, that was what just did it for me.  I can't even look at the  guy anymore.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  No, and a lot of people who look at this ad are going to be put  off by it.  It's probably going to put more people off of watching the NFL.   That's one of the league's problems.  Ratings have been falling.  It's  predicted to fall again this year.  You kind of have to wonder if they  don't wish they had done what George Steinbrenner did for the Yankees in  the '70s when he set up his \"no facial-hair\" policy and there was no  arguing with it.  You want to play for the Yankees, this is what you're  going to do.  One and done and get it over with.  Because this just keeps  dragging on and it's not helping the NFL or the players.  </p><p>ASMAN:  You bring up a great point, Kim.  You're an employee.  You're an  employee.  It's not the question of citizenship.  It's a question of what  you have to do in order to stay and play.  </p><p>There's the question of whether Nike is -- may in the end, some people say,  could benefit from this.  Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, retired now,  but he still takes active job in participating with the company's future.   He would always push the edgiest stuff possible because we're talking about  it, folks, and that's part of the reason they did it, right?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Nike's sales were down and they needed to do something.  Please  don't groan.  But Phil Knight and Nike are throwing a Hail Mary with Colin  Kaepernick.  They needed to become a conversation piece again.  And they  have succeeded at that.  It was a marketing ploy.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes.  And we are talking about them.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Yes, and so is President Trump.  It might be good for Nike, but  for the NFL to pick this one man.  Nike supplies the NFL with uniforms,  too.  We will not hear the last from Donald Trump.  </p><p>ASMAN:  We are a month away from baseball season.  I will spend a lot of  months wishing we were back in it or at least hoping that we get there  soon.</p><p>Thank you, folks.  </p><p>MCGURN:  Two months.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Appreciate it.</p><p>We have to take one more break.  When we come back, \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the  week.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASMAN:  And it is time for the \"Hits &amp; Misses\" of the week.</p><p>Kim, first to you.  </p><p>STRASSEL:  David, this is a hit for Senator John Kyle, who has agreed to  temporarily fill the seat of the recently departed John McCain.  Senator  Kyle was in the Senate for 18 years.  He's immensely respected.  He left in  2013 well before the Trump hoopla.  He likely has no interest coming back  to do that.  And he says he's not going to do it long term.  He said he  wanted to see that business got done.  That's something that we should  admire him for, especially in light of the circus we saw there this week.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Yes, it was an inspired pick.  And Cindy McCain, by the way, gave  her approval to it as well.  </p><p>James, hits or misses?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  David, we have been talking about how all players stand for the  anthem this weekend.  I would like to salute another group of people at the  game who will be both sitting and standing.  Those are American tailgaters  who really haven't gotten enough credit for all the innovations in recent  years.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Like?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  You have gone from a few sandwiches and a cooler and maybe a  thermos of coffee to amazing multi-course grilling, couches, even satellite  television at some tailgates.  It's been exciting.  </p><p>ASMAN:  We wish them the very best.  </p><p>Bill, what do you have?  </p><p>MCGURN:  A hit to Britain, which, this week, charged two Russians with  poisoning an ex-Russian spy and his daughter on British soil earlier this  year.  The spy who was poison was hit with nerve agent.  It also  inadvertently killed a British woman who accidentally came in contact with  it.  The British are not likely to get the two men that they've accused,  but Britain's security minister puts the blames squarely on Vladimir Putin  and he warns that Britain will respond with both overt and covert measures.  </p><p>ASMAN:  Wow.</p><p>All right, Dan?  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, David, I'm going to get hit to Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell, who doesn't get that many hits these days as a matter of  fact.  </p><p>ASMAN:  No.</p><p>HENNINGER:  Well, he and the Senate have just recently confirmed Donald  Trump's 60th judicial nominee, adding 33 to the district court and 26  appellate court nominees.  One of President Trump's primary promises during  the campaign and Mitch McConnell is delivering on it.  </p><p>ASMAN:  It's extraordinary when you think where they came from.  </p><p>HENNINGER:  Yes.</p><p>ASMAN:  They were so far behind and they've caught up and now exceeded the  normal.  </p><p>Thank you, everybody.  That was a great show.</p><p>Remember, if you have your own \"Hits &amp; Misses,\" be sure to tweet it to us,  @JERonFNC.</p><p>That's it for the show this week.  I'm David Asman.  You can catch me on  the weekdays on \"After the Bell\" on the FOX Business Network, at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern time.  Paul is back next week.  We hope to see you then. </p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

A shockingly weekjobs report is out this morning and now there's debate over whetherit's a blip or a warning.  They Labor Department says the economyadded only 20,000 new jobs in February.  That's an anemic in any caseespecially given months of more robust hiring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is just a month and there's no doubt temporary factors like badweather and the partial government shutdown played a role in thesenumbers, and there are silver linings in the new report.  Theunemployment rate still remarkably low, 3.8 percent.  And year to yeargrowth in wages, pretty solid.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, because jobs growth was so far below expectations, this reportraises questions about whether this is just a speed bump or if theeconomy is heading into a stretch of slower growth.</p><p>Among those hoping this is just a blip, a president gearing up for are-election campaign that is anchored on the theme that he has revvedthe American economy into high gear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've seen wages risemore than they have at any time for a long, long time because theeconomy is very, very strong.  If you look at the stock market overthe last few months, it's been great.  And certainly, since myelection, it's getting close to 50 percent.</p><p>As soon as these trade deals are done, if they get done and we'reworking with China, we'll see what happens but I think you're going tosee a very big spike.</p><p>The unemployment rate just went lower.  We're down now to 3.8 percentso we have very good news on that.  I think the big news, really, wasthat wages went up and that's great for the American workers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  Alison Kosik gets us started with a walk through the numbers.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  A big surprise John with theFebruary jobs report.  Only 20,000 jobs were added to the economy inFebruary.  While this is a surprise, not completely unexpected,because if you see how the jobs numbers have been over the past yearthey've been averaging 234,000 jobs added monthly for a year.</p><p>So there's only so long the jobs market can add that many jobs when weknow that the unemployment rate, as we've learned today, is sitting at3.8 percent.  That's a drop from four percent.  We did see theunemployment rate tick higher in January in part because of thegovernment shutdown.</p><p>So what happened with the sectors in February?  We did see jobadditions in business services and health care.  But then we see thedrop off in construction, a loss of 31,000 jobs.  That gives anindication why we saw some of those job numbers go down.  In Februarywe are seeing a home sale's under pressure.</p><p>So the big question is that job numbers, the job gains of 20,000 jobsadded to the economy in February, is it a trend or is this just ablip?  Because we did see the job numbers go down in similar fashionin September of 2017, John?</p><p>KING:  Alison Kosik, thanks for the numbers breakdown.  Ana Swansonwith the New York Times joins the conversation now.  And whetheryou're the president or whether you're an American worker, that's whatyou're worried about.</p><p>Is this just that blip, they happen.  They happen.  Actually we canshow.  We did put up the job chart numbers just through the lastseveral years.  And you go back and, look, you see a couple of verylow points September 2017 the last time we were this low, but they dohappen.  And if you look at the overall picture there, that's prettygood.  Is there a rebound in the making here or are there signs ofslower growth?</p><p>ANA SWANSON, TRADE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS REPORTER, THE NEW YORKTIMES:  I would say it's probably something in the middle here.  Youknow, that was a very disappointing figure, 20,000 jobs.  The initialreaction this morning was like did someone forget to put a zero on theend of it?</p><p>But, you know, I think overall it's dangerous to interpret too muchfrom one month and it really should be viewed as more of a correctiveto the blistering job growth that we saw in December and in January.A little bit more modest of the trend there.</p><p>And overall there could be trouble on the horizon here with theeconomy.  We are seeing economies overseas, particularly China andEurope, slowing, the effect of the president's $1.5 trillion tax cutis starting to work its way through.  And then you have the ongoingtrade war and the effect of the tariffs.  And so all of this couldcome back to bite just as the 2020campaign starts to heat up here.</p><p>[12:35:05] KING:  And the campaign parts, what makes it interestingbecause we can walk through some of this.  This is sort of twoeconomies if you will if you're President Trump you have lowunemployment.  You have more jobs added, you have higher wage growth.You've been cutting taxes and regulations and you think that's givensome steroids if you want some stimulus to the economy.</p><p>On the flip side, tariffs are causing a lot of anxiety especially outin foreign states that were Trump states.  The trade deficits way up,stock markets up now but if we've had a few blips there and the globalgrowth show that you speak of.</p><p>So if you're the president and you're in this tough negotiations withChina, now there's talk that some of the President Xi no date becausethey're still talking both sides that have issues.</p><p>If you're the president, does this make you think, I want a deal, Iwant this to over with, I want the uncertainty over if I win a re-election?</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that's why thereisn't so much focus on that summit and that trade deal comingtogether.  The White House is paying very close attention to thesenumbers because they know the economy is going to be so critical totheir 2020 message.</p><p>And that's something they want to be able to tout that's why you sawthe president touting the wage growth and what he did is he left theWhite House this morning.  But they are also increasingly looking tothat China-U.S. trade deal that they think they can secure.  Becausethey think if they did, that is going to be historic.</p><p>It would be monumental to President Trump's legacy while in office andthey think it would be able to help them despite what the economynumbers are when they are going into that campaign.</p><p>SEUNG MIN KIM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE WASHINTON POST:  AndRepublicans clearly, I mean after the trade deficit news came out thisweek, I've talked to Republicans on the Hill and they said, yes, ofcourse, this increases the pressure for the president to get a goodtrade deal with China later this month.</p><p>And I was talking about -- especially Republican Senators from foreignstates like we've mentioned earlier and their view on a reallyinteresting.  I mean, we're still at the point where they say, youknow, farmers do love Trump.  They support him, but they are startingto run out of patience.</p><p>I mean this is hurting their economy back home and that coulddefinitely have an impact for his re-election campaign.</p><p>KING:  So that point is from an A.P. story, Howard Hill is a hogfarmer.  We listen to a lot of voices from Washington, we shouldlisten to voices out the America more often than we do.</p><p>\"We have patients but we don't have unlimited patience.  I thinkpeople recognize particularly with China, they have not been playingby the rules for a long time.  I think producers are supportive ofChina correct these issues.  On the other hand, we don't want it to goon forever.\"</p><p>Meaning, we have to make five year plans.  You're in a farm, you makefive year and ten year plans and all these uncertainty it's freezingthat.</p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS:  Yes, themake plans, they buy equipment, they sell soybeans to China.  So they-- and they need some certainty to their jobs.  And, yes, I think I'vesay they've been very loyal to President Trump in these states.  Butthese are states the president needs for his re-election.</p><p>You know, Iowa is a key, a key state for him.  Other Ag states aregoing to be a big part of it.  And the President really has -- andevery president wants a good economy to run for re-election, but hehas really pledged that he can do the things himself.  But he is theone turbo charging that his policies, his decisions.  So if there isreally a slowdown, it's on him in a very significant way.</p><p>KING:  And to that point in the sense that we have a Democratic Houseand Republican Senate, they are not going to be in a new economicpolicy initiatives in the past before the election.  This is just notgoing to happen.</p><p>Maybe the U.S., Mexico, Canada trade agreement, that's one issue thePresident hopes to get through.  We'll see where that one goes.  Butis -- are the trade negotiations with China the biggest thing that thepresident can personally do in the sense that he can't expect to passany new legislation but he want to tweak tax cuts or do anything else,so if he's going to do anything, it's on him, right?</p><p>SWANSON:  Yes.  I think those are really under his power.  And he hasbeen very motivated to come to a deal, in part because of the stockmarket we missed that you saw at the end of last year, that's anothermetric that the President sees as a measure of his performance.</p><p>But in recent days we've actually been hearing that that summitbetween the president and President Xi Jinping of China is a littlebit less certain.  The president is also open to criticism on both theright and the left here for taking what is a bad China deal.  And itseems like they're starting to back off a little bit from thecertainty of that summit happening later this month in Mar-A-Lago.</p><p>The Chinese particularly very worried about the examples set by thepresident in Hanoi when he met Kim Jong-Un, wary of sending theirpresident across the sea just to be embarrassed if no deal was made.</p><p>KING:  And they might think of a Chinese perspective that a reportlike this might -- maybe gives him a little bit more leverage or alittle more time to hold and wait and appreciate you're coming in.Before we go to break on this International Women's Day, some words ofdetermination and inspiration from the first U.S. female fighter pilotto fly in combat went on to become United States senator.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN.

That judged (ph) that there was no collusion withRussia.  This has nothing to do with collusion.  There was nocollusion.  It's a collusion hoax, it's a collusion witch hoax (ph), Idon't collude with Russians.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  Well, the truth for those of you who care about such things isthat Manafort's trial revolved around financial crimes, not Russianconspiracy.  Judge T.S. Ellis did not consider the collusion question.But the Southbound (ph) Hollywood reporters there made sure thepresident was paying close attention to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN DOWNING, PAUL MANAFORT'S ATTORNEY:  I think most importantlywhat you saw today is the same thing that we had said from day one.There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved withany collusion, with any government official from Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  Judge Ellis sentenced Manafort to nearly four years in prisonminus time served.  That life sentence departed from the sentencingguidelines and is sparking outrage in some quarters.  To that in amoment, but first the question raised again by that public appeal fromManafort's lawyer, is the president considering a pardon?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Has the president ruled out a pardon for PaulManafort?</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR FOR THE PRESIDENT:  I didn't discuss thatwith the president.  I haven't heard him say that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  CNN's Jessica Schneider joins our conversation.  I want tostart with you on the pause.  I love the pause.  I love the pause.Very smart pause.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[12:50:00] COLLINS:  I said they were like digging for something tocome.  And then the president was asked again about it today and hesaid he's not the one who discusses his pardons, it's us who keepsbringing it in him up.  And no course behind the scenes that has beena pretty big discussion about whether or not that's something thepresident would do.  But right now what the White House is refusing todo is rule out that the president whenever grant him one, which is whypeople keep asking about it.</p><p>KING:  And Mr. Downing, Mr. Manafort's lawyer, was clearly putting itout there, shall we say, by saying once again, we please thepresident.  We're not talking about -- no Russian collusion here.</p><p>There's a lot of outrage about this sense was the judge within hisguideline?  I mean the judge can do whatever he wants.</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly.</p><p>KING:  But this is well below the guidelines.  What was the rationale?</p><p>SCHNEIDER:  Yes, the judge said it quite clearly.  He said this is ajust sentence.  And in Judge Ellis' mind, this was in fact a justsentence.  He didn't believe that the sentencing guidelines reallyspoke to what this crime was, the fact that Paul Manafort was a first-time offender here.</p><p>And Manafort's lawyers really pushed this point as well because theysubmitted several other examples of people who had stolen much morefrom the government and paid much less when it came to jail time.</p><p>They cited one woman, and this was incredible, who had $47 million inan overseas bank account.  John, I'm not kidding when I say that hersentence was five seconds.  Five seconds, it doesn't want to makesense of probation.</p><p>So that was the argument from Manafort's attorney.  Judge Ellisobviously didn't go that extreme, but they were trying to have thisparody in sentencing saying that Manafort, a first-time offender.This is it.</p><p>KING:  And the question if you're the special counsel's office do youtake this as a shock in the sense that, you know, he could've gotten20 years in prison?  He's 69 years old.  He has another sentencing inanother case next week.</p><p>So Paul Manafort's going to spend -- if not the rest of his life,pretty close for the rest of his life in prison.  But the judge didsay this early on in the trial, \"You don't really care about Mr.Manafort's bank fraud, you really care about his information Mr.Manafort could give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump or lead to hisprosecution or impeachment.\"</p><p>So, the special counsel have attest (ph) to think this judge was kindof skeptical of us from the get go.</p><p>LUCEY:  Yes.  I mean that's certainly from a lot of skepticism fromthe judge yesterday.  And I think he just wanted to note that you --this is prison time, there's going to be another sentence.  And if youthink about this in context of just how many people this case haspulled up.  I mean, it is still a wide-ranging investigation that hastouched a lot of people associated with the president.</p><p>LISA LERER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  And Ithink we're so engrossed in the details that it is important to stepback and say, look, the president's campaign manager was convicted,was sentenced to jail for bank fraud and dealings with foreigngovernments.  Like that is a big deal.In any other administration, this would be a huge deal, but I thinkwith this new cycle and this administration, the scope of thisinvestigation, a lot of these moments sort of get lost in the --</p><p>KING:  Right.  It's a -- it is stunning sometimes that the standardis, well, the president hired a swamp creature who broke the lawrepeatedly then cut a deal to cooperate and lied about it.  But thepresident says that does not reflect badly on me because you haven'tproven Russian collusion.</p><p>You've just -- you're only proving that I hired and he's only one of ahalf dozen, my guys who are swamp creatures who lied, who have cheatedand who are going to jail.</p><p>SCHNEIDER:  And to that point Judge Ellis, he did say that this trialwasn't about collusion but Judge Ellis didn't say there was nocollusion, he just said this was a trial on other matters.  This was-- Paul Manafort was convicted for tax and bank fraud.  So thepresident sort of twisting the judge's words there and saying he foundno collusion.</p><p>COLLINS:  Yes.  But for the White House that's enough.  That's the onething that they can use coming out of this to say this had nothing todo with Russian collusion which his sentence didn't but of courseyou're saying they didn't say that we have proven that there was noRussian collusion.</p><p>For the White House, the state has really changed.  Like what you'resaying, typically that the President's former campaign chairman wasconvicted of anything it's a big deal.  But for this White House, theyso much want to distance themselves.  They want to push the narrativethat it started out being about Russian collusion but it's morphedinto so many other things.  So that's going to be helpful for theirnarrative going forward.</p><p>LERER:  Any other moment in Washington this would be like a 550 alarmfire and we now you feel like it's just kind of like a little brushfire over here and then there's all this other thing.  And you really--</p><p>LUCEY:  And the president is still speaking very kindly about PaulManafort, too.  I mean today he said he feels badly for him, you know,he said it's been a hard time for him.  So, I think that's --</p><p>SCHNEIDER:  There's more to come here.  The next sentencing onWednesday in D.C. and the judge here Amy Berman Jackson, she couldthrow the book at Manafort up to 10 year sentence.</p><p>KING:  And oddly Paul Manafort has now becoming exhibit A at themoment in the Democratic argument for criminal justice who are sayingthis is just wrong, here's Cory Booker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm really ticked offabout this, but in our country we prey upon the most vulnerablecitizens in our nation, poor folks, mentally ill folks, addicted folksand overwhelmingly black and brown folks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Were you shocked that he only got 47 weeks?</p><p>BOOKER:  No, this criminal justice can't surprise me anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  It's odd that Paul Manafort in the middle of this debate.  Butthis has been an issue front and center for the Democrats in thecampaign, and the president just signed a big criminal justice reformof this.   It's actually a bipartisan agreement and the Democrats say,wait a minute.  Wait a minute, you know some black guy gets pulledover the traffic, stop (ph), that's a bag of weed, so it's going to goto prison for long than Paul Manafort.</p><p>[12:55:06] LERER:  But this is going to be an issue in the Democraticprimary black voters make of the huge portion that Democraticelectorate and the make up the majority in some key states, SouthCarolina as you will know.  So we're going to keep hearing about thistopic.</p><p>KING:  We'll continue.  Thank you all for joining us today on -- shallwe say an interesting day.  A lot happened.  I hope to see you backhere Sunday morning as well.  We'll be up early 8:00 Eastern.  Don'tgo anywhere, a lot of breaking news today including the president inAlabama.

A shockingly week jobs report is out this morning and now there's debate over whether it's a blip or a warning. They Labor Department says the economy added only 20,000 new jobs in February. That's an anemic in any case especially given months of more robust hiring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is just a month and there's no doubt temporary factors like bad weather and the partial government shutdown played a role in these numbers, and there are silver linings in the new report. The unemployment rate still remarkably low, 3.8 percent. And year to year growth in wages, pretty solid.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, because jobs growth was so far below expectations, this report raises questions about whether this is just a speed bump or if the economy is heading into a stretch of slower growth.</p><p>Among those hoping this is just a blip, a president gearing up for a re-election campaign that is anchored on the theme that he has revved the American economy into high gear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've seen wages rise more than they have at any time for a long, long time because the economy is very, very strong. If you look at the stock market over the last few months, it's been great. And certainly, since my election, it's getting close to 50 percent.</p><p>As soon as these trade deals are done, if they get done and we're working with China, we'll see what happens but I think you're going to see a very big spike.</p><p>The unemployment rate just went lower. We're down now to 3.8 percent so we have very good news on that. I think the big news, really, was that wages went up and that's great for the American workers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Alison Kosik gets us started with a walk through the numbers.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A big surprise John with the February jobs report. Only 20,000 jobs were added to the economy in February. While this is a surprise, not completely unexpected, because if you see how the jobs numbers have been over the past year they've been averaging 234,000 jobs added monthly for a year.</p><p>So there's only so long the jobs market can add that many jobs when we know that the unemployment rate, as we've learned today, is sitting at 3.8 percent. That's a drop from four percent. We did see the unemployment rate tick higher in January in part because of the government shutdown.</p><p>So what happened with the sectors in February? We did see job additions in business services and health care. But then we see the drop off in construction, a loss of 31,000 jobs. That gives an indication why we saw some of those job numbers go down. In February we are seeing a home sale's under pressure.</p><p>So the big question is that job numbers, the job gains of 20,000 jobs added to the economy in February, is it a trend or is this just a blip? Because we did see the job numbers go down in similar fashion in September of 2017, John?</p><p>KING: Alison Kosik, thanks for the numbers breakdown. Ana Swanson with the New York Times joins the conversation now. And whether you're the president or whether you're an American worker, that's what you're worried about.</p><p>Is this just that blip, they happen. They happen. Actually we can show. We did put up the job chart numbers just through the last several years. And you go back and, look, you see a couple of very low points September 2017 the last time we were this low, but they do happen. And if you look at the overall picture there, that's pretty good. Is there a rebound in the making here or are there signs of slower growth?</p><p>ANA SWANSON, TRADE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I would say it's probably something in the middle here. You know, that was a very disappointing figure, 20,000 jobs. The initial reaction this morning was like did someone forget to put a zero on the end of it?</p><p>But, you know, I think overall it's dangerous to interpret too much from one month and it really should be viewed as more of a corrective to the blistering job growth that we saw in December and in January. A little bit more modest of the trend there.</p><p>And overall there could be trouble on the horizon here with the economy. We are seeing economies overseas, particularly China and Europe, slowing, the effect of the president's $1.5 trillion tax cut is starting to work its way through. And then you have the ongoing trade war and the effect of the tariffs. And so all of this could come back to bite just as the 2020campaign starts to heat up here.</p><p>[12:35:05] KING: And the campaign parts, what makes it interesting because we can walk through some of this. This is sort of two economies if you will if you're President Trump you have low unemployment. You have more jobs added, you have higher wage growth. You've been cutting taxes and regulations and you think that's given some steroids if you want some stimulus to the economy.</p><p>On the flip side, tariffs are causing a lot of anxiety especially out in foreign states that were Trump states. The trade deficits way up, stock markets up now but if we've had a few blips there and the global growth show that you speak of.</p><p>So if you're the president and you're in this tough negotiations with China, now there's talk that some of the President Xi no date because they're still talking both sides that have issues.</p><p>If you're the president, does this make you think, I want a deal, I want this to over with, I want the uncertainty over if I win a re- election?</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's why there isn't so much focus on that summit and that trade deal coming together. The White House is paying very close attention to these numbers because they know the economy is going to be so critical to their 2020 message.</p><p>And that's something they want to be able to tout that's why you saw the president touting the wage growth and what he did is he left the White House this morning. But they are also increasingly looking to that China-U.S. trade deal that they think they can secure. Because they think if they did, that is going to be historic.</p><p>It would be monumental to President Trump's legacy while in office and they think it would be able to help them despite what the economy numbers are when they are going into that campaign.</p><p>SEUNG MIN KIM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE WASHINTON POST: And Republicans clearly, I mean after the trade deficit news came out this week, I've talked to Republicans on the Hill and they said, yes, of course, this increases the pressure for the president to get a good trade deal with China later this month.</p><p>And I was talking about -- especially Republican Senators from foreign states like we've mentioned earlier and their view on a really interesting. I mean, we're still at the point where they say, you know, farmers do love Trump. They support him, but they are starting to run out of patience.</p><p>I mean this is hurting their economy back home and that could definitely have an impact for his re-election campaign.</p><p>KING: So that point is from an A.P. story, Howard Hill is a hog farmer. We listen to a lot of voices from Washington, we should listen to voices out the America more often than we do.</p><p>\"We have patients but we don't have unlimited patience. I think people recognize particularly with China, they have not been playing by the rules for a long time. I think producers are supportive of China correct these issues. On the other hand, we don't want it to go on forever.\"</p><p>Meaning, we have to make five year plans. You're in a farm, you make five year and ten year plans and all these uncertainty it's freezing that.</p><p>CATHERINE LUCEY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: Yes, the make plans, they buy equipment, they sell soybeans to China. So they -- and they need some certainty to their jobs. And, yes, I think I've say they've been very loyal to President Trump in these states. But these are states the president needs for his re-election.</p><p>You know, Iowa is a key, a key state for him. Other Ag states are going to be a big part of it. And the President really has -- and every president wants a good economy to run for re-election, but he has really pledged that he can do the things himself. But he is the one turbo charging that his policies, his decisions. So if there is really a slowdown, it's on him in a very significant way.</p><p>KING: And to that point in the sense that we have a Democratic House and Republican Senate, they are not going to be in a new economic policy initiatives in the past before the election. This is just not going to happen.</p><p>Maybe the U.S., Mexico, Canada trade agreement, that's one issue the President hopes to get through. We'll see where that one goes. But is -- are the trade negotiations with China the biggest thing that the president can personally do in the sense that he can't expect to pass any new legislation but he want to tweak tax cuts or do anything else, so if he's going to do anything, it's on him, right?</p><p>SWANSON: Yes. I think those are really under his power. And he has been very motivated to come to a deal, in part because of the stock market we missed that you saw at the end of last year, that's another metric that the President sees as a measure of his performance.</p><p>But in recent days we've actually been hearing that that summit between the president and President Xi Jinping of China is a little bit less certain. The president is also open to criticism on both the right and the left here for taking what is a bad China deal. And it seems like they're starting to back off a little bit from the certainty of that summit happening later this month in Mar-A-Lago.</p><p>The Chinese particularly very worried about the examples set by the president in Hanoi when he met Kim Jong-Un, wary of sending their president across the sea just to be embarrassed if no deal was made.</p><p>KING: And they might think of a Chinese perspective that a report like this might -- maybe gives him a little bit more leverage or a little more time to hold and wait and appreciate you're coming in. Before we go to break on this International Women's Day, some words of determination and inspiration from the first U.S. female fighter pilot to fly in combat went on to become United States senator.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARTHA MCSALLY (R), ARIZONA: It just pissed me off. But I said, that's exactly what I'm going to do. And I walked around saying I'm going to be the first woman fighter pilot. I knew nothing about flying, but I was mostly driven because they told me that I couldn't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:42:34] KING: Topping our political radar today, Elizabeth Warren moments ago as you can see here talking with voters in Harlem. Also today, Warren rolling out one of her big policy plans, breaking up Amazon, Google and other big tech giants.</p><p>Warren's plan would dismantle companies with annual revenues of at least $25 billion because what she says they've become too powerful for mergers and buyouts. Warren says big tech dominants is squashing small businesses and stifling innovation.</p><p>Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper kicks off his 2020 presidential campaign with a big rally in Denver last night. Telling the hometown credit he's the Democrat who can beat President Trump running as a pro-pragmatic candidate with a progressive agenda. He says, also could appeal to Independents and Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Being a pragmatist doesn't mean saying no to bold ideas, it means knowing how to make them happen. That is my record. And that will be my promise as president. Let's get to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: And the big 2020 problem for the lesser knowns in the Democratic field, getting that all-important name recognition. Pete Buttigieg at a politics and (INAUDIBLE) in New Hampshire this morning nodding to that challenge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it's safe to say I'm not extremely famous. So a big part of challenge for is just getting known. And I think that our party, especially in moments like this when there's a widespread field, I'd like to think that our party is favorable turf for new comers and underdogs and has a general knack for giving, you know, young person a funny name coming out of nowhere a shot.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Next, the Judge sends Paul Manafort to prison but also lands a body blow with the special counsel.</p><p>[12:48:28] KING: The president this morning saying Paul Manafort caught a tough break, but the president's biggest takeaway is a familiar mantra.</p><p>(BEGI VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Well, his lawyer a highly respected man and a very highly respected judge. That judged (ph) that there was no collusion with Russia. This has nothing to do with collusion. There was no collusion. It's a collusion hoax, it's a collusion witch hoax (ph), I don't collude with Russians.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Well, the truth for those of you who care about such things is that Manafort's trial revolved around financial crimes, not Russian conspiracy. Judge T.S. Ellis did not consider the collusion question. But the Southbound (ph) Hollywood reporters there made sure the president was paying close attention to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN DOWNING, PAUL MANAFORT'S ATTORNEY: I think most importantly what you saw today is the same thing that we had said from day one. There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved with any collusion, with any government official from Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Judge Ellis sentenced Manafort to nearly four years in prison minus time served. That life sentence departed from the sentencing guidelines and is sparking outrage in some quarters. To that in a moment, but first the question raised again by that public appeal from Manafort's lawyer, is the president considering a pardon?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has the president ruled out a pardon for Paul Manafort?</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR FOR THE PRESIDENT: I didn't discuss that with the president. I haven't heard him say that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: CNN's Jessica Schneider joins our conversation. I want to start with you on the pause. I love the pause. I love the pause. Very smart pause.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[12:50:00] COLLINS: I said they were like digging for something to come. And then the president was asked again about it today and he said he's not the one who discusses his pardons, it's us who keeps bringing it in him up. And no course behind the scenes that has been a pretty big discussion about whether or not that's something the president would do. But right now what the White House is refusing to do is rule out that the president whenever grant him one, which is why people keep asking about it.</p><p>KING: And Mr. Downing, Mr. Manafort's lawyer, was clearly putting it out there, shall we say, by saying once again, we please the president. We're not talking about -- no Russian collusion here.</p><p>There's a lot of outrage about this sense was the judge within his guideline? I mean the judge can do whatever he wants.</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Exactly.</p><p>KING: But this is well below the guidelines. What was the rationale?</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Yes, the judge said it quite clearly. He said this is a just sentence. And in Judge Ellis' mind, this was in fact a just sentence. He didn't believe that the sentencing guidelines really spoke to what this crime was, the fact that Paul Manafort was a first- time offender here.</p><p>And Manafort's lawyers really pushed this point as well because they submitted several other examples of people who had stolen much more from the government and paid much less when it came to jail time.</p><p>They cited one woman, and this was incredible, who had $47 million in an overseas bank account. John, I'm not kidding when I say that her sentence was five seconds. Five seconds, it doesn't want to make sense of probation.</p><p>So that was the argument from Manafort's attorney. Judge Ellis obviously didn't go that extreme, but they were trying to have this parody in sentencing saying that Manafort, a first-time offender. This is it.</p><p>KING: And the question if you're the special counsel's office do you take this as a shock in the sense that, you know, he could've gotten 20 years in prison? He's 69 years old. He has another sentencing in another case next week.</p><p>So Paul Manafort's going to spend -- if not the rest of his life, pretty close for the rest of his life in prison. But the judge did say this early on in the trial, \"You don't really care about Mr. Manafort's bank fraud, you really care about his information Mr. Manafort could give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump or lead to his prosecution or impeachment.\"</p><p>So, the special counsel have attest (ph) to think this judge was kind of skeptical of us from the get go.</p><p>LUCEY: Yes. I mean that's certainly from a lot of skepticism from the judge yesterday. And I think he just wanted to note that you -- this is prison time, there's going to be another sentence. And if you think about this in context of just how many people this case has pulled up. I mean, it is still a wide-ranging investigation that has touched a lot of people associated with the president.</p><p>LISA LERER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: And I think we're so engrossed in the details that it is important to step back and say, look, the president's campaign manager was convicted, was sentenced to jail for bank fraud and dealings with foreign governments. Like that is a big deal. In any other administration, this would be a huge deal, but I think with this new cycle and this administration, the scope of this investigation, a lot of these moments sort of get lost in the --</p><p>KING: Right. It's a -- it is stunning sometimes that the standard is, well, the president hired a swamp creature who broke the law repeatedly then cut a deal to cooperate and lied about it. But the president says that does not reflect badly on me because you haven't proven Russian collusion.</p><p>You've just -- you're only proving that I hired and he's only one of a half dozen, my guys who are swamp creatures who lied, who have cheated and who are going to jail.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: And to that point Judge Ellis, he did say that this trial wasn't about collusion but Judge Ellis didn't say there was no collusion, he just said this was a trial on other matters. This was -- Paul Manafort was convicted for tax and bank fraud. So the president sort of twisting the judge's words there and saying he found no collusion.</p><p>COLLINS: Yes. But for the White House that's enough. That's the one thing that they can use coming out of this to say this had nothing to do with Russian collusion which his sentence didn't but of course you're saying they didn't say that we have proven that there was no Russian collusion.</p><p>For the White House, the state has really changed. Like what you're saying, typically that the President's former campaign chairman was convicted of anything it's a big deal. But for this White House, they so much want to distance themselves. They want to push the narrative that it started out being about Russian collusion but it's morphed into so many other things. So that's going to be helpful for their narrative going forward.</p><p>LERER: Any other moment in Washington this would be like a 550 alarm fire and we now you feel like it's just kind of like a little brush fire over here and then there's all this other thing. And you really --</p><p>LUCEY: And the president is still speaking very kindly about Paul Manafort, too. I mean today he said he feels badly for him, you know, he said it's been a hard time for him. So, I think that's --</p><p>SCHNEIDER: There's more to come here. The next sentencing on Wednesday in D.C. and the judge here Amy Berman Jackson, she could throw the book at Manafort up to 10 year sentence.</p><p>KING: And oddly Paul Manafort has now becoming exhibit A at the moment in the Democratic argument for criminal justice who are saying this is just wrong, here's Cory Booker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm really ticked off about this, but in our country we prey upon the most vulnerable citizens in our nation, poor folks, mentally ill folks, addicted folks and overwhelmingly black and brown folks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Were you shocked that he only got 47 weeks?</p><p>BOOKER: No, this criminal justice can't surprise me anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: It's odd that Paul Manafort in the middle of this debate. But this has been an issue front and center for the Democrats in the campaign, and the president just signed a big criminal justice reform of this. It's actually a bipartisan agreement and the Democrats say, wait a minute. Wait a minute, you know some black guy gets pulled over the traffic, stop (ph), that's a bag of weed, so it's going to go to prison for long than Paul Manafort.</p><p>[12:55:06] LERER: But this is going to be an issue in the Democratic primary black voters make of the huge portion that Democratic electorate and the make up the majority in some key states, South Carolina as you will know. So we're going to keep hearing about this topic.</p><p>KING: We'll continue. Thank you all for joining us today on -- shall we say an interesting day. A lot happened. I hope to see you back here Sunday morning as well. We'll be up early 8:00 Eastern. Don't go anywhere, a lot of breaking news today including the president in Alabama. Brianna Keilar starts after a quick break.</p><p>[13:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019030802CNV15</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-JK61-DXH2-64FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Collusion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elizabeth Warren</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Hickenlooper</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Paul Manafort</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>White House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bank Fraud</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Unemployment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Job</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

This weekend it became a political confab, as nine Democratic presidential hopefuls descended on the central Texas city to make their pitch to convention-goers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One by one, the candidates took the stage in Austin, most in one-on-one, hour-long interviews with journalists at a theatre better known for rollicking music concerts than high-minded political discussions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How did they do? Here's a look at the biggest ideas and biggest weaknesses of those who showed up \u2013 and how they were received.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amy Klobuchar</p><p>In a large and growing Democratic presidential field, Amy Klobuchar is trying to lay claim to the moderate middle. But that can be a tough sell, particularly when many of her rivals are touting big-ticket progressive goals like universal healthcare, free college education and aggressive attempts to address income inequality.</p><p>\"I'm being honest, and I think you want honesty,\" she says.</p><p>If the goal for Democrats is to find a candidate who can win the Midwest swing states that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 \u2013 places like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 Ms Klobuchar may be an attractive choice. Her big idea: She offered a number of proposals during her time on stage \u2013 bringing broadband to rural areas, lowering prescription drug prices and some kind of transactional tax on technology companies that sell information about their users. When I asked her to name her top idea, she opted for one she hadn't mentioned \u2013 passing a law automatically registering all citizens to vote when they turn 18.</p><p>Her biggest obstacle: Raising the massive amount of money to fund a presidential campaign was her biggest obstacle, she told me. Allegations that she has been verbally abusive towards her Senate staff have dogged the early days of her campaign, however, and threaten to become a recurring distraction. \"I have high expectations for myself, I have high expectations for people who work for me, and most importantly I have high expectations for this country,\" she said. \"I can always do better.\"</p><p>Reception: Moderation and practicality may eventually win support, but they didn't get people out of their chairs here.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren</p><p>The Massachusetts senator arrived at the South by Southwest conference one day after announcing her plan to use the government's antitrust powers to break up big technology companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple. Say what you will about her candidacy, but that took guts.</p><p>At the beginning of her panel, moderator Anand Giridharadas of Time magazine asked current and former employees of the aforementioned companies in the audience to stand up and face the senator as she explained her proposal.</p><p>She compared the current system to a baseball league where participants could either be an umpire or team \u2013 but not both. Companies like Amazon, which are marketplace platforms but also participants that use the information they glean from transactions to sell their own products, have an unfair, innovation-stifling advantage.</p><p>Her big idea: Ms Warren's campaign sometimes seems fashioned entirely out of big ideas, with her tech-company break-up plan only being the latest. She's also proposed a universal childcare programme and a tax on the wealth of multimillionaires. Personal assets over $50m would be subject to an annual 2% assessment, she says, while those over $1bn would be hit with a 3% tax.</p><p>Her biggest obstacle: Saturday's hour-long interview was classic Warren \u2013 a mix of history lesson, economic theory and academic research. On the campaign stump it can be a bit clunky, but in a one-on-one format it shines. No one in the Democratic field can talk nuts-and-bolts of policy like her. If a campaign for president was a series of in-depth lectures on issues of importance, she might be running away with the nomination. The biggest obstacle for her is that it's not.</p><p>Reception: Ms Warren came to Austin to bury big tech companies, not to praise them. Despite this, she had the best reception of any politician at South by Southwest not named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Jay Inslee</p><p>The Washington governor launched his presidential campaign just over a week ago and has been focused laser-like on the issue of climate change ever since. \"We are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change,\" he said, \"but we are the last generation that can do something about it.\"</p><p>He noted that a recent Iowa poll showed that the environment was the top issue for Democratic voters, tied with healthcare. With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal helping to push the topic to centre stage, Mr Inslee could be in position to capitalise on the attention.</p><p>His big idea: Clearly environmental action is the central thrust of Mr Inslee's campaign, although he says he has no one preferred policy \"silver bullet\", but rather wants a multifaceted \"silver buckshot\" approach. One big idea he threw his weight behind in Austin was eliminating the legislative blocking tactic known as the filibuster in the US Senate.</p><p>\"Anyone who says they want to do anything of any significance in the next several years has to be in favour of ending the filibuster or they're not serious,\" Mr Inslee told me. \"So if you say you're serious about climate change and believe that it's an existential threat to the nation, but you're not categorically against the filibuster, then you're dooming the United States to failure.\"</p><p>His biggest challenge: Mr Inslee is starting in the race as a little-known governor from a state in the far corner of America. If he succeeds in raising his visibility by pushing the environmental issue, his biggest challenge will be using that attention to sell Democratic voters on the rest of his progressive record in Washington \u2013 on issues like marijuana legalisation, criminal justice reform, raising the minimum wage, abolishing the death penalty and expanding healthcare coverage.</p><p>Reception: He had by far the worst time slot \u2013 a 9:30am start on the morning after clocks moved forward an hour. Talk of impending climate disaster kept those who did show up engaged in the conversation, however.</p><p>Juli\u00e1n Castro</p><p>The former housing and urban development secretary was reportedly on Hillary Clinton's vice-presidential short list in 2016. He was passed over for Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, but now he's angling for the top job. Or, perhaps, he's trying to make a more compelling case for the second spot on the 2020 nominee's ticket.</p><p>He said his goal is to make the US the smartest, healthiest, fairest and most prosperous nation on earth. Maybe it's his response to \"make America great again\", although it will be considerably harder to print on a hat.</p><p>His big idea: In an interview earlier in the day, he criticised fellow candidate Bernie Sanders for his willingness to write \"big cheques\" for things like healthcare or education, but being unwilling to consider reparations to African-Americans descended from slaves. The US constitution mandates that Americans be compensated if their property is taken, he noted, so why shouldn't people who were treated as property themselves also receive compensation?</p><p>\"I've long believed that the country should consider reparations because of the atrocity of slavery,\" Mr Castro told me. \"I believe that we're never going to fully heal as a country from the racial divide until we've addressed the tremendous wrong that was done with slavery.\"</p><p>He said that, as president, he would set up a commission to determine an inclusive way to address \"the best path forward\". It will be up to those who support reparations to decide whether a \"commission\" is the kind of bold move they had in mind.</p><p>His biggest challenge: While Mr Castro is staking out a reparations position to the left of most of the Democratic field, he's spent most of his political career talking and acting like a moderate. On Sunday he identified himself as a \"progressive\" \u2013 in favour of universal healthcare, universal pre-kindergarten and tuition-free college.</p><p>\"I don't think that with any one candidate you're going to consistently find them in one place,\" he said. That may not be enough to convince progressives he is legitimately one of their own.</p><p>Reception: Mr Castro had a bit of a home field advantage in Austin, as he is the former mayor of nearby San Antonio. He isn't a lively public speaker, but was more than comfortable with the interview format.</p><p>John Hickenlooper</p><p>The geologist turned brewpub owner turned politician turned up at South by Southwest just three days after he formally launched his presidential campaign with a speech in Denver. The former Colorado governor echoed similar themes in Austin on Saturday, preaching his ability to work with Republicans to advance progressive priorities like gun control, environmental regulation and healthcare coverage expansion.</p><p>His biggest idea: During his hour-long interview Mr Hickenlooper said that the 2020 presidential race would be a \"campaign of ideas\".</p><p>So, after his talk, I asked him which ideas set him out from the crowd. \"I think I'm the one person that demonstrates the idea of action, of actually accomplishing things,\" he said.</p><p>\"Action\" isn't really an idea, I said.</p><p>He went on to talk about healthcare, environmental regulation and workforce training. It wasn't exactly stand-apart-from-the-crowd material.</p><p>His biggest challenge: Mr Hickenlooper's focus on co-operation may have won him political success in Colorado, but it also made him some fierce critics. Some environmentalists, in particular, weren't all that thrilled that the former oil industry scientist sat down with energy industry executives for friendly negotiations. In one particularly memorable instance, the governor drank a glass of fracking fluid to prove that it didn't harm humans.</p><p>Mr Hickenlooper explained that he was trying to gain their trust \u2013 and that the talks led to real regulation of methane emissions. \"They're mad that I did stuff,\" he said. \"We actually did stuff. So sue me.\" They won't sue him, but they might not vote for him, either.</p><p>Reception: Mr Hickenlooper is an affable man, and that came across in his appearance. They have a saying about where nice guys finish, though.</p><p>Pete Buttegieg</p><p>If elected, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would achieve a number of presidential firsts \u2013 the youngest president, aged 37, the first mayor elected directly to the White House, the first Afghanistan War veteran and the first openly gay president.</p><p>On Sunday at a CNN event, he showed flashes of the charisma that turned heads in the party when he mounted an upstart, although ultimately unsuccessful, bid to be head of the Democratic National Committee in 2017.</p><p>In one line that has caught particular attention, he blasted Vice-President Mike Pence, the former governor of his home state.</p><p>\"How can he allow himself to be the cheerleader for the porn star presidency?\" he asked. \"Is it that he stopped believing in scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump?\"</p><p>His big idea: Many of the Democrats in the presidential field have endorsed universal government-managed health insurance by expanding to everyone the Medicare programme that provides healthcare for the elderly. Mr Buttigieg didn't go that far on Sunday night, instead opting for what he called \"Medicare for all who want it\". The way he described it, \"you take some flavour of Medicare, you make it available on the exchange as a kind of public option, and you invite people to buy into it\".</p><p>His biggest obstacle: The possible \"first\" are also obstacles. He's young. And the mayor's office of a small Indiana town, with its small constituency, is an unlikely seat from which to launch a presidential campaign. Mr Buttigieg will be hard-pressed to break through against better-funded, more experienced candidates. Chances are, however, he'll still be around in politics long after many of them are gone and he thinks his age is a plus. \"It allows me to communicate to the country a vision about what our country is going to look like in 2054,\" he said. \"That's the year I get to the current age of the current president.\"</p><p>Reception: \"I have rarely seen a candidate make better use of televised town hall,\" said former Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod. \"Crisp, thoughtful and relatable. He'll be a little less of a long shot tomorrow.\"</p><p>Andrew Yang</p><p>Political opinion surveys show that most Americans don't know who Andrew Yang is. Those are the polls that ask about Mr Yang at all, which are few in number.</p><p>The technology entrepreneur had a small room in Austin but filled it. And, due to his moderator's cancelled flight, he had to interview himself. That he managed to pull it off was a testament to his ease at public speaking, which if he manages to make it onto a Democratic debate stage later this year, may turn some heads. He's developed a loyal online following and has garnered more than 57,000 individual donations \u2013 on a pace to hit the 65,000 mark that is one of the Democratic Party's criteria for qualifying for the first debate.</p><p>His big idea: Mr Yang's entire campaign is centred around one big idea -a universal basic income. He proposes guaranteeing every American a $1,000 monthly payment funded by a value-added tax, which he calls the \"freedom dividend.\" He says it is necessary to cushion the American public for the coming upheaval created by automation and artificial intelligence.</p><p>\"This economy is going to go from punitive to savage very quickly,\" he says. \"The next downturn, the knives are going to come out.\" Everyone from call centre operators to truck drivers will be on the chopping block. \"There's no magical realignment that's going to happen,\" he says. A basic income will ease the blow.</p><p>His biggest obstacle: To a man with a hammer, every problem can look like a nail. For a one-issue candidate like Mr Yang, the basic income is a salve for all ills. Climate change? A basic income would free people to focus on the environment instead of making ends meet. Small-town decay? The money would let people move back and start businesses. Mr Yang says critics who call his plan socialism get it wrong. The reality, however, is Mr Yang is never going to be elected president. His obstacle is finding a way to get enough attention to inject his income proposal into the conversation. It's not an impossible goal.</p><p>Reception: Yes, we're grading on a curve here, but the people who showed up for Mr Yang's event were buying what he was selling. (He was selling free money, of course.)</p><p>John Delaney</p><p>Former Maryland congressman John Delaney has been running for president since July 2017, but Sunday night \u2013 in a cable-televised town hall with audience questions \u2013 was his first opportunity to bask in the spotlight.</p><p>He did\u2026 not bad. He sounded like a polished politician who knew the key to success in this type of forum is to look the questioner in the eye and make a connection. The former technology executive did what he had to make his pitch for moderation and accord. \"I don't think bipartisanship is a dirty word,\" he said.</p><p>He ticked off six possible areas of common ground he thinks both parties could find if he's president \u2013 a carbon tax; infrastructure spending; criminal justice reform; immigration reform; digital privacy and a new national service programme.</p><p>You have to admit, he's an optimist.</p><p>His big idea: As part of his effort to find common ground with political opponents, Mr Delaney promises that as president he would hold nationally televised debates with Congress once every three months. Think of it like question time in the British Parliament, but not as often and (probably) with less creative insults.</p><p>His biggest obstacle: Mr Delaney has been campaigning in Iowa for 20 months and still barely registers as a blip in presidential preference polls there. He joked that he was unable to clear the presidential field despite his long head start. Chances are, the field will soon leave him in the dust.</p><p>Reception: For an hour on Sunday, Mr Delaney was the star. He got real questions from real voters who treated him like a real contender. No matter what happens from here, he'll always have Austin.</p><p>Tulsi Gabbard</p><p>The 37-year-old Hawaii congresswoman was one of the few congressional supporters of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, but now she's running against him.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting moment in Ms Gabbard's Sunday evening town hall was when she was asked whether she is a capitalist. It's the kind of question every Democratic candidate has faced in the past few days, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>\"So many of these labels are misused, misunderstood to the point where people don't have any idea what they mean anymore,\" Ms Gabbard said.</p><p>The audience applauded. Perhaps they sympathised. Just a day earlier, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told a South by Southwest audience that capitalism was \"irredeemable\", while elsewhere possible independent candidate Howard Schultz praised capitalism and said to understand socialism you should \"look at Venezuela\".</p><p>When the terms of the debate can't even be agreed upon, what's the chance of a useful answer? Democrats might want to follow the Hawaiian's lead and avoid trying to answer.</p><p>Her big idea: A central part of Ms Gabbard's campaign has been her call for an end to US-led \"regime change wars\" \u2013 in Syria and Afghanistan. She also condemns runaway military spending as a \"new arms race\". As a major in the US Army reserve and a veteran of the Iraq War, Ms Gabbard has a unique perch from which to launch her critique.</p><p>Her biggest obstacle: Her foreign policy has also been a source of controversy. In 2017 she met President Bashar Assad in Syria and has questioned the international consensus that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons against its own citizens.</p><p>\"I served in a war in Iraq, a war that was based on lies,\" she said. \"I think that the evidence needs to be gathered.\" She refused to label Mr Assad as a \"war criminal\" \u2013 a position that sets her well apart from the majority of US politicians and the American people.</p><p>Reception: Ms Gabbard had the toughest questions from the town hall audience, which she often dodged despite moderator follow-ups. She had her supporters in the crowd, but many of those present didn't seem to warm to her.</p><p>Post Views: 38 </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/70/155249322760.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/70/155249322760.jpg</url></p><p>Tulsi Gabbard<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/83/155249322846.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/83/155249322846.jpg</url></p><p>Amy Klobuchar<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/26/155249322930.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/26/155249322930.jpg</url></p><p>Andrew Yang<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/57/155249323020.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/57/155249323020.jpg</url></p><p>Elizabeth Warren<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/1/155249323103.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/1/155249323103.jpg</url></p><p>Jay Inslee<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/83/155249323191.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/83/155249323191.jpg</url></p><p>John Delaney<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/58/155249323276.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/58/155249323276.jpg</url></p><p>John Hickenlooper<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/57/155249323369.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/57/155249323369.jpg</url></p><p>Juli\u00e1n Castro<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/77/155249323453.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/631/1801/77/155249323453.jpg</url></p><p>Pete Buttegieg<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERGHA-140139006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERGHA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMN-7SC1-F11P-X1SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3147\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Herald.

There would be closer scrutiny on antitrust matters, at least compared to the Obama administration, but we do not expect this would go as far as breaking up Big Tech companies. A Biden administration would have a very similar stance on Chinese tech as the current Trump administration, but it would take a much more multilateral approach and look to ally with other countries in Europe and Asia. We believe there is a 70% probability that Joe Biden will win the forthcoming US Presidential elections, a 35% chance this will be combined with the Democrats gaining a majority in the Senate. </p><p>Looking at the telecoms market, the Democrats are focusing on investing into broadband and 5G networks, as well as ensuring the open internet through net neutrality rules. However, these are driven by the competitive landscape of the market, which are unlikely to drastically change. The repealing of the Internet Open Rules has had a very limited impact, and their return would have the same effect, because there are no sustainable business models where some content is prioritised. Furthermore, with the exception of some specific conditions in terms of rolling out, and spectrum availability, the private sector will continue to be the main driver in terms of investments into telecoms infrastructure.Focusing on technology and Big Tech companies, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">we believe the main short-term benefit of a Biden administration would be on immigration</emphasis>. The sector is a big user of H-1B visas for highly-skilled workers, and a new Democratic administration would reverse the crackdown initiated during the presidency of Donald Trump. The presence of Kamala Harris on the ticket, both through her own personal background and because she represents California, thus Silicon Valley, in the Senate, means a new administration would make that change early, benefiting Big Tech companies as well as greater number of international students in related subjects.Her presence would however not lead to a laissez-faire approach when it comes to regulation. While <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">we do not believe it would go as far as breaking the Big Tech companies</emphasis>, though this would depend on the future role of Elizabeth Warren, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">we believe there would be greater scrutiny</emphasis>, and greater responsibility put on the tech companies. The Trump administration has started some antitrust lawsuits against major tech companies, which would be ongoing during Joe Biden's term if he wins the Presidency, and we believe there would be a much bigger focus in terms of remedies, and even more funding for key administrations such as the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.Further divergences exist between the two parties, and section 230 is a clear example. Joe Biden first mooted the possibility of repealing it in January 2020, before President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May. But they have very different reasons to do so; while the Republicans believe the platforms are doing too much in terms of content regulation, arguing there is an anti-conservative bias, the Democrats think they are doing too little, and accuse them of spreading misinformation. It is likely that a Biden administration, alongside a Democratic Congress, would look to make <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">tech companies more accountable</emphasis>, and this could include regulation relating to stricter privacy rules on the federal level, greater protection of gig economy workers, as in California, and higher taxation for the largest companies. If new rules are put into place, then the key question will move towards enforcement. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On the international level, we do not believe there would be a change of stance in terms of Chinese tech, but a change of method</emphasis>. The Biden administration would likely be more multilateral, and look to include allies in both Europe and Asia against Chinese influence. This could mean common standards when it comes to emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), even though there would remain divergences between the need for innovation and the need for regulation. And it could also mean a much stronger alliance against <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Huawei</emphasis> worldwide, as countries feel they would have the support of the US should they decide to ban the vendor, if it is part of a much broader strategy. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-1585447</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YJ-W831-JD33-J02T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Monitor International Ltd.

She spent two weeks in a homemade theater training program. Here\u2019s an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">excerpt from her essay about it</url>.</p><p>I started with vocal work, arranging a voice lesson via Broadway Plus, a concierge service that used to arrange V.I.P. access to Broadway performances and has since pivoted to online meet-and-greets and private lessons.</p><p>After polling friends about a good song for a nice lady with a Playbill-slim range and a shaky grasp of pitch, I picked \u201cSonya Alone,\u201d from \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">Natasha, Pierre &amp;amp; the Great Comet of 1812</url>.\u201d I rehearsed when I could \u2014 in the shower, cooking dinner, under my breath at various playgrounds. By the time the lesson came around, I had it down.</p><p>Though I once won a limbo contest at a classmate\u2019s bar mitzvah, dance has also never been my thing. Still, I figured that Beginner Theater Dance, which I signed up for through Ailey Extension, couldn\u2019t be so hard. I figured wrong.</p><p>We warmed up to selections from \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cThe Prince of Egypt.\u201d I even learned a Fosse hip roll. But as we danced to \u201cNo Day but Today,\u201d the \u201cRent\u201d finale, the ballet terms \u2014 pass\u00e9, coup\u00e9, rond de jambe \u2014 proliferated and the eight counts came worryingly fast. Though I had positioned my laptop camera so that it showed me only from the rib cage up, I couldn\u2019t even fake the arms.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s because, as I soon learned, a level exists even below Beginner. That level is Basic. So am I. The following week, I tried Steps on Broadway\u2019s Basic Theater Dance.</p><p>The instructor, Tera-Lee Pollin, a Broadway veteran with inhuman exuberance, guided a handful of students through \u201cWaterloo,\u201d the curtain number for \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d and a song about defeat. Together, delightedly, we ponied, we swam, we grapevined. No jambes were ronded.</p><p>So, yes, any amateur with enough time and resilience and discretionary income can probably learn theater basics remotely. The alchemy of live acting before a live audience almost comes through onscreen \u2014 but not quite. Until it can, I will think of the thousands and thousands of people in their homes, practicing their pentameter, arabesques and key changes, waiting for curtains to rise.</p><p>That\u2019s it for this briefing.

The European Union said Wednesday that it's investigating whether Amazon uses data from independent retailers to gain an unfair advantage, a decision that could lead to changes in how the internet's biggest marketplace works. The move echoes similar antitrust actions against Google and Microsoft that have led to billions of dollars in fines. </p><p>It also contrasts with United States lawmakers' slower approach to the issue, as they start discussing how to curb the growing power of the tech industry's titans. A Tuesday hearing in Washington looked into whether the companies' business practices run afoul of century-old laws originally designed to combat railroad and oil monopolies. Any U.S. action is a long time away. The EU's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, said she's taking a \"very close look\" at Amazon's dual role as marketplace and retailer. In addition to selling its products, Amazon allows third-party retailers to sell their goods through its site. Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from third-party sellers. In doing so, Amazon collects data about activity on its platform that, the EU says, it might be able to use to favor its products for sale. In particular, the EU will look at how Amazon determines which trader is selected as the default seller of an item that a customer wants to buy. The EU opened a preliminary probe into the issue last year, and Vestager said it has shown that \"Amazon appears to use competitively sensitive information - about marketplace sellers, their products and transactions on the marketplace.\" The investigation could lead to fines and eventually cause Amazon to change the way it works. Previous EU antitrust cases have resulted in such change, though it's unclear how big their ultimate impact has been in addressing the EU's concerns. For example, Google had to tweak the display of search results, which the EU had said favored Google goods and services. Amazon said it \"will cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\" During Tuesday's hearing before a House panel, Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton said Amazon has an incentive to keep third-party sellers strong because they make up nearly 60 percent of unit sales for Amazon and are growing twice as fast as Amazon's own retail operations. Under questioning, Sutton insisted Amazon uses data to serve customers but not to directly compete with them. His remarks echoed executive Jeff Wilke's insistence in June that no one inside Amazon shares seller data to create competing Amazon private-label products, such as Solimo paper towels and Amazon Basics batteries. In a parallel but separate case, Germany's competition regulator said Wednesday that Amazon was changing some of its business conditions for traders on its online marketplace worldwide after the regulator raised concerns about some terms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN69041955</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKV-WDM1-DYRV-41H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Our analysts examine what is behmd the recent rally and discuss the current fundamental factors that could affec the market's direction through year end.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Equity markets in the United States. with the exception of the sharp correction in February and March, have marched consistently higher since July 2006, breaching record levels. But with a significantly weaker U.S. dollar and slowing economic expansion, the question on the minds of most traders is whether the equity bull market is sustainable or are we approaching the ultimate blow-off top?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you look at a long-term chart, the momentum is still upwards,\" says Michael J. Zarembski, senior analyst for XpressTrade Inc. \"There are only three weeks this year that it paid to be short.\"</p><p>But is it greed or fear that is driving equities? Michael Kimbarovsky, principal of Advocate Asset Management LLC, says the bull market is being driven more by a lack of supply than by demand. \"It's really supply-based liquidity.\" He says that fear of not participating in the bull market has drawn cash into the market. \"When you add liquidity to any scenario, it's like adding pure oxygen to a fire. Everything will go up,\" Kimbarovsky says. \"The question is: how much is left?\"</p><p>BULL SPEAK</p><p>\"I can't find any good reasons to be a bear,\" says Jason Leander, vice president at Rothschild Investment Corporation. He attributes the strength in equities to three factors: money has been plentiful and liquidity has been high; companies have been sitting on cash and using it to buy back shares removing them from circulation; and private equity is purchasing public companies at a premium, taking entire corporations out of circulation. \"AU these companies have gone private and you realize: Oh, Jeez, CDW is now private, and you won't be able to buy stock in that company anymore. You used to be able to put your money in and think about retiring, and you are not able to do that anymore.\"</p><p>Another positive factor for the market is that consumer spending, which accounts for more than 60% of the U.S. economy and is correlated to corporate earnings, has not been affected yet by the correction in the housing market and the wreckage of the subprime lending industry.</p><p>\"It doesn't seem to have any effect on the consumer so far; and as we can see, prices are still moving higher,\" Zarembski says. \"There are other factors at play besides just die U.S. housing market. It is having less effect than it may have in the past.\"</p><p>LOST HERE BEFORE</p><p>Movements in the Nasdaq mimic important moves by the 1937 DJIA (in black) and the 1974 Nasdaq, and indicate an imminent aggressive inflationary or deflationary environment.</p><p>RUSSELL'S REIGN</p><p>The small cap Russell 2000 has punched above its weight, keeping pace and occasionally out-performing the S&amp;P 500, but is more susceptible to rate increases and fickle U.S. consumers.</p><p>Zarembski says that money from non-U. S. sources, especially Asia, has flooded the equities market, that business spending is picking up any slack in consumer spending; and that all of this is happening despite increasing bond yields and with the yield curve at its steepest since October 2005. \"Usually that would be a competitor,\" Zarembski says. \"When you can get 5.25% on a 30-year bond nearly risk free, you would think stocks would pull back a bit to make that risk a little more palatable to investors, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\"</p><p>BEAR SPEAK</p><p>\"The resilience and strength has been amazing. And intraday volatility has been tremendously high,\" Kimbarovsky says. But with the S&amp;.P up 6.5% year-to-date, compared with energy, which is 16% higher year-to-date, he is less than impressed. \"At a macro level, you cannot grow faster than the GDP for any length of time,\" he says, and people have not incorporated the weakening economy into their investment decisions. He notes that that the current 6% U.S. account deficit and unbalanced budget are a drag on the economy, which posted an anemic 0.7% gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter. \"There is not a lot of room in the U.S. for consistent growth under this macro-economic environment. I don't see a lot of continued upward trajectory in the domestic indexes,\" Kimbarovsky adds.</p><p>He is also leery of an over dependence on consumer spending. \"As long as consumer spending is up, which is 60% to 70% of the U.S. economy, it's fine. But consumer spending based on easily available credit is going to stop.\" He says that a liquidity crunch would move die market toward a \"more rational allocation of capital,\" and he sees a number of potential catalysts: weakness in die real estate market, more subprime and junk bond defaults and a spillover into the high-leverage private-equity market. \"When our clients say to us: 'take out a more aggressive equity position,' whether that means higher-beta stocks, or higher total equity exposure, we sort of know we are close to a top,\" he says. \"When clients start pressuring you, we know they are probably pressuring odiers, and they are fearing that they are not participating in the upside, that's the point where liquidity starts disappearing.\"</p><p>George J. Slezak, registered investment advisor and principal of stockindextiming.com, says that since the recession of 2001, the stock market has looked like the 1932 recessionary low, the 1974 recessionary low, and like Japan's 1992 recessionary low, and that we are at a critical juncture (see \"Lost here before,\" left). \"Look at real estate, we had a bubble and it went too far and now we all pay for it. Look at the Nasdaq in 2000, we went too far and we paid for it. It is symptomatic of the times that every market goes into a bubble-type expansion and then it gets corrected,\" Slezak says. Citing the grain complex and the housing market as recent examples, he adds, \"Every market is experiencing the bubble blow-out and then the excessive correction; and we are going to experience that in the stock market over the next 12 months. And how we deal with that is critically important in determining whether we have inflation or deflation.\" And the factors that will determine direction are interest rates and the U.S. dollar.</p><p>FED SPEAK</p><p>In late June, the Federal Open Market Committee said that the economy would likely continue expanding at a moderate pace and that while core inflation improved, sustained moderation had not been demonstrated convincingly. In addition, the high level of resource utilization could sustain inflationary pressures. The Fed concluded: \"In these circumstances, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.\" They left the Fed Funds rate at 5.25%.</p><p>\"I don't think Bernanke has the will power or the stamina to get out in front of the market,\" Slezak says. \"Alan Greenspan was a great chartist. He knew how to study markets and then forecast where they were going and Bernanke doesn't have that skill. He is a typical economist; he has a difficult time reporting what has already happened.\" Slezak expects higher inflation and for hedge funds to bear the brunt. \"They have a lot of risk capital and they are going to take the hit on all the mortgages; and the Fed is going to bail everybody out, eventually, through interest rates.\"</p><p>And an increase in the Fed funds rate wouldn't necessarily spell the end of the bull run, Leander says, noting that the U.S. economy expanded healthily throughout the quarter-point march up to 5.25%, where the Fed Funds rate has rested for the past year.</p><p>The conundrum is on the fixed income side, Kimbarovsky says, and he is amazed at the volatility of the yields, especially on the long side. He is baffled by the strong yields on junk bonds. While defaults are low he says that the demand for sub- investment grade credit, considering the meager pay-off, which he says is just 200 basis points higher than Treasuries, is foolish because they are so highly leveraged and illiquid.</p><p>Another threat is the rising competitiveness of the euro as a viable reserve currency and strengthening yields in the Euro zone, where the return is currently 4%. \"The U.S. is in a Catch-22 and can't do anything about it as far as raising or lowering its own rate,\" Kimbarovsky says.</p><p>As non-U. S. economies gather strength and as non-U.S. governments diversify their investments out of U.S. Treasuries, the question of long-term U.S. economic supremacy is uncertain.</p><p>\"Over the last 20 years, the influence the U.S. economy on the world economy has decreased,\" says Kimbarovsky, adding that in addition to having lost many manufacturing jobs, more financial services institutions are based outside the United States due to our more stringent regulatory requirements.</p><p>Zarembski says in the past, when U.S. markets would dip, it was expected that Japan's Nikkei would follow. \"Now it seems like everybody is focused on what is happening in Shanghai. If Shanghai is up, there's a good chance fhat the S&amp;Ps will be up as well.\" But even that may be changing. \"We were kind of going handin-hand with China early in the year and now we've broken off since then. We can't just look at the situation here in the U.S. It's really a world economic situation that we have to focus on.\"</p><p>Slezak is more conservative in his estimations. \"China doesn't matter. If we inflate, they will inflate. If we go into recession/depression, they will go into recession/depression. China follows us completely,\" he says. \"Their circumstances are really a reflection of our circumstances. Our wages are rising, so their wages are finally rising. So what? But it's not their inflation diat's driving our inflation. It's our economy that is driving their economy.\"</p><p>The other important fundamental is the U.S. dollar, which has been in decline, and therefore driving competition for bond investment. \"As the Euro zone raises rates, or maintains a rate that is comparable or even more competitive to the U.S., and now that China has decided it is moving into hard assets rather than Treasuries, there is this vacuum created. I'm exaggerating, but there is a vacuum created as to who buys U.S. Treasuries simply because China has decided to buy hard assets,\" Kimbarovsky says.</p><p>GUIDANCE</p><p>Kimbarovsky is confident in three sectors: energy service providers, telecommunications and healthcare. He says that while the energy service providers are more volatile than vertically integrated conglomerates, such as Exxon Mobil, they have tremendous positive cash flow. Healthcare is a winner based on the aging of America and telecommunications will continue to benefit from the desire for instantaneous information. \"We are still very positive on rhe internationally-diversified traditional large-capitalization and mid-capitalization stocks,\" which he says are more immune to the idiosyncrasies of the U.S. consumer. \"At the same time, we have a short on the small-capitalization sector, mostly as a result of what we feel is the most interest rate sensitive sector.\" While that hasn't been a winner for him, it has helped mute his portfolio's volatility.</p><p>Leander is especially interested in technology stocks. \"I love the companies that are supplying components to the big tech companies. I would be looking for value, people should be playing around the edges; rather than buying the oil companies, buy the drillers and the services providers.\"</p><p>Zarembski and Slezak say that because of limited supply, small caps are coming back into favor. But should the Fed raise interest rates, small caps would be the first to feel the pain (see \"Russell's reign,\" page 26).</p><p>One thing that the analysts do agree on is that the third and fourth quarters will be volatile, and Kimbarovky urges caution, suggesting that you should invest based on fundamentals rather than momentum. \"The risk of capital loss is what you should be focused on, not the risk of under performing a bull market. That is not an easy concept to make resonate with clients,\" he says adding \"It's harder to make money when you have lost money.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Graphs</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photographs</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABI-1316511861</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1316511861 ABI</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4PCR-FM50-TWP5-M442-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">148636</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2187\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 ProQuest Information and Learning Company<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2007 Futures Magazine Group</copyright><publicationName>Futures</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0746-2468</issn><volume>Vol. 36</volume><issueNumber>No. 10</issueNumber><aggregationName>ABI/INFORM</aggregationName><publicationDate month=\"08\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>August 2007</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other (Periodical)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Cover Story</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Investment analysis &amp;

Our analysts examine what is behmd the recent rally and discuss the current fundamental factors that could affec the market's direction through year end.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Equity markets in the United States. with the exception of the sharp correction in February and March, have marched consistently higher since July 2006, breaching record levels. But with a significantly weaker U.S. dollar and slowing economic expansion, the question on the minds of most traders is whether the equity bull market is sustainable or are we approaching the ultimate blow-off top?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you look at a long-term chart, the momentum is still upwards,\" says Michael J. Zarembski, senior analyst for XpressTrade Inc. \"There are only three weeks this year that it paid to be short.\"</p><p>But is it greed or fear that is driving equities? Michael Kimbarovsky, principal of Advocate Asset Management LLC, says the bull market is being driven more by a lack of supply than by demand. \"It's really supply-based liquidity.\" He says that fear of not participating in the bull market has drawn cash into the market. \"When you add liquidity to any scenario, it's like adding pure oxygen to a fire. Everything will go up,\" Kimbarovsky says. \"The question is: how much is left?\"</p><p>BULL SPEAK</p><p>\"I can't find any good reasons to be a bear,\" says Jason Leander, vice president at Rothschild Investment Corporation. He attributes the strength in equities to three factors: money has been plentiful and liquidity has been high; companies have been sitting on cash and using it to buy back shares removing them from circulation; and private equity is purchasing public companies at a premium, taking entire corporations out of circulation. \"AU these companies have gone private and you realize: Oh, Jeez, CDW is now private, and you won't be able to buy stock in that company anymore. You used to be able to put your money in and think about retiring, and you are not able to do that anymore.\"</p><p>Another positive factor for the market is that consumer spending, which accounts for more than 60% of the U.S. economy and is correlated to corporate earnings, has not been affected yet by the correction in the housing market and the wreckage of the subprime lending industry.</p><p>\"It doesn't seem to have any effect on the consumer so far; and as we can see, prices are still moving higher,\" Zarembski says. \"There are other factors at play besides just die U.S. housing market. It is having less effect than it may have in the past.\"</p><p>Zarembski says that money from non-U. S. sources, especially Asia, has flooded the equities market, that business spending is picking up any slack in consumer spending; and that all of this is happening despite increasing bond yields and with the yield curve at its steepest since October 2005. \"Usually that would be a competitor,\" Zarembski says. \"When you can get 5.25% on a 30-year bond nearly risk free, you would think stocks would pull back a bit to make that risk a little more palatable to investors, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\"</p><p>BEAR SPEAK</p><p>\"The resilience and strength has been amazing. And intraday volatility has been tremendously high,\" Kimbarovsky says. But with the S&amp;.P up 6.5% year-to-date, compared with energy, which is 16% higher year-to-date, he is less than impressed. \"At a macro level, you cannot grow faster than the GDP for any length of time,\" he says, and people have not incorporated the weakening economy into their investment decisions. He notes that that the current 6% U.S. account deficit and unbalanced budget are a drag on the economy, which posted an anemic 0.7% gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter. \"There is not a lot of room in the U.S. for consistent growth under this macro-economic environment. I don't see a lot of continued upward trajectory in the domestic indexes,\" Kimbarovsky adds.</p><p>He is also leery of an over dependence on consumer spending. \"As long as consumer spending is up, which is 60% to 70% of the U.S. economy, it's fine. But consumer spending based on easily available credit is going to stop.\" He says that a liquidity crunch would move die market toward a \"more rational allocation of capital,\" and he sees a number of potential catalysts: weakness in die real estate market, more subprime and junk bond defaults and a spillover into the high-leverage private-equity market. \"When our clients say to us: 'take out a more aggressive equity position,' whether that means higher-beta stocks, or higher total equity exposure, we sort of know we are close to a top,\" he says. \"When clients start pressuring you, we know they are probably pressuring odiers, and they are fearing that they are not participating in the upside, that's the point where liquidity starts disappearing.\"</p><p>George J. Slezak, registered investment advisor and principal of stockindextiming.com, says that since the recession of 2001, the stock market has looked like the 1932 recessionary low, the 1974 recessionary low, and like Japan's 1992 recessionary low, and that we are at a critical juncture (see \"Lost here before,\" left). \"Look at real estate, we had a bubble and it went too far and now we all pay for it. Look at the Nasdaq in 2000, we went too far and we paid for it. It is symptomatic of the times that every market goes into a bubble-type expansion and then it gets corrected,\" Slezak says. Citing the grain complex and the housing market as recent examples, he adds, \"Every market is experiencing the bubble blow-out and then the excessive correction; and we are going to experience that in the stock market over the next 12 months. And how we deal with that is critically important in determining whether we have inflation or deflation.\" And the factors that will determine direction are interest rates and the U.S. dollar.</p><p>FED SPEAK</p><p>In late June, the Federal Open Market Committee said that the economy would likely continue expanding at a moderate pace and that while core inflation improved, sustained moderation had not been demonstrated convincingly. In addition, the high level of resource utilization could sustain inflationary pressures. The Fed concluded: \"In these circumstances, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.\" They left the Fed Funds rate at 5.25%.</p><p>\"I don't think Bernanke has the will power or the stamina to get out in front of the market,\" Slezak says. \"Alan Greenspan was a great chartist. He knew how to study markets and then forecast where they were going and Bernanke doesn't have that skill. He is a typical economist; he has a difficult time reporting what has already happened.\" Slezak expects higher inflation and for hedge funds to bear the brunt. \"They have a lot of risk capital and they are going to take the hit on all the mortgages; and the Fed is going to bail everybody out, eventually, through interest rates.\"</p><p>And an increase in the Fed funds rate wouldn't necessarily spell the end of the bull run, Leander says, noting that the U.S. economy expanded healthily throughout the quarter-point march up to 5.25%, where the Fed Funds rate has rested for the past year.</p><p>The conundrum is on the fixed income side, Kimbarovsky says, and he is amazed at the volatility of the yields, especially on the long side. He is baffled by the strong yields on junk bonds. While defaults are low he says that the demand for sub- investment grade credit, considering the meager pay-off, which he says is just 200 basis points higher than Treasuries, is foolish because they are so highly leveraged and illiquid.</p><p>Another threat is the rising competitiveness of the euro as a viable reserve currency and strengthening yields in the Euro zone, where the return is currently 4%. \"The U.S. is in a Catch-22 and can't do anything about it as far as raising or lowering its own rate,\" Kimbarovsky says.</p><p>As non-U. S. economies gather strength and as non-U.S. governments diversify their investments out of U.S. Treasuries, the question of long-term U.S. economic supremacy is uncertain.</p><p>\"Over the last 20 years, the influence the U.S. economy on the world economy has decreased,\" says Kimbarovsky, adding that in addition to having lost many manufacturing jobs, more financial services institutions are based outside the United States due to our more stringent regulatory requirements.</p><p>Zarembski says in the past, when U.S. markets would dip, it was expected that Japan's Nikkei would follow. \"Now it seems like everybody is focused on what is happening in Shanghai. If Shanghai is up, there's a good chance fhat the S&amp;Ps will be up as well.\" But even that may be changing. \"We were kind of going handin-hand with China early in the year and now we've broken off since then. We can't just look at the situation here in the U.S. It's really a world economic situation that we have to focus on.\"</p><p>Slezak is more conservative in his estimations. \"China doesn't matter. If we inflate, they will inflate. If we go into recession/depression, they will go into recession/depression. China follows us completely,\" he says. \"Their circumstances are really a reflection of our circumstances. Our wages are rising, so their wages are finally rising. So what? But it's not their inflation diat's driving our inflation. It's our economy that is driving their economy.\"</p><p>The other important fundamental is the U.S. dollar, which has been in decline, and therefore driving competition for bond investment. \"As the Euro zone raises rates, or maintains a rate that is comparable or even more competitive to the U.S., and now that China has decided it is moving into hard assets rather than Treasuries, there is this vacuum created. I'm exaggerating, but there is a vacuum created as to who buys U.S. Treasuries simply because China has decided to buy hard assets,\" Kimbarovsky says.</p><p>GUIDANCE</p><p>Kimbarovsky is confident in three sectors: energy service providers, telecommunications and healthcare. He says that while the energy service providers are more volatile than vertically integrated conglomerates, such as Exxon Mobil, they have tremendous positive cash flow. Healthcare is a winner based on the aging of America and telecommunications will continue to benefit from the desire for instantaneous information. \"We are still very positive on rhe internationally-diversified traditional large-capitalization and mid-capitalization stocks,\" which he says are more immune to the idiosyncrasies of the U.S. consumer. \"At the same time, we have a short on the small-capitalization sector, mostly as a result of what we feel is the most interest rate sensitive sector.\" While that hasn't been a winner for him, it has helped mute his portfolio's volatility.</p><p>Leander is especially interested in technology stocks. \"I love the companies that are supplying components to the big tech companies. I would be looking for value, people should be playing around the edges; rather than buying the oil companies, buy the drillers and the services providers.\"</p><p>Zarembski and Slezak say that because of limited supply, small caps are coming back into favor. But should the Fed raise interest rates, small caps would be the first to feel the pain (see \"Russell's reign,\" page 26).</p><p>One thing that the analysts do agree on is that the third and fourth quarters will be volatile, and Kimbarovky urges caution, suggesting that you should invest based on fundamentals rather than momentum. \"The risk of capital loss is what you should be focused on, not the risk of under performing a bull market. That is not an easy concept to make resonate with clients,\" he says adding \"It's harder to make money when you have lost money.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Graphs</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>IMAGE GRAPH, LOST HERE BEFORE, Movements in the Nasdaq mimic important moves by the 1937 DJIA (in black) and the 1974 Nasdaq, and indicate an imminent aggressive inflationary or deflationary environment., RUSSELL'S REIGN, The small cap Russell 2000 has punched above its weight, keeping pace and occasionally out-performing the S&amp;P 500, but is more susceptible to rate increases and fickle U.S. consumers.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FUTCHI-1316511861</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FUTCHI2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4PDK-J030-TXNG-D3NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2124\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2007 Futures Magazine Group</copyright><publicationName>Futures Chicago</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0746-2468</issn><volume>Vol. 36</volume><issueNumber>No. 10</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"08\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>August 2007</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Scientific Materials</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Cover Story</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Consumer spending</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economic conditions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Futures trading</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>CLASSIFICATION: </className><className>United States</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CLASSIFICATION: </className><className>Investment analysis &amp;

Each of the three main equity benchmarks - the S&amp;P 500, the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq - are sitting at record levels. Indeed, on Thursday August 11, all three were simultaneously at all time highs for the first time since the height of the internet boom back in early 2000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It all looks very different to the early months of 2016, when worries about China, the oil price and central bank policy saw markets tumbling and commentators talking about the likelihood of the US tipping into recession. So what is the true state of the US economy, and can the equity rally continue?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We retain an optimistic outlook for the US economy and stockmarket, although we recognise a number of uncertainties exist,\" says Wisconsin- based Tom Ognar, who leads the Heritage Growth Team at Wells FargoAsset Management. He points to the effects of China's slowing growth rate on both US and global economies as well as fallout from central banks' monetary policies.</p><p>Despite such risks, the resilient US economy has continued to grow at a modest pace. Recent data has shown house prices and demand for new homes increasing, while, having reined in purchases for the first few months of the year, consumers spent more freely in May than in April - good news for the economy because household spending accounts for more than two- thirds of GDP in the US. There have also been signs that manufacturing activity is picking up and M&amp;A activity has continued as companies took advantage of low interest rates.</p><p>It has not all been good news however, with US GDP and jobs data underscoring some weaknesses in the economy. \"GDP increased at a sluggish annual rate of 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2016, down from 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2015, and May's disappointing employment data revealed employers added jobs in May at the slowest pace in five years,\" highlights Mr Ognar.</p><p>Widespread fears of US recession which surfaced earlier this year were \"overdone\", says Didier Saint-Georges, a member of the Investment Committee at Carmignac, who expects the slowdown to continue.</p><p>\"The two drivers of economic growth are investment and consumption,\" he explains. \"US corporate margins have been coming down for more than a year. It is hard to find a better medium-term advance indicator of investment. A more short-term indicator is the rate of capitalisation and this has been going down as well. When you combine the two it is difficult to figure how the investment cycle is going to pick up and drive economic growth.\"</p><p>This leaves consumption, where the picture is better with wages starting to pick up and employment looking quite strong. However Mr Saint-Georges worries the economy is looking fragile. He warns any inflation is likely to be in non-discretionary areas, such as in rents or the oil price, and could act as a tax on consumption, while Fed Chair Janet Yellen has \"very little leeway\" to do anything should the economy weaken.</p><p>Too expensive?</p><p>Yet despite the consensus that the US economy is late in the economic cycle and will continue in slow growth mode, stockmarkets are at record highs. Are equities overpriced?</p><p>\"US equities may be trading at more expensive multiples than European counterparts, but we think there is still room for the equity market to appreciate,\" says Pictet Asset Management's chief strategist Luca Paolini.</p><p>\"Valuations in US stocks are nowhere near bubble territory yet, while those in bonds have reached far more excessive levels.\" A Fed that is unlikely to raise interest rates before December should also help underpin risky assets, he believes.</p><p>\"US equities are certainly not undervalued, and there are pockets that are overvalued, but to say the whole market is overvalued is not correct,\" says Nick Melhuish, head of global equities at Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager with EU987bn ($1.1tn) in AuM.</p><p>The areas which look expensive are those which investors have rushed into in search of safe havens, he explains, for example consumer staples. Better value can be found in energy stocks, claims Mr Melhuish.</p><p>\"They have bounced back a bit this year along with the oil price, and if you think the oil price is going to normalise somewhere between here and 100 dollars, which I do, the amount spent on exploration will come back to haunt us, probably in 18 months to two years time. That will make the energy companies attractive.\"</p><p>He also likes healthcare, as well as big tech companies, which have large amounts of free cash flow and are much more diversified than before. \"These names are more annuity-like now in that chances of Microsoft disappearing in the next five years because it has made the wrong bet is increasingly unlikely,\" he says.</p><p>A major difference between investing in the US and in Europe is the gap between the cheapest and most expensive stocks by sector - the spreads are wider in the US than they are in Europe. Europe is relatively cheap, but everything has been \"burnt down to the ground\". But in the US, even in sectors which appear expensive, you can still find outliers, says Mr Melhuish. He explains how risk-averse investors have piled into companies with high levels of visibility and low earnings risk, placing a premium on those stocks and leaving others behind, which often tend to play catch-up later on in the cycle as valuation means revert.</p><p>The market has been favouring low volatility, yield-focused, defensive stocks, agrees Adam Schor, director of global equity strategies at Janus Capital Group, and instead favours companies that can find ways to grow earnings through innovation, secular industry change and market share gains despite the slow-growth economy. \"We are finding these stocks across many sectors but healthcare and technology are especially attractive sectors.\"</p><p>He highlights the e-commerce trend, rapidly expanding and pressuring traditional mall-based retailers and companies without an effective defence against disintermediation.</p><p>Given current interest rates, John Bailer, senior portfolio manager at the Boston Company Asset Management, a subsidiary of BNY Mellon, believes the equity market is undervalued and will be driven higher by more cyclical areas of the economy.</p><p>\"Currently we are bullish on the financial sector as it is trading at significant discount,\" he explains. \"We believe the market is overlooking their very strong balance sheets, improving revenue growth opportunities and good cost controls. Also, based on the most recent Federal Reserve test, capital returns through share buybacks and dividends will be positive.\"</p><p>There are plenty of small regional banks in the US, which makes for an interesting investment universe, believes Boston-based Geoff Dailey, portfolio manager and senior analyst for US equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners. \"You can be very regionally-specific. You can pick banks that serve the New York Area, the North West, California... for example I own a small cap bank that has 18 branches in southern California.\"</p><p>With banks facing increasing regulatory pressure and compliance demands, they are being forced to add systems and increase headcounts. As such, there are huge benefits to scale. \"We are starting to see a ramp-up in deals being made, we are seeing them at higher valuations, and at higher market cap sizes,\" says Mr Dailey. \"We think that will continue and it makes for an interesting investment theme.\"</p><p>Election fever</p><p>Boston-based Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, believes the market is a little expensive and is surprised stocks have held up so well given the uncertain economic outlook and potentially negative catalysts on the horizon. He highlights the upcoming US presidential election in November.</p><p>\"It is surprising to me that the market has not focused on what could be two very different scenarios, depending on who gets elected.\"</p><p>Although the consensus is Hillary Clinton will get elected, anyone doing proper scenario analysis has to consider the possibility that Donald Trump could win. \"Because he is such a controversial person and his trade policies would be so protectionist, the market would not like the prospect of a Trump presidency, at least as its first, gut reaction. I don't think that risk has been priced in yet.\"</p><p>This risk could creep into the market as the election draws nearer, believes Mr Perkin, or it could be more like the Brexit referendum, where polls and consensus leading up to election day point one way, then there is a surprise on the day itself and the market reacts accordingly. In any case, there is a great deal at stake in this election, he believes. \"Both the range of potential outcomes and what it means for potential policy is wider than normal in this election. The uncertainty is high.\"</p><p>Healthcare is a sector favoured by many fund managers, although this one area could prove to be a political football. Ms Clinton has made reform of this sector one of her key political objectives, and has repeatedly criticised high drug prices.</p><p>\"For Clinton, healthcare reform is clearly not a political soundbite; she really does believe in this,\" says Mr Melhuish at Amundi. \"She will be looking to lay out clear differences between her and Trump so maybe we will be hearing much more about healthcare.\"</p><p>But this should not stop people investing in the sector, he warns, rather it is just an additional risk. \"The underlying factors are positive enough and the reality is you have to get all of this through Congress anyway.\"</p><p>Time to look at biotech?</p><p>Now could be the best moment to look at the biotechnology sector, argues Daniel Koller, lead manager at BB-Biotech, a Swiss-based investment trust, owned by Bellevue Asset Management, and with SFr3.3bn ($3.4bn) in AuM. Shares in the sector have tumbled since the summer of 2015, and with biotech stocks underperforming general equity markets by around 20 per cent since January 2016, valuations for the biotech blue chips have reached their lows of 2010/11, trading significantly below US and EU large pharmaceutical multiples and below the average S&amp;P multiple.</p><p>\"We believe the current phase is a breathing space before the next growth curve. The market has now passed on the effects of possible shifts in sales and profit development, reflected for example in the issue of reimbursement in the health systems, and these are evident in the price of shares,\" says Mr Koller.</p><p>The elections will bring some volatility to the market, highlighting challenges facing US healthcare, he says. Yet he believes the drug industry is starting to become more vocal about its interests and value proposition.</p><p>\"Contrary to 2008, markets have already been through a correction, a year before the elections,\" says Mr Koller. \"So the market's reaction should be minor even if we can expect some volatility depending on the candidate elected and his or her healthcare programme.\"</p><p>Rumours that Ms Clinton would cut drug prices shocked the market, says Janwillem Acket, chief economist at Julius Baer, but he agrees opportunities outweigh risks in this sector. \"The US population isn't as healthy as it may look - obesity levels are high, there are some bad lifestyles. The US market is the largest healthcare market in the world.\"</p><p>He highlights the gene sequencing story, now getting out of the laboratory into clinical applications. Several US companies are at the forefront, and have a global outlook. \"They have impressive potential,\" says Mr Acket, highlighting Illumina and Laboratory Corporation.</p><p>Market volatility makes this a time for stockpickers, rather than \"coarse\" index and sector approaches, which can lead to bad performance. \"It is the themes and the companies that you want to look at. Those with good corporate governance, good management and good figures regularly delivered, and sitting within a sector addressing needs, then you are in the right place.\"</p><p>These quality stocks should also deliver regular dividends, increasingly becoming the yield investors are missing out on in bond markets, adds Mr Acket, although he warns investors should see these payments as an added benefit rather than the sole reason for buying a particular company.</p><p>\"If you just buy dividends you do the same mistake as you would going into high yield bonds - forgetting that underlying it is something that could be a lousy investment which would risk your capital. Don't go for the bait of a dividend promise... the search for yield can make people blind and too greedy.\"</p><p>Stay active</p><p>Despite the growth of passive strategies (see View from Morningstar on p45), in a market such as the US, sitting where it is in the economic cycle, active management is absolutely vital, argues Amundi's Mr Melhuish, as an exchanged traded fund (ETF) cannot pick up the valuation stories.</p><p>\"You can buy sector ETFs, or some of the factor ETFs could be relevant. But to pick out those companies on an intra-sector basis, you really need an active manager.\"</p><p>This is typically the point in the cycle to rely on alpha rather than beta, he believes.</p><p>\"The cycle is quite mature, making big headline returns between now and whatever ends this cycle is going to be more difficult, so you really need to start peering deeply inside the market. Active managers are much better at doing that than passive strategies,\" adds Mr Melhuish.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PWMGT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PWMGT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KP4-1JJ1-JDJ9-H1DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">336091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2210\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Professional Wealth Management (PWM)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>August 1, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Globally, Apple iPhone and China's Xiaomi grew their market shares while Huawei sales continued to haemorrhage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kantar says smartphone purchasing shifted online in most reported markets, and accounted for nearly two-thirds of sales in the quarter. Sales were up by at least 11pc in the EU5, USA and Japan, compared to the same quarter last year. (The EU5 comprises France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.)</p><p>Apple's second generation cheaper phone the iPhone SE, and Phone 11 were winners in the quarter, and iPhone sales even toppled those of the embattled Huawei in China. Samsung's cheaper mid-range A series phones also sold well.</p><p>\"Both iPhone SE and iPhone 11 interchangeably take the top 1 and 2 model seller spots in EU5, USA, Australia, Japan and even in China, where Huawei is almost half of smartphone sales, iPhone 11 is the number 1 model sold,\" says Jennifer Chan, insight director for Kantar.</p><p>\"Samsung A series sales performance continues in positive strides, with 2019 A series out-performing sales of A series 2020 launches. The appeal of A series has left a tough act for Samsung S20 flagship to follow,\" she says. \"Of the EU5 markets, S20 flagships only appear in the top 10 model sellers in Great Britain.\"</p><p>She says Kantar has been tracking the rise of cheaper smartphones by premium manufacturers such as Samsung A series and iPhone SE. \"The emphasis on high quality smartphones, at a fraction of flagship prices, couldn't be more relevant at a time when many consumers are feeling financial pressures as a result of COVID-19.\"</p><p>She says since Google announced it was pulling Huawei's Android license, Huawei sales hade been diminishing across Europe, Australia and Japan. \" Meanwhile, support for the local brand in China prevails, accounting for 48pc of sales, up 5pc year-on-year.\" </p><p>She says Huawei's association with being a national security concern was creating not only physical barriers for the brand's future launches, but also mental barriers for consumers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">10.00am: </emphasis>US police mass \"geo-scanning\" under fire            </p><p>US police use of a type of warrant to monitor Google users' locations en masse is staring down its first legal and political challenges as scrutiny of law enforcement tactics grows.</p><p>Criminal defendants in Virginia and San Francisco are disputing \"geofence\" warrants, which authorities can use to scan geographic areas and time periods for suspects through user location histories stored by technology companies. As these motions await arguments and potential decisions as soon as August, New York lawmakers are pushing legislation to ban the practice.</p><p>Police turned in both cases to Alphabet, Google, which says the number of such requests grew 1,500 per cent from 2017 to 2018, and an additional 500 per cent from 2018 to 2019. The search and advertising giant created a special process to fulfil the warrants but has raised concerns that the demands made by law enforcement invade privacy.</p><p>Privacy advocates fear that compliance by Google could lead authorities to seek similar data from fitness trackers, ride-share apps and other companies if more of those businesses begin to store users' granular location histories to hone their products and services.</p><p>\"We're going to see this ever-expanding universe of geolocation warrants that will be tracking huge numbers of people if we don't outlaw the practice,\" said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a non-profit advocacy group.</p><p>The pushback coincidentally comes amid a drumbeat of criticism of law enforcement after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Wall Street Journal.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">9.25am: </emphasis>Facebook sues EU            </p><p>Facebook is suing EU antitrust regulators for seeking information beyond what is necessary, including highly personal details, for their investigations into the company's data and marketplace, the U.S. social media group says.</p><p>Facebook has been under EU competition enforcers' scrutiny since last year, with one investigation focused on its trove of data and the other on its online marketplace launched in 2016 and used by 800 million Facebook users in 70 countries to buy and sell items.</p><p>The company has since then provided 315,000 documents equivalent to 1.7 million pages to the Commission.</p><p>\"The exceptionally broad nature of the Commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the Commission's investigations, including highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees,\" Facebook associate general counsel Tim Lamb said in a statement.</p><p>\"We think such requests should be reviewed by the EU Courts.\"</p><p>The Commission said it would defend its case in court.</p><p>EU regulators comb through documents looking for about 2,500 search phrases which include \"big question\", \"shut down\" and \"not good for us\", said a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>The person said such search terms could be found in employees' health information, performance evaluation and even job applications to the company which are not relevant to the EU investigations.</p><p>In addition to the two lawsuits against the Commission, Facebook is also seeking interim measures at the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, to halt such data requests until judges rule, according to a court filing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reuters</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> 9.05am: </emphasis>               Big tech's mandatory code coming            </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>Fresh off a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/google-faces-accc-data-consent-case/news-story/b64f3ff2a994367eb8a7265f417c5cab\">blockbuster day in which he announced Federal Court action against Google</url>, ACCC boss Rod Sims is expected to hand down his mandatory bargaining code between media companies and the tech giants today.</p><p>The parties were initially told to negotiate a voluntary bargaining code earlier this year, before talks broke down.</p><p>The code will dictate to what extent the tech giants will be forced to pay media companies for use of their content.</p><p>The mandatory code will apply at least to Facebook's News Feed and Google Search, as well as potentially Instagram and WhatsApp - both owned by Facebook - and hardware services like Google Assistant and Android TV.</p><p>Payment could be made to publishers through a number of options, including that publishers negotiate individually with the tech giants, or that they collectively bargain to reach a more favourable outcome.</p><p>Mr Sims <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/media-tech-giants-split-on-revenue-sharing/news-story/55756afe8137621322b405adfb9dd26c\">told The Australian in May it became clear early on during the discussions that the goalposts were too far apart</url> for the parties to be able to reach an agreement.</p><p>\"The question the government put to us in April was not 'how pleasant are the meetings and how much discussion is going on'; the question the government put to us is 'Do you really think, as you see it now, that we'll get there?', and the best, honest answer was that the revenue share particularly was going to be something they would not agree on,\" Mr Sims told The Australian.</p><p>\"We got that mainly from seeing how that issue was being dealt with and what the various responses were. A lot of talk was going on, very pleasant talk, but there wasn't much progress, so really you have to exercise the compulsory option. Given the very different positions of the parties, with all the best will in the world ... ultimately this is going to have to be imposed.</p><p>\"This is a big regulatory step to take. Yes, you can ask should it have been done some time ago, but big steps often need quite a build-up and this has had one.\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/><emphasis

Now <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>chief executive of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>plans to start shifting people toward private conversations and away from public broadcasting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who runs <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, on Wednesday expressed his intentions to change the essential nature of social media. Instead of encouraging public posts, he said he would focus on private and encrypted communications, in which users message mostly smaller groups of people they know. Unlike publicly shared posts that are kept as users' permanent records, the communications could also be deleted after a certain period of time. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  He said <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>would achieve the shift partly by integrating Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger so that users worldwide could easily message one another across the networks. In effect, he said, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>would change from being a digital town square to creating a type of ''digital living room,'' where people could expect their discussions to be intimate, ephemeral and secure from outsiders.</p><p>  ''We're building a foundation for social communication aligned with the direction people increasingly care about: messaging each other privately,'' Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said in an interview on Wednesday. In a blog post, he added that as he thought about the future of the internet, ''I believe a privacy-focused communications platform will become even more important than today's open platforms.''</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>plan -- in which the company is playing catch-up to how people are already communicating digitally -- raises new questions, not the least of which is whether it can realistically pull off a privacy-focused platform. The Silicon Valley giant, valued at $490 billion, depends on people openly sharing posts to be able to target advertising to them. While the company will not eradicate public sharing, a proliferation of private and secure communications could potentially hurt its business model.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>also faces concerns about what the change means for people's data and whether it was being anti-competitive by knitting together WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, which historically have been separate and operated autonomously.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was vague on many details of the shift, including how long it would take to enact and whether that meant Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger would share user information and other contact details with one another. He did not address how private, encrypted communications would affect <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>bottom line.</p><p>  But Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>did acknowledge the skepticism that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>would be able to change. ''Frankly we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services, and we've historically focused on tools for more open sharing,'' he wrote in his blog post. ''But we've repeatedly shown that we can evolve to build the services that people really want, including in private messaging and stories.''</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>move is set to redefine how people use social media and how they will connect with one another. That has societal, political and national security implications given the grip that the company's services have on more than 2.7 billion users around the world. In some countries, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and its other apps are often considered as being the internet.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>decision follows years of scandal for the social network, much of it originating from public sharing of posts. Foreign agents from countries like Russia have used <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to publish disinformation, in an attempt to sway elections. Some communities have used <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>Groups to strengthen ideologies around issues such as anti-vaccination. And firms have harvested the material that people openly shared for all manner of purposes, including targeting advertising and creating voter profiles.</p><p>  Even WhatsApp, which has long been encrypted, has grappled with the distribution of misinformation through its service, sometimes with deadly consequences.</p><p>  All of that has put <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in the spotlight, which in turn has badly damaged the company's reputation and created mistrust with users. Regulators have intensified scrutiny of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>privacy practices, with the Federal Trade Commission considering a multibillion-dollar fine against the company for violating a 2011 privacy consent decree. Last week, the agency said it would create a task force to monitor big tech companies and potential anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has repeatedly tried to rid <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>of toxic content, disinformation and other problems. At one point, he emphasized prioritizing what friends and family shared on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and de-emphasizing content from publishers and brands. He has also said that the company will hire more people to comb through and remove abusive or dangerous posts, and that it is working on artificial intelligence tools to do that job.</p><p>  But none of those moves addressed the issue of public sharing. And in many ways, consumers were already moving en masse toward more private methods of digital communications.</p><p>  Snap, the maker of the Snapchat app, has built a young, loyal audience by allowing people to share messages and stories for a finite period of time, for example. Other companies, like the local social networking company Nextdoor, focus on the power of group and community communications. And closed, private messaging services like Signal and Telegram have also become more prominent.</p><p>  Evan Spiegel, chief executive of Snap, hinted at the problems that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>News Feed had created last week at a New York Times conference. Because of the way social networks had been constructed for people to publicly share content, he said, ''things that are negative actually spread faster and further than things that are positive.'' He later added, ''You know, I certainly think there's a lot of opportunity to sort of course-correct here.''</p><p>  In many ways, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is now emulating a strategy popularized by Tencent, the Chinese internet company that makes the messaging app WeChat. WeChat has become the de facto portal to the rest of the internet for Chinese citizens because through the app, users can perform a multitude of tasks, like pay for items, communicate with friends and order takeout.</p><p>  [Video:  Watch on YouTube.]</p><p>  ''<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is focused on mobile and messaging as the key conduit for people to communicate online, and thereby to communicate with <person><nameText>Facebook,</nameText></person>'' said Ashkan Soltani, an independent privacy and security researcher who was a former chief technologist at the F.T.C. ''The chat app essentially becomes your browser.''</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said that even though he would focus on private and secure conversations, the public forums for communication popularized by <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>would continue. In addition, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger will remain stand-alone apps, even as their underlying messaging infrastructures are woven together, The Times previously reported. The work, which will include adding end-to-end encryption across all the apps, is in the early stages.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said this overall shift would ultimately create new opportunities for <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>  ''We're thinking about private messaging in a way that we can build the tools to make that better,'' he said in the interview. ''There's all kinds of different commerce opportunities, especially in developing countries. There's more private tools to be built around peoples' location. There's just a whole set of broader utilities we can build that fit this more intimate mode of sharing.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>the chief executive of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>said he would now focus on private and encrypted communications, in which users message mostly smaller groups of people they know.

That would be some achievement, given that most trade deals take years as they get bogged down in the minutiae of rules and regulations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Never rule out a miracle, of course, but let's just see how these good intentions roll down the snowy hills of Davos as reality sinks in next week,\" analysts at Rabobank International said in a note to investors.</p><p>Britain could be a focal point. It leaves the EU on Jan. 31 and will then open parallel trade discussions with both the U.S. and the EU. And the U.S. and the EU have just started their own discussions as U.S. President Donald Trump turns his focus away from China, after the conclusion of a first round of trade talks with Beijing.</p><p>Members of Mr. Trump's cabinet talked up the prospects of a swift trade deal with Britain and argued that it should be relatively straightforward given how similar the two economies are.</p><p>At a news briefing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he's heading to London this weekend to meet with his British counterpart, Sajid Javid, to discuss an array of issues including trade.</p><p>\"It's an absolute priority of President Trump and we expect to complete that within this year,\" Mr. Mnuchin said.</p><p>Although Mr. Javid has said that negotiating a trade deal with the EU will be his \"top priority,\" discussions with the U.S. will take place at the same time.</p><p>Mr. Mnuchin said that was \"obviously an aggressive timeline.\"</p><p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the U.S. and Britain shouldn't be too difficult, as the two economies have more in common than they do with the EU.</p><p>\"Both are very heavily servicesoriented and within services, such as financial services, there's already a pretty high degree of integration and co-ordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Ross also sought to dampen concerns raised in Britain that a future trade deal would mean higher drug prices as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain's staterun National Health Service.</p><p>Although the U.S. is important, Britain conducts far more business with the other 27 countries of the EU - that's why so many businesses want economic relations to be as close as possible.</p><p>Paolo Gentiloni, the former Italian prime minister who is now the EU's main economy commissioner, said he welcomes the clarity over Brexit after last month's convincing election win by Boris Johnson's Conservative Party.</p><p>\"Eleven months for a free-trade agreement is really very short if we look at other free-trade agreements, but the EU is ready to do all in our power to have the best possible relation with the U.K.,\" he said. \"It's not easy in 11 months, but I think it is still possible.\"</p><p>How quickly a deal can be reached will depend on what Britain is looking for. Mr. Javid has insisted Britain will not stick to EU rules and regulations, which could make a deal harder.</p><p>\"Of course, we won't suddenly stop being part of this continent of like-minded countries in eight days,\" Mr. Javid told an audience of business leaders in Davos.</p><p>\"Both sides in the debate want our close relationship to continue, but that relationship is going to change.\"</p><p>The final piece of the trade jigsaw relates to the U.S. and the EU, and discussions have begun as Mr. Trump turns his gaze to what he considers to be the unfair treatment of U.S. businesses by Brussels.</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's new president, said a deal could be secured \"within weeks,\" an aspiration that took many close observers by surprise and wasn't wholly shared by U.S. officials.</p><p>She didn't lay out the scope of any such agreement, but she appeared intent on avoiding any tariffs on European carmakers, which Mr. Trump has threatened repeatedly in recent days.</p><p>Mr. Mnuchin said the purpose of tariffs, and the threat of them, \"is to get free, fair and reciprocal trade.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, France agreed to delay its tax on big tech firms such as Google and Facebook Inc.</p><p>in exchange for a U.S. promise to hold off its retaliatory tariffs on French cheese and wine. Discussions on an international approach to digital taxes will now take place under the auspices of the Paris-based Organization or Economic Co-operation and Development.</p><p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the agreement was a big win for France's \"aggressive\" approach. \"If France would not have been the first European country to introduce a national digital taxation, there would not be any discussion at the OECD level anymore,\" he said Thursday. \"It would have been buried, to be very clear. So we can be tough. We can be offensive.\"</p><p>The approach seems to be setting the tone for what are likely to be complicated discussions between the EU and the U.S.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20200124rbibdavostrade</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6058-NW71-F06S-323Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

I will first explain the similarities and differences between the two bodies of law, and second suggest lessons from cross-fertilization.</p><p>I attach a short interview of me on the subject of US/EU competition law and big tech, and my article, \"Why Europe Is Different.\"</p><p>I. A COMPARISON</p><p>The United States</p><p>The US Sherman Act was enacted in 1890 to control the power of the big trusts. Senator John Sherman famously said: \"If we will not endure a king..., we should not endure a king of trade.\"1 Through major legislation in 1914 (the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act) and 1950 (the Cellar Kefauver merger act), Congress extended the reach of the law to control power, to protect the little guy, and to stem a rising tide of economic concentration for social, political and economic ends. Congress tried to ensure against fascism, at one end, and communism, at the other, by protecting the market. Antitrust was the economic democracy of the market.2 But through the years the Supreme Court excessively expanded the law's reach, condemning some perfectly normal aggressive business behavior, and, beginning especially in 1981 with the Reagan Administration, the Supreme Court set about to cut back the reach of the law. Case by case, the law changed to an efficiency prescription. For mergers the paradigm became: There should be no antitrust intervention unless the transaction would decrease consumer surplus. In monopoly cases, the Court assumed and assumes that what firms do is good for consumers; that freedom of even dominant firms will produce the most efficiency and innovation and thus will be best for consumers, competitiveness and markets. Today in US monopoly law (Section 2 of the Sherman Act), there is relatively small scope for condemnation of conduct as anticompetitive. To be condemned, the acts must not only constitute a use of monopoly power; they must create more monopoly power or at least entrench existing power. And by default presumption, the Court assumes that this will not happen; that the market will work.3 Many lower courts, and often our two excellent federal antitrust agencies, are more watchful watchdogs against abuses of power than Supreme Court jurisprudence would predict.</p><p>Europe</p><p>Meanwhile in Europe, at the end of World War II, a critical core of European nations resolved to create a new structure of governance so as never to have a war again. Six nations, led by Germany, France and Italy, formed first the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951/52 and then the European Economic Community in 1957/58. The project depended upon community - upon a single European market. As Adam Smith said, people who trade (intensely) together don't fight wars with one another. They come to respect one another and leave hatreds behind.4 Free trade in the internal market was at the heart of the conception. That meant border barriers must fall. But as the founders correctly anticipated, once tariffs and quotas were abolished, private firms would conspire to re-erect them, and they did. Moreover, most of the nations had their own national champions, often state- owned, and almost always beneficiaries of state-conferred privilege. Thus it was necessary to include antitrust within the Treaty itself, to prevent private power and privileged enterprises from undermining community. As a result, the EU Treaty contains Article 101, against anticompetitive agreements, and Article 102, against abuse of dominance.5</p><p>Like the US, the EU went through two important phases with regard to the question: When is single-firm conduct anticompetitive? In the first stage, EU law was formalistic. It was very hard on dominant firm conduct that had exclusionary effects on smaller firms. It contained broad presumptions against, for example, exclusive contracts by dominant firms. The second phase came in the 1990s and even more dramatically in the first decade of the new millennium, epitomized by the 2009 guidance on dominant firm conduct.6 In this second phase, the European Commission adopted, and the Courts followed, a more economic approach.7 While incorporating economic analysis into the law, Europe retained certain guiding principles and approaches reflecting the place of antitrust in the Treaty. These approaches include: EU law is about community and integration. EU competition law is sympathetic with EU's internal market free-movement law, which stresses the importance of free movement across Member State lines. Likewise, EU law is antagonistic to Member State restraints and the privileges they grant to favored firms. It views such restraints and privileges as distortions of competition. Both aspects - respect for free movement and antagonism to state restraints - are imported into EU competition law and specifically into abuse of dominance law. EU competition law stresses market access and the right to contest markets on the merits. It is sympathetic to access to networks. It is hostile to dominant firms' using leverage to take advantages for themselves at the expense of competitors, thereby \"unleveling the playing field.\" It does not aim to protect inefficient competitors. Rather, EU precedents safeguard a clearer path of the outsider to access markets on the merits, free from obstructions by dominant firms. Nonetheless, from the point of view of detractors who worry about excessive enforcement against dominant firms, the EU approach does protect competitors.</p><p>Presumption and Divergence</p><p>EU competition law adopted its more economic approach nearly two decades ago. However, it never adopted the Chicago School premises. It does not assume markets work well. It does not admonish: Trust the market - especially not when the market is concentrated and dominated by a single firm. It does not presume that antitrust intervention is likely to mess up the market and chill competition and innovation. Its teaching implies a belief that lowering barriers to entry and keeping a clear path for challengers is likely to make the market more dynamic and thus serve consumers better. When dealing with innovation incentives, US cases are likely to assume that antitrust action against a dominant firm will chill the firm's incentives to invent.8 EU law is more likely to find that the dominant firm's challenged conduct will chill the outsiders' incentives to invent, and has documented this effect in specific cases. While US competition law abhors duties of dominant firms to deal with competitors, calling such duties \"forced sharing,\" undermining incentives to invent,10 EU law applies a contrary principle: Dominant firms, especially firms with power in one market who compete in an adjacent market, have the special responsibility not to impair rivals' competition on the merits.</p><p>Both jurisdictions want to preserve and facilitate sustainable low pricing even if it displaces small firms that can't keep up with the competition, but US law makes it harder than does EU law to attack below cost pricing. US law requires the plaintiff to prove a probable recoupment scenario (defendant must be likely to recover its losses by charging monopoly prices high enough and long enough after the predatory siege).11 EU law does not require proof of probable recoupment where the dominant firm had exclusionary intent.12 It is enough that the predator thought the scheme was worth it.</p><p>Despite these different presumptions and principles, much of the unilateral conduct law is virtually identical on both sides of the ocean. But the different presumptions and principles have resulted in diametrically different results on nearly identical facts in some key cases, especially regarding refusal to deal, as described in my attached article, Why Europe is Different.13</p><p>II. Implications for Big Tech, Big Data</p><p>The big tech, big data firms are posing challenges to this country and to the world. A handful of high tech giants are dominating markets. The firms generally were started from scratch by entrepreneurs with great ideas that have attracted millions of users. They are networks and make use of network effects, which please consumers (who get more friends or suppliers or buyers), but create high barriers to entry and, with it, power. They offer their products on one side of the market for zero; on the other side they make huge revenues from advertising, often by selling the data of their users. They operate with low-price models, not the high prices that have traditionally attracted antitrust attention. Some have been exposed for serious misuses of data. Some have waged media campaigns of false information against critics.</p><p>The platforms that offer services in competition with their customers tend to prefer their own products and demote their rivals, to stamp out creative rivals by appropriating their ideas, to mine the data of the firms they host to provide the next big thing, and to breach privacy. Are the firms violating the competition laws? Does it depend on whether the laws are those of the US or those of the EU? It might.</p><p>The new forms of business, even to the extent that they may be abusive, pose challenging questions under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The market definitions are difficult and contestable. Monopoly power may be hard to prove, especially if, as usual, power is measured by the extent to which the firm can raise price above a competitive price for a significant time. Anticompetitive conduct may be difficult to prove, especially if the plaintiff must establish, as frequently demanded, that the conduct lowers output and raises prices.</p><p>Under EU competition law, the case is easier to make. EU law is less demanding of proof of the market. Moreover, a firm might hold a dominant position even when it does not have monopoly power or be dangerously likely to get it as demanded in the United States. It might be a gatekeeper rather than a traditional monopolist. A firm might abuse its dominance when it uses its power in one market to get significant competitive advantages in an adjacent market by blocking competitors' access by conduct that has no competitive merit. An important platform might abuse its dominance under EU law by refusing to deal fairly with a competing rival on the platform when the refusal squeezes out an otherwise efficient rival.</p><p>These qualities of EU law make it a more flexible tool than the Sherman Act to deal with the new problems of high tech/big data. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair methods of competition, also has this flexibility. The flexibility does not prejudge the answers. The European Commission and Courts14 and the US FTC would want to consider all of the facts; they would consider the reasons for and benefits of the challenged conduct. They would consider the effects on innovation on both sides - the insider seeking to justify its strategy and the outsider or user seeking fair, non- discriminatory, transparent and nonexploitative treatment. The European Commission and the US FTC can consider the consumer protection as well as the antitrust the problems; and the European Commission may consider any violations of the European privacy directive. A holistic treatment of the issues might be what we need.</p><p>The standard for analysis: US/EU</p><p>I will comment on the standard for analysis: What is anticompetitive? Here, perhaps surprisingly, US and EU competition law converge in broad concept, even while displaying big differences in presumptions and applications. Both the US and the EU, by their antitrust laws, are trying to protect the market. Neither law protects inefficient competitors from competition itself. Both laws welcome the winds of competition and sustained low pricing. The Court of Justice expresses the goal of EU competition law variously as protecting consumers' interests and as protecting the interests of all market players - meaning all but those who want protection or privilege.15 The US Supreme Court sometimes says the goal of US antitrust is consumer welfare and sometimes says (as did Justice Breyer in Leegin) \"to maintain a marketplace free of anticompetitive practices.\"16 This is the market goal, the robust market goal, or the market process goal. What it does not admit into the antitrust paradigm is protection of non-competition interests.</p><p>There is a false dichotomy afoot that says: Either we protect the tried and true standard of consumer welfare17 or we sink into a mire of special interests. The real dichotomy is antitrust as market law versus antitrust without market boundaries. US antitrust and EU competition law are market law. This, of course, is the tip of another inquiry - What interventions are good and important to help make the market work better for the good of the people, or to prevent its degradation by the use of economic power? This essay has described two points of view or perspective in answer to the question. Still, the basic market facts that the analyst needs to know are virtually the same.</p><p>Does Europe Discriminate?</p><p>I am of course aware that various colleagues and even Presidents have accused the European Commission of suing successful American high tech firms because they are successful. I have read the European decisions and judgments carefully and I do not believe that the European Commission has discriminated against American firms. The principles applied by the EU courts and Commission to the US firms are principles deeply embedded in the European competition law jurisprudence. Breaking company with US law, EU competition law imposes on dominant firms responsibilities to deal fairly with rivals that are their customers. The whole EU Treaty exudes sympathy with non-discriminatory market access. It is not surprising that President of the European Commission Junker listed second in his 10 Commission priorities for 2015-19: a digital single market.18 And it is worthy of note that cases very similar to the EU cases have been brought or advocated to be brought in the United States.19</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>The US antitrust law on monopolization and the EU competition law on abuse of dominance share much in common. They proscribe the anticompetitive conduct of dominant or monopoly firms. However they often part ways in their application, because the United States maintains a default posture that even dominant firms tend to act in the interests of consumers, and a perspective that duties to deal are perverse because they undercut incentives (of the dominant firm) to invent; and in Europe the dominant firm has the responsibility not to obstruct outsiders' efficient competition on the merits, and Europe (more clearly) aspires to unleash outsiders' as well as incumbents' innovation. This century has revealed new forms of competition and innovation and also new forms of power and its abuse. For solutions, we may need law flexible enough and enforcers wise and knowledgeable enough to deal with these new sources and uses of power.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGTST-20189200001174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGTST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0R-NX81-JDJ1-T49M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Thanks to that immunity, U.S. companies have built massive profit engines around material such as Facebook posts, Instagram photos and YouTube videos, without having to screen them ahead of time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and European Union are starting to chip away at those protections, driven by growing concern about hoaxes, hate speech and other online bad behavior.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In April, President Donald Trump signed a law holding online companies liable for \"knowingly\" hosting content that enables sex trafficking. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are talking about carving out a similar exception for illegal opioid sales.</p><p>In Brussels, meanwhile, the European Commission recently introduced a bill that would require sites like Facebook to take down terrorist content - Islamic State videos, for example - within an hour of being flagged by authorities, or face still-unspecified penalties. The move follows updates to EU copyright and audiovisual media laws that require platforms like YouTube and Amazon to more actively monitor for violations, including online copyright infringements and inappropriate ad placements.</p><p>The growing legal risks could force Google, Facebook and Twitter to take a far more active role in managing the content that flows through their platforms - a mammoth task given the vast numbers of tweets, snaps, blog posts, ads and other material involved. Google-owned YouTube alone posts 400 hours of user-uploaded videos each minute, and the company boasted last year that its users watch a billion hours' worth every day.</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who helped write America's tech liability provision in the 1990s, warned that the internet as we know it would cease to exist if the industry's legal protections disappear.</p><p>\"If websites, ISPs, text message services, video game companies and any other type of platform were held liable for every word and deed they facilitated or somehow enabled, the entire system would shut down,\" Wyden told POLITICO. Without the U.S. law, \"collaboration and communication on the internet would simply cease,\" he said.</p><p>But the tech industry's once-golden reputation has taken hits amid a series of damaging revelations, including Russia's manipulation of social media and Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data scandal. And even tech allies like Wyden concede that if the internet giants don't do a better job of cleaning up their services, their favorable legal status is in jeopardy.</p><p>\"You don't use the sword, there's going to be powerful interests that are going to say, 'Here's the opportunity for us to lead an effort in the Congress to take away the shield,'\" he said.</p><p>Efforts to revamp the laws underpinning tech platforms are still at an early stage and could still be derailed. But the fact that officials on both sides of the Atlantic are taking aim at the provisions - Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the EU's E-Commerce Directive - shows how much attitudes toward the major tech companies have shifted in the past few years.</p><p>In the early years of the World Wide Web, as millions of ordinary people began flocking to the internet, U.S. and European policymakers saw a need to protect young online companies from lawsuits that could drive them out of business. Section 230 dates back to 1996, while the E-Commerce Directive followed in 2000.</p><p>But the landscape has changed dramatically since then. The number of internet users has exploded, reaching an estimated 3.6 billion worldwide in 2018, according to eMarketer, a digital market research firm. And giant companies like Google and Facebook - which didn't even exist when the U.S. law came into force - now dominate the advertising-driven online economy.</p><p>Politicians on both the left and right spent years lauding the tech industry and its innovative spirit. But today, many are beginning to ask why these companies, which play such a central role in society and daily life, shouldn't be regulated like, say, broadcasters or utilities. Former White House strategist Steve Bannon is among those who have called for utility-style oversight of Facebook and Google. </p><p>U.S. lawmakers kicked off the effort this year with their anti- sex-trafficking bill, which drew broad bipartisan support as Congress overrode tech companies' resistance to any tinkering with the immunity provision. </p><p>Around the same time, the EU followed with its terrorist, copyright and media provisions. It's a sign that European lawmakers, frustrated that tech companies aren't moving fast enough to address their concerns, are shifting from away from an old reliance on non-binding recommendations. </p><p>\"Reforming the E-Commerce Directive is unavoidable,\" said Marietje Schaake, a Dutch Liberals member of the European Parliament who specializes in digital rights. \"De facto steps taken by big tech platforms to tackle terrorist content, disinformation and copyright infringements already make their claims of being 'neutral' dubious.\"</p><p>The pressure is likely to grow in the coming months, as political leaders see an upside to going after tech companies and the legal foundations on which they rest.</p><p>On the American side, the issue has gotten caught up in the 2018 midterm elections. Republicans, who have increasingly accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of being biased against conservative views, repeatedly questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other tech executives at congressional hearings about why they still deserve Section 230 protections. Trump has joined the complaints, accusing Google of rigging its search results against him and \"controlling what we can &amp; cannot see.\"</p><p>And members of both parties have raised the idea of weakening Section 230 further by making internet companies responsible for the illegal sale of opioid drugs on their platforms. </p><p>\"Do you all feel any responsibility?\" Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), whose state has been hit hard by opioid abuse, asked Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a Senate hearing last month. \"A lot of people have been affected and a lot of people have died receiving information about how to obtain drugs through y'all's platforms.\"</p><p>In Europe, France and Britain are calling for a full reopening of the E-Commerce Directive, to crack down on the spread of hate, racism and disinformation. </p><p>Early this year, France proposed legislation to curb the spread of hoaxes and fake news, in the wake of Russian meddling in the 2017 French presidential election. And last month, French Prime Minister \u00e9douard Philippe unveiled a measure to penalize platforms that don't do enough to stem the spread of hate speech and racism. He said hate is spreading in online spaces \"with impunity\" and argued that the only solution is tighter time limits for companies to take down material - with sanctions for inaction.</p><p>\"Public opinion is so poor that people are ready to discuss, to take action,\" France's digital secretary, Mounir Mahjoubi, told POLITICO. \"Because of this public opinion, we can't sit around without reacting. If not, the government will seem weak on this subject and we could endanger the situation even further.\"</p><p>British Prime Minister Theresa May's government has expressed similar frustrations, saying it's \"assessing legislative options to modify the online liability regime in the U.K.,\" including changes that \"may be possible when we leave the EU.\" The implication was that Britain could go further than Brussels in setting up strict new rules once it's left the bloc as part of Brexit. </p><p>It's an opportunity \"to write a set of laws that are absolutely right for the modern times,\" said former U.K. digital minister Matt Hancock.</p><p>The industry has pushed back hard on multiple fronts. </p><p>In Congress, the biggest tech brands and their trade groups and allies have furiously lobbied to keep Section 230 intact, fearing that the sex trafficking bill opened the door to further erosion of the law.

And as ugly as the war of words over NATO was at the summit in London, the fight over trade could go on even longer, with Trump reacting harshly to Macron's imposition of a digital services tax[2] that will hit big U.S. tech firms like Google and Amazon. The rising tension over the digital tax and U.S. tariffs reflects a fundamental disagreement over how to deal with the multinational digital giants, most of which are American, and could easily spread to other European countries. Like France, many other countries are considering similar fixes to a glaring loophole in the international tax code that allows digital 'products' to go untaxed and has defied any sort of consensus solution for years. </p><p>The United States singled out Italy, Austria, and Turkey as potentially the next victims of U.S. tariffs. 'It may be that the administration is thinking, 'We need to pressure France to make sure the others don't follow along,'' said Simon Lester, a trade expert at the Cato Institute. The new acrimony also comes as Trump seems to have rediscovered his love of tariffs after briefly hitting the pause button on his many trade wars. On Monday, the World Trade Organization (WTO) gave the United States approval to slap tariffs on billions of dollars more in European goods due to continued European state support for Airbus. Also on Monday, Trump turned on Brazil and Argentina, announcing tariffs on their steel exports due to alleged currency manipulation, catching government officials in both countries off guard and scrambling[3] to placate Washington. On Tuesday, Trump said he's in no hurry[4] to finalize a tiny trade deal with China (which would mean lifting some tariffs), which sent stock markets plunging. 'It's just the status quo of Trump using tariffs for various purposes\u2014whether to raise revenue or to gain negotiating leverage or to get other countries to change their policies,' Lester said. 'It's just more of the same.' Trump later dismissed the fight over the 'Google tax' as a minor disagreement, but relations between Washington, Paris, and Brussels are already strained. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire took aim at the latest Trump tariff threat, saying[5], 'It's not worthy of an ally, and it's not the behavior we expect from the U.S. toward one of its main allies,' while also warning that Europe would retaliate. That would further escalate a trade war between the United States and Europe that has already included U.S. duties on European steel, European countermeasures, and an ongoing fight over state support for the aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus that has led to tit-for-tat tariffs on billions more goods. The French Economy and Finance Ministry said it wants to see a global solution to the digital tax question but in the meantime is working with the European Commission to prepare responses to U.S. tariffs. Trump's latest escalation of trade tensions comes at a critical time for the global economy\u2014and for the international order that has propped up global trade in recent decades. Trade wars between the United States, China, and Europe have chilled global investment and driven forecasters like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to trim global growth forecasts[6] to their lowest level since the financial crisis a decade ago, while red lights are blinking in the U.S. manufacturing sector[7]. Meanwhile, the organization in charge of regulating the rules of global trade is itself facing an existential threat: Due to U.S. obstruction, the WTO's appeals system, which ultimately adjudicates trade fights between countries, will cease to function next week. The Trump administration's latest front in its trade battle with Europe is over France's imposition of a digital tax on big tech firms (which are largely American) that make a lot of money overseas but pay little there in taxes. The Trump administration late Monday released the findings of its investigation into the French law and found[8] that it is 'unreasonable, discriminatory, and burdens U.S. commerce.' France argues that the law, which also affects European and Chinese firms, isn't meant to target U.S. tech giants. In response, the administration drew up a list[9] of $2.4 billion worth of high-end French exports\u2014from Gruyere cheese to handbags to champagne\u2014that could be hit with tariffs of up to 100 percent by early next year in retaliation. It's not clear the U.S. actions will make France think twice\u2014let alone other countries. French officials insisted[10] Tuesday that they will go ahead as planned with the digital tax despite U.S. threats, and other countries[11] including the U.K., Turkey, Spain, Italy, and Canada all have plans to impose digital taxes or proposals to do so. But France might not be able to hold out alone against the might of the U.S. economy, despite early vows of resistance. And other countries will be watching. 'Other countries are likely to think twice before moving ahead with their draft laws,' said Julien Nocetti, an associate fellow at the French Institute of International Relations. 'If they see France withdraw its own project, they will surely backpedal.' For other observers, Trump's actions are losing their dissuasive powers. 'There have been so many unilateral actions. No one is in the mood to back down,' Lester said. For now, the U.S. threat of tariffs on France is not set in stone; the Trump administration could file a complaint against France at the soon-to-be-paralyzed WTO or even use the threat of tariffs to jump-start international talks on a global solution for how to tax digital companies with worldwide operations and little local tax exposure. Those talks have made a lot of progress, Nocetti said, so a global consensus is possible. Remarkably, the trade fight with France isn't the only conflagration the Trump administration has started this week. Trump's out-of-the-blue tweet early Monday that he was applying tariffs 'immediately[12]' on Brazil and Argentina\u2014ostensibly because they have driven down the value of their currencies to gain a trade advantage\u2014sowed concern and confusion in Brasliaand Buenos Aires. Brazil in particular has bent over backward to accommodate the Trump administration and seemed shocked to be targeted with punitive sanctions\u2014especially when its currency floats freely and isn't subject to government meddling one way or the other. Those aren't the only problems with those tariff threats (and it's still not clear, Trump's tweet notwithstanding, if they will actually be levied or not). The official justification for those tariffs on steel and aluminum, first broached in 2018, is concern about U.S. national security. National security concerns as a rule do not include the value of foreign countries' currencies. Moreover, the window for using that national security argument for steel tariffs has already closed, as a U.S. trade court recently ruled[13]. That's why many trade experts view even tariffs on Brazil and Argentina as illegal[14]. Regardless of the legality of the proposed tariffs, they also could create problems for other U.S. trade relations\u2014like the ongoing talks with China to reach some sort of mini-deal that will stave off further tariff escalation between the world's two biggest economies. Trump's broadside against Brazil and Argentina is being watched by other countries that are trying to reach limited trade agreements with the United States, Lester said\u2014and that kind of payback to pliant allies does not go unnoticed. 'There is a danger. I'm not sure how anyone can trust the Trump administration to stick to their agreements,' he said. Not that China and the United States were about to ink their 'phase one' deal anytime soon. Trump on Tuesday reiterated that he could push back any such agreement\u2014which just days ago was 'millimeters away[15]'\u2014until after next year's election. That spells another full year of uncertainty for business, increased costs for U.S. firms and consumers who have to pay[16] the tariffs, and shrinking export markets for U.S. farmers who've seen countries like Brazil and Argentina eat their lunch by selling to China. But for Trump, who famously proclaimed himself 'Tariff Man,' that's just business as usual.

The United States and Washington accelerated negotiations on a new framework enabling firms to easily transfer personal data across the Atlantic after the previous one was struck down by a top EU court last year on concerns about US snooping. Under European Union data protection law, companies cannot transfer EU citizens' personal data to countries outside the bloc deemed to have insufficient privacy safeguards, of which the United States is one. </p><p>Since the EU's highest court ruled on Oct 6 that the 15-year-old Safe Harbour framework, used by over 4,000 firms to transfer Europeans' data to the United States, did not adequately protect the data because US national security requirements trumped privacy safeguards, firms on both sides of the Atlantic have been in legal limbo. In a letter, seen by Reuters, to US President Barack Obama, European Commission President <person><nameText>Jean-Claude Juncker </nameText></person>and the 28 European heads of state, four business associations warned of the dire economic impact if data flows between the two blocs were disrupted. \"This issue must be resolved immediately or the consequences could be enormous for the thousands of businesses and millions of users impacted,\" the letter from US Chamber of Commerce, BusinessEurope, DigitalEurope and the Information Technology Industry Council says. The groups also ask for a transition period to comply with any revised data transfer framework, especially for those small and medium-sized businesses that relied entirely on Safe Harbour. IMPENDING DEADLINE European Union data protection authorities gave Brussels and Washington until the end of January to forge a new pact and businesses the same deadline to set up alternative legal channels to transfer personal data across the Atlantic, such as binding corporate rules within multinationals or model clauses. While a political agreement may be possible in that time, ironing out the legal details will take longer, according to a person familiar with the talks. However the business groups warn that all data transfer mechanisms are in jeopardy as a result of the EU ruling, something echoed by lawyers, and that could impact nearly all financial transactions between the two largest economies in the world. \"We therefore urge your leadership to ensure a durable legal framework for transatlantic data flows in the future,\" the letter says. EU privacy regulators are due to meet on Feb 2 to decide if they should start taking enforcement action against companies if they come to the conclusion that all transfer mechanisms fall foul of EU law and there is no new framework in place. Revelations two years ago of mass US surveillance programmes where American authorities collected private information directly from big tech firms like Apple , Facebook and Google riled Europe and set the stage for the European Court of Justice ruling. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-2434606</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HW9-KSW1-JCDN-128V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>7:20 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The five F.T.C. commissioners voted unanimously at the time against bringing charges against the company. Googleagreed to make some changes to search practices tied to advertising. </p><p>  But this year, with a new antitrust task force announced in February, the trade commission renewed its interest in Google. In recent weeks, the commission referred complaints about the company to the Justice Department, which also oversees antitrust regulations, according to two people familiar with the actions. The commission has also told companies and others with complaints against Googleto take them to the Justice Department.</p><p>  The task force had been looking into Google's advertising practices and influence in the online advertising industry, according to two of the people. One of the people said the agency was also looking into its search practices. Most of Google's revenue comes from advertisements tied to its search results.</p><p>  A Justice Department spokesman, Jeremy Edwards, declined to comment, as did representatives for Googleand the F.T.C.</p><p>  The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the Justice Department's potential inquiry into Google.</p><p>  If the Justice Department opens a formal investigation, it will be its first major antitrust case against a big tech company during the <person><nameText>Trump administration. </nameText></person>Google, Facebook and Amazon have come under intense bipartisan criticism, and calls to break up the firms have become a talking point in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.</p><p>  Political leaders and consumer advocacy groups have criticized American regulators for inaction against tech companies. Google, Amazon and Facebook have faced stiff penalties from a variety of European regulators for antitrust and privacy issues. This year, European regulators fined Google1.5 billion euros for antitrust violations in the online advertising market, the third antitrust move against the company by European officials in three years.</p><p>  American regulators have been investigating Facebook's privacy practices, and the outcome is widely seen as a test of the nation's ability to police how giant tech firms handle user data. The F.T.C. is negotiating a settlement with Facebook that expected to be as much as $5 billion for failing to protect its users' data from being used for political profiling by Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm that had worked for <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>presidential campaign.</p><p>  There has been a wave of new antitrust scrutiny into tech companies in Washington, including a Senate hearing in May on digital advertising that featured accusations that Googleengaged in anticompetitive practices.</p><p>  The call to regulate and scrutinize Big Tech has also become a consistent campaign promise among Democratic presidential candidates, even longtime friends of Silicon Valley such as Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts brought her ''Break Up Big Tech'' slogan to a billboard in San Francisco this week.</p><p>  ''Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,'' Ms. Warren wrote in a blog post on Medium this year.</p><p>  When the F.T.C. announced the antitrust task force, the agency's chairman, Joseph J. Simons, said it had been created because technology companies presented new challenges to decades-long regulation of antitrust. Companies like Googleand Facebook offer free services and can argue that alternative search and social networks are a click away for consumers. That can complicate arguments that the services harm consumers or stifle competition.</p><p>  The task force has started to steer complaints about Googleto the Justice Department's antitrust division. The department and the F.T.C. regularly negotiate over who has jurisdiction over antitrust cases, including investigations into competition violations and the review of mergers.</p><p>  While some of the complaints against Googleare years old, there has been a surge of new ones in recent months as concerns over Silicon Valley's influence and power have grown, according to one of the people with knowledge of deliberations.</p><p>  Stephen Kaufer, the chief executive of TripAdvisor, a company that has complained about Google's practices in the past, said he welcomed the new scrutiny on the tech giant.</p><p>  ''TripAdvisor remains concerned about Google's practices in the U.S., the E.U. and throughout the world,'' he said in a statement, referring to the European Union. ''For the good of consumers and competition on the internet, we welcome any renewed interest by U.S. regulators into Google's anticompetitive behavior.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-357677190601</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W7M-DW71-DXY4-X1TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"851\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/business/google-antitrust-justice-department.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/business/google-antitrust-justice-department.html</url><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 1, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We will get to that.  There is a lot going on today and this is what's moving markets on Thursday, the 31st of January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You thought scandals could hurt Facebook.  Yeah, right.  Their shares are soaring and profits have never been better.  Not to be outdone, GE.  Shares are up even more after the company's signs of a turnaround there are finally under way.  And we've got China, trade talks in the Oval Office any minute now.  Yes, I told you.  A busy hour ahead.  I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Sandals?  What scandals?  We're in the final hour of trading on Wall Street, and even as new controversies emerge, I'm telling you just in the last few minutes, Facebook shares are on pace for their best day in three years.  Now the company which also owns Messenger, WhatApp and Instagram booked a record profit of $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.  As you can see up better than 12%.</p><p>Facebook spent the fourth quarter fighting scandal after scandal.  First, the crisis that kept on giving, Facebook slow response to the Russian election interference and reports that Facebook executives advised against revealing publicly what they knew about that.  Second, Facebook was too slow to remove posts discussing the sale of a child bride in South Sudan.  Third, that Facebook executives hired a PR firm to attack liberal billionaire, George Soros.</p><p>Then, in December, two privacy scandals in quick succession.  First, a bug which exposed photos from 6.8 million new users and then, of course, less than one week later, another report that Facebook shared far more user data with companies like Microsoft and Yahoo than it had admitted.</p><p>Remember, these are just from the last three months of 2018, not in the history of the Facebook.  Now, the rest of the year was as bad or worse.  So has any of this driven away any users?  I bet you already know the  answer to that.  Facebook's Chief Financial Officer dealt with that on the earnings call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAVID WEHNER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  I would just - you know, I'd probably just let the numbers stand for themselves.  We saw, that you know, we are growing in all regions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  You heard it.  The numbers speak for themselves.  Now that growth explains Facebook's stock surge today.  Wall Street is betting 2.7 billion users can't be wrong.  Now, just in the last few minutes, new revelations.  Facebook and Twitter say they have removed thousands of accounts that engaged in coordinated, what they say is inauthentic action.  Many of those accounts originated this time in Iran and targeted users right around the world.</p><p>Our Samuel Burke is in London with the latest.  Samuel, I know were on the call getting the information on this, why today and how intrusive, how serious is this?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, Paula, the contrast could not be more stunning.  On the one hand you have a company whose stock is roaring up nearly 12% as you just described and yet, on the very same day that the stock is surging, the company is making clear that they do not have the reins, the control over their own social network.</p><p>In the past few minutes, Facebook announcing a huge campaign to bring down what they call inauthentic behavior, originating in Iran they say, though they are careful to note that there is not a connection to the government that they can see right now.</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen exactly the scope of what we're seeing here according to Facebook starting with the removal of 783 pages, groups and accounts, Paula, and it's not just Facebook.  It's also on Instagram.  About two million accounts, we're following at least one of these pages and Facebook was taking money for them, nearly $30,000.00 in spending for ads.</p><p>Many of these pages and accounts were masquerading as news websites, Paula, doing the work of journalists or that's what they wanted the users to believe, and Facebook is even sharing some of the posts that they say they have taken down already.  Many of them are anti-Israel in tone.  We have a post just like this, printing them out right now, this is just coming off.  \"Jene reconnais absolument pas Israel.\"  \"I will absolutely not recognize Israel.\"</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>BURKE:  We have other accounts with images like this, the stereotypical anti-Semitic images of somebody with the Star of David and the large nose.  Of course, these aren't from authentic accounts.  These aren't people's actual political views or anti-Israel messages, they are inauthentic accounts, coordinated accounts, and at the very same time, Paula, we see reports coming from \"The  Washington Post\" that Twitter is also taking down pages that they say originate in Iran, Russia and Venezuela.</p><p>Again, important to note that these companies aren't making links to the governments.  They are saying that this activity just originates in those countries.</p><p>NEWTON:  Any insight into how they found this and exactly if they are getting any better at trying to take down some of these accounts more quickly?</p><p>BURKE:  Well, they are saying they are working with outside parties to do analysis of this type of content, and the fact that there's another social network doing it right now as well might say that this was part of a broader effort.  Facebook saying that they've shared the information with the U.S. government, but we have no sense whatsoever if they are getting better at this.</p><p>In fact, I might even argue that it looks like they might be getting worse.  Now, you might be saying, \"Well, why?  If they are taking down the accounts.\"  Tucked into the earnings report was a line that said that the number of fake accounts, Paula, on Facebook has risen by 27% to an all-time high of 116 million fake accounts on Facebook, and that's according to Facebook.  What about the pages that they may not know about?</p><p>Incredible that Sheryl Sandberg said after the earnings report, \"We have proved with this blockbuster report that we can both protect the platform and at the same time have profitability.\"  If have you a surge of 27%, 116 million fake accounts, have you really protected the platform?</p><p>NEWTON:  They claim, yes, right?  They say they are doing the best that they can, and that is the challenge that they are up against.  Our Samuel Burke, thanks so much for jumping on that very quickly.  As you can see, more news from Facebook with the problems they are having on protecting the authenticity really, of their own platform.</p><p>Now, as we were saying, Facebook shares don't seem to be alarmed in the slightest by the latest development.  If you can see, they are up better than 11%.  I want now you to weigh in on this.  Please go to cnn.com/join.  I want to hear from you.  Our question today is would you consider quitting Facebook?  I'm going to ask you again.  Anybody here in the studio going to give me an answer on that?  Look at this, a silence.  I'm getting silence, people.  No Facebook login is required.  We'll discuss the results in a moment.</p><p>And I want all of you on the record as well.  Rana Foroohar is CNN's global economic analyst and columnist at \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST, CNN:  Who recently quit Facebook.</p><p>NEWTON:  They are sick of me telling them I have never been on Facebook ever in my life.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Interesting.</p><p>NEWTON:  I identified it as a security risk early on in my career.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Good for you.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, Rana, you identified 2018 as the tech lash.  I'm going to read your editorial back to you.  You said, \"This is a company that was so desperate to protect its top leadership and its business model that it hired a shadowy PR firm that used anti-Semitism as a political weapon.\"</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Indeed, and here we are.</p><p>NEWTON:  But here's what I say to you.  It worked.  Their user base continues to grow.  They are a very large formidable platform now.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they say they are doing their best.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.  It's interesting.  I mean, Sheryl Sandberg came out and said, look, this last quarter has proved not only can we add people to combat some of the fake news issues, we can fight regulators and we can grow at the same time.</p><p>But I'll tell you something, I think this year is really going to be the turning point because at the same time that you have all of these good news happening with the Facebook shares, you have Senator Mark Warner, for example, Democrat in the U.S. coming out and saying, he's crafting new legislation to try to put and a price on data so that people know the value of what have they are giving away.</p><p>I think a lot of the fact that people still go to these platforms has to do with the fact that they have no idea the value of what they are giving up.  And I think that when that becomes more transparent and you might get more competitors if there are antitrust issue, we could see a change.</p><p>NEWTON:  It's so trite and such a cliche, but obviously, an educated consumer is the best thing that could happen here especially when it even comes to those accounts that Samuel did such a good job of highlighting, if you're looking at something like that to really try and to see its origin and where it is coming from.</p><p>I mean, I know I gravitate on something like Twitter to verified accounts, right, just to see what's there.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Exactly.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, you know, it's kind of like even regulation, will it work?  Remember, we all - I know a lot of people don't remember the phone company, but we all used to be angry at the phone company, but we didn't rip the phone off the wall.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Right.</p><p>NEWTON:  That's what's happening here, Rana.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's true, but again, I am going to go back to this idea of competition.  A lot of people see the privacy issues posed by Facebook and Google and the like and the competition issues in two separate baskets.</p><p>I actually see them as being together, and I think that as you get U.S. and E.U. regulators really boring down and probably bringing some antitrust cases against these companies, it will be like if you remember 20 years ago when Microsoft was under fire.  The U.S. went after Microsoft for antitrust issues.  That actually allowed space for Google to be born.  I think that you're going to see new companies being born as these come under more pressure.</p><p>[15:10:08]</p><p>NEWTON:  And that they will have some more competition even more.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think they will, and I think even amongst the giants, you already see companies like Apple and IBM starting to compete on privacy and using data protection and privacy as a competitive advantage, so I think that this issue is out there.  I think you're going to see a lot of action this year.</p><p>NEWTON:  One of the things some people have pointed out though, and as you give Facebook the benefit of the doubt, they say they are trying their best.  They are leveraging everything that they have at this right now.  You're skeptical?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Well, I'm skeptical because the fundamental business proposition is still tracking everything you do and monetizing it.  It's surveillance capitalism.  I mean, this is a whole new area.  And by the way, it's not just the platform tech companies that are in it.  Almost every business these days is trying to track what you do from say a Starbucks to a Johnson &amp; Johnson.  I mean, your sneakers have chips in them.</p><p>This is - data is the new oil, and so I think that all the things you're seeing right now that Facebook is coming under pressure for, you're going to see broader number of companies facing these pressures.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet some people say that because of definitely deep pockets and them getting in on the ground floor of regulation, that it's actually Facebook that's going to be the winner in any kind of regulatory fight.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's interesting.  I mean, certainly in Europe, GDPR which is the new privacy regulation that rolled out this past year, it favors the big players in a sense that they have the money to actually enforce these rules and to comply.  Smaller players don't have that legal muscle, but I think we're in the beginning stages of a war.  This is the first battle.  This is really going to be I think the new too big to fail battle in some ways.  It's going to be big tech versus regulators just as the way it was with the banks.</p><p>NEWTON:  One difference, I have yet to see the consumer outrage.  We have to go.  But what do you think?  Do you think we'll see it?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think we're going to see an Exxon Valdez privacy probably around kids -- kids and games.</p><p>NEWTON:  Good point.  Rana, always so good to have you on here.  Really appreciate it.  Remember, she called it technological 2018.  According to those of you voting at cnn.com/join, most of you say, you would consider quitting Facebook, about a quarter of you say no way.  I wonder what the age spread is on that.</p><p>It is the last hour of trading on the last day of the month.  The Dow is down on the day, but all three major indices are way up for the month.  And as you can see there, the NASDAQ getting a nice rally.  Now, earlier today, the chief market strategist at National Holdings, Art Hogan put the rally into context for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL HOLDINGS:  We are having the best January in 30 years.  We had the worst December in 30 years, 80 years.  I'd say we're pairing off very nicely in the last two months.</p><p>I think we've gotten back to the midpoint where valuations are reasonable.  We are trading about 15.5 times this year's earnings and I think that when you look at where both the Dow and S&amp;P are, it's basically where we started last year, so we've gone 12 months without doing much and at the same time, multiples have come down because earnings are much better.</p><p>Now, in 2019, the S&amp;P can earn $170.00, which is down from $182.00, that's about 6% earnings growth, then I think we can have a normal year where things don't go crazy and we're going to be at 2,800 or 2,850 at the end of the year on the S&amp;P.</p><p>The only thing that stops that is trade.  If this is a long drawn out mutually destructive trade war --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will get to that trade - those trade negotiations later this hour.  Now, it is a good month as we were saying for the markets and a busy day for earnings.  Here to discuss all of that is CNN's Paul La Monica and of course, CNN's Matt Egan.  Thank you both.  I hope you came armed with opinions.  There's a lot of insight to be had from a lot of numbers.  Let's go first.  General Electric, it's funny because it's a great day for General Electric, but look where it had to come from?</p><p>MATT EGAN, LEAD WRITER, CNN BUSINESS:  You're right.  You know, I think that Wall Street is betting that the crisis at GE may finally be over.  The stock is up double digits.  It's like 45 minutes away from the best day in almost a decade, and, you know, the actual numbers were pretty crummy.  Power was down again.  GE wouldn't even say whether or not they will generate any positive free cash flow in 2019, but, you know, they did clean up one of the sins from the past.  They had a $1.5 billion settlement over WMC Mortgage.</p><p>Aviation was really good.  They had a profit there.  It was up 24%.  There were orders for their engine.  It was up a lot and so, you know, I do think that investors are betting that GE may have finally turned a corner here.</p><p>NEWTON:  Tesla, no one is agnostic over Tesla.  People love to hate it or love to love it.  In those latest results, certainly a lot of people were talking about the production issues there, but cash seemed to be okay.  Cash on --</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, Tesla still has a decent amount of cash.  I don't think that's the worry right now, Paula.  The problem, the biggest problem, I think, Elon Musk, you just have to scratch your head and wonder why he does the things he does in the way he does sometimes.</p><p>They wait until the very last moment of the conference call with analysts after their earnings to pull the reverse Steve Jobs one more thing moment.  They gave bad news that the CFO is leaving, and that just, I think, leaves a bad taste.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was the last thing in the phone call.</p><p>LA MONICA:  It was the last thing in the phone call.  You look at the transcript.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bury the headline.</p><p>[15:15:07]</p><p>LA MONICA:  It's just bizarre that this is what happened, because it's not as if there's anything wrong with Tesla.  That's probably the reason why the CFO is leaving.  He's actually done two stints as CFO.  It's nice for him to be able to go off into the sunset at a time where ...</p><p>NEWTON:  With that cash on hand.</p><p>LA MONICA:  ... people do feel like they have a good amount of cash and Model 3 demand is there.  So there are a lot of things to like about Tesla, but Musk can't get out of his own way sometimes.</p><p>EGAN:  It's just another reminder that it's just like the ultimate high wire act there at Tesla because it's all built on divisionary brilliance of Elon Musk which sometimes will lead to some executives leaving, and there's also a lot of debt there, which is why we're talking about cash, and that has continued to be a concern there at Tesla.</p><p>NEWTON:  It has been a great month for stocks so far.  We've got Amazon tomorrow.  Is this just going to blow -- sorry, today after the bell.  Is that going to blow the roof off of this market?</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think we have to wait and see.  I think what people are really going to be focusing on with Amazon.  We know that sales growth in the core retail business is starting to slow.  Hopefully they had a good holiday quarter, both at the online business as well as their own branded brick and mortar stores, Whole Foods, et cetera, but the number I'm really going to be looking at, Paula, is the AWS Cloud figures because Amazon Web Services is so insanely profitable that it helps to subsidize every other thing that Jeff Bezos wants to do at Amazon.</p><p>Sometimes that requires big investments that may lose money, but they can afford to do it because AWS is just a huge cash cow now.</p><p>NEWTON:  We saw Microsoft as well earlier with those great Cloud numbers as well, although the stock didn't fare so well.  A lot of it was okay.  In terms of where we're going in general with the market, gentlemen, I mean, I've heard both things about the earnings.  Of course, it's company dependent.</p><p>January though was a great month because basically expectations have been lowered, right, and people blew out the expectations.</p><p>EGAN:  I also think it was because December was so horrible, right.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was horrible.</p><p>EGAN:  It was the worst December that we've seen in quite a long time and I think it was about the fact that people feared an imminent recession in the economy.  They worried about the Federal Reserve being overly aggressive, and the U.S.-China trade war.  Listen, January is better because all three of those things have improved.</p><p>U.S. and China are talking instead of raising tariffs on each other.  The idea of an imminent recession doesn't seem likely right now and we have the Federal Reserve that went from unbelievably hawkish to really dovish in record time.</p><p>LA MONICA:  You were at the NYC yesterday and I swore when I was waiting to talk to you on yesterday's \"QMB Express Show\" I think there was a trader behind you whistling \"Patience\" you know, the Guns 'n Roses song.  I might be making it up because I'm a Gen X'er and I remember Gun's 'n Roses from the late '80s early '90s.</p><p>NEWTON:  I don't think you're making it up.</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think someone was actually whistling that because it's the word of the month.  Patience is the reason why we're having this record-setting or almost record-setting January.</p><p>NEWTON:  We have to leave it there.  But really, the Fed gets the credit.  The fact that Donald Trump even got off of the Fed's back.  We'll tell you all you need to know about that Fed meeting yesterday.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both so much.  You came armed with opinions.  I love it.  More of you two.  Excellent.  Coming up.  He is marshalling the Brexit debates in the British Parliament, and gaining worldwide attention.  Speaker of the House of Commons, you'll want to hear this.  He talks exclusively to CNN.</p><p>And Italy's economic downturn becomes has a full-blown recession.  Could its European neighbors soon follow?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:20:00]</p><p>NEWTON:  Now in a rare an exclusive television, the Speaker of the British House of Commons tells CNN says his job is like being a football referee.  You know the kind of football I'm talking about here, right, it's what we call soccer.</p><p>John Bercow is gaining an ever higher profile, thanks to his role in Parliament's Brexit drama.  You may know him from his greatest hits.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, SPEAKER, HOUSE OF COMMONS:  Order.  Order.  Order.  Resume your seat.  Resume your seat.  Don't tell me what the procedures of this House are.</p><p>Order.  I know what I'm doing.</p><p>It's utterly irresponsible chanting in the background.</p><p>The House must calm itself.  Zen.</p><p>Laughing and chuckling away as if there's a great amusement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Isn't that great?  Bianca Nobilo is here.  I can't think of a better person to exclusively interview, the Speaker.  By the way, the British media, some British media have dubbed him Speaker of the Devil.  Bianca, please explain because some people have called him either the greatest defender of democracy or someone who undermines it.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, he certainly excites a lot of passions and is a very controversial and colorful figure and that's why it was so great to speak to him, but by and large the MPs that I speak to, and I'm always talking to them every week, do have a lot of respect for him.</p><p>He has been embroiled in a couple of controversies, particularly over the management of some issues like bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons, but by and large, he is well respected for his ability to champion not the government's agenda, but that of back benchers and rank and file lawmakers, if you like.</p><p>And he has been successful of that.  And Paula, that's part of the reason that the Brexit debate is so shaped by him because Theresa May doesn't have a firm grip on Parliament because she has a minority government.  It means that when the Speaker selects ideas and stances from other members of Parliament, they take greater precedence.</p><p>So we now hear so many voices on the Brexit debate, and it's at a very confusing place, partly because of his championing of those backbenchers and Members of Parliament who aren't in government.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bianca, in terms of what he would say to defend himself, because some people have said that he's interfering in Brexit, and perhaps he's showing his hand had a little bit, even though he is supposed to be impeccably even-handed about this and non-partisan.</p><p>NOBILO:  So I spoke to him about how important it is for the Speaker to be an impartial figure, and I asked him was it difficult to transition from being a Member of Parliament, which is obviously a political animal to the Speaker which has to be impartial?  And he said no, because it's simply the duty of the Speaker to do that.</p><p>He also said that if he was truly impartial, it would be picked up constantly on social media, and in terms of the claims and accusations that are being made against him that he's being partial in the Brexit debate, he says, no, he's simply doing his job by representing the wider spectrum of opinions.</p><p>Also, when I spoke to him about how he decides what amendments to select and which way to move forward with the Brexit debate, he said he looks at which suggestions have are the most support in Parliament and which suggestions are coming not just from one side of the House of Commons, but from cross-parties.</p><p>So he has a mental check list, if you like, of considerations that he'll go through, and it was interesting because a lot of people will recognize the Speaker from Prime Minister's Questions, the boisterous event which we see every Wednesday here in the U.K., and I asked him how hard it was to cope with rowdy Members of Parliament, and he likened his job to something unexpected.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERCOW:  I'm a regular at my club with my son.  I'm a season ticket holder at Arsenal.  There are 60,000 people in the crowd, and there are virtually 60,000 people who think they know better than the referee.  The referee has just got to do his job as he thinks fit, and in a sense ...</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>BERCOW:   ... perhaps the Speaker is in a not all together dissimilar position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO:  Well, what was very clear to me, Paula, is that the speaker doesn't - isn't bothered by inconveniencing the government or, quote, \"moaning ministers.\"  He sees his job is to champion democracy, and that was clear to me that he was hugely passionate about the role of Parliament and trying to increase its authority, especially in such turbulent times.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it was funny to me, Bianca, that in trying to impugn his impartiality, they point to the fact that there was a bumper at his home that says \"Bollocks to Brexit.\"  I can only assume, Bianca, that he is in favor of free speech at his own home the way he is in the House of Parliament because he says the bumper sticker belongs to his wife.</p><p>Bianca, thanks so much for the interview.  We'll await to hear more from that very exclusive interview with the Speaker.  Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, stocks finished higher in London despite the Brexit uncertainty.  Elsewhere though, it was a mixed picture.  The Eurozone posted its flows, growth in four years with the final quarter of last year, and in Milan, stocks were hit by news that Italy slipped into recession in 2018.  The economy contracting for two straight quarters.  More on that later in this program.</p><p>Now with hundreds of billions of dollars of imports and exports on the line and time running out fast, Donald Trump calls for a top-level meeting with China's Xi Jinping to end this trade war.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Hello.  I'm Paula Newton, and there's more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment.  First though, these are the headlines on CNN this hour.</p><p>Exclusive video obtained by CNN is giving us a dramatic look at the last battles to drive ISIS from Syria.  Kurdish and Arab forces are fighting the remnants of ISIS on the ground backed up by U.S.-led air power, but ISIS fighters aren't giving us easily, battling to hold on to the last villages they control in Eastern Syria.</p><p>The U.S. is expressing grave concern over the accusation from Venezuela's self-declared acting President that his family is being intimidated by embattled President Nicolas Maduro.  Now, Juan Guaido says Mr. Maduro's special forces tried to enter the family's home.</p><p>In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, Guaido refused to rule out U.S. military intervention to end the escalating political unrest.  Defense attorneys present a closing argument in the trial of Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.</p><p>Joaquin Guzman is facing drug trafficking and other charges in New York.  Prosecutors presented more than 50 witnesses in the trial along with his phone calls, texts and documents.</p><p>Engineers at MIT have developed a robot that can actually play Jenga.  Now, the robot is able to see and feel individual blocks in a tower and has learned to switch blocks if it starts to wobble.  You may still have a chance to beat it though.  The robot isn't yet smart enough to work out which specific blocks would make your next turn impossible.  Let me see if it can make dinner.</p><p>OK, Donald Trump says this week's trade talks with China are going well, and will hopefully lead to a deal by March 1st.  Now, that's the last day before the U.S. may increase tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.  Mr. Trump is also making very clear, there will be no final deal until he meets again with China's President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Now, the president laid out his terms on Twitter, he wants Beijing to open its markets to U.S. financial manufacturing and agricultural businesses along with other sectors.  Mr. Trump added, he wants these talks to leave, quote, \"nothing unresolved.\"</p><p>Now, time is tight.  Even tighter if you can believe it than those Brexit talks.  Negotiators have until March 1st, just over four weeks away.  Now, if the deal can't be done by then, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods will increase from 10 percent to 25 percent, and you bet they are going to bite.</p><p>Carla Hills is a former U.S. trade representative, and she joins me now from Washington.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for joining us.  OK, the person who is at the table right now is Robert Lighthizer.  What do you think his main task is right now to get a deal with the Chinese or is it going to be a tougher thing to get a deal that the Trump administration will accept?</p><p>CARLA HILLS, FORMER UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  I suspect that the U.S. team will try to lay out exactly what the U.S. needs in order to move forward.  I don't anticipate that they will get a deal during this visit, and it's not because the president has said no deal until he meets with President Xi.</p><p>It is that there are so many things on the agenda.  I think they're going to have to meet again and perhaps a couple of times again and try to understand what each side needs to do.  What are the political limitations and the economic limitations?</p><p>NEWTON:  What many people are looking for in the Trump administration at least, and I believe the U.S. trade representative as well is structural reform.  Do you think that's just too ambitious, and at the end this trade deal.  If there is one, is going to look much different than that.</p><p>HILLS:  You have to define what you mean by structural reform.  I would ask the Chinese to remove the percentage caps on inward investment.  When they join the World Trade Organization in 2001, they committed to two basic norms, national treatment and non-discrimination, and they don't tell local firms that they can only have 39 percent in a given sector.</p><p>They should not tell a U.S. firm that they cannot come in and have green-field investments in areas of their interests.  And it is particularly important because in many instances, the joint ventures that have been mandated have been the pathway to get a hold of intellectual property that the U.S. holds, so it really needs to be corrected.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet if it needs to be corrected, do you think that means that a deal can't be done? We just went through the deadline, it is very tight, it is four weeks before those tariffs that are paid by the way by U.S. firms go up substantially.</p><p>HILLS:  Well, President Trump could take some of the things that they accomplish, perhaps extend and give a little more time.  I don't know how they're going to handle the negotiations, neither one of us is in the negotiating room.</p><p>NEWTON:  Your best guess though as someone who has been in this position before, and I lean on you because at a time when you were dealing with these issues with China, completely different era I understand, but it was that same debate, right?</p><p>[15:35:00]  Is China going to move to a more -- an economy that more mirrors capitalism in a way and privatization? Because a lot of people are saying now that actually in the last five years, especially with the state sponsorship of its companies, that China has actually moved backwards on these issues.</p><p>NEWTON:  I agree that China has moved backwards.  And we have a pre-eminent economist Nicholas Lardy who has just released a book called \"The State Strikes Back\".  And he, five years earlier, had written a book entitled \"Market Over Mao\".</p><p>And in 2014, when he wrote \"The Market Over Mao\", he was saying, look, the market is working.  It's -- the restrictions are coming down because that's where the profits are.  The private sector is making a difference.</p><p>And what he has noted and profoundly spells out in detail with charts is how that has turned around, that the government is spending more money, flowing more capital to state-owned enterprises that are not making a profit, whereas the private sector in China is making a profit.</p><p>We have a deal to make because what we're asking of China will actually be good for its economy.</p><p>NEWTON:  But they don't believe perhaps that it will be good for them politically, which is another argument entirely.  Ambassador Hills, before I let you go, you know, we have this issue of this CFO, this Huawei executive who is out on bail in Vancouver.</p><p>A lot of people are saying still cloud the talks, but I point more not to the case of one executive or even the 23 charges that have been put against Huawei and her and other executives.  But the fact that you had the Intel chiefs in the United States say the other day on Capitol Hill that Huawei poses an intelligence risk to the United States.</p><p>How do you see going forward with China, when basically, you have the intelligence community saying any kind of cooperation with this country on that level, even from a private company in China is a risk?</p><p>HILLS:  Well, as an old prosecutor, let me say, I don't have the facts of what the accusations are other than that, what has been in the press.  But if a case can be made whether it's against somebody from China or Brazil or England, that is for the prosecutors to make that case, and we should look at it objectively.</p><p>There are facts in earlier instances where there have been I think actions where they've stepped across the line.</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will see indeed how long it takes for that court -- that case to make its way through the courts.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for being with us, really appreciate it.  Now, when we return --</p><p>HILLS:  A pleasure --</p><p>NEWTON:  Two men are claiming to be Venezuela's president, one of them speaks to Cnn about his plan for fixing the country's broken economy.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now for the third time in a decade, yes, I said that, third time in a decade, Italy's economy has slipped into a recession.  Economic growth contracted for a second consecutive quarter in 2018, that's fueling fears that Italy's European neighbors could soon follow.</p><p>Lorenzo Codogno is the former chief economist and Director General at the Treasury Department of the Italian Ministry of Economy, and a visiting professor now at the London School of Economics.  He joins me now from London.  OK, the current government in power for eight months says these last two quarters are an absolute blip.</p><p>That there's no way that the Italian economy will grow.  Are they right?</p><p>LORENZO CODOGNO, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST &amp; DIRECTOR GENERAL, TREASURY DEPARTMENT, ITALIAN MINISTRY OF ECONOMY:  Well, you know, the global climate has changed, and if you look at the Eurozone growth, it is slowing fast.</p><p>And clearly, Italy is the weak spot, so I think this weakness will continue.  Actually, leading indicators already suggest that probably the first quarter of this year will be negative again.</p><p>The big issue here is whether at some point we see some stabilization during the course of this year and a modest recovery or whether this kind of slowdown transforms into a deeper and prolonged recession.  I think now it's not clear, but at least the first quarter will be negative, and I think given the negative carryover, probably the whole 2019 will end up in negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  The entire year of 2019 in a recession for Italy you think?</p><p>CODOGNO:  Well, again, given two negative quarters and the likely negative quarter at the beginning of this year, basically the year is already compromised to some extent, so unless you expect a sharp recovery in the second half, which I don't see at the moment, probably the overall outcome for the year is going to be negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  You know, it's a controversial question even to say it, but obviously the populist government here has a lot of policies out there that they are -- that are trial balloons.  Do you see anything in what they're proposing that could help the situation where the economy is concerned?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think the only positive here is that probably having a kind of anti-establishment protest parties in government basically prevents any, you know, upheaval in the streets as we have seen in France.  But other than that, I think there's a risk that the current government continues to roll back reforms introduced by the previous government and continues to have an anti-business attitude which would actually affect investment behavior by companies which I think is what is happening now.</p><p>NEWTON:  Interesting point of view you have though, that regular rank and file feel as if they have a voice in government now and that may be what's keeping them off the streets.  Before I let you go, I have to ask you in terms of any kind of contagion throughout Europe, there has been discussion about Germany also falling into a recession.</p><p>Mario Draghi has said, look, that there's reasons for the fact that he won't be -- that he will be continuing to stimulate those European economies, is he prudent to do so?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think so because I don't think that the Eurozone will enter a recession.  I think it's just a soft patch, but for Italy, it is definitely a recession and for the whole area, it is certainly softening of demand which would probably deserve a longer period of accommodative monetary policy.</p><p>So I think Mario Draghi and the ECB correct in slightly delaying the normalization of monetary conditions, so to speak.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and glad to hear that perhaps the rest of Europe may see some growth in 2019.  Lorenzo, thanks so much, really appreciate it.  Now the --</p><p>CODOGNO:  Thank you --</p><p>NEWTON:  Vice President of the European Commission says Europe needs a strong alliance between France and Germany to keep its economy moving.  Jyrki Katainen spoke to Richard in Davos last week and says it's the only way for Europe to move forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  Everybody should know that without a strong France-German access, Europe don't move forward -- Europe doesn't move forward.  So if you need a strong ownership, you need a strong leadership, especially in big countries.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN:  But --</p><p>KATAINEN:  It doesn't mean that smaller countries are put aside, but without strong France-German access, nothing moves on.</p><p>QUEST:  But hang on.  Should France and Germany be agreeing a treaty for closer economic cooperation, closer foreign policy cooperation, all the things that are in this treaty, shouldn't this be done in the greater sphere of the EU?</p><p>[15:45:00]  KATAINEN:  Of course, I mean, even the two big countries cannot decide anything separately from the other.  So the two countries are small enough to get decisions done unless the others don't support.  So we need overall more strong national ownership, ownership coming from the national governments whether you're big or small country, but it's not sufficient to sit on the fence and just see that if somebody is leading Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  OK, after the break, Europe's largest economies are trying to dance around U.S. sanctions on Iran.  You'll want these details up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  So right now, the Chief Financial Officer of the Chinese tech company Huawei is in -- is out on bail in Canada accused of dodging U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Now, three of the world's largest economies are openly trying to bypass sanctions on the same country.</p><p>Germany, France and the U.K. are working on a payment mechanism to allow their businesses to continue trading with Iran in defiance of President Trump's sanctions.  Now, it's called INSTEX, and it's an Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges.</p><p>Now, it's expected to operate like a barring platform or clearing house rather than relying on direct financial transactions, key, it won't be using U.S. dollars.  If Washington wants to punish those who use it, it would mean penalizing countries traditionally seen as its closest allies.</p><p>Now, Ramin Asgard is a former political adviser to the U.S. Central Command.  He was also director of America's Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai.  This is a controversial move by Europe, when they first proposed it, I actually didn't believe they'd go through with it.</p><p>It seems like they are no matter how honestly -- how modestly it begins.  Do you think it will elicit a response from the Trump administration?</p><p>RAMIN ASGARD, FORMER POLITICAL ADVISER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND:  Now, thank you very much.  I think what the Europeans have done is, they're playing a game of three-dimensional chess where they are a little bit caught between their responsibilities under the JCPOA and U.S. sanctions and not wanting to trigger them.</p><p>What they've done here is frankly, they've taken the smallest step forward in trying to show a little bit of independence from U.S. sanctions policy, and this INSTEX that has gone into effect today deals only at this point with humanitarian trade; food, medicine, medical equipment.</p><p>[15:50:00]  And they're hoping the Europeans that it will be enough to keep Iran in the JCPOA and not too much so that the United States will have any negative reaction to it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet Iran has already shown some impatience with the time table, and with as you said so far the humanitarian parameters of that.  As I say, you know, Mike Pompeo has called this a disastrous policy, and some are waiting to see exactly what kind of enrapture it will cause between the United States and these allies.</p><p>What is Europe trying to get at here?</p><p>ASGARD:  I think what the Europeans are trying to do is they desperately want the JCPOA to stay into effect.  They don't want Iran to break out again into a race for nuclear technology.  They think that could escalate very rapidly into a very serious conflict.</p><p>And so they want to play kind of an intermediate role with the United States.  This is a harkening back to what was going on in the 2000s basically where the EU three were doing their best to maintain Iran from going too rogue, and the United States was pretty much maintaining a strong thrust of sanctions.</p><p>If the EU is now looking to really stand up for its banks and its businesses and really step out, it would require them to go beyond humanitarian trade.  Remember, humanitarian trade is legal for U.S. sanctions in this case.  So, so far the EU is treading very carefully, but is definitely watching the trend and seeing, do we want to step any further?</p><p>Perhaps they're waiting for reactions from the Trump White House, from the Iranians to see where exactly this might head.  But they are maintaining at least a positive momentum and delivering on a promise that they had mentioned several months ago that they would do.</p><p>So in that effect, they are showing a little bit of independence and a little bit of forward progress for standing up for the EU three's position.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it will be a very interesting story to watch in the coming months, so thank you for your insights on this, appreciate it.  Now --</p><p>ASGARD:  Thank you very much.</p><p>NEWTON:  The self-declared president of Venezuela says he wants to reactivate the country's oil industry after the Trump administration placed sanctions on the state oil company.  Juan Guaido told Cnn that ordinary Venezuelans deserve those profits, not the embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  What we're doing is trying to reactivate this industry so there will be no usurping action by the way of Maduro and keeping this money and that the production of petroleum will be on behalf of Venezuela.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, the U.S. sanctions could have huge implications for the global oil industry.  Our emerging markets editor John Defterios told me the Trump administration is now playing hardball.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  The U.S. strategy seems very clear, starting first with the financial interests of PDVSA and directing those revenues that went into the United States to the National Assembly.</p><p>Number two, chasing bank accounts of Maduro and his cadre, even gold sitting in Germany and London hasn't taken action yet on that front.  And finally, I thought this was going to bubble to the surface, and that is Citco; it's a large refinery in the United States, has 5,000 petrol stations throughout the country, 30 states to be specific.</p><p>They could freeze the assets or again redirect those revenues somewhere else.  This is playing the hardball.  I think also we have to look at the bigger picture.  You know this very well, Russia and China have been playing in Venezuela for the better part of the decade, funneling nearly $70 billion into the country.</p><p>I can't imagine they're going to pick up their sticks, walk away and let Donald Trump fill this void in Venezuela.  But the U.S. is using all the economic tools.  You know the power of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that shut down banking systems, particularly the dollar because of the hyper inflation in Venezuela so vital to the economy, but they're doing it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they're doing it, and they've decided, as you said, a full-corps press, they're going to go all the way now.  Secretary Mnuchin being very clear that he is in touch with oil companies and those refineries in the Gulf that might be impacted.</p><p>In terms of Venezuela itself, I mean, John, the devastation and the production of oil in Venezuela has been staggering, which means it's only really has left the very little oil that actually it produces right now, that it could get out right now and, of course, as you were pointing out, Citgo.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes, let's cover PDVSA, this is the biggest collapse of any state oil company in the history of the business, at least since World War II.  If it didn't face a conflict on its soil -- take a look at the numbers, Paula, we're looking now at production at the end of 2018 according to OPEC at 1.1 million barrels a day.</p><p>[15:55:00]  If you rolled back the clock to 2008, it was 3.2 million barrels a day.  PDVSA used to be a very well run state oil company, that's not the case now, 20 years of Hugo Chavez and Maduro together, the last 10, the crunch, and you almost have a foreign direct investment freeze on the company because there's no reinvestment, and they've been printing money and that's why you have the hyper inflation.</p><p>Citgo is a very valuable brand in the United States, as you well know.  It will be really interesting to see how aggressive the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration plan to be going forward with that asset.</p><p>Also, we can't, you know, shut out the fact the poor Venezuelans, a million percent inflation last year, the IMF is suggesting ten times that in 2019, and I think you've seen the graph, poverty had shot up 40 percent in the last five years alone, Paula, to nearly 90 percent.</p><p>You've been on the ground there, it's absolutely painful and the number one asset, number one proven reserves in the world when it comes to oil is heavy crude, but they're not extracting it now because nobody wants to invest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, you are just a few minutes away until that closing bell and the close of trade for January.  It's been a great January and we will be right back to cap it all off for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  We are heading into the last few minutes of trading on Wall Street, and as you can see there, even the Dow has turned positive today.  U.S. markets are set to finish -- all three markets are set to finish higher today, and it's been a really good month for all three major indices.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is having its best January since 1987! Lifted by some strong results, of course, they are better-than-expected at the ones we have been talking about from yesterday.  Facebook, even GE getting in on the action.  A quick look now at that Dow as you can see there, most of those stocks in positive territory, even companies like Cat that continue to rely on that U.S.-China showdown -- trade showdown.</p><p>Drug-maker Pfizer is the best performer of the day, up about 3 percent.  Now, it is the busiest week of the quarter for earnings, Amazon report right after the markets close in just a few minutes, investors will find out how the holiday shopping season went as well as Amazon integration with Whole Foods and of course the all important growth on cloud services.</p><p>Chevron and Exxon close out the weeks, big earnings reports on Friday.  And as we hear, the applause for the closing bell today.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Paula Newton, \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper is next.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2174419999</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB8-TVN1-JBHT-D495-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

We will get to that.  There is a lot going on today and this is what's moving markets on Thursday, the 31st of January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You thought scandals could hurt Facebook.  Yeah, right.  Their shares are soaring and profits have never been better.  Not to be outdone, GE.  Shares are up even more after the company's signs of a turnaround there are finally under way.  And we've got China, trade talks in the Oval Office any minute now.  Yes, I told you.  A busy hour ahead.  I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Sandals?  What scandals?  We're in the final hour of trading on Wall Street, and even as new controversies emerge, I'm telling you just in the last few minutes, Facebook shares are on pace for their best day in three years.  Now the company which also owns Messenger, WhatApp and Instagram booked a record profit of $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.  As you can see up better than 12%.</p><p>Facebook spent the fourth quarter fighting scandal after scandal.  First, the crisis that kept on giving, Facebook slow response to the Russian election interference and reports that Facebook executives advised against revealing publicly what they knew about that.  Second, Facebook was too slow to remove posts discussing the sale of a child bride in South Sudan.  Third, that Facebook executives hired a PR firm to attack liberal billionaire, George Soros.</p><p>Then, in December, two privacy scandals in quick succession.  First, a bug which exposed photos from 6.8 million new users and then, of course, less than one week later, another report that Facebook shared far more user data with companies like Microsoft and Yahoo than it had admitted.</p><p>Remember, these are just from the last three months of 2018, not in the history of the Facebook.  Now, the rest of the year was as bad or worse.  So has any of this driven away any users?  I bet you already know the  answer to that.  Facebook's Chief Financial Officer dealt with that on the earnings call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAVID WEHNER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  I would just - you know, I'd probably just let the numbers stand for themselves.  We saw, that you know, we are growing in all regions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  You heard it.  The numbers speak for themselves.  Now that growth explains Facebook's stock surge today.  Wall Street is betting 2.7 billion users can't be wrong.  Now, just in the last few minutes, new revelations.  Facebook and Twitter say they have removed thousands of accounts that engaged in coordinated, what they say is inauthentic action.  Many of those accounts originated this time in Iran and targeted users right around the world.</p><p>Our Samuel Burke is in London with the latest.  Samuel, I know were on the call getting the information on this, why today and how intrusive, how serious is this?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, Paula, the contrast could not be more stunning.  On the one hand you have a company whose stock is roaring up nearly 12% as you just described and yet, on the very same day that the stock is surging, the company is making clear that they do not have the reins, the control over their own social network.</p><p>In the past few minutes, Facebook announcing a huge campaign to bring down what they call inauthentic behavior, originating in Iran they say, though they are careful to note that there is not a connection to the government that they can see right now.</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen exactly the scope of what we're seeing here according to Facebook starting with the removal of 783 pages, groups and accounts, Paula, and it's not just Facebook.  It's also on Instagram.  About two million accounts, we're following at least one of these pages and Facebook was taking money for them, nearly $30,000.00 in spending for ads.</p><p>Many of these pages and accounts were masquerading as news websites, Paula, doing the work of journalists or that's what they wanted the users to believe, and Facebook is even sharing some of the posts that they say they have taken down already.  Many of them are anti-Israel in tone.  We have a post just like this, printing them out right now, this is just coming off.  \"Jene reconnais absolument pas Israel.\"  \"I will absolutely not recognize Israel.\"</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>BURKE:  We have other accounts with images like this, the stereotypical anti-Semitic images of somebody with the Star of David and the large nose.  Of course, these aren't from authentic accounts.  These aren't people's actual political views or anti-Israel messages, they are inauthentic accounts, coordinated accounts, and at the very same time, Paula, we see reports coming from \"The  Washington Post\" that Twitter is also taking down pages that they say originate in Iran, Russia and Venezuela.</p><p>Again, important to note that these companies aren't making links to the governments.  They are saying that this activity just originates in those countries.</p><p>NEWTON:  Any insight into how they found this and exactly if they are getting any better at trying to take down some of these accounts more quickly?</p><p>BURKE:  Well, they are saying they are working with outside parties to do analysis of this type of content, and the fact that there's another social network doing it right now as well might say that this was part of a broader effort.  Facebook saying that they've shared the information with the U.S. government, but we have no sense whatsoever if they are getting better at this.</p><p>In fact, I might even argue that it looks like they might be getting worse.  Now, you might be saying, \"Well, why?  If they are taking down the accounts.\"  Tucked into the earnings report was a line that said that the number of fake accounts, Paula, on Facebook has risen by 27% to an all-time high of 116 million fake accounts on Facebook, and that's according to Facebook.  What about the pages that they may not know about?</p><p>Incredible that Sheryl Sandberg said after the earnings report, \"We have proved with this blockbuster report that we can both protect the platform and at the same time have profitability.\"  If have you a surge of 27%, 116 million fake accounts, have you really protected the platform?</p><p>NEWTON:  They claim, yes, right?  They say they are doing the best that they can, and that is the challenge that they are up against.  Our Samuel Burke, thanks so much for jumping on that very quickly.  As you can see, more news from Facebook with the problems they are having on protecting the authenticity really, of their own platform.</p><p>Now, as we were saying, Facebook shares don't seem to be alarmed in the slightest by the latest development.  If you can see, they are up better than 11%.  I want now you to weigh in on this.  Please go to cnn.com/join.  I want to hear from you.  Our question today is would you consider quitting Facebook?  I'm going to ask you again.  Anybody here in the studio going to give me an answer on that?  Look at this, a silence.  I'm getting silence, people.  No Facebook login is required.  We'll discuss the results in a moment.</p><p>And I want all of you on the record as well.  Rana Foroohar is CNN's global economic analyst and columnist at \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST, CNN:  Who recently quit Facebook.</p><p>NEWTON:  They are sick of me telling them I have never been on Facebook ever in my life.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Interesting.</p><p>NEWTON:  I identified it as a security risk early on in my career.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Good for you.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, Rana, you identified 2018 as the tech lash.  I'm going to read your editorial back to you.  You said, \"This is a company that was so desperate to protect its top leadership and its business model that it hired a shadowy PR firm that used anti-Semitism as a political weapon.\"</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Indeed, and here we are.</p><p>NEWTON:  But here's what I say to you.  It worked.  Their user base continues to grow.  They are a very large formidable platform now.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they say they are doing their best.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.  It's interesting.  I mean, Sheryl Sandberg came out and said, look, this last quarter has proved not only can we add people to combat some of the fake news issues, we can fight regulators and we can grow at the same time.</p><p>But I'll tell you something, I think this year is really going to be the turning point because at the same time that you have all of these good news happening with the Facebook shares, you have Senator Mark Warner, for example, Democrat in the U.S. coming out and saying, he's crafting new legislation to try to put and a price on data so that people know the value of what have they are giving away.</p><p>I think a lot of the fact that people still go to these platforms has to do with the fact that they have no idea the value of what they are giving up.  And I think that when that becomes more transparent and you might get more competitors if there are antitrust issue, we could see a change.</p><p>NEWTON:  It's so trite and such a cliche, but obviously, an educated consumer is the best thing that could happen here especially when it even comes to those accounts that Samuel did such a good job of highlighting, if you're looking at something like that to really try and to see its origin and where it is coming from.</p><p>I mean, I know I gravitate on something like Twitter to verified accounts, right, just to see what's there.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Exactly.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, you know, it's kind of like even regulation, will it work?  Remember, we all - I know a lot of people don't remember the phone company, but we all used to be angry at the phone company, but we didn't rip the phone off the wall.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Right.</p><p>NEWTON:  That's what's happening here, Rana.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's true, but again, I am going to go back to this idea of competition.  A lot of people see the privacy issues posed by Facebook and Google and the like and the competition issues in two separate baskets.</p><p>I actually see them as being together, and I think that as you get U.S. and E.U. regulators really boring down and probably bringing some antitrust cases against these companies, it will be like if you remember 20 years ago when Microsoft was under fire.  The U.S. went after Microsoft for antitrust issues.  That actually allowed space for Google to be born.  I think that you're going to see new companies being born as these come under more pressure.</p><p>[15:10:08]</p><p>NEWTON:  And that they will have some more competition even more.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think they will, and I think even amongst the giants, you already see companies like Apple and IBM starting to compete on privacy and using data protection and privacy as a competitive advantage, so I think that this issue is out there.  I think you're going to see a lot of action this year.</p><p>NEWTON:  One of the things some people have pointed out though, and as you give Facebook the benefit of the doubt, they say they are trying their best.  They are leveraging everything that they have at this right now.  You're skeptical?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Well, I'm skeptical because the fundamental business proposition is still tracking everything you do and monetizing it.  It's surveillance capitalism.  I mean, this is a whole new area.  And by the way, it's not just the platform tech companies that are in it.  Almost every business these days is trying to track what you do from say a Starbucks to a Johnson &amp; Johnson.  I mean, your sneakers have chips in them.</p><p>This is - data is the new oil, and so I think that all the things you're seeing right now that Facebook is coming under pressure for, you're going to see broader number of companies facing these pressures.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet some people say that because of definitely deep pockets and them getting in on the ground floor of regulation, that it's actually Facebook that's going to be the winner in any kind of regulatory fight.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's interesting.  I mean, certainly in Europe, GDPR which is the new privacy regulation that rolled out this past year, it favors the big players in a sense that they have the money to actually enforce these rules and to comply.  Smaller players don't have that legal muscle, but I think we're in the beginning stages of a war.  This is the first battle.  This is really going to be I think the new too big to fail battle in some ways.  It's going to be big tech versus regulators just as the way it was with the banks.</p><p>NEWTON:  One difference, I have yet to see the consumer outrage.  We have to go.  But what do you think?  Do you think we'll see it?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think we're going to see an Exxon Valdez privacy probably around kids -- kids and games.</p><p>NEWTON:  Good point.  Rana, always so good to have you on here.  Really appreciate it.  Remember, she called it technological 2018.  According to those of you voting at cnn.com/join, most of you say, you would consider quitting Facebook, about a quarter of you say no way.  I wonder what the age spread is on that.</p><p>It is the last hour of trading on the last day of the month.  The Dow is down on the day, but all three major indices are way up for the month.  And as you can see there, the NASDAQ getting a nice rally.  Now, earlier today, the chief market strategist at National Holdings, Art Hogan put the rally into context for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL HOLDINGS:  We are having the best January in 30 years.  We had the worst December in 30 years, 80 years.  I'd say we're pairing off very nicely in the last two months.</p><p>I think we've gotten back to the midpoint where valuations are reasonable.  We are trading about 15.5 times this year's earnings and I think that when you look at where both the Dow and S&amp;P are, it's basically where we started last year, so we've gone 12 months without doing much and at the same time, multiples have come down because earnings are much better.</p><p>Now, in 2019, the S&amp;P can earn $170.00, which is down from $182.00, that's about 6% earnings growth, then I think we can have a normal year where things don't go crazy and we're going to be at 2,800 or 2,850 at the end of the year on the S&amp;P.</p><p>The only thing that stops that is trade.  If this is a long drawn out mutually destructive trade war --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will get to that trade - those trade negotiations later this hour.  Now, it is a good month as we were saying for the markets and a busy day for earnings.  Here to discuss all of that is CNN's Paul La Monica and of course, CNN's Matt Egan.  Thank you both.  I hope you came armed with opinions.  There's a lot of insight to be had from a lot of numbers.  Let's go first.  General Electric, it's funny because it's a great day for General Electric, but look where it had to come from?</p><p>MATT EGAN, LEAD WRITER, CNN BUSINESS:  You're right.  You know, I think that Wall Street is betting that the crisis at GE may finally be over.  The stock is up double digits.  It's like 45 minutes away from the best day in almost a decade, and, you know, the actual numbers were pretty crummy.  Power was down again.  GE wouldn't even say whether or not they will generate any positive free cash flow in 2019, but, you know, they did clean up one of the sins from the past.  They had a $1.5 billion settlement over WMC Mortgage.</p><p>Aviation was really good.  They had a profit there.  It was up 24%.  There were orders for their engine.  It was up a lot and so, you know, I do think that investors are betting that GE may have finally turned a corner here.</p><p>NEWTON:  Tesla, no one is agnostic over Tesla.  People love to hate it or love to love it.  In those latest results, certainly a lot of people were talking about the production issues there, but cash seemed to be okay.  Cash on --</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, Tesla still has a decent amount of cash.  I don't think that's the worry right now, Paula.  The problem, the biggest problem, I think, Elon Musk, you just have to scratch your head and wonder why he does the things he does in the way he does sometimes.</p><p>They wait until the very last moment of the conference call with analysts after their earnings to pull the reverse Steve Jobs one more thing moment.  They gave bad news that the CFO is leaving, and that just, I think, leaves a bad taste.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was the last thing in the phone call.</p><p>LA MONICA:  It was the last thing in the phone call.  You look at the transcript.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bury the headline.</p><p>[15:15:07]</p><p>LA MONICA:  It's just bizarre that this is what happened, because it's not as if there's anything wrong with Tesla.  That's probably the reason why the CFO is leaving.  He's actually done two stints as CFO.  It's nice for him to be able to go off into the sunset at a time where ...</p><p>NEWTON:  With that cash on hand.</p><p>LA MONICA:  ... people do feel like they have a good amount of cash and Model 3 demand is there.  So there are a lot of things to like about Tesla, but Musk can't get out of his own way sometimes.</p><p>EGAN:  It's just another reminder that it's just like the ultimate high wire act there at Tesla because it's all built on divisionary brilliance of Elon Musk which sometimes will lead to some executives leaving, and there's also a lot of debt there, which is why we're talking about cash, and that has continued to be a concern there at Tesla.</p><p>NEWTON:  It has been a great month for stocks so far.  We've got Amazon tomorrow.  Is this just going to blow -- sorry, today after the bell.  Is that going to blow the roof off of this market?</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think we have to wait and see.  I think what people are really going to be focusing on with Amazon.  We know that sales growth in the core retail business is starting to slow.  Hopefully they had a good holiday quarter, both at the online business as well as their own branded brick and mortar stores, Whole Foods, et cetera, but the number I'm really going to be looking at, Paula, is the AWS Cloud figures because Amazon Web Services is so insanely profitable that it helps to subsidize every other thing that Jeff Bezos wants to do at Amazon.</p><p>Sometimes that requires big investments that may lose money, but they can afford to do it because AWS is just a huge cash cow now.</p><p>NEWTON:  We saw Microsoft as well earlier with those great Cloud numbers as well, although the stock didn't fare so well.  A lot of it was okay.  In terms of where we're going in general with the market, gentlemen, I mean, I've heard both things about the earnings.  Of course, it's company dependent.</p><p>January though was a great month because basically expectations have been lowered, right, and people blew out the expectations.</p><p>EGAN:  I also think it was because December was so horrible, right.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was horrible.</p><p>EGAN:  It was the worst December that we've seen in quite a long time and I think it was about the fact that people feared an imminent recession in the economy.  They worried about the Federal Reserve being overly aggressive, and the U.S.-China trade war.  Listen, January is better because all three of those things have improved.</p><p>U.S. and China are talking instead of raising tariffs on each other.  The idea of an imminent recession doesn't seem likely right now and we have the Federal Reserve that went from unbelievably hawkish to really dovish in record time.</p><p>LA MONICA:  You were at the NYC yesterday and I swore when I was waiting to talk to you on yesterday's \"QMB Express Show\" I think there was a trader behind you whistling \"Patience\" you know, the Guns 'n Roses song.  I might be making it up because I'm a Gen X'er and I remember Gun's 'n Roses from the late '80s early '90s.</p><p>NEWTON:  I don't think you're making it up.</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think someone was actually whistling that because it's the word of the month.  Patience is the reason why we're having this record-setting or almost record-setting January.</p><p>NEWTON:  We have to leave it there.  But really, the Fed gets the credit.  The fact that Donald Trump even got off of the Fed's back.  We'll tell you all you need to know about that Fed meeting yesterday.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both so much.  You came armed with opinions.  I love it.  More of you two.  Excellent.  Coming up.  He is marshalling the Brexit debates in the British Parliament, and gaining worldwide attention.  Speaker of the House of Commons, you'll want to hear this.  He talks exclusively to CNN.</p><p>And Italy's economic downturn becomes has a full-blown recession.  Could its European neighbors soon follow?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:20:00]</p><p>NEWTON:  Now in a rare an exclusive television, the Speaker of the British House of Commons tells CNN says his job is like being a football referee.  You know the kind of football I'm talking about here, right, it's what we call soccer.</p><p>John Bercow is gaining an ever higher profile, thanks to his role in Parliament's Brexit drama.  You may know him from his greatest hits.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, SPEAKER, HOUSE OF COMMONS:  Order.  Order.  Order.  Resume your seat.  Resume your seat.  Don't tell me what the procedures of this House are.</p><p>Order.  I know what I'm doing.</p><p>It's utterly irresponsible chanting in the background.</p><p>The House must calm itself.  Zen.</p><p>Laughing and chuckling away as if there's a great amusement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Isn't that great?  Bianca Nobilo is here.  I can't think of a better person to exclusively interview, the Speaker.  By the way, the British media, some British media have dubbed him Speaker of the Devil.  Bianca, please explain because some people have called him either the greatest defender of democracy or someone who undermines it.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, he certainly excites a lot of passions and is a very controversial and colorful figure and that's why it was so great to speak to him, but by and large the MPs that I speak to, and I'm always talking to them every week, do have a lot of respect for him.</p><p>He has been embroiled in a couple of controversies, particularly over the management of some issues like bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons, but by and large, he is well respected for his ability to champion not the government's agenda, but that of back benchers and rank and file lawmakers, if you like.</p><p>And he has been successful of that.  And Paula, that's part of the reason that the Brexit debate is so shaped by him because Theresa May doesn't have a firm grip on Parliament because she has a minority government.  It means that when the Speaker selects ideas and stances from other members of Parliament, they take greater precedence.</p><p>So we now hear so many voices on the Brexit debate, and it's at a very confusing place, partly because of his championing of those backbenchers and Members of Parliament who aren't in government.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bianca, in terms of what he would say to defend himself, because some people have said that he's interfering in Brexit, and perhaps he's showing his hand had a little bit, even though he is supposed to be impeccably even-handed about this and non-partisan.</p><p>NOBILO:  So I spoke to him about how important it is for the Speaker to be an impartial figure, and I asked him was it difficult to transition from being a Member of Parliament, which is obviously a political animal to the Speaker which has to be impartial?  And he said no, because it's simply the duty of the Speaker to do that.</p><p>He also said that if he was truly impartial, it would be picked up constantly on social media, and in terms of the claims and accusations that are being made against him that he's being partial in the Brexit debate, he says, no, he's simply doing his job by representing the wider spectrum of opinions.</p><p>Also, when I spoke to him about how he decides what amendments to select and which way to move forward with the Brexit debate, he said he looks at which suggestions have are the most support in Parliament and which suggestions are coming not just from one side of the House of Commons, but from cross-parties.</p><p>So he has a mental check list, if you like, of considerations that he'll go through, and it was interesting because a lot of people will recognize the Speaker from Prime Minister's Questions, the boisterous event which we see every Wednesday here in the U.K., and I asked him how hard it was to cope with rowdy Members of Parliament, and he likened his job to something unexpected.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERCOW:  I'm a regular at my club with my son.  I'm a season ticket holder at Arsenal.  There are 60,000 people in the crowd, and there are virtually 60,000 people who think they know better than the referee.  The referee has just got to do his job as he thinks fit, and in a sense ...</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>BERCOW:   ... perhaps the Speaker is in a not all together dissimilar position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO:  Well, what was very clear to me, Paula, is that the speaker doesn't - isn't bothered by inconveniencing the government or, quote, \"moaning ministers.\"  He sees his job is to champion democracy, and that was clear to me that he was hugely passionate about the role of Parliament and trying to increase its authority, especially in such turbulent times.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it was funny to me, Bianca, that in trying to impugn his impartiality, they point to the fact that there was a bumper at his home that says \"Bollocks to Brexit.\"  I can only assume, Bianca, that he is in favor of free speech at his own home the way he is in the House of Parliament because he says the bumper sticker belongs to his wife.</p><p>Bianca, thanks so much for the interview.  We'll await to hear more from that very exclusive interview with the Speaker.  Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, stocks finished higher in London despite the Brexit uncertainty.  Elsewhere though, it was a mixed picture.  The Eurozone posted its flows, growth in four years with the final quarter of last year, and in Milan, stocks were hit by news that Italy slipped into recession in 2018.  The economy contracting for two straight quarters.  More on that later in this program.</p><p>Now with hundreds of billions of dollars of imports and exports on the line and time running out fast, Donald Trump calls for a top-level meeting with China's Xi Jinping to end this trade war.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Hello.  I'm Paula Newton, and there's more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment.  First though, these are the headlines on CNN this hour.</p><p>Exclusive video obtained by CNN is giving us a dramatic look at the last battles to drive ISIS from Syria.  Kurdish and Arab forces are fighting the remnants of ISIS on the ground backed up by U.S.-led air power, but ISIS fighters aren't giving us easily, battling to hold on to the last villages they control in Eastern Syria.</p><p>The U.S. is expressing grave concern over the accusation from Venezuela's self-declared acting President that his family is being intimidated by embattled President Nicolas Maduro.  Now, Juan Guaido says Mr. Maduro's special forces tried to enter the family's home.</p><p>In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, Guaido refused to rule out U.S. military intervention to end the escalating political unrest.  Defense attorneys present a closing argument in the trial of Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.</p><p>Joaquin Guzman is facing drug trafficking and other charges in New York.  Prosecutors presented more than 50 witnesses in the trial along with his phone calls, texts and documents.</p><p>Engineers at MIT have developed a robot that can actually play Jenga.  Now, the robot is able to see and feel individual blocks in a tower and has learned to switch blocks if it starts to wobble.  You may still have a chance to beat it though.  The robot isn't yet smart enough to work out which specific blocks would make your next turn impossible.  Let me see if it can make dinner.</p><p>OK, Donald Trump says this week's trade talks with China are going well, and will hopefully lead to a deal by March 1st.  Now, that's the last day before the U.S. may increase tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.  Mr. Trump is also making very clear, there will be no final deal until he meets again with China's President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Now, the president laid out his terms on Twitter, he wants Beijing to open its markets to U.S. financial manufacturing and agricultural businesses along with other sectors.  Mr. Trump added, he wants these talks to leave, quote, \"nothing unresolved.\"</p><p>Now, time is tight.  Even tighter if you can believe it than those Brexit talks.  Negotiators have until March 1st, just over four weeks away.  Now, if the deal can't be done by then, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods will increase from 10 percent to 25 percent, and you bet they are going to bite.</p><p>Carla Hills is a former U.S. trade representative, and she joins me now from Washington.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for joining us.  OK, the person who is at the table right now is Robert Lighthizer.  What do you think his main task is right now to get a deal with the Chinese or is it going to be a tougher thing to get a deal that the Trump administration will accept?</p><p>CARLA HILLS, FORMER UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  I suspect that the U.S. team will try to lay out exactly what the U.S. needs in order to move forward.  I don't anticipate that they will get a deal during this visit, and it's not because the president has said no deal until he meets with President Xi.</p><p>It is that there are so many things on the agenda.  I think they're going to have to meet again and perhaps a couple of times again and try to understand what each side needs to do.  What are the political limitations and the economic limitations?</p><p>NEWTON:  What many people are looking for in the Trump administration at least, and I believe the U.S. trade representative as well is structural reform.  Do you think that's just too ambitious, and at the end this trade deal.  If there is one, is going to look much different than that.</p><p>HILLS:  You have to define what you mean by structural reform.  I would ask the Chinese to remove the percentage caps on inward investment.  When they join the World Trade Organization in 2001, they committed to two basic norms, national treatment and non-discrimination, and they don't tell local firms that they can only have 39 percent in a given sector.</p><p>They should not tell a U.S. firm that they cannot come in and have green-field investments in areas of their interests.  And it is particularly important because in many instances, the joint ventures that have been mandated have been the pathway to get a hold of intellectual property that the U.S. holds, so it really needs to be corrected.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet if it needs to be corrected, do you think that means that a deal can't be done? We just went through the deadline, it is very tight, it is four weeks before those tariffs that are paid by the way by U.S. firms go up substantially.</p><p>HILLS:  Well, President Trump could take some of the things that they accomplish, perhaps extend and give a little more time.  I don't know how they're going to handle the negotiations, neither one of us is in the negotiating room.</p><p>NEWTON:  Your best guess though as someone who has been in this position before, and I lean on you because at a time when you were dealing with these issues with China, completely different era I understand, but it was that same debate, right?</p><p>[15:35:00]  Is China going to move to a more -- an economy that more mirrors capitalism in a way and privatization? Because a lot of people are saying now that actually in the last five years, especially with the state sponsorship of its companies, that China has actually moved backwards on these issues.</p><p>NEWTON:  I agree that China has moved backwards.  And we have a pre-eminent economist Nicholas Lardy who has just released a book called \"The State Strikes Back\".  And he, five years earlier, had written a book entitled \"Market Over Mao\".</p><p>And in 2014, when he wrote \"The Market Over Mao\", he was saying, look, the market is working.  It's -- the restrictions are coming down because that's where the profits are.  The private sector is making a difference.</p><p>And what he has noted and profoundly spells out in detail with charts is how that has turned around, that the government is spending more money, flowing more capital to state-owned enterprises that are not making a profit, whereas the private sector in China is making a profit.</p><p>We have a deal to make because what we're asking of China will actually be good for its economy.</p><p>NEWTON:  But they don't believe perhaps that it will be good for them politically, which is another argument entirely.  Ambassador Hills, before I let you go, you know, we have this issue of this CFO, this Huawei executive who is out on bail in Vancouver.</p><p>A lot of people are saying still cloud the talks, but I point more not to the case of one executive or even the 23 charges that have been put against Huawei and her and other executives.  But the fact that you had the Intel chiefs in the United States say the other day on Capitol Hill that Huawei poses an intelligence risk to the United States.</p><p>How do you see going forward with China, when basically, you have the intelligence community saying any kind of cooperation with this country on that level, even from a private company in China is a risk?</p><p>HILLS:  Well, as an old prosecutor, let me say, I don't have the facts of what the accusations are other than that, what has been in the press.  But if a case can be made whether it's against somebody from China or Brazil or England, that is for the prosecutors to make that case, and we should look at it objectively.</p><p>There are facts in earlier instances where there have been I think actions where they've stepped across the line.</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will see indeed how long it takes for that court -- that case to make its way through the courts.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for being with us, really appreciate it.  Now, when we return --</p><p>HILLS:  A pleasure --</p><p>NEWTON:  Two men are claiming to be Venezuela's president, one of them speaks to Cnn about his plan for fixing the country's broken economy.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now for the third time in a decade, yes, I said that, third time in a decade, Italy's economy has slipped into a recession.  Economic growth contracted for a second consecutive quarter in 2018, that's fueling fears that Italy's European neighbors could soon follow.</p><p>Lorenzo Codogno is the former chief economist and Director General at the Treasury Department of the Italian Ministry of Economy, and a visiting professor now at the London School of Economics.  He joins me now from London.  OK, the current government in power for eight months says these last two quarters are an absolute blip.</p><p>That there's no way that the Italian economy will grow.  Are they right?</p><p>LORENZO CODOGNO, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST &amp; DIRECTOR GENERAL, TREASURY DEPARTMENT, ITALIAN MINISTRY OF ECONOMY:  Well, you know, the global climate has changed, and if you look at the Eurozone growth, it is slowing fast.</p><p>And clearly, Italy is the weak spot, so I think this weakness will continue.  Actually, leading indicators already suggest that probably the first quarter of this year will be negative again.</p><p>The big issue here is whether at some point we see some stabilization during the course of this year and a modest recovery or whether this kind of slowdown transforms into a deeper and prolonged recession.  I think now it's not clear, but at least the first quarter will be negative, and I think given the negative carryover, probably the whole 2019 will end up in negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  The entire year of 2019 in a recession for Italy you think?</p><p>CODOGNO:  Well, again, given two negative quarters and the likely negative quarter at the beginning of this year, basically the year is already compromised to some extent, so unless you expect a sharp recovery in the second half, which I don't see at the moment, probably the overall outcome for the year is going to be negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  You know, it's a controversial question even to say it, but obviously the populist government here has a lot of policies out there that they are -- that are trial balloons.  Do you see anything in what they're proposing that could help the situation where the economy is concerned?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think the only positive here is that probably having a kind of anti-establishment protest parties in government basically prevents any, you know, upheaval in the streets as we have seen in France.  But other than that, I think there's a risk that the current government continues to roll back reforms introduced by the previous government and continues to have an anti-business attitude which would actually affect investment behavior by companies which I think is what is happening now.</p><p>NEWTON:  Interesting point of view you have though, that regular rank and file feel as if they have a voice in government now and that may be what's keeping them off the streets.  Before I let you go, I have to ask you in terms of any kind of contagion throughout Europe, there has been discussion about Germany also falling into a recession.</p><p>Mario Draghi has said, look, that there's reasons for the fact that he won't be -- that he will be continuing to stimulate those European economies, is he prudent to do so?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think so because I don't think that the Eurozone will enter a recession.  I think it's just a soft patch, but for Italy, it is definitely a recession and for the whole area, it is certainly softening of demand which would probably deserve a longer period of accommodative monetary policy.</p><p>So I think Mario Draghi and the ECB correct in slightly delaying the normalization of monetary conditions, so to speak.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and glad to hear that perhaps the rest of Europe may see some growth in 2019.  Lorenzo, thanks so much, really appreciate it.  Now the --</p><p>CODOGNO:  Thank you --</p><p>NEWTON:  Vice President of the European Commission says Europe needs a strong alliance between France and Germany to keep its economy moving.  Jyrki Katainen spoke to Richard in Davos last week and says it's the only way for Europe to move forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  Everybody should know that without a strong France-German access, Europe don't move forward -- Europe doesn't move forward.  So if you need a strong ownership, you need a strong leadership, especially in big countries.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN:  But --</p><p>KATAINEN:  It doesn't mean that smaller countries are put aside, but without strong France-German access, nothing moves on.</p><p>QUEST:  But hang on.  Should France and Germany be agreeing a treaty for closer economic cooperation, closer foreign policy cooperation, all the things that are in this treaty, shouldn't this be done in the greater sphere of the EU?</p><p>[15:45:00]  KATAINEN:  Of course, I mean, even the two big countries cannot decide anything separately from the other.  So the two countries are small enough to get decisions done unless the others don't support.  So we need overall more strong national ownership, ownership coming from the national governments whether you're big or small country, but it's not sufficient to sit on the fence and just see that if somebody is leading Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  OK, after the break, Europe's largest economies are trying to dance around U.S. sanctions on Iran.  You'll want these details up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  So right now, the Chief Financial Officer of the Chinese tech company Huawei is in -- is out on bail in Canada accused of dodging U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Now, three of the world's largest economies are openly trying to bypass sanctions on the same country.</p><p>Germany, France and the U.K. are working on a payment mechanism to allow their businesses to continue trading with Iran in defiance of President Trump's sanctions.  Now, it's called INSTEX, and it's an Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges.</p><p>Now, it's expected to operate like a barring platform or clearing house rather than relying on direct financial transactions, key, it won't be using U.S. dollars.  If Washington wants to punish those who use it, it would mean penalizing countries traditionally seen as its closest allies.</p><p>Now, Ramin Asgard is a former political adviser to the U.S. Central Command.  He was also director of America's Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai.  This is a controversial move by Europe, when they first proposed it, I actually didn't believe they'd go through with it.</p><p>It seems like they are no matter how honestly -- how modestly it begins.  Do you think it will elicit a response from the Trump administration?</p><p>RAMIN ASGARD, FORMER POLITICAL ADVISER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND:  Now, thank you very much.  I think what the Europeans have done is, they're playing a game of three-dimensional chess where they are a little bit caught between their responsibilities under the JCPOA and U.S. sanctions and not wanting to trigger them.</p><p>What they've done here is frankly, they've taken the smallest step forward in trying to show a little bit of independence from U.S. sanctions policy, and this INSTEX that has gone into effect today deals only at this point with humanitarian trade; food, medicine, medical equipment.</p><p>[15:50:00]  And they're hoping the Europeans that it will be enough to keep Iran in the JCPOA and not too much so that the United States will have any negative reaction to it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet Iran has already shown some impatience with the time table, and with as you said so far the humanitarian parameters of that.  As I say, you know, Mike Pompeo has called this a disastrous policy, and some are waiting to see exactly what kind of enrapture it will cause between the United States and these allies.</p><p>What is Europe trying to get at here?</p><p>ASGARD:  I think what the Europeans are trying to do is they desperately want the JCPOA to stay into effect.  They don't want Iran to break out again into a race for nuclear technology.  They think that could escalate very rapidly into a very serious conflict.</p><p>And so they want to play kind of an intermediate role with the United States.  This is a harkening back to what was going on in the 2000s basically where the EU three were doing their best to maintain Iran from going too rogue, and the United States was pretty much maintaining a strong thrust of sanctions.</p><p>If the EU is now looking to really stand up for its banks and its businesses and really step out, it would require them to go beyond humanitarian trade.  Remember, humanitarian trade is legal for U.S. sanctions in this case.  So, so far the EU is treading very carefully, but is definitely watching the trend and seeing, do we want to step any further?</p><p>Perhaps they're waiting for reactions from the Trump White House, from the Iranians to see where exactly this might head.  But they are maintaining at least a positive momentum and delivering on a promise that they had mentioned several months ago that they would do.</p><p>So in that effect, they are showing a little bit of independence and a little bit of forward progress for standing up for the EU three's position.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it will be a very interesting story to watch in the coming months, so thank you for your insights on this, appreciate it.  Now --</p><p>ASGARD:  Thank you very much.</p><p>NEWTON:  The self-declared president of Venezuela says he wants to reactivate the country's oil industry after the Trump administration placed sanctions on the state oil company.  Juan Guaido told Cnn that ordinary Venezuelans deserve those profits, not the embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  What we're doing is trying to reactivate this industry so there will be no usurping action by the way of Maduro and keeping this money and that the production of petroleum will be on behalf of Venezuela.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, the U.S. sanctions could have huge implications for the global oil industry.  Our emerging markets editor John Defterios told me the Trump administration is now playing hardball.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  The U.S. strategy seems very clear, starting first with the financial interests of PDVSA and directing those revenues that went into the United States to the National Assembly.</p><p>Number two, chasing bank accounts of Maduro and his cadre, even gold sitting in Germany and London hasn't taken action yet on that front.  And finally, I thought this was going to bubble to the surface, and that is Citco; it's a large refinery in the United States, has 5,000 petrol stations throughout the country, 30 states to be specific.</p><p>They could freeze the assets or again redirect those revenues somewhere else.  This is playing the hardball.  I think also we have to look at the bigger picture.  You know this very well, Russia and China have been playing in Venezuela for the better part of the decade, funneling nearly $70 billion into the country.</p><p>I can't imagine they're going to pick up their sticks, walk away and let Donald Trump fill this void in Venezuela.  But the U.S. is using all the economic tools.  You know the power of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that shut down banking systems, particularly the dollar because of the hyper inflation in Venezuela so vital to the economy, but they're doing it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they're doing it, and they've decided, as you said, a full-corps press, they're going to go all the way now.  Secretary Mnuchin being very clear that he is in touch with oil companies and those refineries in the Gulf that might be impacted.</p><p>In terms of Venezuela itself, I mean, John, the devastation and the production of oil in Venezuela has been staggering, which means it's only really has left the very little oil that actually it produces right now, that it could get out right now and, of course, as you were pointing out, Citgo.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes, let's cover PDVSA, this is the biggest collapse of any state oil company in the history of the business, at least since World War II.  If it didn't face a conflict on its soil -- take a look at the numbers, Paula, we're looking now at production at the end of 2018 according to OPEC at 1.1 million barrels a day.</p><p>[15:55:00]  If you rolled back the clock to 2008, it was 3.2 million barrels a day.  PDVSA used to be a very well run state oil company, that's not the case now, 20 years of Hugo Chavez and Maduro together, the last 10, the crunch, and you almost have a foreign direct investment freeze on the company because there's no reinvestment, and they've been printing money and that's why you have the hyper inflation.</p><p>Citgo is a very valuable brand in the United States, as you well know.  It will be really interesting to see how aggressive the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration plan to be going forward with that asset.</p><p>Also, we can't, you know, shut out the fact the poor Venezuelans, a million percent inflation last year, the IMF is suggesting ten times that in 2019, and I think you've seen the graph, poverty had shot up 40 percent in the last five years alone, Paula, to nearly 90 percent.</p><p>You've been on the ground there, it's absolutely painful and the number one asset, number one proven reserves in the world when it comes to oil is heavy crude, but they're not extracting it now because nobody wants to invest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, you are just a few minutes away until that closing bell and the close of trade for January.  It's been a great January and we will be right back to cap it all off for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  We are heading into the last few minutes of trading on Wall Street, and as you can see there, even the Dow has turned positive today.  U.S. markets are set to finish -- all three markets are set to finish higher today, and it's been a really good month for all three major indices.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is having its best January since 1987! Lifted by some strong results, of course, they are better-than-expected at the ones we have been talking about from yesterday.  Facebook, even GE getting in on the action.  A quick look now at that Dow as you can see there, most of those stocks in positive territory, even companies like Cat that continue to rely on that U.S.-China showdown -- trade showdown.</p><p>Drug-maker Pfizer is the best performer of the day, up about 3 percent.  Now, it is the busiest week of the quarter for earnings, Amazon report right after the markets close in just a few minutes, investors will find out how the holiday shopping season went as well as Amazon integration with Whole Foods and of course the all important growth on cloud services.</p><p>Chevron and Exxon close out the weeks, big earnings reports on Friday.  And as we hear, the applause for the closing bell today.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Paula Newton, \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper is next.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2174420945</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB8-TVN1-JBHT-D49F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

We will get to that.  There is a lot going on today and this is what's moving markets on Thursday, the 31st of January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You thought scandals could hurt Facebook.  Yeah, right.  Their shares are soaring and profits have never been better.  Not to be outdone, GE.  Shares are up even more after the company's signs of a turnaround there are finally under way.  And we've got China, trade talks in the Oval Office any minute now.  Yes, I told you.  A busy hour ahead.  I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Sandals?  What scandals?  We're in the final hour of trading on Wall Street, and even as new controversies emerge, I'm telling you just in the last few minutes, Facebook shares are on pace for their best day in three years.  Now the company which also owns Messenger, WhatApp and Instagram booked a record profit of $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.  As you can see up better than 12%.</p><p>Facebook spent the fourth quarter fighting scandal after scandal.  First, the crisis that kept on giving, Facebook slow response to the Russian election interference and reports that Facebook executives advised against revealing publicly what they knew about that.  Second, Facebook was too slow to remove posts discussing the sale of a child bride in South Sudan.  Third, that Facebook executives hired a PR firm to attack liberal billionaire, George Soros.</p><p>Then, in December, two privacy scandals in quick succession.  First, a bug which exposed photos from 6.8 million new users and then, of course, less than one week later, another report that Facebook shared far more user data with companies like Microsoft and Yahoo than it had admitted.</p><p>Remember, these are just from the last three months of 2018, not in the history of the Facebook.  Now, the rest of the year was as bad or worse.  So has any of this driven away any users?  I bet you already know the  answer to that.  Facebook's Chief Financial Officer dealt with that on the earnings call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAVID WEHNER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  I would just - you know, I'd probably just let the numbers stand for themselves.  We saw, that you know, we are growing in all regions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  You heard it.  The numbers speak for themselves.  Now that growth explains Facebook's stock surge today.  Wall Street is betting 2.7 billion users can't be wrong.  Now, just in the last few minutes, new revelations.  Facebook and Twitter say they have removed thousands of accounts that engaged in coordinated, what they say is inauthentic action.  Many of those accounts originated this time in Iran and targeted users right around the world.</p><p>Our Samuel Burke is in London with the latest.  Samuel, I know were on the call getting the information on this, why today and how intrusive, how serious is this?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, Paula, the contrast could not be more stunning.  On the one hand you have a company whose stock is roaring up nearly 12% as you just described and yet, on the very same day that the stock is surging, the company is making clear that they do not have the reins, the control over their own social network.</p><p>In the past few minutes, Facebook announcing a huge campaign to bring down what they call inauthentic behavior, originating in Iran they say, though they are careful to note that there is not a connection to the government that they can see right now.</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen exactly the scope of what we're seeing here according to Facebook starting with the removal of 783 pages, groups and accounts, Paula, and it's not just Facebook.  It's also on Instagram.  About two million accounts, we're following at least one of these pages and Facebook was taking money for them, nearly $30,000.00 in spending for ads.</p><p>Many of these pages and accounts were masquerading as news websites, Paula, doing the work of journalists or that's what they wanted the users to believe, and Facebook is even sharing some of the posts that they say they have taken down already.  Many of them are anti-Israel in tone.  We have a post just like this, printing them out right now, this is just coming off.  \"Jene reconnais absolument pas Israel.\"  \"I will absolutely not recognize Israel.\"</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>BURKE:  We have other accounts with images like this, the stereotypical anti-Semitic images of somebody with the Star of David and the large nose.  Of course, these aren't from authentic accounts.  These aren't people's actual political views or anti-Israel messages, they are inauthentic accounts, coordinated accounts, and at the very same time, Paula, we see reports coming from \"The  Washington Post\" that Twitter is also taking down pages that they say originate in Iran, Russia and Venezuela.</p><p>Again, important to note that these companies aren't making links to the governments.  They are saying that this activity just originates in those countries.</p><p>NEWTON:  Any insight into how they found this and exactly if they are getting any better at trying to take down some of these accounts more quickly?</p><p>BURKE:  Well, they are saying they are working with outside parties to do analysis of this type of content, and the fact that there's another social network doing it right now as well might say that this was part of a broader effort.  Facebook saying that they've shared the information with the U.S. government, but we have no sense whatsoever if they are getting better at this.</p><p>In fact, I might even argue that it looks like they might be getting worse.  Now, you might be saying, \"Well, why?  If they are taking down the accounts.\"  Tucked into the earnings report was a line that said that the number of fake accounts, Paula, on Facebook has risen by 27% to an all-time high of 116 million fake accounts on Facebook, and that's according to Facebook.  What about the pages that they may not know about?</p><p>Incredible that Sheryl Sandberg said after the earnings report, \"We have proved with this blockbuster report that we can both protect the platform and at the same time have profitability.\"  If have you a surge of 27%, 116 million fake accounts, have you really protected the platform?</p><p>NEWTON:  They claim, yes, right?  They say they are doing the best that they can, and that is the challenge that they are up against.  Our Samuel Burke, thanks so much for jumping on that very quickly.  As you can see, more news from Facebook with the problems they are having on protecting the authenticity really, of their own platform.</p><p>Now, as we were saying, Facebook shares don't seem to be alarmed in the slightest by the latest development.  If you can see, they are up better than 11%.  I want now you to weigh in on this.  Please go to cnn.com/join.  I want to hear from you.  Our question today is would you consider quitting Facebook?  I'm going to ask you again.  Anybody here in the studio going to give me an answer on that?  Look at this, a silence.  I'm getting silence, people.  No Facebook login is required.  We'll discuss the results in a moment.</p><p>And I want all of you on the record as well.  Rana Foroohar is CNN's global economic analyst and columnist at \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST, CNN:  Who recently quit Facebook.</p><p>NEWTON:  They are sick of me telling them I have never been on Facebook ever in my life.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Interesting.</p><p>NEWTON:  I identified it as a security risk early on in my career.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Good for you.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, Rana, you identified 2018 as the tech lash.  I'm going to read your editorial back to you.  You said, \"This is a company that was so desperate to protect its top leadership and its business model that it hired a shadowy PR firm that used anti-Semitism as a political weapon.\"</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Indeed, and here we are.</p><p>NEWTON:  But here's what I say to you.  It worked.  Their user base continues to grow.  They are a very large formidable platform now.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they say they are doing their best.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.  It's interesting.  I mean, Sheryl Sandberg came out and said, look, this last quarter has proved not only can we add people to combat some of the fake news issues, we can fight regulators and we can grow at the same time.</p><p>But I'll tell you something, I think this year is really going to be the turning point because at the same time that you have all of these good news happening with the Facebook shares, you have Senator Mark Warner, for example, Democrat in the U.S. coming out and saying, he's crafting new legislation to try to put and a price on data so that people know the value of what have they are giving away.</p><p>I think a lot of the fact that people still go to these platforms has to do with the fact that they have no idea the value of what they are giving up.  And I think that when that becomes more transparent and you might get more competitors if there are antitrust issue, we could see a change.</p><p>NEWTON:  It's so trite and such a cliche, but obviously, an educated consumer is the best thing that could happen here especially when it even comes to those accounts that Samuel did such a good job of highlighting, if you're looking at something like that to really try and to see its origin and where it is coming from.</p><p>I mean, I know I gravitate on something like Twitter to verified accounts, right, just to see what's there.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Exactly.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, you know, it's kind of like even regulation, will it work?  Remember, we all - I know a lot of people don't remember the phone company, but we all used to be angry at the phone company, but we didn't rip the phone off the wall.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Right.</p><p>NEWTON:  That's what's happening here, Rana.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's true, but again, I am going to go back to this idea of competition.  A lot of people see the privacy issues posed by Facebook and Google and the like and the competition issues in two separate baskets.</p><p>I actually see them as being together, and I think that as you get U.S. and E.U. regulators really boring down and probably bringing some antitrust cases against these companies, it will be like if you remember 20 years ago when Microsoft was under fire.  The U.S. went after Microsoft for antitrust issues.  That actually allowed space for Google to be born.  I think that you're going to see new companies being born as these come under more pressure.</p><p>[15:10:08]</p><p>NEWTON:  And that they will have some more competition even more.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think they will, and I think even amongst the giants, you already see companies like Apple and IBM starting to compete on privacy and using data protection and privacy as a competitive advantage, so I think that this issue is out there.  I think you're going to see a lot of action this year.</p><p>NEWTON:  One of the things some people have pointed out though, and as you give Facebook the benefit of the doubt, they say they are trying their best.  They are leveraging everything that they have at this right now.  You're skeptical?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Well, I'm skeptical because the fundamental business proposition is still tracking everything you do and monetizing it.  It's surveillance capitalism.  I mean, this is a whole new area.  And by the way, it's not just the platform tech companies that are in it.  Almost every business these days is trying to track what you do from say a Starbucks to a Johnson &amp; Johnson.  I mean, your sneakers have chips in them.</p><p>This is - data is the new oil, and so I think that all the things you're seeing right now that Facebook is coming under pressure for, you're going to see broader number of companies facing these pressures.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet some people say that because of definitely deep pockets and them getting in on the ground floor of regulation, that it's actually Facebook that's going to be the winner in any kind of regulatory fight.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's interesting.  I mean, certainly in Europe, GDPR which is the new privacy regulation that rolled out this past year, it favors the big players in a sense that they have the money to actually enforce these rules and to comply.  Smaller players don't have that legal muscle, but I think we're in the beginning stages of a war.  This is the first battle.  This is really going to be I think the new too big to fail battle in some ways.  It's going to be big tech versus regulators just as the way it was with the banks.</p><p>NEWTON:  One difference, I have yet to see the consumer outrage.  We have to go.  But what do you think?  Do you think we'll see it?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think we're going to see an Exxon Valdez privacy probably around kids -- kids and games.</p><p>NEWTON:  Good point.  Rana, always so good to have you on here.  Really appreciate it.  Remember, she called it technological 2018.  According to those of you voting at cnn.com/join, most of you say, you would consider quitting Facebook, about a quarter of you say no way.  I wonder what the age spread is on that.</p><p>It is the last hour of trading on the last day of the month.  The Dow is down on the day, but all three major indices are way up for the month.  And as you can see there, the NASDAQ getting a nice rally.  Now, earlier today, the chief market strategist at National Holdings, Art Hogan put the rally into context for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL HOLDINGS:  We are having the best January in 30 years.  We had the worst December in 30 years, 80 years.  I'd say we're pairing off very nicely in the last two months.</p><p>I think we've gotten back to the midpoint where valuations are reasonable.  We are trading about 15.5 times this year's earnings and I think that when you look at where both the Dow and S&amp;P are, it's basically where we started last year, so we've gone 12 months without doing much and at the same time, multiples have come down because earnings are much better.</p><p>Now, in 2019, the S&amp;P can earn $170.00, which is down from $182.00, that's about 6% earnings growth, then I think we can have a normal year where things don't go crazy and we're going to be at 2,800 or 2,850 at the end of the year on the S&amp;P.</p><p>The only thing that stops that is trade.  If this is a long drawn out mutually destructive trade war --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will get to that trade - those trade negotiations later this hour.  Now, it is a good month as we were saying for the markets and a busy day for earnings.  Here to discuss all of that is CNN's Paul La Monica and of course, CNN's Matt Egan.  Thank you both.  I hope you came armed with opinions.  There's a lot of insight to be had from a lot of numbers.  Let's go first.  General Electric, it's funny because it's a great day for General Electric, but look where it had to come from?</p><p>MATT EGAN, LEAD WRITER, CNN BUSINESS:  You're right.  You know, I think that Wall Street is betting that the crisis at GE may finally be over.  The stock is up double digits.  It's like 45 minutes away from the best day in almost a decade, and, you know, the actual numbers were pretty crummy.  Power was down again.  GE wouldn't even say whether or not they will generate any positive free cash flow in 2019, but, you know, they did clean up one of the sins from the past.  They had a $1.5 billion settlement over WMC Mortgage.</p><p>Aviation was really good.  They had a profit there.  It was up 24%.  There were orders for their engine.  It was up a lot and so, you know, I do think that investors are betting that GE may have finally turned a corner here.</p><p>NEWTON:  Tesla, no one is agnostic over Tesla.  People love to hate it or love to love it.  In those latest results, certainly a lot of people were talking about the production issues there, but cash seemed to be okay.  Cash on --</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, Tesla still has a decent amount of cash.  I don't think that's the worry right now, Paula.  The problem, the biggest problem, I think, Elon Musk, you just have to scratch your head and wonder why he does the things he does in the way he does sometimes.</p><p>They wait until the very last moment of the conference call with analysts after their earnings to pull the reverse Steve Jobs one more thing moment.  They gave bad news that the CFO is leaving, and that just, I think, leaves a bad taste.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was the last thing in the phone call.</p><p>LA MONICA:  It was the last thing in the phone call.  You look at the transcript.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bury the headline.</p><p>[15:15:07]</p><p>LA MONICA:  It's just bizarre that this is what happened, because it's not as if there's anything wrong with Tesla.  That's probably the reason why the CFO is leaving.  He's actually done two stints as CFO.  It's nice for him to be able to go off into the sunset at a time where ...</p><p>NEWTON:  With that cash on hand.</p><p>LA MONICA:  ... people do feel like they have a good amount of cash and Model 3 demand is there.  So there are a lot of things to like about Tesla, but Musk can't get out of his own way sometimes.</p><p>EGAN:  It's just another reminder that it's just like the ultimate high wire act there at Tesla because it's all built on divisionary brilliance of Elon Musk which sometimes will lead to some executives leaving, and there's also a lot of debt there, which is why we're talking about cash, and that has continued to be a concern there at Tesla.</p><p>NEWTON:  It has been a great month for stocks so far.  We've got Amazon tomorrow.  Is this just going to blow -- sorry, today after the bell.  Is that going to blow the roof off of this market?</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think we have to wait and see.  I think what people are really going to be focusing on with Amazon.  We know that sales growth in the core retail business is starting to slow.  Hopefully they had a good holiday quarter, both at the online business as well as their own branded brick and mortar stores, Whole Foods, et cetera, but the number I'm really going to be looking at, Paula, is the AWS Cloud figures because Amazon Web Services is so insanely profitable that it helps to subsidize every other thing that Jeff Bezos wants to do at Amazon.</p><p>Sometimes that requires big investments that may lose money, but they can afford to do it because AWS is just a huge cash cow now.</p><p>NEWTON:  We saw Microsoft as well earlier with those great Cloud numbers as well, although the stock didn't fare so well.  A lot of it was okay.  In terms of where we're going in general with the market, gentlemen, I mean, I've heard both things about the earnings.  Of course, it's company dependent.</p><p>January though was a great month because basically expectations have been lowered, right, and people blew out the expectations.</p><p>EGAN:  I also think it was because December was so horrible, right.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was horrible.</p><p>EGAN:  It was the worst December that we've seen in quite a long time and I think it was about the fact that people feared an imminent recession in the economy.  They worried about the Federal Reserve being overly aggressive, and the U.S.-China trade war.  Listen, January is better because all three of those things have improved.</p><p>U.S. and China are talking instead of raising tariffs on each other.  The idea of an imminent recession doesn't seem likely right now and we have the Federal Reserve that went from unbelievably hawkish to really dovish in record time.</p><p>LA MONICA:  You were at the NYC yesterday and I swore when I was waiting to talk to you on yesterday's \"QMB Express Show\" I think there was a trader behind you whistling \"Patience\" you know, the Guns 'n Roses song.  I might be making it up because I'm a Gen X'er and I remember Gun's 'n Roses from the late '80s early '90s.</p><p>NEWTON:  I don't think you're making it up.</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think someone was actually whistling that because it's the word of the month.  Patience is the reason why we're having this record-setting or almost record-setting January.</p><p>NEWTON:  We have to leave it there.  But really, the Fed gets the credit.  The fact that Donald Trump even got off of the Fed's back.  We'll tell you all you need to know about that Fed meeting yesterday.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both so much.  You came armed with opinions.  I love it.  More of you two.  Excellent.  Coming up.  He is marshalling the Brexit debates in the British Parliament, and gaining worldwide attention.  Speaker of the House of Commons, you'll want to hear this.  He talks exclusively to CNN.</p><p>And Italy's economic downturn becomes has a full-blown recession.  Could its European neighbors soon follow?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:20:00]</p><p>NEWTON:  Now in a rare an exclusive television, the Speaker of the British House of Commons tells CNN says his job is like being a football referee.  You know the kind of football I'm talking about here, right, it's what we call soccer.</p><p>John Bercow is gaining an ever higher profile, thanks to his role in Parliament's Brexit drama.  You may know him from his greatest hits.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, SPEAKER, HOUSE OF COMMONS:  Order.  Order.  Order.  Resume your seat.  Resume your seat.  Don't tell me what the procedures of this House are.</p><p>Order.  I know what I'm doing.</p><p>It's utterly irresponsible chanting in the background.</p><p>The House must calm itself.  Zen.</p><p>Laughing and chuckling away as if there's a great amusement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Isn't that great?  Bianca Nobilo is here.  I can't think of a better person to exclusively interview, the Speaker.  By the way, the British media, some British media have dubbed him Speaker of the Devil.  Bianca, please explain because some people have called him either the greatest defender of democracy or someone who undermines it.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, he certainly excites a lot of passions and is a very controversial and colorful figure and that's why it was so great to speak to him, but by and large the MPs that I speak to, and I'm always talking to them every week, do have a lot of respect for him.</p><p>He has been embroiled in a couple of controversies, particularly over the management of some issues like bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons, but by and large, he is well respected for his ability to champion not the government's agenda, but that of back benchers and rank and file lawmakers, if you like.</p><p>And he has been successful of that.  And Paula, that's part of the reason that the Brexit debate is so shaped by him because Theresa May doesn't have a firm grip on Parliament because she has a minority government.  It means that when the Speaker selects ideas and stances from other members of Parliament, they take greater precedence.</p><p>So we now hear so many voices on the Brexit debate, and it's at a very confusing place, partly because of his championing of those backbenchers and Members of Parliament who aren't in government.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bianca, in terms of what he would say to defend himself, because some people have said that he's interfering in Brexit, and perhaps he's showing his hand had a little bit, even though he is supposed to be impeccably even-handed about this and non-partisan.</p><p>NOBILO:  So I spoke to him about how important it is for the Speaker to be an impartial figure, and I asked him was it difficult to transition from being a Member of Parliament, which is obviously a political animal to the Speaker which has to be impartial?  And he said no, because it's simply the duty of the Speaker to do that.</p><p>He also said that if he was truly impartial, it would be picked up constantly on social media, and in terms of the claims and accusations that are being made against him that he's being partial in the Brexit debate, he says, no, he's simply doing his job by representing the wider spectrum of opinions.</p><p>Also, when I spoke to him about how he decides what amendments to select and which way to move forward with the Brexit debate, he said he looks at which suggestions have are the most support in Parliament and which suggestions are coming not just from one side of the House of Commons, but from cross-parties.</p><p>So he has a mental check list, if you like, of considerations that he'll go through, and it was interesting because a lot of people will recognize the Speaker from Prime Minister's Questions, the boisterous event which we see every Wednesday here in the U.K., and I asked him how hard it was to cope with rowdy Members of Parliament, and he likened his job to something unexpected.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERCOW:  I'm a regular at my club with my son.  I'm a season ticket holder at Arsenal.  There are 60,000 people in the crowd, and there are virtually 60,000 people who think they know better than the referee.  The referee has just got to do his job as he thinks fit, and in a sense ...</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>BERCOW:   ... perhaps the Speaker is in a not all together dissimilar position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO:  Well, what was very clear to me, Paula, is that the speaker doesn't - isn't bothered by inconveniencing the government or, quote, \"moaning ministers.\"  He sees his job is to champion democracy, and that was clear to me that he was hugely passionate about the role of Parliament and trying to increase its authority, especially in such turbulent times.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it was funny to me, Bianca, that in trying to impugn his impartiality, they point to the fact that there was a bumper at his home that says \"Bollocks to Brexit.\"  I can only assume, Bianca, that he is in favor of free speech at his own home the way he is in the House of Parliament because he says the bumper sticker belongs to his wife.</p><p>Bianca, thanks so much for the interview.  We'll await to hear more from that very exclusive interview with the Speaker.  Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, stocks finished higher in London despite the Brexit uncertainty.  Elsewhere though, it was a mixed picture.  The Eurozone posted its flows, growth in four years with the final quarter of last year, and in Milan, stocks were hit by news that Italy slipped into recession in 2018.  The economy contracting for two straight quarters.  More on that later in this program.</p><p>Now with hundreds of billions of dollars of imports and exports on the line and time running out fast, Donald Trump calls for a top-level meeting with China's Xi Jinping to end this trade war.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Hello.  I'm Paula Newton, and there's more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment.  First though, these are the headlines on CNN this hour.</p><p>Exclusive video obtained by CNN is giving us a dramatic look at the last battles to drive ISIS from Syria.  Kurdish and Arab forces are fighting the remnants of ISIS on the ground backed up by U.S.-led air power, but ISIS fighters aren't giving us easily, battling to hold on to the last villages they control in Eastern Syria.</p><p>The U.S. is expressing grave concern over the accusation from Venezuela's self-declared acting President that his family is being intimidated by embattled President Nicolas Maduro.  Now, Juan Guaido says Mr. Maduro's special forces tried to enter the family's home.</p><p>In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, Guaido refused to rule out U.S. military intervention to end the escalating political unrest.  Defense attorneys present a closing argument in the trial of Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.</p><p>Joaquin Guzman is facing drug trafficking and other charges in New York.  Prosecutors presented more than 50 witnesses in the trial along with his phone calls, texts and documents.</p><p>Engineers at MIT have developed a robot that can actually play Jenga.  Now, the robot is able to see and feel individual blocks in a tower and has learned to switch blocks if it starts to wobble.  You may still have a chance to beat it though.  The robot isn't yet smart enough to work out which specific blocks would make your next turn impossible.  Let me see if it can make dinner.</p><p>OK, Donald Trump says this week's trade talks with China are going well, and will hopefully lead to a deal by March 1st.  Now, that's the last day before the U.S. may increase tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.  Mr. Trump is also making very clear, there will be no final deal until he meets again with China's President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Now, the president laid out his terms on Twitter, he wants Beijing to open its markets to U.S. financial manufacturing and agricultural businesses along with other sectors.  Mr. Trump added, he wants these talks to leave, quote, \"nothing unresolved.\"</p><p>Now, time is tight.  Even tighter if you can believe it than those Brexit talks.  Negotiators have until March 1st, just over four weeks away.  Now, if the deal can't be done by then, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods will increase from 10 percent to 25 percent, and you bet they are going to bite.</p><p>Carla Hills is a former U.S. trade representative, and she joins me now from Washington.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for joining us.  OK, the person who is at the table right now is Robert Lighthizer.  What do you think his main task is right now to get a deal with the Chinese or is it going to be a tougher thing to get a deal that the Trump administration will accept?</p><p>CARLA HILLS, FORMER UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  I suspect that the U.S. team will try to lay out exactly what the U.S. needs in order to move forward.  I don't anticipate that they will get a deal during this visit, and it's not because the president has said no deal until he meets with President Xi.</p><p>It is that there are so many things on the agenda.  I think they're going to have to meet again and perhaps a couple of times again and try to understand what each side needs to do.  What are the political limitations and the economic limitations?</p><p>NEWTON:  What many people are looking for in the Trump administration at least, and I believe the U.S. trade representative as well is structural reform.  Do you think that's just too ambitious, and at the end this trade deal.  If there is one, is going to look much different than that.</p><p>HILLS:  You have to define what you mean by structural reform.  I would ask the Chinese to remove the percentage caps on inward investment.  When they join the World Trade Organization in 2001, they committed to two basic norms, national treatment and non-discrimination, and they don't tell local firms that they can only have 39 percent in a given sector.</p><p>They should not tell a U.S. firm that they cannot come in and have green-field investments in areas of their interests.  And it is particularly important because in many instances, the joint ventures that have been mandated have been the pathway to get a hold of intellectual property that the U.S. holds, so it really needs to be corrected.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet if it needs to be corrected, do you think that means that a deal can't be done? We just went through the deadline, it is very tight, it is four weeks before those tariffs that are paid by the way by U.S. firms go up substantially.</p><p>HILLS:  Well, President Trump could take some of the things that they accomplish, perhaps extend and give a little more time.  I don't know how they're going to handle the negotiations, neither one of us is in the negotiating room.</p><p>NEWTON:  Your best guess though as someone who has been in this position before, and I lean on you because at a time when you were dealing with these issues with China, completely different era I understand, but it was that same debate, right?</p><p>[15:35:00]  Is China going to move to a more -- an economy that more mirrors capitalism in a way and privatization? Because a lot of people are saying now that actually in the last five years, especially with the state sponsorship of its companies, that China has actually moved backwards on these issues.</p><p>NEWTON:  I agree that China has moved backwards.  And we have a pre-eminent economist Nicholas Lardy who has just released a book called \"The State Strikes Back\".  And he, five years earlier, had written a book entitled \"Market Over Mao\".</p><p>And in 2014, when he wrote \"The Market Over Mao\", he was saying, look, the market is working.  It's -- the restrictions are coming down because that's where the profits are.  The private sector is making a difference.</p><p>And what he has noted and profoundly spells out in detail with charts is how that has turned around, that the government is spending more money, flowing more capital to state-owned enterprises that are not making a profit, whereas the private sector in China is making a profit.</p><p>We have a deal to make because what we're asking of China will actually be good for its economy.</p><p>NEWTON:  But they don't believe perhaps that it will be good for them politically, which is another argument entirely.  Ambassador Hills, before I let you go, you know, we have this issue of this CFO, this Huawei executive who is out on bail in Vancouver.</p><p>A lot of people are saying still cloud the talks, but I point more not to the case of one executive or even the 23 charges that have been put against Huawei and her and other executives.  But the fact that you had the Intel chiefs in the United States say the other day on Capitol Hill that Huawei poses an intelligence risk to the United States.</p><p>How do you see going forward with China, when basically, you have the intelligence community saying any kind of cooperation with this country on that level, even from a private company in China is a risk?</p><p>HILLS:  Well, as an old prosecutor, let me say, I don't have the facts of what the accusations are other than that, what has been in the press.  But if a case can be made whether it's against somebody from China or Brazil or England, that is for the prosecutors to make that case, and we should look at it objectively.</p><p>There are facts in earlier instances where there have been I think actions where they've stepped across the line.</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will see indeed how long it takes for that court -- that case to make its way through the courts.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for being with us, really appreciate it.  Now, when we return --</p><p>HILLS:  A pleasure --</p><p>NEWTON:  Two men are claiming to be Venezuela's president, one of them speaks to Cnn about his plan for fixing the country's broken economy.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now for the third time in a decade, yes, I said that, third time in a decade, Italy's economy has slipped into a recession.  Economic growth contracted for a second consecutive quarter in 2018, that's fueling fears that Italy's European neighbors could soon follow.</p><p>Lorenzo Codogno is the former chief economist and Director General at the Treasury Department of the Italian Ministry of Economy, and a visiting professor now at the London School of Economics.  He joins me now from London.  OK, the current government in power for eight months says these last two quarters are an absolute blip.</p><p>That there's no way that the Italian economy will grow.  Are they right?</p><p>LORENZO CODOGNO, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST &amp; DIRECTOR GENERAL, TREASURY DEPARTMENT, ITALIAN MINISTRY OF ECONOMY:  Well, you know, the global climate has changed, and if you look at the Eurozone growth, it is slowing fast.</p><p>And clearly, Italy is the weak spot, so I think this weakness will continue.  Actually, leading indicators already suggest that probably the first quarter of this year will be negative again.</p><p>The big issue here is whether at some point we see some stabilization during the course of this year and a modest recovery or whether this kind of slowdown transforms into a deeper and prolonged recession.  I think now it's not clear, but at least the first quarter will be negative, and I think given the negative carryover, probably the whole 2019 will end up in negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  The entire year of 2019 in a recession for Italy you think?</p><p>CODOGNO:  Well, again, given two negative quarters and the likely negative quarter at the beginning of this year, basically the year is already compromised to some extent, so unless you expect a sharp recovery in the second half, which I don't see at the moment, probably the overall outcome for the year is going to be negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  You know, it's a controversial question even to say it, but obviously the populist government here has a lot of policies out there that they are -- that are trial balloons.  Do you see anything in what they're proposing that could help the situation where the economy is concerned?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think the only positive here is that probably having a kind of anti-establishment protest parties in government basically prevents any, you know, upheaval in the streets as we have seen in France.  But other than that, I think there's a risk that the current government continues to roll back reforms introduced by the previous government and continues to have an anti-business attitude which would actually affect investment behavior by companies which I think is what is happening now.</p><p>NEWTON:  Interesting point of view you have though, that regular rank and file feel as if they have a voice in government now and that may be what's keeping them off the streets.  Before I let you go, I have to ask you in terms of any kind of contagion throughout Europe, there has been discussion about Germany also falling into a recession.</p><p>Mario Draghi has said, look, that there's reasons for the fact that he won't be -- that he will be continuing to stimulate those European economies, is he prudent to do so?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think so because I don't think that the Eurozone will enter a recession.  I think it's just a soft patch, but for Italy, it is definitely a recession and for the whole area, it is certainly softening of demand which would probably deserve a longer period of accommodative monetary policy.</p><p>So I think Mario Draghi and the ECB correct in slightly delaying the normalization of monetary conditions, so to speak.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and glad to hear that perhaps the rest of Europe may see some growth in 2019.  Lorenzo, thanks so much, really appreciate it.  Now the --</p><p>CODOGNO:  Thank you --</p><p>NEWTON:  Vice President of the European Commission says Europe needs a strong alliance between France and Germany to keep its economy moving.  Jyrki Katainen spoke to Richard in Davos last week and says it's the only way for Europe to move forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  Everybody should know that without a strong France-German access, Europe don't move forward -- Europe doesn't move forward.  So if you need a strong ownership, you need a strong leadership, especially in big countries.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN:  But --</p><p>KATAINEN:  It doesn't mean that smaller countries are put aside, but without strong France-German access, nothing moves on.</p><p>QUEST:  But hang on.  Should France and Germany be agreeing a treaty for closer economic cooperation, closer foreign policy cooperation, all the things that are in this treaty, shouldn't this be done in the greater sphere of the EU?</p><p>[15:45:00]  KATAINEN:  Of course, I mean, even the two big countries cannot decide anything separately from the other.  So the two countries are small enough to get decisions done unless the others don't support.  So we need overall more strong national ownership, ownership coming from the national governments whether you're big or small country, but it's not sufficient to sit on the fence and just see that if somebody is leading Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  OK, after the break, Europe's largest economies are trying to dance around U.S. sanctions on Iran.  You'll want these details up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  So right now, the Chief Financial Officer of the Chinese tech company Huawei is in -- is out on bail in Canada accused of dodging U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Now, three of the world's largest economies are openly trying to bypass sanctions on the same country.</p><p>Germany, France and the U.K. are working on a payment mechanism to allow their businesses to continue trading with Iran in defiance of President Trump's sanctions.  Now, it's called INSTEX, and it's an Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges.</p><p>Now, it's expected to operate like a barring platform or clearing house rather than relying on direct financial transactions, key, it won't be using U.S. dollars.  If Washington wants to punish those who use it, it would mean penalizing countries traditionally seen as its closest allies.</p><p>Now, Ramin Asgard is a former political adviser to the U.S. Central Command.  He was also director of America's Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai.  This is a controversial move by Europe, when they first proposed it, I actually didn't believe they'd go through with it.</p><p>It seems like they are no matter how honestly -- how modestly it begins.  Do you think it will elicit a response from the Trump administration?</p><p>RAMIN ASGARD, FORMER POLITICAL ADVISER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND:  Now, thank you very much.  I think what the Europeans have done is, they're playing a game of three-dimensional chess where they are a little bit caught between their responsibilities under the JCPOA and U.S. sanctions and not wanting to trigger them.</p><p>What they've done here is frankly, they've taken the smallest step forward in trying to show a little bit of independence from U.S. sanctions policy, and this INSTEX that has gone into effect today deals only at this point with humanitarian trade; food, medicine, medical equipment.</p><p>[15:50:00]  And they're hoping the Europeans that it will be enough to keep Iran in the JCPOA and not too much so that the United States will have any negative reaction to it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet Iran has already shown some impatience with the time table, and with as you said so far the humanitarian parameters of that.  As I say, you know, Mike Pompeo has called this a disastrous policy, and some are waiting to see exactly what kind of enrapture it will cause between the United States and these allies.</p><p>What is Europe trying to get at here?</p><p>ASGARD:  I think what the Europeans are trying to do is they desperately want the JCPOA to stay into effect.  They don't want Iran to break out again into a race for nuclear technology.  They think that could escalate very rapidly into a very serious conflict.</p><p>And so they want to play kind of an intermediate role with the United States.  This is a harkening back to what was going on in the 2000s basically where the EU three were doing their best to maintain Iran from going too rogue, and the United States was pretty much maintaining a strong thrust of sanctions.</p><p>If the EU is now looking to really stand up for its banks and its businesses and really step out, it would require them to go beyond humanitarian trade.  Remember, humanitarian trade is legal for U.S. sanctions in this case.  So, so far the EU is treading very carefully, but is definitely watching the trend and seeing, do we want to step any further?</p><p>Perhaps they're waiting for reactions from the Trump White House, from the Iranians to see where exactly this might head.  But they are maintaining at least a positive momentum and delivering on a promise that they had mentioned several months ago that they would do.</p><p>So in that effect, they are showing a little bit of independence and a little bit of forward progress for standing up for the EU three's position.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it will be a very interesting story to watch in the coming months, so thank you for your insights on this, appreciate it.  Now --</p><p>ASGARD:  Thank you very much.</p><p>NEWTON:  The self-declared president of Venezuela says he wants to reactivate the country's oil industry after the Trump administration placed sanctions on the state oil company.  Juan Guaido told Cnn that ordinary Venezuelans deserve those profits, not the embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  What we're doing is trying to reactivate this industry so there will be no usurping action by the way of Maduro and keeping this money and that the production of petroleum will be on behalf of Venezuela.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, the U.S. sanctions could have huge implications for the global oil industry.  Our emerging markets editor John Defterios told me the Trump administration is now playing hardball.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  The U.S. strategy seems very clear, starting first with the financial interests of PDVSA and directing those revenues that went into the United States to the National Assembly.</p><p>Number two, chasing bank accounts of Maduro and his cadre, even gold sitting in Germany and London hasn't taken action yet on that front.  And finally, I thought this was going to bubble to the surface, and that is Citco; it's a large refinery in the United States, has 5,000 petrol stations throughout the country, 30 states to be specific.</p><p>They could freeze the assets or again redirect those revenues somewhere else.  This is playing the hardball.  I think also we have to look at the bigger picture.  You know this very well, Russia and China have been playing in Venezuela for the better part of the decade, funneling nearly $70 billion into the country.</p><p>I can't imagine they're going to pick up their sticks, walk away and let Donald Trump fill this void in Venezuela.  But the U.S. is using all the economic tools.  You know the power of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that shut down banking systems, particularly the dollar because of the hyper inflation in Venezuela so vital to the economy, but they're doing it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they're doing it, and they've decided, as you said, a full-corps press, they're going to go all the way now.  Secretary Mnuchin being very clear that he is in touch with oil companies and those refineries in the Gulf that might be impacted.</p><p>In terms of Venezuela itself, I mean, John, the devastation and the production of oil in Venezuela has been staggering, which means it's only really has left the very little oil that actually it produces right now, that it could get out right now and, of course, as you were pointing out, Citgo.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes, let's cover PDVSA, this is the biggest collapse of any state oil company in the history of the business, at least since World War II.  If it didn't face a conflict on its soil -- take a look at the numbers, Paula, we're looking now at production at the end of 2018 according to OPEC at 1.1 million barrels a day.</p><p>[15:55:00]  If you rolled back the clock to 2008, it was 3.2 million barrels a day.  PDVSA used to be a very well run state oil company, that's not the case now, 20 years of Hugo Chavez and Maduro together, the last 10, the crunch, and you almost have a foreign direct investment freeze on the company because there's no reinvestment, and they've been printing money and that's why you have the hyper inflation.</p><p>Citgo is a very valuable brand in the United States, as you well know.  It will be really interesting to see how aggressive the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration plan to be going forward with that asset.</p><p>Also, we can't, you know, shut out the fact the poor Venezuelans, a million percent inflation last year, the IMF is suggesting ten times that in 2019, and I think you've seen the graph, poverty had shot up 40 percent in the last five years alone, Paula, to nearly 90 percent.</p><p>You've been on the ground there, it's absolutely painful and the number one asset, number one proven reserves in the world when it comes to oil is heavy crude, but they're not extracting it now because nobody wants to invest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, you are just a few minutes away until that closing bell and the close of trade for January.  It's been a great January and we will be right back to cap it all off for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  We are heading into the last few minutes of trading on Wall Street, and as you can see there, even the Dow has turned positive today.  U.S. markets are set to finish -- all three markets are set to finish higher today, and it's been a really good month for all three major indices.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is having its best January since 1987! Lifted by some strong results, of course, they are better-than-expected at the ones we have been talking about from yesterday.  Facebook, even GE getting in on the action.  A quick look now at that Dow as you can see there, most of those stocks in positive territory, even companies like Cat that continue to rely on that U.S.-China showdown -- trade showdown.</p><p>Drug-maker Pfizer is the best performer of the day, up about 3 percent.  Now, it is the busiest week of the quarter for earnings, Amazon report right after the markets close in just a few minutes, investors will find out how the holiday shopping season went as well as Amazon integration with Whole Foods and of course the all important growth on cloud services.</p><p>Chevron and Exxon close out the weeks, big earnings reports on Friday.  And as we hear, the applause for the closing bell today.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Paula Newton, \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper is next.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2174420945</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2T-RYV1-DY0W-426F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

We will get to that. There is a lot going on today and this is what's moving markets on Thursday, the 31st of January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You thought scandals could hurt Facebook. Yeah, right. Their shares are soaring and profits have never been better. Not to be outdone, GE. Shares are up even more after the company's signs of a turnaround there are finally under way. And we've got China, trade talks in the Oval Office any minute now. Yes, I told you. A busy hour ahead. I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. Sandals? What scandals? We're in the final hour of trading on Wall Street, and even as new controversies emerge, I'm telling you just in the last few minutes, Facebook shares are on pace for their best day in three years. Now the company which also owns Messenger, WhatApp and Instagram booked a record profit of $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. As you can see up better than 12%.</p><p>Facebook spent the fourth quarter fighting scandal after scandal. First, the crisis that kept on giving, Facebook slow response to the Russian election interference and reports that Facebook executives advised against revealing publicly what they knew about that. Second, Facebook was too slow to remove posts discussing the sale of a child bride in South Sudan. Third, that Facebook executives hired a PR firm to attack liberal billionaire, George Soros.</p><p>Then, in December, two privacy scandals in quick succession. First, a bug which exposed photos from 6.8 million new users and then, of course, less than one week later, another report that Facebook shared far more user data with companies like Microsoft and Yahoo than it had admitted.</p><p>Remember, these are just from the last three months of 2018, not in the history of the Facebook. Now, the rest of the year was as bad or worse. So has any of this driven away any users? I bet you already know the answer to that. Facebook's Chief Financial Officer dealt with that on the earnings call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAVID WEHNER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, FACEBOOK: I would just - you know, I'd probably just let the numbers stand for themselves. We saw, that you know, we are growing in all regions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: You heard it. The numbers speak for themselves. Now that growth explains Facebook's stock surge today. Wall Street is betting 2.7 billion users can't be wrong. Now, just in the last few minutes, new revelations. Facebook and Twitter say they have removed thousands of accounts that engaged in coordinated, what they say is inauthentic action. Many of those accounts originated this time in Iran and targeted users right around the world.</p><p>Our Samuel Burke is in London with the latest. Samuel, I know were on the call getting the information on this, why today and how intrusive, how serious is this?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, Paula, the contrast could not be more stunning. On the one hand you have a company whose stock is roaring up nearly 12% as you just described and yet, on the very same day that the stock is surging, the company is making clear that they do not have the reins, the control over their own social network.</p><p>In the past few minutes, Facebook announcing a huge campaign to bring down what they call inauthentic behavior, originating in Iran they say, though they are careful to note that there is not a connection to the government that they can see right now.</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen exactly the scope of what we're seeing here according to Facebook starting with the removal of 783 pages, groups and accounts, Paula, and it's not just Facebook. It's also on Instagram. About two million accounts, we're following at least one of these pages and Facebook was taking money for them, nearly $30,000.00 in spending for ads.</p><p>Many of these pages and accounts were masquerading as news websites, Paula, doing the work of journalists or that's what they wanted the users to believe, and Facebook is even sharing some of the posts that they say they have taken down already. Many of them are anti-Israel in tone. We have a post just like this, printing them out right now, this is just coming off. \"Jene reconnais absolument pas Israel.\" \"I will absolutely not recognize Israel.\"</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>BURKE: We have other accounts with images like this, the stereotypical anti-Semitic images of somebody with the Star of David and the large nose. Of course, these aren't from authentic accounts. These aren't people's actual political views or anti-Israel messages, they are inauthentic accounts, coordinated accounts, and at the very same time, Paula, we see reports coming from \"The Washington Post\" that Twitter is also taking down pages that they say originate in Iran, Russia and Venezuela.</p><p>Again, important to note that these companies aren't making links to the governments. They are saying that this activity just originates in those countries.</p><p>NEWTON: Any insight into how they found this and exactly if they are getting any better at trying to take down some of these accounts more quickly?</p><p>BURKE: Well, they are saying they are working with outside parties to do analysis of this type of content, and the fact that there's another social network doing it right now as well might say that this was part of a broader effort. Facebook saying that they've shared the information with the U.S. government, but we have no sense whatsoever if they are getting better at this.</p><p>In fact, I might even argue that it looks like they might be getting worse. Now, you might be saying, \"Well, why? If they are taking down the accounts.\" Tucked into the earnings report was a line that said that the number of fake accounts, Paula, on Facebook has risen by 27% to an all-time high of 116 million fake accounts on Facebook, and that's according to Facebook. What about the pages that they may not know about?</p><p>Incredible that Sheryl Sandberg said after the earnings report, \"We have proved with this blockbuster report that we can both protect the platform and at the same time have profitability.\" If have you a surge of 27%, 116 million fake accounts, have you really protected the platform?</p><p>NEWTON: They claim, yes, right? They say they are doing the best that they can, and that is the challenge that they are up against. Our Samuel Burke, thanks so much for jumping on that very quickly. As you can see, more news from Facebook with the problems they are having on protecting the authenticity really, of their own platform.</p><p>Now, as we were saying, Facebook shares don't seem to be alarmed in the slightest by the latest development. If you can see, they are up better than 11%. I want now you to weigh in on this. Please go to cnn.com/join. I want to hear from you. Our question today is would you consider quitting Facebook? I'm going to ask you again. Anybody here in the studio going to give me an answer on that? Look at this, a silence. I'm getting silence, people. No Facebook login is required. We'll discuss the results in a moment.</p><p>And I want all of you on the record as well. Rana Foroohar is CNN's global economic analyst and columnist at \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST, CNN: Who recently quit Facebook.</p><p>NEWTON: They are sick of me telling them I have never been on Facebook ever in my life.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Interesting.</p><p>NEWTON: I identified it as a security risk early on in my career.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Good for you.</p><p>NEWTON: Having said that, Rana, you identified 2018 as the tech lash. I'm going to read your editorial back to you. You said, \"This is a company that was so desperate to protect its top leadership and its business model that it hired a shadowy PR firm that used anti-Semitism as a political weapon.\"</p><p>FOROOHAR: Indeed, and here we are.</p><p>NEWTON: But here's what I say to you. It worked. Their user base continues to grow. They are a very large formidable platform now.</p><p>FOROOHAR: They are.</p><p>NEWTON: And they say they are doing their best.</p><p>FOROOHAR: They are. It's interesting. I mean, Sheryl Sandberg came out and said, look, this last quarter has proved not only can we add people to combat some of the fake news issues, we can fight regulators and we can grow at the same time.</p><p>But I'll tell you something, I think this year is really going to be the turning point because at the same time that you have all of these good news happening with the Facebook shares, you have Senator Mark Warner, for example, Democrat in the U.S. coming out and saying, he's crafting new legislation to try to put and a price on data so that people know the value of what have they are giving away.</p><p>I think a lot of the fact that people still go to these platforms has to do with the fact that they have no idea the value of what they are giving up. And I think that when that becomes more transparent and you might get more competitors if there are antitrust issue, we could see a change.</p><p>NEWTON: It's so trite and such a cliche, but obviously, an educated consumer is the best thing that could happen here especially when it even comes to those accounts that Samuel did such a good job of highlighting, if you're looking at something like that to really try and to see its origin and where it is coming from.</p><p>I mean, I know I gravitate on something like Twitter to verified accounts, right, just to see what's there.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Exactly.</p><p>NEWTON: Having said that, you know, it's kind of like even regulation, will it work? Remember, we all - I know a lot of people don't remember the phone company, but we all used to be angry at the phone company, but we didn't rip the phone off the wall.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Right.</p><p>NEWTON: That's what's happening here, Rana.</p><p>FOROOHAR: You know, it's true, but again, I am going to go back to this idea of competition. A lot of people see the privacy issues posed by Facebook and Google and the like and the competition issues in two separate baskets.</p><p>I actually see them as being together, and I think that as you get U.S. and E.U. regulators really boring down and probably bringing some antitrust cases against these companies, it will be like if you remember 20 years ago when Microsoft was under fire. The U.S. went after Microsoft for antitrust issues. That actually allowed space for Google to be born. I think that you're going to see new companies being born as these come under more pressure.</p><p>[15:10:08]</p><p>NEWTON: And that they will have some more competition even more.</p><p>FOROOHAR: I think they will, and I think even amongst the giants, you already see companies like Apple and IBM starting to compete on privacy and using data protection and privacy as a competitive advantage, so I think that this issue is out there. I think you're going to see a lot of action this year.</p><p>NEWTON: One of the things some people have pointed out though, and as you give Facebook the benefit of the doubt, they say they are trying their best. They are leveraging everything that they have at this right now. You're skeptical?</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, I'm skeptical because the fundamental business proposition is still tracking everything you do and monetizing it. It's surveillance capitalism. I mean, this is a whole new area. And by the way, it's not just the platform tech companies that are in it. Almost every business these days is trying to track what you do from say a Starbucks to a Johnson &amp; Johnson. I mean, your sneakers have chips in them.</p><p>This is - data is the new oil, and so I think that all the things you're seeing right now that Facebook is coming under pressure for, you're going to see broader number of companies facing these pressures.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet some people say that because of definitely deep pockets and them getting in on the ground floor of regulation, that it's actually Facebook that's going to be the winner in any kind of regulatory fight.</p><p>FOROOHAR: You know, it's interesting. I mean, certainly in Europe, GDPR which is the new privacy regulation that rolled out this past year, it favors the big players in a sense that they have the money to actually enforce these rules and to comply. Smaller players don't have that legal muscle, but I think we're in the beginning stages of a war. This is the first battle. This is really going to be I think the new too big to fail battle in some ways. It's going to be big tech versus regulators just as the way it was with the banks.</p><p>NEWTON: One difference, I have yet to see the consumer outrage. We have to go. But what do you think? Do you think we'll see it?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I think we're going to see an Exxon Valdez privacy probably around kids -- kids and games.</p><p>NEWTON: Good point. Rana, always so good to have you on here. Really appreciate it. Remember, she called it technological 2018. According to those of you voting at cnn.com/join, most of you say, you would consider quitting Facebook, about a quarter of you say no way. I wonder what the age spread is on that.</p><p>It is the last hour of trading on the last day of the month. The Dow is down on the day, but all three major indices are way up for the month. And as you can see there, the NASDAQ getting a nice rally. Now, earlier today, the chief market strategist at National Holdings, Art Hogan put the rally into context for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL HOLDINGS: We are having the best January in 30 years. We had the worst December in 30 years, 80 years. I'd say we're pairing off very nicely in the last two months.</p><p>I think we've gotten back to the midpoint where valuations are reasonable. We are trading about 15.5 times this year's earnings and I think that when you look at where both the Dow and S&amp;P are, it's basically where we started last year, so we've gone 12 months without doing much and at the same time, multiples have come down because earnings are much better.</p><p>Now, in 2019, the S&amp;P can earn $170.00, which is down from $182.00, that's about 6% earnings growth, then I think we can have a normal year where things don't go crazy and we're going to be at 2,800 or 2,850 at the end of the year on the S&amp;P.</p><p>The only thing that stops that is trade. If this is a long drawn out mutually destructive trade war --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: And we will get to that trade - those trade negotiations later this hour. Now, it is a good month as we were saying for the markets and a busy day for earnings. Here to discuss all of that is CNN's Paul La Monica and of course, CNN's Matt Egan. Thank you both. I hope you came armed with opinions. There's a lot of insight to be had from a lot of numbers. Let's go first. General Electric, it's funny because it's a great day for General Electric, but look where it had to come from?</p><p>MATT EGAN, LEAD WRITER, CNN BUSINESS: You're right. You know, I think that Wall Street is betting that the crisis at GE may finally be over. The stock is up double digits. It's like 45 minutes away from the best day in almost a decade, and, you know, the actual numbers were pretty crummy. Power was down again. GE wouldn't even say whether or not they will generate any positive free cash flow in 2019, but, you know, they did clean up one of the sins from the past. They had a $1.5 billion settlement over WMC Mortgage.</p><p>Aviation was really good. They had a profit there. It was up 24%. There were orders for their engine. It was up a lot and so, you know, I do think that investors are betting that GE may have finally turned a corner here.</p><p>NEWTON: Tesla, no one is agnostic over Tesla. People love to hate it or love to love it. In those latest results, certainly a lot of people were talking about the production issues there, but cash seemed to be okay. Cash on --</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Yes, Tesla still has a decent amount of cash. I don't think that's the worry right now, Paula. The problem, the biggest problem, I think, Elon Musk, you just have to scratch your head and wonder why he does the things he does in the way he does sometimes.</p><p>They wait until the very last moment of the conference call with analysts after their earnings to pull the reverse Steve Jobs one more thing moment. They gave bad news that the CFO is leaving, and that just, I think, leaves a bad taste.</p><p>NEWTON: It was the last thing in the phone call.</p><p>LA MONICA: It was the last thing in the phone call. You look at the transcript.</p><p>NEWTON: Bury the headline.</p><p>[15:15:07]</p><p>LA MONICA: It's just bizarre that this is what happened, because it's not as if there's anything wrong with Tesla. That's probably the reason why the CFO is leaving. He's actually done two stints as CFO. It's nice for him to be able to go off into the sunset at a time where ...</p><p>NEWTON: With that cash on hand.</p><p>LA MONICA: ... people do feel like they have a good amount of cash and Model 3 demand is there. So there are a lot of things to like about Tesla, but Musk can't get out of his own way sometimes.</p><p>EGAN: It's just another reminder that it's just like the ultimate high wire act there at Tesla because it's all built on divisionary brilliance of Elon Musk which sometimes will lead to some executives leaving, and there's also a lot of debt there, which is why we're talking about cash, and that has continued to be a concern there at Tesla.</p><p>NEWTON: It has been a great month for stocks so far. We've got Amazon tomorrow. Is this just going to blow -- sorry, today after the bell. Is that going to blow the roof off of this market?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think we have to wait and see. I think what people are really going to be focusing on with Amazon. We know that sales growth in the core retail business is starting to slow. Hopefully they had a good holiday quarter, both at the online business as well as their own branded brick and mortar stores, Whole Foods, et cetera, but the number I'm really going to be looking at, Paula, is the AWS Cloud figures because Amazon Web Services is so insanely profitable that it helps to subsidize every other thing that Jeff Bezos wants to do at Amazon.</p><p>Sometimes that requires big investments that may lose money, but they can afford to do it because AWS is just a huge cash cow now.</p><p>NEWTON: We saw Microsoft as well earlier with those great Cloud numbers as well, although the stock didn't fare so well. A lot of it was okay. In terms of where we're going in general with the market, gentlemen, I mean, I've heard both things about the earnings. Of course, it's company dependent.</p><p>January though was a great month because basically expectations have been lowered, right, and people blew out the expectations.</p><p>EGAN: I also think it was because December was so horrible, right.</p><p>NEWTON: It was horrible.</p><p>EGAN: It was the worst December that we've seen in quite a long time and I think it was about the fact that people feared an imminent recession in the economy. They worried about the Federal Reserve being overly aggressive, and the U.S.-China trade war. Listen, January is better because all three of those things have improved.</p><p>U.S. and China are talking instead of raising tariffs on each other. The idea of an imminent recession doesn't seem likely right now and we have the Federal Reserve that went from unbelievably hawkish to really dovish in record time.</p><p>LA MONICA: You were at the NYC yesterday and I swore when I was waiting to talk to you on yesterday's \"QMB Express Show\" I think there was a trader behind you whistling \"Patience\" you know, the Guns 'n Roses song. I might be making it up because I'm a Gen X'er and I remember Gun's 'n Roses from the late '80s early '90s.</p><p>NEWTON: I don't think you're making it up.</p><p>LA MONICA: I think someone was actually whistling that because it's the word of the month. Patience is the reason why we're having this record- setting or almost record-setting January.</p><p>NEWTON: We have to leave it there. But really, the Fed gets the credit. The fact that Donald Trump even got off of the Fed's back. We'll tell you all you need to know about that Fed meeting yesterday.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both so much. You came armed with opinions. I love it. More of you two. Excellent. Coming up. He is marshalling the Brexit debates in the British Parliament, and gaining worldwide attention. Speaker of the House of Commons, you'll want to hear this. He talks exclusively to CNN.</p><p>And Italy's economic downturn becomes has a full-blown recession. Could its European neighbors soon follow?</p><p>[15:20:00]</p><p>NEWTON: Now in a rare an exclusive television, the Speaker of the British House of Commons tells CNN says his job is like being a football referee. You know the kind of football I'm talking about here, right, it's what we call soccer.</p><p>John Bercow is gaining an ever higher profile, thanks to his role in Parliament's Brexit drama. You may know him from his greatest hits. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, SPEAKER, HOUSE OF COMMONS: Order. Order. Order. Resume your seat. Resume your seat. Don't tell me what the procedures of this House are.</p><p>Order. I know what I'm doing.</p><p>It's utterly irresponsible chanting in the background.</p><p>The House must calm itself. Zen.</p><p>Laughing and chuckling away as if there's a great amusement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Isn't that great? Bianca Nobilo is here. I can't think of a better person to exclusively interview, the Speaker. By the way, the British media, some British media have dubbed him Speaker of the Devil. Bianca, please explain because some people have called him either the greatest defender of democracy or someone who undermines it.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Well, he certainly excites a lot of passions and is a very controversial and colorful figure and that's why it was so great to speak to him, but by and large the MPs that I speak to, and I'm always talking to them every week, do have a lot of respect for him.</p><p>He has been embroiled in a couple of controversies, particularly over the management of some issues like bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons, but by and large, he is well respected for his ability to champion not the government's agenda, but that of back benchers and rank and file lawmakers, if you like.</p><p>And he has been successful of that. And Paula, that's part of the reason that the Brexit debate is so shaped by him because Theresa May doesn't have a firm grip on Parliament because she has a minority government. It means that when the Speaker selects ideas and stances from other members of Parliament, they take greater precedence.</p><p>So we now hear so many voices on the Brexit debate, and it's at a very confusing place, partly because of his championing of those backbenchers and Members of Parliament who aren't in government.</p><p>NEWTON: Bianca, in terms of what he would say to defend himself, because some people have said that he's interfering in Brexit, and perhaps he's showing his hand had a little bit, even though he is supposed to be impeccably even-handed about this and non-partisan.</p><p>NOBILO: So I spoke to him about how important it is for the Speaker to be an impartial figure, and I asked him was it difficult to transition from being a Member of Parliament, which is obviously a political animal to the Speaker which has to be impartial? And he said no, because it's simply the duty of the Speaker to do that.</p><p>He also said that if he was truly impartial, it would be picked up constantly on social media, and in terms of the claims and accusations that are being made against him that he's being partial in the Brexit debate, he says, no, he's simply doing his job by representing the wider spectrum of opinions.</p><p>Also, when I spoke to him about how he decides what amendments to select and which way to move forward with the Brexit debate, he said he looks at which suggestions have are the most support in Parliament and which suggestions are coming not just from one side of the House of Commons, but from cross-parties.</p><p>So he has a mental check list, if you like, of considerations that he'll go through, and it was interesting because a lot of people will recognize the Speaker from Prime Minister's Questions, the boisterous event which we see every Wednesday here in the U.K., and I asked him how hard it was to cope with rowdy Members of Parliament, and he likened his job to something unexpected. Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERCOW: I'm a regular at my club with my son. I'm a season ticket holder at Arsenal. There are 60,000 people in the crowd, and there are virtually 60,000 people who think they know better than the referee. The referee has just got to do his job as he thinks fit, and in a sense ...</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>BERCOW: ... perhaps the Speaker is in a not all together dissimilar position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Well, what was very clear to me, Paula, is that the speaker doesn't - isn't bothered by inconveniencing the government or, quote, \"moaning ministers.\" He sees his job is to champion democracy, and that was clear to me that he was hugely passionate about the role of Parliament and trying to increase its authority, especially in such turbulent times.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, it was funny to me, Bianca, that in trying to impugn his impartiality, they point to the fact that there was a bumper at his home that says \"Bollocks to Brexit.\" I can only assume, Bianca, that he is in favor of free speech at his own home the way he is in the House of Parliament because he says the bumper sticker belongs to his wife.</p><p>Bianca, thanks so much for the interview. We'll await to hear more from that very exclusive interview with the Speaker. Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, stocks finished higher in London despite the Brexit uncertainty. Elsewhere though, it was a mixed picture. The Eurozone posted its flows, growth in four years with the final quarter of last year, and in Milan, stocks were hit by news that Italy slipped into recession in 2018. The economy contracting for two straight quarters. More on that later in this program.</p><p>Now with hundreds of billions of dollars of imports and exports on the line and time running out fast, Donald Trump calls for a top-level meeting with China's Xi Jinping to end this trade war.</p><p>NEWTON: Hello. I'm Paula Newton, and there's more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment. First though, these are the headlines on CNN this hour.</p><p>Exclusive video obtained by CNN is giving us a dramatic look at the last battles to drive ISIS from Syria. Kurdish and Arab forces are fighting the remnants of ISIS on the ground backed up by U.S.-led air power, but ISIS fighters aren't giving us easily, battling to hold on to the last villages they control in Eastern Syria.</p><p>The U.S. is expressing grave concern over the accusation from Venezuela's self-declared acting President that his family is being intimidated by embattled President Nicolas Maduro. Now, Juan Guaido says Mr. Maduro's special forces tried to enter the family's home.</p><p>In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, Guaido refused to rule out U.S. military intervention to end the escalating political unrest. Defense attorneys present a closing argument in the trial of Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.</p><p>Joaquin Guzman is facing drug trafficking and other charges in New York. Prosecutors presented more than 50 witnesses in the trial along with his phone calls, texts and documents.</p><p>Engineers at MIT have developed a robot that can actually play Jenga. Now, the robot is able to see and feel individual blocks in a tower and has learned to switch blocks if it starts to wobble. You may still have a chance to beat it though. The robot isn't yet smart enough to work out which specific blocks would make your next turn impossible. Let me see if it can make dinner.</p><p>OK, Donald Trump says this week's trade talks with China are going well, and will hopefully lead to a deal by March 1st. Now, that's the last day before the U.S. may increase tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. Mr. Trump is also making very clear, there will be no final deal until he meets again with China's President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Now, the president laid out his terms on Twitter, he wants Beijing to open its markets to U.S. financial manufacturing and agricultural businesses along with other sectors. Mr. Trump added, he wants these talks to leave, quote, \"nothing unresolved.\"</p><p>Now, time is tight. Even tighter if you can believe it than those Brexit talks. Negotiators have until March 1st, just over four weeks away. Now, if the deal can't be done by then, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods will increase from 10 percent to 25 percent, and you bet they are going to bite.</p><p>Carla Hills is a former U.S. trade representative, and she joins me now from Washington. Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for joining us. OK, the person who is at the table right now is Robert Lighthizer. What do you think his main task is right now to get a deal with the Chinese or is it going to be a tougher thing to get a deal that the Trump administration will accept?</p><p>CARLA HILLS, FORMER UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: I suspect that the U.S. team will try to lay out exactly what the U.S. needs in order to move forward. I don't anticipate that they will get a deal during this visit, and it's not because the president has said no deal until he meets with President Xi.</p><p>It is that there are so many things on the agenda. I think they're going to have to meet again and perhaps a couple of times again and try to understand what each side needs to do. What are the political limitations and the economic limitations?</p><p>NEWTON: What many people are looking for in the Trump administration at least, and I believe the U.S. trade representative as well is structural reform. Do you think that's just too ambitious, and at the end this trade deal. If there is one, is going to look much different than that.</p><p>HILLS: You have to define what you mean by structural reform. I would ask the Chinese to remove the percentage caps on inward investment. When they join the World Trade Organization in 2001, they committed to two basic norms, national treatment and non-discrimination, and they don't tell local firms that they can only have 39 percent in a given sector.</p><p>They should not tell a U.S. firm that they cannot come in and have green- field investments in areas of their interests. And it is particularly important because in many instances, the joint ventures that have been mandated have been the pathway to get a hold of intellectual property that the U.S. holds, so it really needs to be corrected.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet if it needs to be corrected, do you think that means that a deal can't be done? We just went through the deadline, it is very tight, it is four weeks before those tariffs that are paid by the way by U.S. firms go up substantially.</p><p>HILLS: Well, President Trump could take some of the things that they accomplish, perhaps extend and give a little more time. I don't know how they're going to handle the negotiations, neither one of us is in the negotiating room.</p><p>NEWTON: Your best guess though as someone who has been in this position before, and I lean on you because at a time when you were dealing with these issues with China, completely different era I understand, but it was that same debate, right?</p><p>[15:35:00] Is China going to move to a more -- an economy that more mirrors capitalism in a way and privatization? Because a lot of people are saying now that actually in the last five years, especially with the state sponsorship of its companies, that China has actually moved backwards on these issues.</p><p>NEWTON: I agree that China has moved backwards. And we have a pre-eminent economist Nicholas Lardy who has just released a book called \"The State Strikes Back\". And he, five years earlier, had written a book entitled \"Market Over Mao\".</p><p>And in 2014, when he wrote \"The Market Over Mao\", he was saying, look, the market is working. It's -- the restrictions are coming down because that's where the profits are. The private sector is making a difference.</p><p>And what he has noted and profoundly spells out in detail with charts is how that has turned around, that the government is spending more money, flowing more capital to state-owned enterprises that are not making a profit, whereas the private sector in China is making a profit.</p><p>We have a deal to make because what we're asking of China will actually be good for its economy.</p><p>NEWTON: But they don't believe perhaps that it will be good for them politically, which is another argument entirely. Ambassador Hills, before I let you go, you know, we have this issue of this CFO, this Huawei executive who is out on bail in Vancouver.</p><p>A lot of people are saying still cloud the talks, but I point more not to the case of one executive or even the 23 charges that have been put against Huawei and her and other executives. But the fact that you had the Intel chiefs in the United States say the other day on Capitol Hill that Huawei poses an intelligence risk to the United States.</p><p>How do you see going forward with China, when basically, you have the intelligence community saying any kind of cooperation with this country on that level, even from a private company in China is a risk?</p><p>HILLS: Well, as an old prosecutor, let me say, I don't have the facts of what the accusations are other than that, what has been in the press. But if a case can be made whether it's against somebody from China or Brazil or England, that is for the prosecutors to make that case, and we should look at it objectively.</p><p>There are facts in earlier instances where there have been I think actions where they've stepped across the line.</p><p>NEWTON: And we will see indeed how long it takes for that court -- that case to make its way through the courts. Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for being with us, really appreciate it. Now, when we return --</p><p>HILLS: A pleasure --</p><p>NEWTON: Two men are claiming to be Venezuela's president, one of them speaks to Cnn about his plan for fixing the country's broken economy.</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON: Now for the third time in a decade, yes, I said that, third time in a decade, Italy's economy has slipped into a recession. Economic growth contracted for a second consecutive quarter in 2018, that's fueling fears that Italy's European neighbors could soon follow.</p><p>Lorenzo Codogno is the former chief economist and Director General at the Treasury Department of the Italian Ministry of Economy, and a visiting professor now at the London School of Economics. He joins me now from London. OK, the current government in power for eight months says these last two quarters are an absolute blip.</p><p>That there's no way that the Italian economy will grow. Are they right?</p><p>LORENZO CODOGNO, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST &amp; DIRECTOR GENERAL, TREASURY DEPARTMENT, ITALIAN MINISTRY OF ECONOMY: Well, you know, the global climate has changed, and if you look at the Eurozone growth, it is slowing fast.</p><p>And clearly, Italy is the weak spot, so I think this weakness will continue. Actually, leading indicators already suggest that probably the first quarter of this year will be negative again.</p><p>The big issue here is whether at some point we see some stabilization during the course of this year and a modest recovery or whether this kind of slowdown transforms into a deeper and prolonged recession. I think now it's not clear, but at least the first quarter will be negative, and I think given the negative carryover, probably the whole 2019 will end up in negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON: The entire year of 2019 in a recession for Italy you think?</p><p>CODOGNO: Well, again, given two negative quarters and the likely negative quarter at the beginning of this year, basically the year is already compromised to some extent, so unless you expect a sharp recovery in the second half, which I don't see at the moment, probably the overall outcome for the year is going to be negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON: You know, it's a controversial question even to say it, but obviously the populist government here has a lot of policies out there that they are -- that are trial balloons. Do you see anything in what they're proposing that could help the situation where the economy is concerned?</p><p>CODOGNO: I think the only positive here is that probably having a kind of anti-establishment protest parties in government basically prevents any, you know, upheaval in the streets as we have seen in France. But other than that, I think there's a risk that the current government continues to roll back reforms introduced by the previous government and continues to have an anti-business attitude which would actually affect investment behavior by companies which I think is what is happening now.</p><p>NEWTON: Interesting point of view you have though, that regular rank and file feel as if they have a voice in government now and that may be what's keeping them off the streets. Before I let you go, I have to ask you in terms of any kind of contagion throughout Europe, there has been discussion about Germany also falling into a recession.</p><p>Mario Draghi has said, look, that there's reasons for the fact that he won't be -- that he will be continuing to stimulate those European economies, is he prudent to do so?</p><p>CODOGNO: I think so because I don't think that the Eurozone will enter a recession. I think it's just a soft patch, but for Italy, it is definitely a recession and for the whole area, it is certainly softening of demand which would probably deserve a longer period of accommodative monetary policy.</p><p>So I think Mario Draghi and the ECB correct in slightly delaying the normalization of monetary conditions, so to speak.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and glad to hear that perhaps the rest of Europe may see some growth in 2019. Lorenzo, thanks so much, really appreciate it. Now the --</p><p>CODOGNO: Thank you --</p><p>NEWTON: Vice President of the European Commission says Europe needs a strong alliance between France and Germany to keep its economy moving. Jyrki Katainen spoke to Richard in Davos last week and says it's the only way for Europe to move forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Everybody should know that without a strong France-German access, Europe don't move forward -- Europe doesn't move forward. So if you need a strong ownership, you need a strong leadership, especially in big countries.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN: But --</p><p>KATAINEN: It doesn't mean that smaller countries are put aside, but without strong France-German access, nothing moves on.</p><p>QUEST: But hang on. Should France and Germany be agreeing a treaty for closer economic cooperation, closer foreign policy cooperation, all the things that are in this treaty, shouldn't this be done in the greater sphere of the EU?</p><p>[15:45:00] KATAINEN: Of course, I mean, even the two big countries cannot decide anything separately from the other. So the two countries are small enough to get decisions done unless the others don't support. So we need overall more strong national ownership, ownership coming from the national governments whether you're big or small country, but it's not sufficient to sit on the fence and just see that if somebody is leading Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: OK, after the break, Europe's largest economies are trying to dance around U.S. sanctions on Iran. You'll want these details up next.</p><p>NEWTON: So right now, the Chief Financial Officer of the Chinese tech company Huawei is in -- is out on bail in Canada accused of dodging U.S. sanctions on Iran. Now, three of the world's largest economies are openly trying to bypass sanctions on the same country.</p><p>Germany, France and the U.K. are working on a payment mechanism to allow their businesses to continue trading with Iran in defiance of President Trump's sanctions. Now, it's called INSTEX, and it's an Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges.</p><p>Now, it's expected to operate like a barring platform or clearing house rather than relying on direct financial transactions, key, it won't be using U.S. dollars. If Washington wants to punish those who use it, it would mean penalizing countries traditionally seen as its closest allies.</p><p>Now, Ramin Asgard is a former political adviser to the U.S. Central Command. He was also director of America's Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai. This is a controversial move by Europe, when they first proposed it, I actually didn't believe they'd go through with it.</p><p>It seems like they are no matter how honestly -- how modestly it begins. Do you think it will elicit a response from the Trump administration?</p><p>RAMIN ASGARD, FORMER POLITICAL ADVISER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: Now, thank you very much. I think what the Europeans have done is, they're playing a game of three-dimensional chess where they are a little bit caught between their responsibilities under the JCPOA and U.S. sanctions and not wanting to trigger them.</p><p>What they've done here is frankly, they've taken the smallest step forward in trying to show a little bit of independence from U.S. sanctions policy, and this INSTEX that has gone into effect today deals only at this point with humanitarian trade; food, medicine, medical equipment.</p><p>[15:50:00] And they're hoping the Europeans that it will be enough to keep Iran in the JCPOA and not too much so that the United States will have any negative reaction to it.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet Iran has already shown some impatience with the time table, and with as you said so far the humanitarian parameters of that. As I say, you know, Mike Pompeo has called this a disastrous policy, and some are waiting to see exactly what kind of enrapture it will cause between the United States and these allies.</p><p>What is Europe trying to get at here?</p><p>ASGARD: I think what the Europeans are trying to do is they desperately want the JCPOA to stay into effect. They don't want Iran to break out again into a race for nuclear technology. They think that could escalate very rapidly into a very serious conflict.</p><p>And so they want to play kind of an intermediate role with the United States. This is a harkening back to what was going on in the 2000s basically where the EU three were doing their best to maintain Iran from going too rogue, and the United States was pretty much maintaining a strong thrust of sanctions.</p><p>If the EU is now looking to really stand up for its banks and its businesses and really step out, it would require them to go beyond humanitarian trade. Remember, humanitarian trade is legal for U.S. sanctions in this case. So, so far the EU is treading very carefully, but is definitely watching the trend and seeing, do we want to step any further?</p><p>Perhaps they're waiting for reactions from the Trump White House, from the Iranians to see where exactly this might head. But they are maintaining at least a positive momentum and delivering on a promise that they had mentioned several months ago that they would do.</p><p>So in that effect, they are showing a little bit of independence and a little bit of forward progress for standing up for the EU three's position.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, it will be a very interesting story to watch in the coming months, so thank you for your insights on this, appreciate it. Now --</p><p>ASGARD: Thank you very much.</p><p>NEWTON: The self-declared president of Venezuela says he wants to reactivate the country's oil industry after the Trump administration placed sanctions on the state oil company. Juan Guaido told Cnn that ordinary Venezuelans deserve those profits, not the embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VENEZUELA (through translator): What we're doing is trying to reactivate this industry so there will be no usurping action by the way of Maduro and keeping this money and that the production of petroleum will be on behalf of Venezuela.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now, the U.S. sanctions could have huge implications for the global oil industry. Our emerging markets editor John Defterios told me the Trump administration is now playing hardball.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: The U.S. strategy seems very clear, starting first with the financial interests of PDVSA and directing those revenues that went into the United States to the National Assembly.</p><p>Number two, chasing bank accounts of Maduro and his cadre, even gold sitting in Germany and London hasn't taken action yet on that front. And finally, I thought this was going to bubble to the surface, and that is Citco; it's a large refinery in the United States, has 5,000 petrol stations throughout the country, 30 states to be specific.</p><p>They could freeze the assets or again redirect those revenues somewhere else. This is playing the hardball. I think also we have to look at the bigger picture. You know this very well, Russia and China have been playing in Venezuela for the better part of the decade, funneling nearly $70 billion into the country.</p><p>I can't imagine they're going to pick up their sticks, walk away and let Donald Trump fill this void in Venezuela. But the U.S. is using all the economic tools. You know the power of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that shut down banking systems, particularly the dollar because of the hyper inflation in Venezuela so vital to the economy, but they're doing it.</p><p>NEWTON: And they're doing it, and they've decided, as you said, a full- corps press, they're going to go all the way now. Secretary Mnuchin being very clear that he is in touch with oil companies and those refineries in the Gulf that might be impacted.</p><p>In terms of Venezuela itself, I mean, John, the devastation and the production of oil in Venezuela has been staggering, which means it's only really has left the very little oil that actually it produces right now, that it could get out right now and, of course, as you were pointing out, Citgo.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes, let's cover PDVSA, this is the biggest collapse of any state oil company in the history of the business, at least since World War II. If it didn't face a conflict on its soil -- take a look at the numbers, Paula, we're looking now at production at the end of 2018 according to OPEC at 1.1 million barrels a day.</p><p>[15:55:00] If you rolled back the clock to 2008, it was 3.2 million barrels a day. PDVSA used to be a very well run state oil company, that's not the case now, 20 years of Hugo Chavez and Maduro together, the last 10, the crunch, and you almost have a foreign direct investment freeze on the company because there's no reinvestment, and they've been printing money and that's why you have the hyper inflation.</p><p>Citgo is a very valuable brand in the United States, as you well know. It will be really interesting to see how aggressive the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration plan to be going forward with that asset.</p><p>Also, we can't, you know, shut out the fact the poor Venezuelans, a million percent inflation last year, the IMF is suggesting ten times that in 2019, and I think you've seen the graph, poverty had shot up 40 percent in the last five years alone, Paula, to nearly 90 percent.</p><p>You've been on the ground there, it's absolutely painful and the number one asset, number one proven reserves in the world when it comes to oil is heavy crude, but they're not extracting it now because nobody wants to invest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now, you are just a few minutes away until that closing bell and the close of trade for January. It's been a great January and we will be right back to cap it all off for you.</p><p>NEWTON: We are heading into the last few minutes of trading on Wall Street, and as you can see there, even the Dow has turned positive today. U.S. markets are set to finish -- all three markets are set to finish higher today, and it's been a really good month for all three major indices.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is having its best January since 1987! Lifted by some strong results, of course, they are better-than-expected at the ones we have been talking about from yesterday. Facebook, even GE getting in on the action.

We will get to that.  There is a lot going on today and this is what's moving markets on Thursday, the 31st of January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You thought scandals could hurt Facebook.  Yeah, right.  Their shares are soaring and profits have never been better.  Not to be outdone, GE.  Shares are up even more after the company's signs of a turnaround there are finally under way.  And we've got China, trade talks in the Oval Office any minute now.  Yes, I told you.  A busy hour ahead.  I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Sandals?  What scandals?  We're in the final hour of trading on Wall Street, and even as new controversies emerge, I'm telling you just in the last few minutes, Facebook shares are on pace for their best day in three years.  Now the company which also owns Messenger, WhatApp and Instagram booked a record profit of $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.  As you can see up better than 12%.</p><p>Facebook spent the fourth quarter fighting scandal after scandal.  First, the crisis that kept on giving, Facebook slow response to the Russian election interference and reports that Facebook executives advised against revealing publicly what they knew about that.  Second, Facebook was too slow to remove posts discussing the sale of a child bride in South Sudan.  Third, that Facebook executives hired a PR firm to attack liberal billionaire, George Soros.</p><p>Then, in December, two privacy scandals in quick succession.  First, a bug which exposed photos from 6.8 million new users and then, of course, less than one week later, another report that Facebook shared far more user data with companies like Microsoft and Yahoo than it had admitted.</p><p>Remember, these are just from the last three months of 2018, not in the history of the Facebook.  Now, the rest of the year was as bad or worse.  So has any of this driven away any users?  I bet you already know the  answer to that.  Facebook's Chief Financial Officer dealt with that on the earnings call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAVID WEHNER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  I would just - you know, I'd probably just let the numbers stand for themselves.  We saw, that you know, we are growing in all regions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  You heard it.  The numbers speak for themselves.  Now that growth explains Facebook's stock surge today.  Wall Street is betting 2.7 billion users can't be wrong.  Now, just in the last few minutes, new revelations.  Facebook and Twitter say they have removed thousands of accounts that engaged in coordinated, what they say is inauthentic action.  Many of those accounts originated this time in Iran and targeted users right around the world.</p><p>Our Samuel Burke is in London with the latest.  Samuel, I know were on the call getting the information on this, why today and how intrusive, how serious is this?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, Paula, the contrast could not be more stunning.  On the one hand you have a company whose stock is roaring up nearly 12% as you just described and yet, on the very same day that the stock is surging, the company is making clear that they do not have the reins, the control over their own social network.</p><p>In the past few minutes, Facebook announcing a huge campaign to bring down what they call inauthentic behavior, originating in Iran they say, though they are careful to note that there is not a connection to the government that they can see right now.</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen exactly the scope of what we're seeing here according to Facebook starting with the removal of 783 pages, groups and accounts, Paula, and it's not just Facebook.  It's also on Instagram.  About two million accounts, we're following at least one of these pages and Facebook was taking money for them, nearly $30,000.00 in spending for ads.</p><p>Many of these pages and accounts were masquerading as news websites, Paula, doing the work of journalists or that's what they wanted the users to believe, and Facebook is even sharing some of the posts that they say they have taken down already.  Many of them are anti-Israel in tone.  We have a post just like this, printing them out right now, this is just coming off.  \"Jene reconnais absolument pas Israel.\"  \"I will absolutely not recognize Israel.\"</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>BURKE:  We have other accounts with images like this, the stereotypical anti-Semitic images of somebody with the Star of David and the large nose.  Of course, these aren't from authentic accounts.  These aren't people's actual political views or anti-Israel messages, they are inauthentic accounts, coordinated accounts, and at the very same time, Paula, we see reports coming from \"The  Washington Post\" that Twitter is also taking down pages that they say originate in Iran, Russia and Venezuela.</p><p>Again, important to note that these companies aren't making links to the governments.  They are saying that this activity just originates in those countries.</p><p>NEWTON:  Any insight into how they found this and exactly if they are getting any better at trying to take down some of these accounts more quickly?</p><p>BURKE:  Well, they are saying they are working with outside parties to do analysis of this type of content, and the fact that there's another social network doing it right now as well might say that this was part of a broader effort.  Facebook saying that they've shared the information with the U.S. government, but we have no sense whatsoever if they are getting better at this.</p><p>In fact, I might even argue that it looks like they might be getting worse.  Now, you might be saying, \"Well, why?  If they are taking down the accounts.\"  Tucked into the earnings report was a line that said that the number of fake accounts, Paula, on Facebook has risen by 27% to an all-time high of 116 million fake accounts on Facebook, and that's according to Facebook.  What about the pages that they may not know about?</p><p>Incredible that Sheryl Sandberg said after the earnings report, \"We have proved with this blockbuster report that we can both protect the platform and at the same time have profitability.\"  If have you a surge of 27%, 116 million fake accounts, have you really protected the platform?</p><p>NEWTON:  They claim, yes, right?  They say they are doing the best that they can, and that is the challenge that they are up against.  Our Samuel Burke, thanks so much for jumping on that very quickly.  As you can see, more news from Facebook with the problems they are having on protecting the authenticity really, of their own platform.</p><p>Now, as we were saying, Facebook shares don't seem to be alarmed in the slightest by the latest development.  If you can see, they are up better than 11%.  I want now you to weigh in on this.  Please go to cnn.com/join.  I want to hear from you.  Our question today is would you consider quitting Facebook?  I'm going to ask you again.  Anybody here in the studio going to give me an answer on that?  Look at this, a silence.  I'm getting silence, people.  No Facebook login is required.  We'll discuss the results in a moment.</p><p>And I want all of you on the record as well.  Rana Foroohar is CNN's global economic analyst and columnist at \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST, CNN:  Who recently quit Facebook.</p><p>NEWTON:  They are sick of me telling them I have never been on Facebook ever in my life.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Interesting.</p><p>NEWTON:  I identified it as a security risk early on in my career.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Good for you.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, Rana, you identified 2018 as the tech lash.  I'm going to read your editorial back to you.  You said, \"This is a company that was so desperate to protect its top leadership and its business model that it hired a shadowy PR firm that used anti-Semitism as a political weapon.\"</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Indeed, and here we are.</p><p>NEWTON:  But here's what I say to you.  It worked.  Their user base continues to grow.  They are a very large formidable platform now.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they say they are doing their best.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.  It's interesting.  I mean, Sheryl Sandberg came out and said, look, this last quarter has proved not only can we add people to combat some of the fake news issues, we can fight regulators and we can grow at the same time.</p><p>But I'll tell you something, I think this year is really going to be the turning point because at the same time that you have all of these good news happening with the Facebook shares, you have Senator Mark Warner, for example, Democrat in the U.S. coming out and saying, he's crafting new legislation to try to put and a price on data so that people know the value of what have they are giving away.</p><p>I think a lot of the fact that people still go to these platforms has to do with the fact that they have no idea the value of what they are giving up.  And I think that when that becomes more transparent and you might get more competitors if there are antitrust issue, we could see a change.</p><p>NEWTON:  It's so trite and such a cliche, but obviously, an educated consumer is the best thing that could happen here especially when it even comes to those accounts that Samuel did such a good job of highlighting, if you're looking at something like that to really try and to see its origin and where it is coming from.</p><p>I mean, I know I gravitate on something like Twitter to verified accounts, right, just to see what's there.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Exactly.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, you know, it's kind of like even regulation, will it work?  Remember, we all - I know a lot of people don't remember the phone company, but we all used to be angry at the phone company, but we didn't rip the phone off the wall.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Right.</p><p>NEWTON:  That's what's happening here, Rana.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's true, but again, I am going to go back to this idea of competition.  A lot of people see the privacy issues posed by Facebook and Google and the like and the competition issues in two separate baskets.</p><p>I actually see them as being together, and I think that as you get U.S. and E.U. regulators really boring down and probably bringing some antitrust cases against these companies, it will be like if you remember 20 years ago when Microsoft was under fire.  The U.S. went after Microsoft for antitrust issues.  That actually allowed space for Google to be born.  I think that you're going to see new companies being born as these come under more pressure.</p><p>[15:10:08]</p><p>NEWTON:  And that they will have some more competition even more.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think they will, and I think even amongst the giants, you already see companies like Apple and IBM starting to compete on privacy and using data protection and privacy as a competitive advantage, so I think that this issue is out there.  I think you're going to see a lot of action this year.</p><p>NEWTON:  One of the things some people have pointed out though, and as you give Facebook the benefit of the doubt, they say they are trying their best.  They are leveraging everything that they have at this right now.  You're skeptical?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Well, I'm skeptical because the fundamental business proposition is still tracking everything you do and monetizing it.  It's surveillance capitalism.  I mean, this is a whole new area.  And by the way, it's not just the platform tech companies that are in it.  Almost every business these days is trying to track what you do from say a Starbucks to a Johnson &amp; Johnson.  I mean, your sneakers have chips in them.</p><p>This is - data is the new oil, and so I think that all the things you're seeing right now that Facebook is coming under pressure for, you're going to see broader number of companies facing these pressures.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet some people say that because of definitely deep pockets and them getting in on the ground floor of regulation, that it's actually Facebook that's going to be the winner in any kind of regulatory fight.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's interesting.  I mean, certainly in Europe, GDPR which is the new privacy regulation that rolled out this past year, it favors the big players in a sense that they have the money to actually enforce these rules and to comply.  Smaller players don't have that legal muscle, but I think we're in the beginning stages of a war.  This is the first battle.  This is really going to be I think the new too big to fail battle in some ways.  It's going to be big tech versus regulators just as the way it was with the banks.</p><p>NEWTON:  One difference, I have yet to see the consumer outrage.  We have to go.  But what do you think?  Do you think we'll see it?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think we're going to see an Exxon Valdez privacy probably around kids -- kids and games.</p><p>NEWTON:  Good point.  Rana, always so good to have you on here.  Really appreciate it.  Remember, she called it technological 2018.  According to those of you voting at cnn.com/join, most of you say, you would consider quitting Facebook, about a quarter of you say no way.  I wonder what the age spread is on that.</p><p>It is the last hour of trading on the last day of the month.  The Dow is down on the day, but all three major indices are way up for the month.  And as you can see there, the NASDAQ getting a nice rally.  Now, earlier today, the chief market strategist at National Holdings, Art Hogan put the rally into context for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL HOLDINGS:  We are having the best January in 30 years.  We had the worst December in 30 years, 80 years.  I'd say we're pairing off very nicely in the last two months.</p><p>I think we've gotten back to the midpoint where valuations are reasonable.  We are trading about 15.5 times this year's earnings and I think that when you look at where both the Dow and S&amp;P are, it's basically where we started last year, so we've gone 12 months without doing much and at the same time, multiples have come down because earnings are much better.</p><p>Now, in 2019, the S&amp;P can earn $170.00, which is down from $182.00, that's about 6% earnings growth, then I think we can have a normal year where things don't go crazy and we're going to be at 2,800 or 2,850 at the end of the year on the S&amp;P.</p><p>The only thing that stops that is trade.  If this is a long drawn out mutually destructive trade war --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will get to that trade - those trade negotiations later this hour.  Now, it is a good month as we were saying for the markets and a busy day for earnings.  Here to discuss all of that is CNN's Paul La Monica and of course, CNN's Matt Egan.  Thank you both.  I hope you came armed with opinions.  There's a lot of insight to be had from a lot of numbers.  Let's go first.  General Electric, it's funny because it's a great day for General Electric, but look where it had to come from?</p><p>MATT EGAN, LEAD WRITER, CNN BUSINESS:  You're right.  You know, I think that Wall Street is betting that the crisis at GE may finally be over.  The stock is up double digits.  It's like 45 minutes away from the best day in almost a decade, and, you know, the actual numbers were pretty crummy.  Power was down again.  GE wouldn't even say whether or not they will generate any positive free cash flow in 2019, but, you know, they did clean up one of the sins from the past.  They had a $1.5 billion settlement over WMC Mortgage.</p><p>Aviation was really good.  They had a profit there.  It was up 24%.  There were orders for their engine.  It was up a lot and so, you know, I do think that investors are betting that GE may have finally turned a corner here.</p><p>NEWTON:  Tesla, no one is agnostic over Tesla.  People love to hate it or love to love it.  In those latest results, certainly a lot of people were talking about the production issues there, but cash seemed to be okay.  Cash on --</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, Tesla still has a decent amount of cash.  I don't think that's the worry right now, Paula.  The problem, the biggest problem, I think, Elon Musk, you just have to scratch your head and wonder why he does the things he does in the way he does sometimes.</p><p>They wait until the very last moment of the conference call with analysts after their earnings to pull the reverse Steve Jobs one more thing moment.  They gave bad news that the CFO is leaving, and that just, I think, leaves a bad taste.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was the last thing in the phone call.</p><p>LA MONICA:  It was the last thing in the phone call.  You look at the transcript.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bury the headline.</p><p>[15:15:07]</p><p>LA MONICA:  It's just bizarre that this is what happened, because it's not as if there's anything wrong with Tesla.  That's probably the reason why the CFO is leaving.  He's actually done two stints as CFO.  It's nice for him to be able to go off into the sunset at a time where ...</p><p>NEWTON:  With that cash on hand.</p><p>LA MONICA:  ... people do feel like they have a good amount of cash and Model 3 demand is there.  So there are a lot of things to like about Tesla, but Musk can't get out of his own way sometimes.</p><p>EGAN:  It's just another reminder that it's just like the ultimate high wire act there at Tesla because it's all built on divisionary brilliance of Elon Musk which sometimes will lead to some executives leaving, and there's also a lot of debt there, which is why we're talking about cash, and that has continued to be a concern there at Tesla.</p><p>NEWTON:  It has been a great month for stocks so far.  We've got Amazon tomorrow.  Is this just going to blow -- sorry, today after the bell.  Is that going to blow the roof off of this market?</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think we have to wait and see.  I think what people are really going to be focusing on with Amazon.  We know that sales growth in the core retail business is starting to slow.  Hopefully they had a good holiday quarter, both at the online business as well as their own branded brick and mortar stores, Whole Foods, et cetera, but the number I'm really going to be looking at, Paula, is the AWS Cloud figures because Amazon Web Services is so insanely profitable that it helps to subsidize every other thing that Jeff Bezos wants to do at Amazon.</p><p>Sometimes that requires big investments that may lose money, but they can afford to do it because AWS is just a huge cash cow now.</p><p>NEWTON:  We saw Microsoft as well earlier with those great Cloud numbers as well, although the stock didn't fare so well.  A lot of it was okay.  In terms of where we're going in general with the market, gentlemen, I mean, I've heard both things about the earnings.  Of course, it's company dependent.</p><p>January though was a great month because basically expectations have been lowered, right, and people blew out the expectations.</p><p>EGAN:  I also think it was because December was so horrible, right.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was horrible.</p><p>EGAN:  It was the worst December that we've seen in quite a long time and I think it was about the fact that people feared an imminent recession in the economy.  They worried about the Federal Reserve being overly aggressive, and the U.S.-China trade war.  Listen, January is better because all three of those things have improved.</p><p>U.S. and China are talking instead of raising tariffs on each other.  The idea of an imminent recession doesn't seem likely right now and we have the Federal Reserve that went from unbelievably hawkish to really dovish in record time.</p><p>LA MONICA:  You were at the NYC yesterday and I swore when I was waiting to talk to you on yesterday's \"QMB Express Show\" I think there was a trader behind you whistling \"Patience\" you know, the Guns 'n Roses song.  I might be making it up because I'm a Gen X'er and I remember Gun's 'n Roses from the late '80s early '90s.</p><p>NEWTON:  I don't think you're making it up.</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think someone was actually whistling that because it's the word of the month.  Patience is the reason why we're having this record-setting or almost record-setting January.</p><p>NEWTON:  We have to leave it there.  But really, the Fed gets the credit.  The fact that Donald Trump even got off of the Fed's back.  We'll tell you all you need to know about that Fed meeting yesterday.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both so much.  You came armed with opinions.  I love it.  More of you two.  Excellent.  Coming up.  He is marshalling the Brexit debates in the British Parliament, and gaining worldwide attention.  Speaker of the House of Commons, you'll want to hear this.  He talks exclusively to CNN.</p><p>And Italy's economic downturn becomes has a full-blown recession.  Could its European neighbors soon follow?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:20:00]</p><p>NEWTON:  Now in a rare an exclusive television, the Speaker of the British House of Commons tells CNN says his job is like being a football referee.  You know the kind of football I'm talking about here, right, it's what we call soccer.</p><p>John Bercow is gaining an ever higher profile, thanks to his role in Parliament's Brexit drama.  You may know him from his greatest hits.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, SPEAKER, HOUSE OF COMMONS:  Order.  Order.  Order.  Resume your seat.  Resume your seat.  Don't tell me what the procedures of this House are.</p><p>Order.  I know what I'm doing.</p><p>It's utterly irresponsible chanting in the background.</p><p>The House must calm itself.  Zen.</p><p>Laughing and chuckling away as if there's a great amusement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Isn't that great?  Bianca Nobilo is here.  I can't think of a better person to exclusively interview, the Speaker.  By the way, the British media, some British media have dubbed him Speaker of the Devil.  Bianca, please explain because some people have called him either the greatest defender of democracy or someone who undermines it.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, he certainly excites a lot of passions and is a very controversial and colorful figure and that's why it was so great to speak to him, but by and large the MPs that I speak to, and I'm always talking to them every week, do have a lot of respect for him.</p><p>He has been embroiled in a couple of controversies, particularly over the management of some issues like bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons, but by and large, he is well respected for his ability to champion not the government's agenda, but that of back benchers and rank and file lawmakers, if you like.</p><p>And he has been successful of that.  And Paula, that's part of the reason that the Brexit debate is so shaped by him because Theresa May doesn't have a firm grip on Parliament because she has a minority government.  It means that when the Speaker selects ideas and stances from other members of Parliament, they take greater precedence.</p><p>So we now hear so many voices on the Brexit debate, and it's at a very confusing place, partly because of his championing of those backbenchers and Members of Parliament who aren't in government.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bianca, in terms of what he would say to defend himself, because some people have said that he's interfering in Brexit, and perhaps he's showing his hand had a little bit, even though he is supposed to be impeccably even-handed about this and non-partisan.</p><p>NOBILO:  So I spoke to him about how important it is for the Speaker to be an impartial figure, and I asked him was it difficult to transition from being a Member of Parliament, which is obviously a political animal to the Speaker which has to be impartial?  And he said no, because it's simply the duty of the Speaker to do that.</p><p>He also said that if he was truly impartial, it would be picked up constantly on social media, and in terms of the claims and accusations that are being made against him that he's being partial in the Brexit debate, he says, no, he's simply doing his job by representing the wider spectrum of opinions.</p><p>Also, when I spoke to him about how he decides what amendments to select and which way to move forward with the Brexit debate, he said he looks at which suggestions have are the most support in Parliament and which suggestions are coming not just from one side of the House of Commons, but from cross-parties.</p><p>So he has a mental check list, if you like, of considerations that he'll go through, and it was interesting because a lot of people will recognize the Speaker from Prime Minister's Questions, the boisterous event which we see every Wednesday here in the U.K., and I asked him how hard it was to cope with rowdy Members of Parliament, and he likened his job to something unexpected.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERCOW:  I'm a regular at my club with my son.  I'm a season ticket holder at Arsenal.  There are 60,000 people in the crowd, and there are virtually 60,000 people who think they know better than the referee.  The referee has just got to do his job as he thinks fit, and in a sense ...</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>BERCOW:   ... perhaps the Speaker is in a not all together dissimilar position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO:  Well, what was very clear to me, Paula, is that the speaker doesn't - isn't bothered by inconveniencing the government or, quote, \"moaning ministers.\"  He sees his job is to champion democracy, and that was clear to me that he was hugely passionate about the role of Parliament and trying to increase its authority, especially in such turbulent times.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it was funny to me, Bianca, that in trying to impugn his impartiality, they point to the fact that there was a bumper at his home that says \"Bollocks to Brexit.\"  I can only assume, Bianca, that he is in favor of free speech at his own home the way he is in the House of Parliament because he says the bumper sticker belongs to his wife.</p><p>Bianca, thanks so much for the interview.  We'll await to hear more from that very exclusive interview with the Speaker.  Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, stocks finished higher in London despite the Brexit uncertainty.  Elsewhere though, it was a mixed picture.  The Eurozone posted its flows, growth in four years with the final quarter of last year, and in Milan, stocks were hit by news that Italy slipped into recession in 2018.  The economy contracting for two straight quarters.  More on that later in this program.</p><p>Now with hundreds of billions of dollars of imports and exports on the line and time running out fast, Donald Trump calls for a top-level meeting with China's Xi Jinping to end this trade war.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Hello.  I'm Paula Newton, and there's more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment.  First though, these are the headlines on CNN this hour.</p><p>Exclusive video obtained by CNN is giving us a dramatic look at the last battles to drive ISIS from Syria.  Kurdish and Arab forces are fighting the remnants of ISIS on the ground backed up by U.S.-led air power, but ISIS fighters aren't giving us easily, battling to hold on to the last villages they control in Eastern Syria.</p><p>The U.S. is expressing grave concern over the accusation from Venezuela's self-declared acting President that his family is being intimidated by embattled President Nicolas Maduro.  Now, Juan Guaido says Mr. Maduro's special forces tried to enter the family's home.</p><p>In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, Guaido refused to rule out U.S. military intervention to end the escalating political unrest.  Defense attorneys present a closing argument in the trial of Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.</p><p>Joaquin Guzman is facing drug trafficking and other charges in New York.  Prosecutors presented more than 50 witnesses in the trial along with his phone calls, texts and documents.</p><p>Engineers at MIT have developed a robot that can actually play Jenga.  Now, the robot is able to see and feel individual blocks in a tower and has learned to switch blocks if it starts to wobble.  You may still have a chance to beat it though.  The robot isn't yet smart enough to work out which specific blocks would make your next turn impossible.  Let me see if it can make dinner.</p><p>OK, Donald Trump says this week's trade talks with China are going well, and will hopefully lead to a deal by March 1st.  Now, that's the last day before the U.S. may increase tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.  Mr. Trump is also making very clear, there will be no final deal until he meets again with China's President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Now, the president laid out his terms on Twitter, he wants Beijing to open its markets to U.S. financial manufacturing and agricultural businesses along with other sectors.  Mr. Trump added, he wants these talks to leave, quote, \"nothing unresolved.\"</p><p>Now, time is tight.  Even tighter if you can believe it than those Brexit talks.  Negotiators have until March 1st, just over four weeks away.  Now, if the deal can't be done by then, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods will increase from 10 percent to 25 percent, and you bet they are going to bite.</p><p>Carla Hills is a former U.S. trade representative, and she joins me now from Washington.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for joining us.  OK, the person who is at the table right now is Robert Lighthizer.  What do you think his main task is right now to get a deal with the Chinese or is it going to be a tougher thing to get a deal that the Trump administration will accept?</p><p>CARLA HILLS, FORMER UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  I suspect that the U.S. team will try to lay out exactly what the U.S. needs in order to move forward.  I don't anticipate that they will get a deal during this visit, and it's not because the president has said no deal until he meets with President Xi.</p><p>It is that there are so many things on the agenda.  I think they're going to have to meet again and perhaps a couple of times again and try to understand what each side needs to do.  What are the political limitations and the economic limitations?</p><p>NEWTON:  What many people are looking for in the Trump administration at least, and I believe the U.S. trade representative as well is structural reform.  Do you think that's just too ambitious, and at the end this trade deal.  If there is one, is going to look much different than that.</p><p>HILLS:  You have to define what you mean by structural reform.  I would ask the Chinese to remove the percentage caps on inward investment.  When they join the World Trade Organization in 2001, they committed to two basic norms, national treatment and non-discrimination, and they don't tell local firms that they can only have 39 percent in a given sector.</p><p>They should not tell a U.S. firm that they cannot come in and have green-field investments in areas of their interests.  And it is particularly important because in many instances, the joint ventures that have been mandated have been the pathway to get a hold of intellectual property that the U.S. holds, so it really needs to be corrected.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet if it needs to be corrected, do you think that means that a deal can't be done? We just went through the deadline, it is very tight, it is four weeks before those tariffs that are paid by the way by U.S. firms go up substantially.</p><p>HILLS:  Well, President Trump could take some of the things that they accomplish, perhaps extend and give a little more time.  I don't know how they're going to handle the negotiations, neither one of us is in the negotiating room.</p><p>NEWTON:  Your best guess though as someone who has been in this position before, and I lean on you because at a time when you were dealing with these issues with China, completely different era I understand, but it was that same debate, right?</p><p>[15:35:00]  Is China going to move to a more -- an economy that more mirrors capitalism in a way and privatization? Because a lot of people are saying now that actually in the last five years, especially with the state sponsorship of its companies, that China has actually moved backwards on these issues.</p><p>NEWTON:  I agree that China has moved backwards.  And we have a pre-eminent economist Nicholas Lardy who has just released a book called \"The State Strikes Back\".  And he, five years earlier, had written a book entitled \"Market Over Mao\".</p><p>And in 2014, when he wrote \"The Market Over Mao\", he was saying, look, the market is working.  It's -- the restrictions are coming down because that's where the profits are.  The private sector is making a difference.</p><p>And what he has noted and profoundly spells out in detail with charts is how that has turned around, that the government is spending more money, flowing more capital to state-owned enterprises that are not making a profit, whereas the private sector in China is making a profit.</p><p>We have a deal to make because what we're asking of China will actually be good for its economy.</p><p>NEWTON:  But they don't believe perhaps that it will be good for them politically, which is another argument entirely.  Ambassador Hills, before I let you go, you know, we have this issue of this CFO, this Huawei executive who is out on bail in Vancouver.</p><p>A lot of people are saying still cloud the talks, but I point more not to the case of one executive or even the 23 charges that have been put against Huawei and her and other executives.  But the fact that you had the Intel chiefs in the United States say the other day on Capitol Hill that Huawei poses an intelligence risk to the United States.</p><p>How do you see going forward with China, when basically, you have the intelligence community saying any kind of cooperation with this country on that level, even from a private company in China is a risk?</p><p>HILLS:  Well, as an old prosecutor, let me say, I don't have the facts of what the accusations are other than that, what has been in the press.  But if a case can be made whether it's against somebody from China or Brazil or England, that is for the prosecutors to make that case, and we should look at it objectively.</p><p>There are facts in earlier instances where there have been I think actions where they've stepped across the line.</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will see indeed how long it takes for that court -- that case to make its way through the courts.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for being with us, really appreciate it.  Now, when we return --</p><p>HILLS:  A pleasure --</p><p>NEWTON:  Two men are claiming to be Venezuela's president, one of them speaks to Cnn about his plan for fixing the country's broken economy.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now for the third time in a decade, yes, I said that, third time in a decade, Italy's economy has slipped into a recession.  Economic growth contracted for a second consecutive quarter in 2018, that's fueling fears that Italy's European neighbors could soon follow.</p><p>Lorenzo Codogno is the former chief economist and Director General at the Treasury Department of the Italian Ministry of Economy, and a visiting professor now at the London School of Economics.  He joins me now from London.  OK, the current government in power for eight months says these last two quarters are an absolute blip.</p><p>That there's no way that the Italian economy will grow.  Are they right?</p><p>LORENZO CODOGNO, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST &amp; DIRECTOR GENERAL, TREASURY DEPARTMENT, ITALIAN MINISTRY OF ECONOMY:  Well, you know, the global climate has changed, and if you look at the Eurozone growth, it is slowing fast.</p><p>And clearly, Italy is the weak spot, so I think this weakness will continue.  Actually, leading indicators already suggest that probably the first quarter of this year will be negative again.</p><p>The big issue here is whether at some point we see some stabilization during the course of this year and a modest recovery or whether this kind of slowdown transforms into a deeper and prolonged recession.  I think now it's not clear, but at least the first quarter will be negative, and I think given the negative carryover, probably the whole 2019 will end up in negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  The entire year of 2019 in a recession for Italy you think?</p><p>CODOGNO:  Well, again, given two negative quarters and the likely negative quarter at the beginning of this year, basically the year is already compromised to some extent, so unless you expect a sharp recovery in the second half, which I don't see at the moment, probably the overall outcome for the year is going to be negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  You know, it's a controversial question even to say it, but obviously the populist government here has a lot of policies out there that they are -- that are trial balloons.  Do you see anything in what they're proposing that could help the situation where the economy is concerned?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think the only positive here is that probably having a kind of anti-establishment protest parties in government basically prevents any, you know, upheaval in the streets as we have seen in France.  But other than that, I think there's a risk that the current government continues to roll back reforms introduced by the previous government and continues to have an anti-business attitude which would actually affect investment behavior by companies which I think is what is happening now.</p><p>NEWTON:  Interesting point of view you have though, that regular rank and file feel as if they have a voice in government now and that may be what's keeping them off the streets.  Before I let you go, I have to ask you in terms of any kind of contagion throughout Europe, there has been discussion about Germany also falling into a recession.</p><p>Mario Draghi has said, look, that there's reasons for the fact that he won't be -- that he will be continuing to stimulate those European economies, is he prudent to do so?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think so because I don't think that the Eurozone will enter a recession.  I think it's just a soft patch, but for Italy, it is definitely a recession and for the whole area, it is certainly softening of demand which would probably deserve a longer period of accommodative monetary policy.</p><p>So I think Mario Draghi and the ECB correct in slightly delaying the normalization of monetary conditions, so to speak.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and glad to hear that perhaps the rest of Europe may see some growth in 2019.  Lorenzo, thanks so much, really appreciate it.  Now the --</p><p>CODOGNO:  Thank you --</p><p>NEWTON:  Vice President of the European Commission says Europe needs a strong alliance between France and Germany to keep its economy moving.  Jyrki Katainen spoke to Richard in Davos last week and says it's the only way for Europe to move forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  Everybody should know that without a strong France-German access, Europe don't move forward -- Europe doesn't move forward.  So if you need a strong ownership, you need a strong leadership, especially in big countries.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN:  But --</p><p>KATAINEN:  It doesn't mean that smaller countries are put aside, but without strong France-German access, nothing moves on.</p><p>QUEST:  But hang on.  Should France and Germany be agreeing a treaty for closer economic cooperation, closer foreign policy cooperation, all the things that are in this treaty, shouldn't this be done in the greater sphere of the EU?</p><p>[15:45:00]  KATAINEN:  Of course, I mean, even the two big countries cannot decide anything separately from the other.  So the two countries are small enough to get decisions done unless the others don't support.  So we need overall more strong national ownership, ownership coming from the national governments whether you're big or small country, but it's not sufficient to sit on the fence and just see that if somebody is leading Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  OK, after the break, Europe's largest economies are trying to dance around U.S. sanctions on Iran.  You'll want these details up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  So right now, the Chief Financial Officer of the Chinese tech company Huawei is in -- is out on bail in Canada accused of dodging U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Now, three of the world's largest economies are openly trying to bypass sanctions on the same country.</p><p>Germany, France and the U.K. are working on a payment mechanism to allow their businesses to continue trading with Iran in defiance of President Trump's sanctions.  Now, it's called INSTEX, and it's an Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges.</p><p>Now, it's expected to operate like a barring platform or clearing house rather than relying on direct financial transactions, key, it won't be using U.S. dollars.  If Washington wants to punish those who use it, it would mean penalizing countries traditionally seen as its closest allies.</p><p>Now, Ramin Asgard is a former political adviser to the U.S. Central Command.  He was also director of America's Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai.  This is a controversial move by Europe, when they first proposed it, I actually didn't believe they'd go through with it.</p><p>It seems like they are no matter how honestly -- how modestly it begins.  Do you think it will elicit a response from the Trump administration?</p><p>RAMIN ASGARD, FORMER POLITICAL ADVISER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND:  Now, thank you very much.  I think what the Europeans have done is, they're playing a game of three-dimensional chess where they are a little bit caught between their responsibilities under the JCPOA and U.S. sanctions and not wanting to trigger them.</p><p>What they've done here is frankly, they've taken the smallest step forward in trying to show a little bit of independence from U.S. sanctions policy, and this INSTEX that has gone into effect today deals only at this point with humanitarian trade; food, medicine, medical equipment.</p><p>[15:50:00]  And they're hoping the Europeans that it will be enough to keep Iran in the JCPOA and not too much so that the United States will have any negative reaction to it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet Iran has already shown some impatience with the time table, and with as you said so far the humanitarian parameters of that.  As I say, you know, Mike Pompeo has called this a disastrous policy, and some are waiting to see exactly what kind of enrapture it will cause between the United States and these allies.</p><p>What is Europe trying to get at here?</p><p>ASGARD:  I think what the Europeans are trying to do is they desperately want the JCPOA to stay into effect.  They don't want Iran to break out again into a race for nuclear technology.  They think that could escalate very rapidly into a very serious conflict.</p><p>And so they want to play kind of an intermediate role with the United States.  This is a harkening back to what was going on in the 2000s basically where the EU three were doing their best to maintain Iran from going too rogue, and the United States was pretty much maintaining a strong thrust of sanctions.</p><p>If the EU is now looking to really stand up for its banks and its businesses and really step out, it would require them to go beyond humanitarian trade.  Remember, humanitarian trade is legal for U.S. sanctions in this case.  So, so far the EU is treading very carefully, but is definitely watching the trend and seeing, do we want to step any further?</p><p>Perhaps they're waiting for reactions from the Trump White House, from the Iranians to see where exactly this might head.  But they are maintaining at least a positive momentum and delivering on a promise that they had mentioned several months ago that they would do.</p><p>So in that effect, they are showing a little bit of independence and a little bit of forward progress for standing up for the EU three's position.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it will be a very interesting story to watch in the coming months, so thank you for your insights on this, appreciate it.  Now --</p><p>ASGARD:  Thank you very much.</p><p>NEWTON:  The self-declared president of Venezuela says he wants to reactivate the country's oil industry after the Trump administration placed sanctions on the state oil company.  Juan Guaido told Cnn that ordinary Venezuelans deserve those profits, not the embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  What we're doing is trying to reactivate this industry so there will be no usurping action by the way of Maduro and keeping this money and that the production of petroleum will be on behalf of Venezuela.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, the U.S. sanctions could have huge implications for the global oil industry.  Our emerging markets editor John Defterios told me the Trump administration is now playing hardball.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  The U.S. strategy seems very clear, starting first with the financial interests of PDVSA and directing those revenues that went into the United States to the National Assembly.</p><p>Number two, chasing bank accounts of Maduro and his cadre, even gold sitting in Germany and London hasn't taken action yet on that front.  And finally, I thought this was going to bubble to the surface, and that is Citco; it's a large refinery in the United States, has 5,000 petrol stations throughout the country, 30 states to be specific.</p><p>They could freeze the assets or again redirect those revenues somewhere else.  This is playing the hardball.  I think also we have to look at the bigger picture.  You know this very well, Russia and China have been playing in Venezuela for the better part of the decade, funneling nearly $70 billion into the country.</p><p>I can't imagine they're going to pick up their sticks, walk away and let Donald Trump fill this void in Venezuela.  But the U.S. is using all the economic tools.  You know the power of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that shut down banking systems, particularly the dollar because of the hyper inflation in Venezuela so vital to the economy, but they're doing it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they're doing it, and they've decided, as you said, a full-corps press, they're going to go all the way now.  Secretary Mnuchin being very clear that he is in touch with oil companies and those refineries in the Gulf that might be impacted.</p><p>In terms of Venezuela itself, I mean, John, the devastation and the production of oil in Venezuela has been staggering, which means it's only really has left the very little oil that actually it produces right now, that it could get out right now and, of course, as you were pointing out, Citgo.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes, let's cover PDVSA, this is the biggest collapse of any state oil company in the history of the business, at least since World War II.  If it didn't face a conflict on its soil -- take a look at the numbers, Paula, we're looking now at production at the end of 2018 according to OPEC at 1.1 million barrels a day.</p><p>[15:55:00]  If you rolled back the clock to 2008, it was 3.2 million barrels a day.  PDVSA used to be a very well run state oil company, that's not the case now, 20 years of Hugo Chavez and Maduro together, the last 10, the crunch, and you almost have a foreign direct investment freeze on the company because there's no reinvestment, and they've been printing money and that's why you have the hyper inflation.</p><p>Citgo is a very valuable brand in the United States, as you well know.  It will be really interesting to see how aggressive the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration plan to be going forward with that asset.</p><p>Also, we can't, you know, shut out the fact the poor Venezuelans, a million percent inflation last year, the IMF is suggesting ten times that in 2019, and I think you've seen the graph, poverty had shot up 40 percent in the last five years alone, Paula, to nearly 90 percent.</p><p>You've been on the ground there, it's absolutely painful and the number one asset, number one proven reserves in the world when it comes to oil is heavy crude, but they're not extracting it now because nobody wants to invest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, you are just a few minutes away until that closing bell and the close of trade for January.  It's been a great January and we will be right back to cap it all off for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  We are heading into the last few minutes of trading on Wall Street, and as you can see there, even the Dow has turned positive today.  U.S. markets are set to finish -- all three markets are set to finish higher today, and it's been a really good month for all three major indices.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is having its best January since 1987! Lifted by some strong results, of course, they are better-than-expected at the ones we have been talking about from yesterday.  Facebook, even GE getting in on the action.  A quick look now at that Dow as you can see there, most of those stocks in positive territory, even companies like Cat that continue to rely on that U.S.-China showdown -- trade showdown.</p><p>Drug-maker Pfizer is the best performer of the day, up about 3 percent.  Now, it is the busiest week of the quarter for earnings, Amazon report right after the markets close in just a few minutes, investors will find out how the holiday shopping season went as well as Amazon integration with Whole Foods and of course the all important growth on cloud services.</p><p>Chevron and Exxon close out the weeks, big earnings reports on Friday.  And as we hear, the applause for the closing bell today.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Paula Newton, \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper is next.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2174421349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB8-TVN1-JBHT-D4BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

We will get to that.  There is a lot going on today and this is what's moving markets on Thursday, the 31st of January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You thought scandals could hurt Facebook.  Yeah, right.  Their shares are soaring and profits have never been better.  Not to be outdone, GE.  Shares are up even more after the company's signs of a turnaround there are finally under way.  And we've got China, trade talks in the Oval Office any minute now.  Yes, I told you.  A busy hour ahead.  I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Sandals?  What scandals?  We're in the final hour of trading on Wall Street, and even as new controversies emerge, I'm telling you just in the last few minutes, Facebook shares are on pace for their best day in three years.  Now the company which also owns Messenger, WhatApp and Instagram booked a record profit of $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.  As you can see up better than 12%.</p><p>Facebook spent the fourth quarter fighting scandal after scandal.  First, the crisis that kept on giving, Facebook slow response to the Russian election interference and reports that Facebook executives advised against revealing publicly what they knew about that.  Second, Facebook was too slow to remove posts discussing the sale of a child bride in South Sudan.  Third, that Facebook executives hired a PR firm to attack liberal billionaire, George Soros.</p><p>Then, in December, two privacy scandals in quick succession.  First, a bug which exposed photos from 6.8 million new users and then, of course, less than one week later, another report that Facebook shared far more user data with companies like Microsoft and Yahoo than it had admitted.</p><p>Remember, these are just from the last three months of 2018, not in the history of the Facebook.  Now, the rest of the year was as bad or worse.  So has any of this driven away any users?  I bet you already know the  answer to that.  Facebook's Chief Financial Officer dealt with that on the earnings call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAVID WEHNER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  I would just - you know, I'd probably just let the numbers stand for themselves.  We saw, that you know, we are growing in all regions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  You heard it.  The numbers speak for themselves.  Now that growth explains Facebook's stock surge today.  Wall Street is betting 2.7 billion users can't be wrong.  Now, just in the last few minutes, new revelations.  Facebook and Twitter say they have removed thousands of accounts that engaged in coordinated, what they say is inauthentic action.  Many of those accounts originated this time in Iran and targeted users right around the world.</p><p>Our Samuel Burke is in London with the latest.  Samuel, I know were on the call getting the information on this, why today and how intrusive, how serious is this?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, Paula, the contrast could not be more stunning.  On the one hand you have a company whose stock is roaring up nearly 12% as you just described and yet, on the very same day that the stock is surging, the company is making clear that they do not have the reins, the control over their own social network.</p><p>In the past few minutes, Facebook announcing a huge campaign to bring down what they call inauthentic behavior, originating in Iran they say, though they are careful to note that there is not a connection to the government that they can see right now.</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen exactly the scope of what we're seeing here according to Facebook starting with the removal of 783 pages, groups and accounts, Paula, and it's not just Facebook.  It's also on Instagram.  About two million accounts, we're following at least one of these pages and Facebook was taking money for them, nearly $30,000.00 in spending for ads.</p><p>Many of these pages and accounts were masquerading as news websites, Paula, doing the work of journalists or that's what they wanted the users to believe, and Facebook is even sharing some of the posts that they say they have taken down already.  Many of them are anti-Israel in tone.  We have a post just like this, printing them out right now, this is just coming off.  \"Jene reconnais absolument pas Israel.\"  \"I will absolutely not recognize Israel.\"</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>BURKE:  We have other accounts with images like this, the stereotypical anti-Semitic images of somebody with the Star of David and the large nose.  Of course, these aren't from authentic accounts.  These aren't people's actual political views or anti-Israel messages, they are inauthentic accounts, coordinated accounts, and at the very same time, Paula, we see reports coming from \"The  Washington Post\" that Twitter is also taking down pages that they say originate in Iran, Russia and Venezuela.</p><p>Again, important to note that these companies aren't making links to the governments.  They are saying that this activity just originates in those countries.</p><p>NEWTON:  Any insight into how they found this and exactly if they are getting any better at trying to take down some of these accounts more quickly?</p><p>BURKE:  Well, they are saying they are working with outside parties to do analysis of this type of content, and the fact that there's another social network doing it right now as well might say that this was part of a broader effort.  Facebook saying that they've shared the information with the U.S. government, but we have no sense whatsoever if they are getting better at this.</p><p>In fact, I might even argue that it looks like they might be getting worse.  Now, you might be saying, \"Well, why?  If they are taking down the accounts.\"  Tucked into the earnings report was a line that said that the number of fake accounts, Paula, on Facebook has risen by 27% to an all-time high of 116 million fake accounts on Facebook, and that's according to Facebook.  What about the pages that they may not know about?</p><p>Incredible that Sheryl Sandberg said after the earnings report, \"We have proved with this blockbuster report that we can both protect the platform and at the same time have profitability.\"  If have you a surge of 27%, 116 million fake accounts, have you really protected the platform?</p><p>NEWTON:  They claim, yes, right?  They say they are doing the best that they can, and that is the challenge that they are up against.  Our Samuel Burke, thanks so much for jumping on that very quickly.  As you can see, more news from Facebook with the problems they are having on protecting the authenticity really, of their own platform.</p><p>Now, as we were saying, Facebook shares don't seem to be alarmed in the slightest by the latest development.  If you can see, they are up better than 11%.  I want now you to weigh in on this.  Please go to cnn.com/join.  I want to hear from you.  Our question today is would you consider quitting Facebook?  I'm going to ask you again.  Anybody here in the studio going to give me an answer on that?  Look at this, a silence.  I'm getting silence, people.  No Facebook login is required.  We'll discuss the results in a moment.</p><p>And I want all of you on the record as well.  Rana Foroohar is CNN's global economic analyst and columnist at \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST, CNN:  Who recently quit Facebook.</p><p>NEWTON:  They are sick of me telling them I have never been on Facebook ever in my life.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Interesting.</p><p>NEWTON:  I identified it as a security risk early on in my career.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Good for you.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, Rana, you identified 2018 as the tech lash.  I'm going to read your editorial back to you.  You said, \"This is a company that was so desperate to protect its top leadership and its business model that it hired a shadowy PR firm that used anti-Semitism as a political weapon.\"</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Indeed, and here we are.</p><p>NEWTON:  But here's what I say to you.  It worked.  Their user base continues to grow.  They are a very large formidable platform now.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they say they are doing their best.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.  It's interesting.  I mean, Sheryl Sandberg came out and said, look, this last quarter has proved not only can we add people to combat some of the fake news issues, we can fight regulators and we can grow at the same time.</p><p>But I'll tell you something, I think this year is really going to be the turning point because at the same time that you have all of these good news happening with the Facebook shares, you have Senator Mark Warner, for example, Democrat in the U.S. coming out and saying, he's crafting new legislation to try to put and a price on data so that people know the value of what have they are giving away.</p><p>I think a lot of the fact that people still go to these platforms has to do with the fact that they have no idea the value of what they are giving up.  And I think that when that becomes more transparent and you might get more competitors if there are antitrust issue, we could see a change.</p><p>NEWTON:  It's so trite and such a cliche, but obviously, an educated consumer is the best thing that could happen here especially when it even comes to those accounts that Samuel did such a good job of highlighting, if you're looking at something like that to really try and to see its origin and where it is coming from.</p><p>I mean, I know I gravitate on something like Twitter to verified accounts, right, just to see what's there.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Exactly.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, you know, it's kind of like even regulation, will it work?  Remember, we all - I know a lot of people don't remember the phone company, but we all used to be angry at the phone company, but we didn't rip the phone off the wall.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Right.</p><p>NEWTON:  That's what's happening here, Rana.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's true, but again, I am going to go back to this idea of competition.  A lot of people see the privacy issues posed by Facebook and Google and the like and the competition issues in two separate baskets.</p><p>I actually see them as being together, and I think that as you get U.S. and E.U. regulators really boring down and probably bringing some antitrust cases against these companies, it will be like if you remember 20 years ago when Microsoft was under fire.  The U.S. went after Microsoft for antitrust issues.  That actually allowed space for Google to be born.  I think that you're going to see new companies being born as these come under more pressure.</p><p>[15:10:08]</p><p>NEWTON:  And that they will have some more competition even more.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think they will, and I think even amongst the giants, you already see companies like Apple and IBM starting to compete on privacy and using data protection and privacy as a competitive advantage, so I think that this issue is out there.  I think you're going to see a lot of action this year.</p><p>NEWTON:  One of the things some people have pointed out though, and as you give Facebook the benefit of the doubt, they say they are trying their best.  They are leveraging everything that they have at this right now.  You're skeptical?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Well, I'm skeptical because the fundamental business proposition is still tracking everything you do and monetizing it.  It's surveillance capitalism.  I mean, this is a whole new area.  And by the way, it's not just the platform tech companies that are in it.  Almost every business these days is trying to track what you do from say a Starbucks to a Johnson &amp; Johnson.  I mean, your sneakers have chips in them.</p><p>This is - data is the new oil, and so I think that all the things you're seeing right now that Facebook is coming under pressure for, you're going to see broader number of companies facing these pressures.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet some people say that because of definitely deep pockets and them getting in on the ground floor of regulation, that it's actually Facebook that's going to be the winner in any kind of regulatory fight.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's interesting.  I mean, certainly in Europe, GDPR which is the new privacy regulation that rolled out this past year, it favors the big players in a sense that they have the money to actually enforce these rules and to comply.  Smaller players don't have that legal muscle, but I think we're in the beginning stages of a war.  This is the first battle.  This is really going to be I think the new too big to fail battle in some ways.  It's going to be big tech versus regulators just as the way it was with the banks.</p><p>NEWTON:  One difference, I have yet to see the consumer outrage.  We have to go.  But what do you think?  Do you think we'll see it?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think we're going to see an Exxon Valdez privacy probably around kids -- kids and games.</p><p>NEWTON:  Good point.  Rana, always so good to have you on here.  Really appreciate it.  Remember, she called it technological 2018.  According to those of you voting at cnn.com/join, most of you say, you would consider quitting Facebook, about a quarter of you say no way.  I wonder what the age spread is on that.</p><p>It is the last hour of trading on the last day of the month.  The Dow is down on the day, but all three major indices are way up for the month.  And as you can see there, the NASDAQ getting a nice rally.  Now, earlier today, the chief market strategist at National Holdings, Art Hogan put the rally into context for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL HOLDINGS:  We are having the best January in 30 years.  We had the worst December in 30 years, 80 years.  I'd say we're pairing off very nicely in the last two months.</p><p>I think we've gotten back to the midpoint where valuations are reasonable.  We are trading about 15.5 times this year's earnings and I think that when you look at where both the Dow and S&amp;P are, it's basically where we started last year, so we've gone 12 months without doing much and at the same time, multiples have come down because earnings are much better.</p><p>Now, in 2019, the S&amp;P can earn $170.00, which is down from $182.00, that's about 6% earnings growth, then I think we can have a normal year where things don't go crazy and we're going to be at 2,800 or 2,850 at the end of the year on the S&amp;P.</p><p>The only thing that stops that is trade.  If this is a long drawn out mutually destructive trade war --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will get to that trade - those trade negotiations later this hour.  Now, it is a good month as we were saying for the markets and a busy day for earnings.  Here to discuss all of that is CNN's Paul La Monica and of course, CNN's Matt Egan.  Thank you both.  I hope you came armed with opinions.  There's a lot of insight to be had from a lot of numbers.  Let's go first.  General Electric, it's funny because it's a great day for General Electric, but look where it had to come from?</p><p>MATT EGAN, LEAD WRITER, CNN BUSINESS:  You're right.  You know, I think that Wall Street is betting that the crisis at GE may finally be over.  The stock is up double digits.  It's like 45 minutes away from the best day in almost a decade, and, you know, the actual numbers were pretty crummy.  Power was down again.  GE wouldn't even say whether or not they will generate any positive free cash flow in 2019, but, you know, they did clean up one of the sins from the past.  They had a $1.5 billion settlement over WMC Mortgage.</p><p>Aviation was really good.  They had a profit there.  It was up 24%.  There were orders for their engine.  It was up a lot and so, you know, I do think that investors are betting that GE may have finally turned a corner here.</p><p>NEWTON:  Tesla, no one is agnostic over Tesla.  People love to hate it or love to love it.  In those latest results, certainly a lot of people were talking about the production issues there, but cash seemed to be okay.  Cash on --</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, Tesla still has a decent amount of cash.  I don't think that's the worry right now, Paula.  The problem, the biggest problem, I think, Elon Musk, you just have to scratch your head and wonder why he does the things he does in the way he does sometimes.</p><p>They wait until the very last moment of the conference call with analysts after their earnings to pull the reverse Steve Jobs one more thing moment.  They gave bad news that the CFO is leaving, and that just, I think, leaves a bad taste.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was the last thing in the phone call.</p><p>LA MONICA:  It was the last thing in the phone call.  You look at the transcript.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bury the headline.</p><p>[15:15:07]</p><p>LA MONICA:  It's just bizarre that this is what happened, because it's not as if there's anything wrong with Tesla.  That's probably the reason why the CFO is leaving.  He's actually done two stints as CFO.  It's nice for him to be able to go off into the sunset at a time where ...</p><p>NEWTON:  With that cash on hand.</p><p>LA MONICA:  ... people do feel like they have a good amount of cash and Model 3 demand is there.  So there are a lot of things to like about Tesla, but Musk can't get out of his own way sometimes.</p><p>EGAN:  It's just another reminder that it's just like the ultimate high wire act there at Tesla because it's all built on divisionary brilliance of Elon Musk which sometimes will lead to some executives leaving, and there's also a lot of debt there, which is why we're talking about cash, and that has continued to be a concern there at Tesla.</p><p>NEWTON:  It has been a great month for stocks so far.  We've got Amazon tomorrow.  Is this just going to blow -- sorry, today after the bell.  Is that going to blow the roof off of this market?</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think we have to wait and see.  I think what people are really going to be focusing on with Amazon.  We know that sales growth in the core retail business is starting to slow.  Hopefully they had a good holiday quarter, both at the online business as well as their own branded brick and mortar stores, Whole Foods, et cetera, but the number I'm really going to be looking at, Paula, is the AWS Cloud figures because Amazon Web Services is so insanely profitable that it helps to subsidize every other thing that Jeff Bezos wants to do at Amazon.</p><p>Sometimes that requires big investments that may lose money, but they can afford to do it because AWS is just a huge cash cow now.</p><p>NEWTON:  We saw Microsoft as well earlier with those great Cloud numbers as well, although the stock didn't fare so well.  A lot of it was okay.  In terms of where we're going in general with the market, gentlemen, I mean, I've heard both things about the earnings.  Of course, it's company dependent.</p><p>January though was a great month because basically expectations have been lowered, right, and people blew out the expectations.</p><p>EGAN:  I also think it was because December was so horrible, right.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was horrible.</p><p>EGAN:  It was the worst December that we've seen in quite a long time and I think it was about the fact that people feared an imminent recession in the economy.  They worried about the Federal Reserve being overly aggressive, and the U.S.-China trade war.  Listen, January is better because all three of those things have improved.</p><p>U.S. and China are talking instead of raising tariffs on each other.  The idea of an imminent recession doesn't seem likely right now and we have the Federal Reserve that went from unbelievably hawkish to really dovish in record time.</p><p>LA MONICA:  You were at the NYC yesterday and I swore when I was waiting to talk to you on yesterday's \"QMB Express Show\" I think there was a trader behind you whistling \"Patience\" you know, the Guns 'n Roses song.  I might be making it up because I'm a Gen X'er and I remember Gun's 'n Roses from the late '80s early '90s.</p><p>NEWTON:  I don't think you're making it up.</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think someone was actually whistling that because it's the word of the month.  Patience is the reason why we're having this record-setting or almost record-setting January.</p><p>NEWTON:  We have to leave it there.  But really, the Fed gets the credit.  The fact that Donald Trump even got off of the Fed's back.  We'll tell you all you need to know about that Fed meeting yesterday.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both so much.  You came armed with opinions.  I love it.  More of you two.  Excellent.  Coming up.  He is marshalling the Brexit debates in the British Parliament, and gaining worldwide attention.  Speaker of the House of Commons, you'll want to hear this.  He talks exclusively to CNN.</p><p>And Italy's economic downturn becomes has a full-blown recession.  Could its European neighbors soon follow?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:20:00]</p><p>NEWTON:  Now in a rare an exclusive television, the Speaker of the British House of Commons tells CNN says his job is like being a football referee.  You know the kind of football I'm talking about here, right, it's what we call soccer.</p><p>John Bercow is gaining an ever higher profile, thanks to his role in Parliament's Brexit drama.  You may know him from his greatest hits.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, SPEAKER, HOUSE OF COMMONS:  Order.  Order.  Order.  Resume your seat.  Resume your seat.  Don't tell me what the procedures of this House are.</p><p>Order.  I know what I'm doing.</p><p>It's utterly irresponsible chanting in the background.</p><p>The House must calm itself.  Zen.</p><p>Laughing and chuckling away as if there's a great amusement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Isn't that great?  Bianca Nobilo is here.  I can't think of a better person to exclusively interview, the Speaker.  By the way, the British media, some British media have dubbed him Speaker of the Devil.  Bianca, please explain because some people have called him either the greatest defender of democracy or someone who undermines it.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, he certainly excites a lot of passions and is a very controversial and colorful figure and that's why it was so great to speak to him, but by and large the MPs that I speak to, and I'm always talking to them every week, do have a lot of respect for him.</p><p>He has been embroiled in a couple of controversies, particularly over the management of some issues like bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons, but by and large, he is well respected for his ability to champion not the government's agenda, but that of back benchers and rank and file lawmakers, if you like.</p><p>And he has been successful of that.  And Paula, that's part of the reason that the Brexit debate is so shaped by him because Theresa May doesn't have a firm grip on Parliament because she has a minority government.  It means that when the Speaker selects ideas and stances from other members of Parliament, they take greater precedence.</p><p>So we now hear so many voices on the Brexit debate, and it's at a very confusing place, partly because of his championing of those backbenchers and Members of Parliament who aren't in government.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bianca, in terms of what he would say to defend himself, because some people have said that he's interfering in Brexit, and perhaps he's showing his hand had a little bit, even though he is supposed to be impeccably even-handed about this and non-partisan.</p><p>NOBILO:  So I spoke to him about how important it is for the Speaker to be an impartial figure, and I asked him was it difficult to transition from being a Member of Parliament, which is obviously a political animal to the Speaker which has to be impartial?  And he said no, because it's simply the duty of the Speaker to do that.</p><p>He also said that if he was truly impartial, it would be picked up constantly on social media, and in terms of the claims and accusations that are being made against him that he's being partial in the Brexit debate, he says, no, he's simply doing his job by representing the wider spectrum of opinions.</p><p>Also, when I spoke to him about how he decides what amendments to select and which way to move forward with the Brexit debate, he said he looks at which suggestions have are the most support in Parliament and which suggestions are coming not just from one side of the House of Commons, but from cross-parties.</p><p>So he has a mental check list, if you like, of considerations that he'll go through, and it was interesting because a lot of people will recognize the Speaker from Prime Minister's Questions, the boisterous event which we see every Wednesday here in the U.K., and I asked him how hard it was to cope with rowdy Members of Parliament, and he likened his job to something unexpected.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERCOW:  I'm a regular at my club with my son.  I'm a season ticket holder at Arsenal.  There are 60,000 people in the crowd, and there are virtually 60,000 people who think they know better than the referee.  The referee has just got to do his job as he thinks fit, and in a sense ...</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>BERCOW:   ... perhaps the Speaker is in a not all together dissimilar position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO:  Well, what was very clear to me, Paula, is that the speaker doesn't - isn't bothered by inconveniencing the government or, quote, \"moaning ministers.\"  He sees his job is to champion democracy, and that was clear to me that he was hugely passionate about the role of Parliament and trying to increase its authority, especially in such turbulent times.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it was funny to me, Bianca, that in trying to impugn his impartiality, they point to the fact that there was a bumper at his home that says \"Bollocks to Brexit.\"  I can only assume, Bianca, that he is in favor of free speech at his own home the way he is in the House of Parliament because he says the bumper sticker belongs to his wife.</p><p>Bianca, thanks so much for the interview.  We'll await to hear more from that very exclusive interview with the Speaker.  Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, stocks finished higher in London despite the Brexit uncertainty.  Elsewhere though, it was a mixed picture.  The Eurozone posted its flows, growth in four years with the final quarter of last year, and in Milan, stocks were hit by news that Italy slipped into recession in 2018.  The economy contracting for two straight quarters.  More on that later in this program.</p><p>Now with hundreds of billions of dollars of imports and exports on the line and time running out fast, Donald Trump calls for a top-level meeting with China's Xi Jinping to end this trade war.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Hello.  I'm Paula Newton, and there's more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment.  First though, these are the headlines on CNN this hour.</p><p>Exclusive video obtained by CNN is giving us a dramatic look at the last battles to drive ISIS from Syria.  Kurdish and Arab forces are fighting the remnants of ISIS on the ground backed up by U.S.-led air power, but ISIS fighters aren't giving us easily, battling to hold on to the last villages they control in Eastern Syria.</p><p>The U.S. is expressing grave concern over the accusation from Venezuela's self-declared acting President that his family is being intimidated by embattled President Nicolas Maduro.  Now, Juan Guaido says Mr. Maduro's special forces tried to enter the family's home.</p><p>In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, Guaido refused to rule out U.S. military intervention to end the escalating political unrest.  Defense attorneys present a closing argument in the trial of Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.</p><p>Joaquin Guzman is facing drug trafficking and other charges in New York.  Prosecutors presented more than 50 witnesses in the trial along with his phone calls, texts and documents.</p><p>Engineers at MIT have developed a robot that can actually play Jenga.  Now, the robot is able to see and feel individual blocks in a tower and has learned to switch blocks if it starts to wobble.  You may still have a chance to beat it though.  The robot isn't yet smart enough to work out which specific blocks would make your next turn impossible.  Let me see if it can make dinner.</p><p>OK, Donald Trump says this week's trade talks with China are going well, and will hopefully lead to a deal by March 1st.  Now, that's the last day before the U.S. may increase tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.  Mr. Trump is also making very clear, there will be no final deal until he meets again with China's President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Now, the president laid out his terms on Twitter, he wants Beijing to open its markets to U.S. financial manufacturing and agricultural businesses along with other sectors.  Mr. Trump added, he wants these talks to leave, quote, \"nothing unresolved.\"</p><p>Now, time is tight.  Even tighter if you can believe it than those Brexit talks.  Negotiators have until March 1st, just over four weeks away.  Now, if the deal can't be done by then, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods will increase from 10 percent to 25 percent, and you bet they are going to bite.</p><p>Carla Hills is a former U.S. trade representative, and she joins me now from Washington.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for joining us.  OK, the person who is at the table right now is Robert Lighthizer.  What do you think his main task is right now to get a deal with the Chinese or is it going to be a tougher thing to get a deal that the Trump administration will accept?</p><p>CARLA HILLS, FORMER UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  I suspect that the U.S. team will try to lay out exactly what the U.S. needs in order to move forward.  I don't anticipate that they will get a deal during this visit, and it's not because the president has said no deal until he meets with President Xi.</p><p>It is that there are so many things on the agenda.  I think they're going to have to meet again and perhaps a couple of times again and try to understand what each side needs to do.  What are the political limitations and the economic limitations?</p><p>NEWTON:  What many people are looking for in the Trump administration at least, and I believe the U.S. trade representative as well is structural reform.  Do you think that's just too ambitious, and at the end this trade deal.  If there is one, is going to look much different than that.</p><p>HILLS:  You have to define what you mean by structural reform.  I would ask the Chinese to remove the percentage caps on inward investment.  When they join the World Trade Organization in 2001, they committed to two basic norms, national treatment and non-discrimination, and they don't tell local firms that they can only have 39 percent in a given sector.</p><p>They should not tell a U.S. firm that they cannot come in and have green-field investments in areas of their interests.  And it is particularly important because in many instances, the joint ventures that have been mandated have been the pathway to get a hold of intellectual property that the U.S. holds, so it really needs to be corrected.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet if it needs to be corrected, do you think that means that a deal can't be done? We just went through the deadline, it is very tight, it is four weeks before those tariffs that are paid by the way by U.S. firms go up substantially.</p><p>HILLS:  Well, President Trump could take some of the things that they accomplish, perhaps extend and give a little more time.  I don't know how they're going to handle the negotiations, neither one of us is in the negotiating room.</p><p>NEWTON:  Your best guess though as someone who has been in this position before, and I lean on you because at a time when you were dealing with these issues with China, completely different era I understand, but it was that same debate, right?</p><p>[15:35:00]  Is China going to move to a more -- an economy that more mirrors capitalism in a way and privatization? Because a lot of people are saying now that actually in the last five years, especially with the state sponsorship of its companies, that China has actually moved backwards on these issues.</p><p>NEWTON:  I agree that China has moved backwards.  And we have a pre-eminent economist Nicholas Lardy who has just released a book called \"The State Strikes Back\".  And he, five years earlier, had written a book entitled \"Market Over Mao\".</p><p>And in 2014, when he wrote \"The Market Over Mao\", he was saying, look, the market is working.  It's -- the restrictions are coming down because that's where the profits are.  The private sector is making a difference.</p><p>And what he has noted and profoundly spells out in detail with charts is how that has turned around, that the government is spending more money, flowing more capital to state-owned enterprises that are not making a profit, whereas the private sector in China is making a profit.</p><p>We have a deal to make because what we're asking of China will actually be good for its economy.</p><p>NEWTON:  But they don't believe perhaps that it will be good for them politically, which is another argument entirely.  Ambassador Hills, before I let you go, you know, we have this issue of this CFO, this Huawei executive who is out on bail in Vancouver.</p><p>A lot of people are saying still cloud the talks, but I point more not to the case of one executive or even the 23 charges that have been put against Huawei and her and other executives.  But the fact that you had the Intel chiefs in the United States say the other day on Capitol Hill that Huawei poses an intelligence risk to the United States.</p><p>How do you see going forward with China, when basically, you have the intelligence community saying any kind of cooperation with this country on that level, even from a private company in China is a risk?</p><p>HILLS:  Well, as an old prosecutor, let me say, I don't have the facts of what the accusations are other than that, what has been in the press.  But if a case can be made whether it's against somebody from China or Brazil or England, that is for the prosecutors to make that case, and we should look at it objectively.</p><p>There are facts in earlier instances where there have been I think actions where they've stepped across the line.</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will see indeed how long it takes for that court -- that case to make its way through the courts.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for being with us, really appreciate it.  Now, when we return --</p><p>HILLS:  A pleasure --</p><p>NEWTON:  Two men are claiming to be Venezuela's president, one of them speaks to Cnn about his plan for fixing the country's broken economy.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now for the third time in a decade, yes, I said that, third time in a decade, Italy's economy has slipped into a recession.  Economic growth contracted for a second consecutive quarter in 2018, that's fueling fears that Italy's European neighbors could soon follow.</p><p>Lorenzo Codogno is the former chief economist and Director General at the Treasury Department of the Italian Ministry of Economy, and a visiting professor now at the London School of Economics.  He joins me now from London.  OK, the current government in power for eight months says these last two quarters are an absolute blip.</p><p>That there's no way that the Italian economy will grow.  Are they right?</p><p>LORENZO CODOGNO, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST &amp; DIRECTOR GENERAL, TREASURY DEPARTMENT, ITALIAN MINISTRY OF ECONOMY:  Well, you know, the global climate has changed, and if you look at the Eurozone growth, it is slowing fast.</p><p>And clearly, Italy is the weak spot, so I think this weakness will continue.  Actually, leading indicators already suggest that probably the first quarter of this year will be negative again.</p><p>The big issue here is whether at some point we see some stabilization during the course of this year and a modest recovery or whether this kind of slowdown transforms into a deeper and prolonged recession.  I think now it's not clear, but at least the first quarter will be negative, and I think given the negative carryover, probably the whole 2019 will end up in negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  The entire year of 2019 in a recession for Italy you think?</p><p>CODOGNO:  Well, again, given two negative quarters and the likely negative quarter at the beginning of this year, basically the year is already compromised to some extent, so unless you expect a sharp recovery in the second half, which I don't see at the moment, probably the overall outcome for the year is going to be negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  You know, it's a controversial question even to say it, but obviously the populist government here has a lot of policies out there that they are -- that are trial balloons.  Do you see anything in what they're proposing that could help the situation where the economy is concerned?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think the only positive here is that probably having a kind of anti-establishment protest parties in government basically prevents any, you know, upheaval in the streets as we have seen in France.  But other than that, I think there's a risk that the current government continues to roll back reforms introduced by the previous government and continues to have an anti-business attitude which would actually affect investment behavior by companies which I think is what is happening now.</p><p>NEWTON:  Interesting point of view you have though, that regular rank and file feel as if they have a voice in government now and that may be what's keeping them off the streets.  Before I let you go, I have to ask you in terms of any kind of contagion throughout Europe, there has been discussion about Germany also falling into a recession.</p><p>Mario Draghi has said, look, that there's reasons for the fact that he won't be -- that he will be continuing to stimulate those European economies, is he prudent to do so?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think so because I don't think that the Eurozone will enter a recession.  I think it's just a soft patch, but for Italy, it is definitely a recession and for the whole area, it is certainly softening of demand which would probably deserve a longer period of accommodative monetary policy.</p><p>So I think Mario Draghi and the ECB correct in slightly delaying the normalization of monetary conditions, so to speak.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and glad to hear that perhaps the rest of Europe may see some growth in 2019.  Lorenzo, thanks so much, really appreciate it.  Now the --</p><p>CODOGNO:  Thank you --</p><p>NEWTON:  Vice President of the European Commission says Europe needs a strong alliance between France and Germany to keep its economy moving.  Jyrki Katainen spoke to Richard in Davos last week and says it's the only way for Europe to move forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  Everybody should know that without a strong France-German access, Europe don't move forward -- Europe doesn't move forward.  So if you need a strong ownership, you need a strong leadership, especially in big countries.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN:  But --</p><p>KATAINEN:  It doesn't mean that smaller countries are put aside, but without strong France-German access, nothing moves on.</p><p>QUEST:  But hang on.  Should France and Germany be agreeing a treaty for closer economic cooperation, closer foreign policy cooperation, all the things that are in this treaty, shouldn't this be done in the greater sphere of the EU?</p><p>[15:45:00]  KATAINEN:  Of course, I mean, even the two big countries cannot decide anything separately from the other.  So the two countries are small enough to get decisions done unless the others don't support.  So we need overall more strong national ownership, ownership coming from the national governments whether you're big or small country, but it's not sufficient to sit on the fence and just see that if somebody is leading Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  OK, after the break, Europe's largest economies are trying to dance around U.S. sanctions on Iran.  You'll want these details up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  So right now, the Chief Financial Officer of the Chinese tech company Huawei is in -- is out on bail in Canada accused of dodging U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Now, three of the world's largest economies are openly trying to bypass sanctions on the same country.</p><p>Germany, France and the U.K. are working on a payment mechanism to allow their businesses to continue trading with Iran in defiance of President Trump's sanctions.  Now, it's called INSTEX, and it's an Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges.</p><p>Now, it's expected to operate like a barring platform or clearing house rather than relying on direct financial transactions, key, it won't be using U.S. dollars.  If Washington wants to punish those who use it, it would mean penalizing countries traditionally seen as its closest allies.</p><p>Now, Ramin Asgard is a former political adviser to the U.S. Central Command.  He was also director of America's Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai.  This is a controversial move by Europe, when they first proposed it, I actually didn't believe they'd go through with it.</p><p>It seems like they are no matter how honestly -- how modestly it begins.  Do you think it will elicit a response from the Trump administration?</p><p>RAMIN ASGARD, FORMER POLITICAL ADVISER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND:  Now, thank you very much.  I think what the Europeans have done is, they're playing a game of three-dimensional chess where they are a little bit caught between their responsibilities under the JCPOA and U.S. sanctions and not wanting to trigger them.</p><p>What they've done here is frankly, they've taken the smallest step forward in trying to show a little bit of independence from U.S. sanctions policy, and this INSTEX that has gone into effect today deals only at this point with humanitarian trade; food, medicine, medical equipment.</p><p>[15:50:00]  And they're hoping the Europeans that it will be enough to keep Iran in the JCPOA and not too much so that the United States will have any negative reaction to it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet Iran has already shown some impatience with the time table, and with as you said so far the humanitarian parameters of that.  As I say, you know, Mike Pompeo has called this a disastrous policy, and some are waiting to see exactly what kind of enrapture it will cause between the United States and these allies.</p><p>What is Europe trying to get at here?</p><p>ASGARD:  I think what the Europeans are trying to do is they desperately want the JCPOA to stay into effect.  They don't want Iran to break out again into a race for nuclear technology.  They think that could escalate very rapidly into a very serious conflict.</p><p>And so they want to play kind of an intermediate role with the United States.  This is a harkening back to what was going on in the 2000s basically where the EU three were doing their best to maintain Iran from going too rogue, and the United States was pretty much maintaining a strong thrust of sanctions.</p><p>If the EU is now looking to really stand up for its banks and its businesses and really step out, it would require them to go beyond humanitarian trade.  Remember, humanitarian trade is legal for U.S. sanctions in this case.  So, so far the EU is treading very carefully, but is definitely watching the trend and seeing, do we want to step any further?</p><p>Perhaps they're waiting for reactions from the Trump White House, from the Iranians to see where exactly this might head.  But they are maintaining at least a positive momentum and delivering on a promise that they had mentioned several months ago that they would do.</p><p>So in that effect, they are showing a little bit of independence and a little bit of forward progress for standing up for the EU three's position.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it will be a very interesting story to watch in the coming months, so thank you for your insights on this, appreciate it.  Now --</p><p>ASGARD:  Thank you very much.</p><p>NEWTON:  The self-declared president of Venezuela says he wants to reactivate the country's oil industry after the Trump administration placed sanctions on the state oil company.  Juan Guaido told Cnn that ordinary Venezuelans deserve those profits, not the embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  What we're doing is trying to reactivate this industry so there will be no usurping action by the way of Maduro and keeping this money and that the production of petroleum will be on behalf of Venezuela.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, the U.S. sanctions could have huge implications for the global oil industry.  Our emerging markets editor John Defterios told me the Trump administration is now playing hardball.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  The U.S. strategy seems very clear, starting first with the financial interests of PDVSA and directing those revenues that went into the United States to the National Assembly.</p><p>Number two, chasing bank accounts of Maduro and his cadre, even gold sitting in Germany and London hasn't taken action yet on that front.  And finally, I thought this was going to bubble to the surface, and that is Citco; it's a large refinery in the United States, has 5,000 petrol stations throughout the country, 30 states to be specific.</p><p>They could freeze the assets or again redirect those revenues somewhere else.  This is playing the hardball.  I think also we have to look at the bigger picture.  You know this very well, Russia and China have been playing in Venezuela for the better part of the decade, funneling nearly $70 billion into the country.</p><p>I can't imagine they're going to pick up their sticks, walk away and let Donald Trump fill this void in Venezuela.  But the U.S. is using all the economic tools.  You know the power of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that shut down banking systems, particularly the dollar because of the hyper inflation in Venezuela so vital to the economy, but they're doing it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they're doing it, and they've decided, as you said, a full-corps press, they're going to go all the way now.  Secretary Mnuchin being very clear that he is in touch with oil companies and those refineries in the Gulf that might be impacted.</p><p>In terms of Venezuela itself, I mean, John, the devastation and the production of oil in Venezuela has been staggering, which means it's only really has left the very little oil that actually it produces right now, that it could get out right now and, of course, as you were pointing out, Citgo.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes, let's cover PDVSA, this is the biggest collapse of any state oil company in the history of the business, at least since World War II.  If it didn't face a conflict on its soil -- take a look at the numbers, Paula, we're looking now at production at the end of 2018 according to OPEC at 1.1 million barrels a day.</p><p>[15:55:00]  If you rolled back the clock to 2008, it was 3.2 million barrels a day.  PDVSA used to be a very well run state oil company, that's not the case now, 20 years of Hugo Chavez and Maduro together, the last 10, the crunch, and you almost have a foreign direct investment freeze on the company because there's no reinvestment, and they've been printing money and that's why you have the hyper inflation.</p><p>Citgo is a very valuable brand in the United States, as you well know.  It will be really interesting to see how aggressive the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration plan to be going forward with that asset.</p><p>Also, we can't, you know, shut out the fact the poor Venezuelans, a million percent inflation last year, the IMF is suggesting ten times that in 2019, and I think you've seen the graph, poverty had shot up 40 percent in the last five years alone, Paula, to nearly 90 percent.</p><p>You've been on the ground there, it's absolutely painful and the number one asset, number one proven reserves in the world when it comes to oil is heavy crude, but they're not extracting it now because nobody wants to invest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, you are just a few minutes away until that closing bell and the close of trade for January.  It's been a great January and we will be right back to cap it all off for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  We are heading into the last few minutes of trading on Wall Street, and as you can see there, even the Dow has turned positive today.  U.S. markets are set to finish -- all three markets are set to finish higher today, and it's been a really good month for all three major indices.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is having its best January since 1987! Lifted by some strong results, of course, they are better-than-expected at the ones we have been talking about from yesterday.  Facebook, even GE getting in on the action.  A quick look now at that Dow as you can see there, most of those stocks in positive territory, even companies like Cat that continue to rely on that U.S.-China showdown -- trade showdown.</p><p>Drug-maker Pfizer is the best performer of the day, up about 3 percent.  Now, it is the busiest week of the quarter for earnings, Amazon report right after the markets close in just a few minutes, investors will find out how the holiday shopping season went as well as Amazon integration with Whole Foods and of course the all important growth on cloud services.</p><p>Chevron and Exxon close out the weeks, big earnings reports on Friday.  And as we hear, the applause for the closing bell today.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Paula Newton, \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper is next.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2174419999</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2T-RYV1-DY0W-426D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

We will get to that.  There is a lot going on today and this is what's moving markets on Thursday, the 31st of January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You thought scandals could hurt Facebook.  Yeah, right.  Their shares are soaring and profits have never been better.  Not to be outdone, GE.  Shares are up even more after the company's signs of a turnaround there are finally under way.  And we've got China, trade talks in the Oval Office any minute now.  Yes, I told you.  A busy hour ahead.  I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Sandals?  What scandals?  We're in the final hour of trading on Wall Street, and even as new controversies emerge, I'm telling you just in the last few minutes, Facebook shares are on pace for their best day in three years.  Now the company which also owns Messenger, WhatApp and Instagram booked a record profit of $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.  As you can see up better than 12%.</p><p>Facebook spent the fourth quarter fighting scandal after scandal.  First, the crisis that kept on giving, Facebook slow response to the Russian election interference and reports that Facebook executives advised against revealing publicly what they knew about that.  Second, Facebook was too slow to remove posts discussing the sale of a child bride in South Sudan.  Third, that Facebook executives hired a PR firm to attack liberal billionaire, George Soros.</p><p>Then, in December, two privacy scandals in quick succession.  First, a bug which exposed photos from 6.8 million new users and then, of course, less than one week later, another report that Facebook shared far more user data with companies like Microsoft and Yahoo than it had admitted.</p><p>Remember, these are just from the last three months of 2018, not in the history of the Facebook.  Now, the rest of the year was as bad or worse.  So has any of this driven away any users?  I bet you already know the  answer to that.  Facebook's Chief Financial Officer dealt with that on the earnings call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAVID WEHNER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, FACEBOOK:  I would just - you know, I'd probably just let the numbers stand for themselves.  We saw, that you know, we are growing in all regions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  You heard it.  The numbers speak for themselves.  Now that growth explains Facebook's stock surge today.  Wall Street is betting 2.7 billion users can't be wrong.  Now, just in the last few minutes, new revelations.  Facebook and Twitter say they have removed thousands of accounts that engaged in coordinated, what they say is inauthentic action.  Many of those accounts originated this time in Iran and targeted users right around the world.</p><p>Our Samuel Burke is in London with the latest.  Samuel, I know were on the call getting the information on this, why today and how intrusive, how serious is this?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, Paula, the contrast could not be more stunning.  On the one hand you have a company whose stock is roaring up nearly 12% as you just described and yet, on the very same day that the stock is surging, the company is making clear that they do not have the reins, the control over their own social network.</p><p>In the past few minutes, Facebook announcing a huge campaign to bring down what they call inauthentic behavior, originating in Iran they say, though they are careful to note that there is not a connection to the government that they can see right now.</p><p>I want to just put up on the screen exactly the scope of what we're seeing here according to Facebook starting with the removal of 783 pages, groups and accounts, Paula, and it's not just Facebook.  It's also on Instagram.  About two million accounts, we're following at least one of these pages and Facebook was taking money for them, nearly $30,000.00 in spending for ads.</p><p>Many of these pages and accounts were masquerading as news websites, Paula, doing the work of journalists or that's what they wanted the users to believe, and Facebook is even sharing some of the posts that they say they have taken down already.  Many of them are anti-Israel in tone.  We have a post just like this, printing them out right now, this is just coming off.  \"Jene reconnais absolument pas Israel.\"  \"I will absolutely not recognize Israel.\"</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>BURKE:  We have other accounts with images like this, the stereotypical anti-Semitic images of somebody with the Star of David and the large nose.  Of course, these aren't from authentic accounts.  These aren't people's actual political views or anti-Israel messages, they are inauthentic accounts, coordinated accounts, and at the very same time, Paula, we see reports coming from \"The  Washington Post\" that Twitter is also taking down pages that they say originate in Iran, Russia and Venezuela.</p><p>Again, important to note that these companies aren't making links to the governments.  They are saying that this activity just originates in those countries.</p><p>NEWTON:  Any insight into how they found this and exactly if they are getting any better at trying to take down some of these accounts more quickly?</p><p>BURKE:  Well, they are saying they are working with outside parties to do analysis of this type of content, and the fact that there's another social network doing it right now as well might say that this was part of a broader effort.  Facebook saying that they've shared the information with the U.S. government, but we have no sense whatsoever if they are getting better at this.</p><p>In fact, I might even argue that it looks like they might be getting worse.  Now, you might be saying, \"Well, why?  If they are taking down the accounts.\"  Tucked into the earnings report was a line that said that the number of fake accounts, Paula, on Facebook has risen by 27% to an all-time high of 116 million fake accounts on Facebook, and that's according to Facebook.  What about the pages that they may not know about?</p><p>Incredible that Sheryl Sandberg said after the earnings report, \"We have proved with this blockbuster report that we can both protect the platform and at the same time have profitability.\"  If have you a surge of 27%, 116 million fake accounts, have you really protected the platform?</p><p>NEWTON:  They claim, yes, right?  They say they are doing the best that they can, and that is the challenge that they are up against.  Our Samuel Burke, thanks so much for jumping on that very quickly.  As you can see, more news from Facebook with the problems they are having on protecting the authenticity really, of their own platform.</p><p>Now, as we were saying, Facebook shares don't seem to be alarmed in the slightest by the latest development.  If you can see, they are up better than 11%.  I want now you to weigh in on this.  Please go to cnn.com/join.  I want to hear from you.  Our question today is would you consider quitting Facebook?  I'm going to ask you again.  Anybody here in the studio going to give me an answer on that?  Look at this, a silence.  I'm getting silence, people.  No Facebook login is required.  We'll discuss the results in a moment.</p><p>And I want all of you on the record as well.  Rana Foroohar is CNN's global economic analyst and columnist at \"The Financial Times.\"</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST, CNN:  Who recently quit Facebook.</p><p>NEWTON:  They are sick of me telling them I have never been on Facebook ever in my life.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Interesting.</p><p>NEWTON:  I identified it as a security risk early on in my career.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Good for you.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, Rana, you identified 2018 as the tech lash.  I'm going to read your editorial back to you.  You said, \"This is a company that was so desperate to protect its top leadership and its business model that it hired a shadowy PR firm that used anti-Semitism as a political weapon.\"</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Indeed, and here we are.</p><p>NEWTON:  But here's what I say to you.  It worked.  Their user base continues to grow.  They are a very large formidable platform now.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they say they are doing their best.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  They are.  It's interesting.  I mean, Sheryl Sandberg came out and said, look, this last quarter has proved not only can we add people to combat some of the fake news issues, we can fight regulators and we can grow at the same time.</p><p>But I'll tell you something, I think this year is really going to be the turning point because at the same time that you have all of these good news happening with the Facebook shares, you have Senator Mark Warner, for example, Democrat in the U.S. coming out and saying, he's crafting new legislation to try to put and a price on data so that people know the value of what have they are giving away.</p><p>I think a lot of the fact that people still go to these platforms has to do with the fact that they have no idea the value of what they are giving up.  And I think that when that becomes more transparent and you might get more competitors if there are antitrust issue, we could see a change.</p><p>NEWTON:  It's so trite and such a cliche, but obviously, an educated consumer is the best thing that could happen here especially when it even comes to those accounts that Samuel did such a good job of highlighting, if you're looking at something like that to really try and to see its origin and where it is coming from.</p><p>I mean, I know I gravitate on something like Twitter to verified accounts, right, just to see what's there.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Exactly.</p><p>NEWTON:  Having said that, you know, it's kind of like even regulation, will it work?  Remember, we all - I know a lot of people don't remember the phone company, but we all used to be angry at the phone company, but we didn't rip the phone off the wall.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Right.</p><p>NEWTON:  That's what's happening here, Rana.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's true, but again, I am going to go back to this idea of competition.  A lot of people see the privacy issues posed by Facebook and Google and the like and the competition issues in two separate baskets.</p><p>I actually see them as being together, and I think that as you get U.S. and E.U. regulators really boring down and probably bringing some antitrust cases against these companies, it will be like if you remember 20 years ago when Microsoft was under fire.  The U.S. went after Microsoft for antitrust issues.  That actually allowed space for Google to be born.  I think that you're going to see new companies being born as these come under more pressure.</p><p>[15:10:08]</p><p>NEWTON:  And that they will have some more competition even more.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think they will, and I think even amongst the giants, you already see companies like Apple and IBM starting to compete on privacy and using data protection and privacy as a competitive advantage, so I think that this issue is out there.  I think you're going to see a lot of action this year.</p><p>NEWTON:  One of the things some people have pointed out though, and as you give Facebook the benefit of the doubt, they say they are trying their best.  They are leveraging everything that they have at this right now.  You're skeptical?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Well, I'm skeptical because the fundamental business proposition is still tracking everything you do and monetizing it.  It's surveillance capitalism.  I mean, this is a whole new area.  And by the way, it's not just the platform tech companies that are in it.  Almost every business these days is trying to track what you do from say a Starbucks to a Johnson &amp; Johnson.  I mean, your sneakers have chips in them.</p><p>This is - data is the new oil, and so I think that all the things you're seeing right now that Facebook is coming under pressure for, you're going to see broader number of companies facing these pressures.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet some people say that because of definitely deep pockets and them getting in on the ground floor of regulation, that it's actually Facebook that's going to be the winner in any kind of regulatory fight.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, it's interesting.  I mean, certainly in Europe, GDPR which is the new privacy regulation that rolled out this past year, it favors the big players in a sense that they have the money to actually enforce these rules and to comply.  Smaller players don't have that legal muscle, but I think we're in the beginning stages of a war.  This is the first battle.  This is really going to be I think the new too big to fail battle in some ways.  It's going to be big tech versus regulators just as the way it was with the banks.</p><p>NEWTON:  One difference, I have yet to see the consumer outrage.  We have to go.  But what do you think?  Do you think we'll see it?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think we're going to see an Exxon Valdez privacy probably around kids -- kids and games.</p><p>NEWTON:  Good point.  Rana, always so good to have you on here.  Really appreciate it.  Remember, she called it technological 2018.  According to those of you voting at cnn.com/join, most of you say, you would consider quitting Facebook, about a quarter of you say no way.  I wonder what the age spread is on that.</p><p>It is the last hour of trading on the last day of the month.  The Dow is down on the day, but all three major indices are way up for the month.  And as you can see there, the NASDAQ getting a nice rally.  Now, earlier today, the chief market strategist at National Holdings, Art Hogan put the rally into context for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL HOLDINGS:  We are having the best January in 30 years.  We had the worst December in 30 years, 80 years.  I'd say we're pairing off very nicely in the last two months.</p><p>I think we've gotten back to the midpoint where valuations are reasonable.  We are trading about 15.5 times this year's earnings and I think that when you look at where both the Dow and S&amp;P are, it's basically where we started last year, so we've gone 12 months without doing much and at the same time, multiples have come down because earnings are much better.</p><p>Now, in 2019, the S&amp;P can earn $170.00, which is down from $182.00, that's about 6% earnings growth, then I think we can have a normal year where things don't go crazy and we're going to be at 2,800 or 2,850 at the end of the year on the S&amp;P.</p><p>The only thing that stops that is trade.  If this is a long drawn out mutually destructive trade war --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will get to that trade - those trade negotiations later this hour.  Now, it is a good month as we were saying for the markets and a busy day for earnings.  Here to discuss all of that is CNN's Paul La Monica and of course, CNN's Matt Egan.  Thank you both.  I hope you came armed with opinions.  There's a lot of insight to be had from a lot of numbers.  Let's go first.  General Electric, it's funny because it's a great day for General Electric, but look where it had to come from?</p><p>MATT EGAN, LEAD WRITER, CNN BUSINESS:  You're right.  You know, I think that Wall Street is betting that the crisis at GE may finally be over.  The stock is up double digits.  It's like 45 minutes away from the best day in almost a decade, and, you know, the actual numbers were pretty crummy.  Power was down again.  GE wouldn't even say whether or not they will generate any positive free cash flow in 2019, but, you know, they did clean up one of the sins from the past.  They had a $1.5 billion settlement over WMC Mortgage.</p><p>Aviation was really good.  They had a profit there.  It was up 24%.  There were orders for their engine.  It was up a lot and so, you know, I do think that investors are betting that GE may have finally turned a corner here.</p><p>NEWTON:  Tesla, no one is agnostic over Tesla.  People love to hate it or love to love it.  In those latest results, certainly a lot of people were talking about the production issues there, but cash seemed to be okay.  Cash on --</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, Tesla still has a decent amount of cash.  I don't think that's the worry right now, Paula.  The problem, the biggest problem, I think, Elon Musk, you just have to scratch your head and wonder why he does the things he does in the way he does sometimes.</p><p>They wait until the very last moment of the conference call with analysts after their earnings to pull the reverse Steve Jobs one more thing moment.  They gave bad news that the CFO is leaving, and that just, I think, leaves a bad taste.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was the last thing in the phone call.</p><p>LA MONICA:  It was the last thing in the phone call.  You look at the transcript.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bury the headline.</p><p>[15:15:07]</p><p>LA MONICA:  It's just bizarre that this is what happened, because it's not as if there's anything wrong with Tesla.  That's probably the reason why the CFO is leaving.  He's actually done two stints as CFO.  It's nice for him to be able to go off into the sunset at a time where ...</p><p>NEWTON:  With that cash on hand.</p><p>LA MONICA:  ... people do feel like they have a good amount of cash and Model 3 demand is there.  So there are a lot of things to like about Tesla, but Musk can't get out of his own way sometimes.</p><p>EGAN:  It's just another reminder that it's just like the ultimate high wire act there at Tesla because it's all built on divisionary brilliance of Elon Musk which sometimes will lead to some executives leaving, and there's also a lot of debt there, which is why we're talking about cash, and that has continued to be a concern there at Tesla.</p><p>NEWTON:  It has been a great month for stocks so far.  We've got Amazon tomorrow.  Is this just going to blow -- sorry, today after the bell.  Is that going to blow the roof off of this market?</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think we have to wait and see.  I think what people are really going to be focusing on with Amazon.  We know that sales growth in the core retail business is starting to slow.  Hopefully they had a good holiday quarter, both at the online business as well as their own branded brick and mortar stores, Whole Foods, et cetera, but the number I'm really going to be looking at, Paula, is the AWS Cloud figures because Amazon Web Services is so insanely profitable that it helps to subsidize every other thing that Jeff Bezos wants to do at Amazon.</p><p>Sometimes that requires big investments that may lose money, but they can afford to do it because AWS is just a huge cash cow now.</p><p>NEWTON:  We saw Microsoft as well earlier with those great Cloud numbers as well, although the stock didn't fare so well.  A lot of it was okay.  In terms of where we're going in general with the market, gentlemen, I mean, I've heard both things about the earnings.  Of course, it's company dependent.</p><p>January though was a great month because basically expectations have been lowered, right, and people blew out the expectations.</p><p>EGAN:  I also think it was because December was so horrible, right.</p><p>NEWTON:  It was horrible.</p><p>EGAN:  It was the worst December that we've seen in quite a long time and I think it was about the fact that people feared an imminent recession in the economy.  They worried about the Federal Reserve being overly aggressive, and the U.S.-China trade war.  Listen, January is better because all three of those things have improved.</p><p>U.S. and China are talking instead of raising tariffs on each other.  The idea of an imminent recession doesn't seem likely right now and we have the Federal Reserve that went from unbelievably hawkish to really dovish in record time.</p><p>LA MONICA:  You were at the NYC yesterday and I swore when I was waiting to talk to you on yesterday's \"QMB Express Show\" I think there was a trader behind you whistling \"Patience\" you know, the Guns 'n Roses song.  I might be making it up because I'm a Gen X'er and I remember Gun's 'n Roses from the late '80s early '90s.</p><p>NEWTON:  I don't think you're making it up.</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think someone was actually whistling that because it's the word of the month.  Patience is the reason why we're having this record-setting or almost record-setting January.</p><p>NEWTON:  We have to leave it there.  But really, the Fed gets the credit.  The fact that Donald Trump even got off of the Fed's back.  We'll tell you all you need to know about that Fed meeting yesterday.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you both so much.  You came armed with opinions.  I love it.  More of you two.  Excellent.  Coming up.  He is marshalling the Brexit debates in the British Parliament, and gaining worldwide attention.  Speaker of the House of Commons, you'll want to hear this.  He talks exclusively to CNN.</p><p>And Italy's economic downturn becomes has a full-blown recession.  Could its European neighbors soon follow?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:20:00]</p><p>NEWTON:  Now in a rare an exclusive television, the Speaker of the British House of Commons tells CNN says his job is like being a football referee.  You know the kind of football I'm talking about here, right, it's what we call soccer.</p><p>John Bercow is gaining an ever higher profile, thanks to his role in Parliament's Brexit drama.  You may know him from his greatest hits.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERCOW, SPEAKER, HOUSE OF COMMONS:  Order.  Order.  Order.  Resume your seat.  Resume your seat.  Don't tell me what the procedures of this House are.</p><p>Order.  I know what I'm doing.</p><p>It's utterly irresponsible chanting in the background.</p><p>The House must calm itself.  Zen.</p><p>Laughing and chuckling away as if there's a great amusement.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Isn't that great?  Bianca Nobilo is here.  I can't think of a better person to exclusively interview, the Speaker.  By the way, the British media, some British media have dubbed him Speaker of the Devil.  Bianca, please explain because some people have called him either the greatest defender of democracy or someone who undermines it.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Well, he certainly excites a lot of passions and is a very controversial and colorful figure and that's why it was so great to speak to him, but by and large the MPs that I speak to, and I'm always talking to them every week, do have a lot of respect for him.</p><p>He has been embroiled in a couple of controversies, particularly over the management of some issues like bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons, but by and large, he is well respected for his ability to champion not the government's agenda, but that of back benchers and rank and file lawmakers, if you like.</p><p>And he has been successful of that.  And Paula, that's part of the reason that the Brexit debate is so shaped by him because Theresa May doesn't have a firm grip on Parliament because she has a minority government.  It means that when the Speaker selects ideas and stances from other members of Parliament, they take greater precedence.</p><p>So we now hear so many voices on the Brexit debate, and it's at a very confusing place, partly because of his championing of those backbenchers and Members of Parliament who aren't in government.</p><p>NEWTON:  Bianca, in terms of what he would say to defend himself, because some people have said that he's interfering in Brexit, and perhaps he's showing his hand had a little bit, even though he is supposed to be impeccably even-handed about this and non-partisan.</p><p>NOBILO:  So I spoke to him about how important it is for the Speaker to be an impartial figure, and I asked him was it difficult to transition from being a Member of Parliament, which is obviously a political animal to the Speaker which has to be impartial?  And he said no, because it's simply the duty of the Speaker to do that.</p><p>He also said that if he was truly impartial, it would be picked up constantly on social media, and in terms of the claims and accusations that are being made against him that he's being partial in the Brexit debate, he says, no, he's simply doing his job by representing the wider spectrum of opinions.</p><p>Also, when I spoke to him about how he decides what amendments to select and which way to move forward with the Brexit debate, he said he looks at which suggestions have are the most support in Parliament and which suggestions are coming not just from one side of the House of Commons, but from cross-parties.</p><p>So he has a mental check list, if you like, of considerations that he'll go through, and it was interesting because a lot of people will recognize the Speaker from Prime Minister's Questions, the boisterous event which we see every Wednesday here in the U.K., and I asked him how hard it was to cope with rowdy Members of Parliament, and he likened his job to something unexpected.  Let's take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERCOW:  I'm a regular at my club with my son.  I'm a season ticket holder at Arsenal.  There are 60,000 people in the crowd, and there are virtually 60,000 people who think they know better than the referee.  The referee has just got to do his job as he thinks fit, and in a sense ...</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>BERCOW:   ... perhaps the Speaker is in a not all together dissimilar position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO:  Well, what was very clear to me, Paula, is that the speaker doesn't - isn't bothered by inconveniencing the government or, quote, \"moaning ministers.\"  He sees his job is to champion democracy, and that was clear to me that he was hugely passionate about the role of Parliament and trying to increase its authority, especially in such turbulent times.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it was funny to me, Bianca, that in trying to impugn his impartiality, they point to the fact that there was a bumper at his home that says \"Bollocks to Brexit.\"  I can only assume, Bianca, that he is in favor of free speech at his own home the way he is in the House of Parliament because he says the bumper sticker belongs to his wife.</p><p>Bianca, thanks so much for the interview.  We'll await to hear more from that very exclusive interview with the Speaker.  Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, stocks finished higher in London despite the Brexit uncertainty.  Elsewhere though, it was a mixed picture.  The Eurozone posted its flows, growth in four years with the final quarter of last year, and in Milan, stocks were hit by news that Italy slipped into recession in 2018.  The economy contracting for two straight quarters.  More on that later in this program.</p><p>Now with hundreds of billions of dollars of imports and exports on the line and time running out fast, Donald Trump calls for a top-level meeting with China's Xi Jinping to end this trade war.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Hello.  I'm Paula Newton, and there's more \"Quest Means Business\" in just a moment.  First though, these are the headlines on CNN this hour.</p><p>Exclusive video obtained by CNN is giving us a dramatic look at the last battles to drive ISIS from Syria.  Kurdish and Arab forces are fighting the remnants of ISIS on the ground backed up by U.S.-led air power, but ISIS fighters aren't giving us easily, battling to hold on to the last villages they control in Eastern Syria.</p><p>The U.S. is expressing grave concern over the accusation from Venezuela's self-declared acting President that his family is being intimidated by embattled President Nicolas Maduro.  Now, Juan Guaido says Mr. Maduro's special forces tried to enter the family's home.</p><p>In an interview with Christiane Amanpour, Guaido refused to rule out U.S. military intervention to end the escalating political unrest.  Defense attorneys present a closing argument in the trial of Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.</p><p>Joaquin Guzman is facing drug trafficking and other charges in New York.  Prosecutors presented more than 50 witnesses in the trial along with his phone calls, texts and documents.</p><p>Engineers at MIT have developed a robot that can actually play Jenga.  Now, the robot is able to see and feel individual blocks in a tower and has learned to switch blocks if it starts to wobble.  You may still have a chance to beat it though.  The robot isn't yet smart enough to work out which specific blocks would make your next turn impossible.  Let me see if it can make dinner.</p><p>OK, Donald Trump says this week's trade talks with China are going well, and will hopefully lead to a deal by March 1st.  Now, that's the last day before the U.S. may increase tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.  Mr. Trump is also making very clear, there will be no final deal until he meets again with China's President Xi Jinping.</p><p>Now, the president laid out his terms on Twitter, he wants Beijing to open its markets to U.S. financial manufacturing and agricultural businesses along with other sectors.  Mr. Trump added, he wants these talks to leave, quote, \"nothing unresolved.\"</p><p>Now, time is tight.  Even tighter if you can believe it than those Brexit talks.  Negotiators have until March 1st, just over four weeks away.  Now, if the deal can't be done by then, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods will increase from 10 percent to 25 percent, and you bet they are going to bite.</p><p>Carla Hills is a former U.S. trade representative, and she joins me now from Washington.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for joining us.  OK, the person who is at the table right now is Robert Lighthizer.  What do you think his main task is right now to get a deal with the Chinese or is it going to be a tougher thing to get a deal that the Trump administration will accept?</p><p>CARLA HILLS, FORMER UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  I suspect that the U.S. team will try to lay out exactly what the U.S. needs in order to move forward.  I don't anticipate that they will get a deal during this visit, and it's not because the president has said no deal until he meets with President Xi.</p><p>It is that there are so many things on the agenda.  I think they're going to have to meet again and perhaps a couple of times again and try to understand what each side needs to do.  What are the political limitations and the economic limitations?</p><p>NEWTON:  What many people are looking for in the Trump administration at least, and I believe the U.S. trade representative as well is structural reform.  Do you think that's just too ambitious, and at the end this trade deal.  If there is one, is going to look much different than that.</p><p>HILLS:  You have to define what you mean by structural reform.  I would ask the Chinese to remove the percentage caps on inward investment.  When they join the World Trade Organization in 2001, they committed to two basic norms, national treatment and non-discrimination, and they don't tell local firms that they can only have 39 percent in a given sector.</p><p>They should not tell a U.S. firm that they cannot come in and have green-field investments in areas of their interests.  And it is particularly important because in many instances, the joint ventures that have been mandated have been the pathway to get a hold of intellectual property that the U.S. holds, so it really needs to be corrected.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet if it needs to be corrected, do you think that means that a deal can't be done? We just went through the deadline, it is very tight, it is four weeks before those tariffs that are paid by the way by U.S. firms go up substantially.</p><p>HILLS:  Well, President Trump could take some of the things that they accomplish, perhaps extend and give a little more time.  I don't know how they're going to handle the negotiations, neither one of us is in the negotiating room.</p><p>NEWTON:  Your best guess though as someone who has been in this position before, and I lean on you because at a time when you were dealing with these issues with China, completely different era I understand, but it was that same debate, right?</p><p>[15:35:00]  Is China going to move to a more -- an economy that more mirrors capitalism in a way and privatization? Because a lot of people are saying now that actually in the last five years, especially with the state sponsorship of its companies, that China has actually moved backwards on these issues.</p><p>NEWTON:  I agree that China has moved backwards.  And we have a pre-eminent economist Nicholas Lardy who has just released a book called \"The State Strikes Back\".  And he, five years earlier, had written a book entitled \"Market Over Mao\".</p><p>And in 2014, when he wrote \"The Market Over Mao\", he was saying, look, the market is working.  It's -- the restrictions are coming down because that's where the profits are.  The private sector is making a difference.</p><p>And what he has noted and profoundly spells out in detail with charts is how that has turned around, that the government is spending more money, flowing more capital to state-owned enterprises that are not making a profit, whereas the private sector in China is making a profit.</p><p>We have a deal to make because what we're asking of China will actually be good for its economy.</p><p>NEWTON:  But they don't believe perhaps that it will be good for them politically, which is another argument entirely.  Ambassador Hills, before I let you go, you know, we have this issue of this CFO, this Huawei executive who is out on bail in Vancouver.</p><p>A lot of people are saying still cloud the talks, but I point more not to the case of one executive or even the 23 charges that have been put against Huawei and her and other executives.  But the fact that you had the Intel chiefs in the United States say the other day on Capitol Hill that Huawei poses an intelligence risk to the United States.</p><p>How do you see going forward with China, when basically, you have the intelligence community saying any kind of cooperation with this country on that level, even from a private company in China is a risk?</p><p>HILLS:  Well, as an old prosecutor, let me say, I don't have the facts of what the accusations are other than that, what has been in the press.  But if a case can be made whether it's against somebody from China or Brazil or England, that is for the prosecutors to make that case, and we should look at it objectively.</p><p>There are facts in earlier instances where there have been I think actions where they've stepped across the line.</p><p>NEWTON:  And we will see indeed how long it takes for that court -- that case to make its way through the courts.  Ambassador Hills, thanks so much for being with us, really appreciate it.  Now, when we return --</p><p>HILLS:  A pleasure --</p><p>NEWTON:  Two men are claiming to be Venezuela's president, one of them speaks to Cnn about his plan for fixing the country's broken economy.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now for the third time in a decade, yes, I said that, third time in a decade, Italy's economy has slipped into a recession.  Economic growth contracted for a second consecutive quarter in 2018, that's fueling fears that Italy's European neighbors could soon follow.</p><p>Lorenzo Codogno is the former chief economist and Director General at the Treasury Department of the Italian Ministry of Economy, and a visiting professor now at the London School of Economics.  He joins me now from London.  OK, the current government in power for eight months says these last two quarters are an absolute blip.</p><p>That there's no way that the Italian economy will grow.  Are they right?</p><p>LORENZO CODOGNO, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIST &amp; DIRECTOR GENERAL, TREASURY DEPARTMENT, ITALIAN MINISTRY OF ECONOMY:  Well, you know, the global climate has changed, and if you look at the Eurozone growth, it is slowing fast.</p><p>And clearly, Italy is the weak spot, so I think this weakness will continue.  Actually, leading indicators already suggest that probably the first quarter of this year will be negative again.</p><p>The big issue here is whether at some point we see some stabilization during the course of this year and a modest recovery or whether this kind of slowdown transforms into a deeper and prolonged recession.  I think now it's not clear, but at least the first quarter will be negative, and I think given the negative carryover, probably the whole 2019 will end up in negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  The entire year of 2019 in a recession for Italy you think?</p><p>CODOGNO:  Well, again, given two negative quarters and the likely negative quarter at the beginning of this year, basically the year is already compromised to some extent, so unless you expect a sharp recovery in the second half, which I don't see at the moment, probably the overall outcome for the year is going to be negative territory.</p><p>NEWTON:  You know, it's a controversial question even to say it, but obviously the populist government here has a lot of policies out there that they are -- that are trial balloons.  Do you see anything in what they're proposing that could help the situation where the economy is concerned?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think the only positive here is that probably having a kind of anti-establishment protest parties in government basically prevents any, you know, upheaval in the streets as we have seen in France.  But other than that, I think there's a risk that the current government continues to roll back reforms introduced by the previous government and continues to have an anti-business attitude which would actually affect investment behavior by companies which I think is what is happening now.</p><p>NEWTON:  Interesting point of view you have though, that regular rank and file feel as if they have a voice in government now and that may be what's keeping them off the streets.  Before I let you go, I have to ask you in terms of any kind of contagion throughout Europe, there has been discussion about Germany also falling into a recession.</p><p>Mario Draghi has said, look, that there's reasons for the fact that he won't be -- that he will be continuing to stimulate those European economies, is he prudent to do so?</p><p>CODOGNO:  I think so because I don't think that the Eurozone will enter a recession.  I think it's just a soft patch, but for Italy, it is definitely a recession and for the whole area, it is certainly softening of demand which would probably deserve a longer period of accommodative monetary policy.</p><p>So I think Mario Draghi and the ECB correct in slightly delaying the normalization of monetary conditions, so to speak.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, and glad to hear that perhaps the rest of Europe may see some growth in 2019.  Lorenzo, thanks so much, really appreciate it.  Now the --</p><p>CODOGNO:  Thank you --</p><p>NEWTON:  Vice President of the European Commission says Europe needs a strong alliance between France and Germany to keep its economy moving.  Jyrki Katainen spoke to Richard in Davos last week and says it's the only way for Europe to move forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JYRKI KATAINEN, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION:  Everybody should know that without a strong France-German access, Europe don't move forward -- Europe doesn't move forward.  So if you need a strong ownership, you need a strong leadership, especially in big countries.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN:  But --</p><p>KATAINEN:  It doesn't mean that smaller countries are put aside, but without strong France-German access, nothing moves on.</p><p>QUEST:  But hang on.  Should France and Germany be agreeing a treaty for closer economic cooperation, closer foreign policy cooperation, all the things that are in this treaty, shouldn't this be done in the greater sphere of the EU?</p><p>[15:45:00]  KATAINEN:  Of course, I mean, even the two big countries cannot decide anything separately from the other.  So the two countries are small enough to get decisions done unless the others don't support.  So we need overall more strong national ownership, ownership coming from the national governments whether you're big or small country, but it's not sufficient to sit on the fence and just see that if somebody is leading Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  OK, after the break, Europe's largest economies are trying to dance around U.S. sanctions on Iran.  You'll want these details up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  So right now, the Chief Financial Officer of the Chinese tech company Huawei is in -- is out on bail in Canada accused of dodging U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Now, three of the world's largest economies are openly trying to bypass sanctions on the same country.</p><p>Germany, France and the U.K. are working on a payment mechanism to allow their businesses to continue trading with Iran in defiance of President Trump's sanctions.  Now, it's called INSTEX, and it's an Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges.</p><p>Now, it's expected to operate like a barring platform or clearing house rather than relying on direct financial transactions, key, it won't be using U.S. dollars.  If Washington wants to punish those who use it, it would mean penalizing countries traditionally seen as its closest allies.</p><p>Now, Ramin Asgard is a former political adviser to the U.S. Central Command.  He was also director of America's Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai.  This is a controversial move by Europe, when they first proposed it, I actually didn't believe they'd go through with it.</p><p>It seems like they are no matter how honestly -- how modestly it begins.  Do you think it will elicit a response from the Trump administration?</p><p>RAMIN ASGARD, FORMER POLITICAL ADVISER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND:  Now, thank you very much.  I think what the Europeans have done is, they're playing a game of three-dimensional chess where they are a little bit caught between their responsibilities under the JCPOA and U.S. sanctions and not wanting to trigger them.</p><p>What they've done here is frankly, they've taken the smallest step forward in trying to show a little bit of independence from U.S. sanctions policy, and this INSTEX that has gone into effect today deals only at this point with humanitarian trade; food, medicine, medical equipment.</p><p>[15:50:00]  And they're hoping the Europeans that it will be enough to keep Iran in the JCPOA and not too much so that the United States will have any negative reaction to it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And yet Iran has already shown some impatience with the time table, and with as you said so far the humanitarian parameters of that.  As I say, you know, Mike Pompeo has called this a disastrous policy, and some are waiting to see exactly what kind of enrapture it will cause between the United States and these allies.</p><p>What is Europe trying to get at here?</p><p>ASGARD:  I think what the Europeans are trying to do is they desperately want the JCPOA to stay into effect.  They don't want Iran to break out again into a race for nuclear technology.  They think that could escalate very rapidly into a very serious conflict.</p><p>And so they want to play kind of an intermediate role with the United States.  This is a harkening back to what was going on in the 2000s basically where the EU three were doing their best to maintain Iran from going too rogue, and the United States was pretty much maintaining a strong thrust of sanctions.</p><p>If the EU is now looking to really stand up for its banks and its businesses and really step out, it would require them to go beyond humanitarian trade.  Remember, humanitarian trade is legal for U.S. sanctions in this case.  So, so far the EU is treading very carefully, but is definitely watching the trend and seeing, do we want to step any further?</p><p>Perhaps they're waiting for reactions from the Trump White House, from the Iranians to see where exactly this might head.  But they are maintaining at least a positive momentum and delivering on a promise that they had mentioned several months ago that they would do.</p><p>So in that effect, they are showing a little bit of independence and a little bit of forward progress for standing up for the EU three's position.</p><p>NEWTON:  Yes, it will be a very interesting story to watch in the coming months, so thank you for your insights on this, appreciate it.  Now --</p><p>ASGARD:  Thank you very much.</p><p>NEWTON:  The self-declared president of Venezuela says he wants to reactivate the country's oil industry after the Trump administration placed sanctions on the state oil company.  Juan Guaido told Cnn that ordinary Venezuelans deserve those profits, not the embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  What we're doing is trying to reactivate this industry so there will be no usurping action by the way of Maduro and keeping this money and that the production of petroleum will be on behalf of Venezuela.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, the U.S. sanctions could have huge implications for the global oil industry.  Our emerging markets editor John Defterios told me the Trump administration is now playing hardball.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  The U.S. strategy seems very clear, starting first with the financial interests of PDVSA and directing those revenues that went into the United States to the National Assembly.</p><p>Number two, chasing bank accounts of Maduro and his cadre, even gold sitting in Germany and London hasn't taken action yet on that front.  And finally, I thought this was going to bubble to the surface, and that is Citco; it's a large refinery in the United States, has 5,000 petrol stations throughout the country, 30 states to be specific.</p><p>They could freeze the assets or again redirect those revenues somewhere else.  This is playing the hardball.  I think also we have to look at the bigger picture.  You know this very well, Russia and China have been playing in Venezuela for the better part of the decade, funneling nearly $70 billion into the country.</p><p>I can't imagine they're going to pick up their sticks, walk away and let Donald Trump fill this void in Venezuela.  But the U.S. is using all the economic tools.  You know the power of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that shut down banking systems, particularly the dollar because of the hyper inflation in Venezuela so vital to the economy, but they're doing it.</p><p>NEWTON:  And they're doing it, and they've decided, as you said, a full-corps press, they're going to go all the way now.  Secretary Mnuchin being very clear that he is in touch with oil companies and those refineries in the Gulf that might be impacted.</p><p>In terms of Venezuela itself, I mean, John, the devastation and the production of oil in Venezuela has been staggering, which means it's only really has left the very little oil that actually it produces right now, that it could get out right now and, of course, as you were pointing out, Citgo.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes, let's cover PDVSA, this is the biggest collapse of any state oil company in the history of the business, at least since World War II.  If it didn't face a conflict on its soil -- take a look at the numbers, Paula, we're looking now at production at the end of 2018 according to OPEC at 1.1 million barrels a day.</p><p>[15:55:00]  If you rolled back the clock to 2008, it was 3.2 million barrels a day.  PDVSA used to be a very well run state oil company, that's not the case now, 20 years of Hugo Chavez and Maduro together, the last 10, the crunch, and you almost have a foreign direct investment freeze on the company because there's no reinvestment, and they've been printing money and that's why you have the hyper inflation.</p><p>Citgo is a very valuable brand in the United States, as you well know.  It will be really interesting to see how aggressive the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration plan to be going forward with that asset.</p><p>Also, we can't, you know, shut out the fact the poor Venezuelans, a million percent inflation last year, the IMF is suggesting ten times that in 2019, and I think you've seen the graph, poverty had shot up 40 percent in the last five years alone, Paula, to nearly 90 percent.</p><p>You've been on the ground there, it's absolutely painful and the number one asset, number one proven reserves in the world when it comes to oil is heavy crude, but they're not extracting it now because nobody wants to invest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON:  Now, you are just a few minutes away until that closing bell and the close of trade for January.  It's been a great January and we will be right back to cap it all off for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON:  We are heading into the last few minutes of trading on Wall Street, and as you can see there, even the Dow has turned positive today.  U.S. markets are set to finish -- all three markets are set to finish higher today, and it's been a really good month for all three major indices.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is having its best January since 1987! Lifted by some strong results, of course, they are better-than-expected at the ones we have been talking about from yesterday.  Facebook, even GE getting in on the action.  A quick look now at that Dow as you can see there, most of those stocks in positive territory, even companies like Cat that continue to rely on that U.S.-China showdown -- trade showdown.</p><p>Drug-maker Pfizer is the best performer of the day, up about 3 percent.  Now, it is the busiest week of the quarter for earnings, Amazon report right after the markets close in just a few minutes, investors will find out how the holiday shopping season went as well as Amazon integration with Whole Foods and of course the all important growth on cloud services.</p><p>Chevron and Exxon close out the weeks, big earnings reports on Friday.  And as we hear, the applause for the closing bell today.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Paula Newton, \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper is next.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2174421349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2T-RYV1-DY0W-426H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8139\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behaviour, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p>The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p>The Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,\" Mnuchin said.</p><p>Today Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\"</p><p>Unlike Mnuchin, Powell - as head of the central bank - is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.\" She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for today's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\"</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,\" Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin\" backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a non-profit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business.

Since many have security settings or may contain proprietary information, the agency must have controls in place to ensure privacy and trade secrets are protected, even in situations where the information is only travelling down a hallway or to another building on the White Oak campus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The FDA scheduled a public meeting for 27 March to hear comments from staff and other experts on issues connected to its data strategy. Among the topics to be discussed are how the agency can \"design its data strategy and policy development to facilitate appropriate data access, data sharing within the agency and via data sharing agreements, as well as the appropriate reuse and repurposing of data to advance agency regulatory science priorities,\" according to an 8 January\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/~/media/Supporting Documents/Pink Sheet/2020/01/FDA Data Strategy public mtg FR notice 1820.pdf\">Federal Register notice</url> announcing the meeting.</p><p>The meeting will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the agency's White Oak headquarters. Comments will help the agency ensure its computing power keeps pace with drug development. Data strategies will be coupled with the FDA's Technology Modernization Action Plan, which was unveiled in September 2019. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//PS140873//\">\"US FDA IT Modernization Plan Will Lay Groundwork For RealTime Data Submissions\" \"Pink Sheet\"</url>)</p><p>Ensuring Security When Data Sets Are Combined </p><p>The data sharing issue may seem more appropriate for the federal clandestine services, but a senior FDA official told the Pink Sheet that in situations where datasets are shared internally, such as to understand new adverse events that were not expected in a drug category, permissions need to be in place to ensure the data may be used appropriately, as well as how the results may be communicated. FDA staff do not want data with a high security setting in a low security environment.</p><p>Agency officials also want to determine the best ways to maintain appropriate security when data sets with differing settings are combined. </p><p>Indeed, logistics within the agency have sometimes created security concerns. A 2017 Government Accountability Office study found that office sharing at White Oak made assessing applications with proprietary information difficult. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//PS119785//\">\"US FDA Headquarters Parking Problem May Create Security Risk\" \"Pink Sheet\"</url>)</p><p>The FDA also asked how it could \"manage data in a way that avoids unnecessary duplication\" as it moves toward more sharing and integrated data sets.</p><p>The agency official said cross-center activities using combined data sets are not common now. However, as the popularity and growth of so-called big data and artificial intelligence continues, more regular review of multiple and large data sets does not seem far away.</p><p>The recently started expansion of the FDA's Sentinel system includes development of methods to use AI, natural language processing and machine learning to improve signal detection. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//PS140931//\">\"Big Tech Helping US FDA With Sentinel Expansion\" \"Pink Sheet\"</url>) Biotech CEOs also predicted that AI will increasingly be used to reduce costs and potentially create incremental and disruptive innovations in 2020.

The FDA has issued guidelines for assessing RWE for effectiveness, but many questions and skepticism remain. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//PS141284//\">\"RealWorld Database Studies Prepare For A Long Journey IQVIA Advises\" \"Pink Sheet\"</url>) Agency officials want to develop more use cases that demonstrate the extent RWE can aid drug development and approval.

Several supplements already have been approved through the pilot program. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//PS124267//\">\"RealTime Oncology Review Has Sponsors Rethinking What Data To Share With US FDA And When\" \"Pink Sheet\"</url>)</p><p>One more well-known example of agency data sharing is FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), which includes a publicly searchable database of AEs reported for approved drugs. Allowing access has created some confusion and forced the agency to clarify the extent of the data available.

But it still pushed the economy's annual growth rate down to a near three-year low of 2.0pc and should be enough to convince Fed officials to deliver another 25bp interest rate cut later today.</p><p>Oanda's Edward Moya says US markets, have opened\u00a0flat, might pick up later in the day when the Fed announces its decision on rates:</p><p>US stocks are little changed despite stronger than expected private payroll and GDP data, as markets await a pivotal Fed rate decision this afternoon. \u00a0This [US] morning's data likely confirms Fed Chair Powell's belief that the economy is in a good place and expectations should grow for the Fed to deliver a hawkish cut this afternoon. \u00a0While both the ADP private payroll number and headline third quarter GDP reading beat expectations, the trend is still weakening.</p><p>The Share Centre's Tom Rosser adds:</p><p>Interestingly, these better than expected results have come out before the Federal Reserve meets later, where futures had predicted the probability of an interest rate cut to be over 90pc. However, this could come into question as the US economy appears to be reasonably robust. Does it really warrant another cut? In my eyes - no. Inflation is relatively subdued, economic growth has picked up slightly and the labour market is relatively tight.

The S&amp;P is hovering between a record  and not.  The Nasdaq is up, but not at a record.  It's been a very busy  day, as you'll hear over the next hour.  And -- oh.  Oh, that's what you  call a determined gavel.  Trading is over.  It's Wednesday, it's December  the 13th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a last hurrah for Janet Yellen.  The outgoing Fed chair raises rates  one more time before she's gone.  A setback for the Trump agenda.  Roy  Moore defeated in Alabama adds urgency to the push on taxes.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a humiliating defeat in Parliament for Theresa May.  Members of her own  party tie her hands, on Brexit.  </p><p>I'm Richard Quest.  We're live in the world's financial capital, New York.   Where I mean business.</p><p>Good evening.  In the past two hours, two pivotal moments in Washington for  the U.S. economy.  You're going to hear about them both in detail and with  analysis on this program.  At one end of the mile, the federal reserve  announced it was raising interest rates.  And moments later at the White  House, President Trump, at the other side of the mile, vowed to deliver on  the tax plan now agreed by Republicans, despite a humiliating setback in  Alabama.  We'll talk about that during the course of the show, as well.  </p><p>And the markets where at record high.  We've a high on the Dow, not on the  S&amp;P or the Nasdaq.  And an economy near full employment, more stimulus  coming down the Washington pipeline from the tax cuts and other policies.   And so, the Fed has raised rates.  It's the third time the Fed's moved this  year, and it's widely expected, although two board members did vote to keep  rates on hold.  That's what you see the target rate of the Fed.  They have  a lower in an upper band.  1.25 to 1.5.  We tend to talk about the  benchmark rate now standing at the upper end at 1.5 percent, although the  Feds hope the market committee attempts to keep it within that bound.   According to the so-called dot plot, most of the Fed is expecting three  rate rises next year.  In her final news conference as Fed chair, Yellen  said, there's not a great deal to be worried about with the U.S. economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR:  You know, I can always give you a  list of, you know, potential troubles, international developments, that  could result in down side economic risk.  But, look, at the moment, the  U.S. economy is performing well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Randall Kroszner, former Fed governor, is with me.  Good to see  you.  Are you a hawk or a dove?  Was this rate rise justified?  Two members  of the FOMC thought it was not.  </p><p>RANDALL KROSZNER, FORMER GOVERNOR, FEDERAL RESERVE:  Yes, the presence of  the Chicago and Minneapolis Fed, I call them the Midwest doves I guess I'm  more of a Chicago hawk and I think it was reasonable to raise rates now,  because the economy is doing quite well, as Janet Yellen had said.  It's  likely to continue to do well at least for the next year.  And although  inflation is not reaching the 2 percent target, I think it's much better  for the Fed to be ahead of the curve than behind it.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  Ahead of the curve, though.  But as long as I can recall, the  Fed's statements have talked about the medium term returning to the 2  percent inflation target.  They just never get there.  </p><p>KROSZNER:  It has been a long time since we've been there.  And that's one  of the reasons why inflation expectations are so much lower than they had  been from before.  But the economy overall is doing quite well.  And so, I  think buying a little bit of insurance through having rates a little bit  higher now rather than waiting, because we could suddenly get a boost up of  wage or inflation pressures, because the unemployment rate is quite low.   It's better to be I had been behind.  </p><p>QUEST:  The fifth rate rise since the whole tightening cycle began, this is  the stewardship of the Fed under Janet Yellen.  This was her last rate- setting meeting in that sense, and her last press conference.  How do you  grade her?  </p><p>KROSZNER:  I give her very high grades.  I think the U.S. economy has  created a lot of jobs over the last four years that she has been in.  I  think the growth rate has started to move up from 2 percent to now close to  3 percent over the last few quarters.  I don't think there have been any  disasters that have occurred.  The discussion of the winding down of the  portfolio has gone very smoothly.  </p><p>[16:05:00] And as exciting as watching paint dry, as she had said.  That  didn't happen in 2013, when we had the taper tantrum.  So, a lot of  difficult things I think she has handled quite well.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  On the core question though of the future direction of  monetary policy next year, the dot plot -- well, if we look at their  forecast -- FMC's forecast on unemployment it goes even lower.  Down into  the 3.  something percent.  Growth remains around about 3.2 to 3 percent.   Three rate rises next year.  Do you go along with that too?  </p><p>KROSZNER:  I think that's where we'll have to see how inflation is  evolving.  Because if inflation starts to move down, then I would be a  little bit more wary of doing that.  If inflation at least stays in the 1.5  to 2 percent area, I think, you know, a few more rate rises might be  justified.  But we're really going to have to see what those inflation  dynamics are, because they're quite different than what they traditionally  have been.  </p><p>QUEST:  Randall, good to see you, sir.  May I wish you and your family a  very happy holiday season, sir.  We're always grateful that you come on  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, thank you.  </p><p>Now we're going to head over to the trading post to talk about how the  market has moved today.  On the way, we see -- hey.  What are you doing  here?  You're going to help us understand, Teddy Weisberg.  </p><p>TED WEISBERG, PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES:  Well, of course.  </p><p>QUEST:  You make your way over there, while I update on the market.  Teddy  Weisberg will be with us in just a moment.  Record high on the Dow.  S&amp;P  off.  So, no records there.  Nasdaq up there.  I think we have to say,  there's two up, one down.  It's a green day on the market, thank you.  And  let's just update -- there we go.  So, we have a record on the Dow, which  proves 68, 60 and 70 so far for the markets.  The issue, of course, is what  was driving this.  And no, we still remain 20, 25 and 10 over on the  European boards.  But this is what we're talking about with Ted Weisberg,  who hopefully is now comfortable.  OK.  Today was an interesting session,  wasn't it?  Green for the markets, because the Dow and the Nasdaq are up.   What was the driving force?  </p><p>WEISBERG:  I think earlier in the day, it was there was a headline news  that both the Senate and the House had come to an agreement on the tax  bill.  So, we saw the market pop.  The market was up all day, but popped at  150.  And then once again, as you get into the weeds a little bit, you  know, we gave back -- </p><p>QUEST:  Why can't it hold on.  What happens during the latter part of the  day, particularly at the close, that means those early gains evaporate.  </p><p>WEISBERG:  Listen, we have a lot of cross currents, a lot of traders.  You  know, it just could be people lightning up.  You know, everyday there's a  new news cycle.  So, there's a reluctance on the part of traders, really  true traders to go home long anything.  </p><p>QUEST:  Ted, I need you to pause for a second.  Let's just have a look and  see.  Doug Jones is going to talk now.  He's listening.  We need to listen  in.  </p><p>DOUG JONES, ALABAMA SENATOR ELECT:  -- little bit of an orderly process.   Because I really want to get to as much as we can.  Let me just start out  by saying how thrilled that my family and I are for this win last night.   It has been a fun campaign, despite what people say and despite all of the  things that get thrown at you.  It was nothing that we didn't fully expect.  </p><p>Most important thing we've had an opportunity to travel around the state,  talking to so many people from so many walks of life.  Listening to their  cares, their concerns, their joys, their happiness.  And that's been so  gratifying.  And it is especially gratifying to know that in this day and  age, here in the state of Alabama, that a message of inclusiveness, a  message of equality, a message of dignity and respect, and importantly,  messages of issues that really are at the end of the day, those issues that  people care about.  The kitchen table issues that we have talked about,  that you guys have heard me preach about over and over.  It has been and  amazing night for us.  It has been an amazing day today.  I have received  calls from so many well-wishers, of friends and family.  But also, future  colleagues in Washington on both sides of the aisle.  I have received calls  from Democratic Senators.  I've received calls from my long-time friend -- </p><p>QUEST:  A bit of Doug Jones.  We are listening in for when he says  something that's, you know -- is significant in terms of the future of the  way he will be in the Senate.  Dan Merica is at the White House.  The  reverberations at the White House as a result of this.  Donald Trump's --  Donald Trump's tweet basically saying, I always knew that Moore was going  to lose.  Sounds like sour grapes.  </p><p>[16:10:00] DAN MERICA, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER:  Yes, it is sour grapes,  frankly.  I mean, there's no doubt that President Trump was fully behind  Roy Moore.  And this changes the calculation here at the White House.  I  mean, there's the practical matter.  Frankly, the Senate now has one less  Republican and one more Democrat, which really would imperil aspects of the  Trump agenda.  There are things that have happened in the last ten months  that wouldn't have happened with that kind of margin.  It also puts a lot  of power back into the hands of more moderate Republican Senators, Susan  Collins, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, those who have spoken out against the  president over the last few months.  </p><p>It also drives a division in the Republican Party, as well.  I mean, there  are many Republicans who are blaming Steve Bannon for this.  There are some  who are blaming Mitch McConnell.  You know, the blame game is alive and  well here in Washington, including here at the White House.  I don't think  Republicans have fully figured out how to blame for that loss.  But this  will cause, you know, kind of a moment of reckoning for many to figure out  what went wrong.  Was it just a candidate who had his own issues, or is  this a broader problem they'll have to confront in 2018?  </p><p>QUEST:  Just how difficult is it going to be with 51-49?  You talk about  the likes of Susan Collins and there's the moderates.  But at the end of  the day, if they scupper their own president or the president from their  own party, don't they de facto shoot themselves in the foot?  </p><p>MERICA:  I mean, you have to remember, some of these Senators who you're  mentioning are not running for re-election, namely Jeff Flake and Bob  Corker.  So they're, you know, unencumbered in many ways from President who  leads their party.  So, there are many members who certainly feel tied to  this president, because they will remain in office.  But many don't.  And  that is going to be a problem this White House is going to have to  confront.  You have seen the president take to Twitter, use events to  really go after Senators who have spoken out against him.  Said things  that, you know, somewhat would be seen as slights towards him.  He may not  be able to do that as freely if this -- this margin is less, because he's  going to need those Senators to pass things.  </p><p>As you see with this tax bill, they want to get this done before Doug Jones  is seated.  Now, president Trump said today that has nothing to do with the  loss in Alabama.  But if Doug Jones does get seated, and this moves past  this Christmas holiday, that is a very, very tricky predicament that the  White House has to confront.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, Dan.  </p><p>Donald Trump says passage of tax reform is only days away even after his  party suffered, what Dan was telling us about, the damaging defeat.  The  president has just finished what was billed as a final pitch on his tax  plan.  A package which is now all but agreed.  Speaking a few moments ago,  he said the bill could take effect within weeks.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If congress sends me a bill  before Christmas, the IRS -- this is just out.  This is breaking news.  Has  just confirmed that Americans will see lower taxes and bigger paychecks  beginning in February.  Just two short months from now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Republican aides tell CNN, they want to wrap-up the tax vote even  quicker after the Alabama result, of course, they don't want to wait until  Doug Jones gets seated.  The whole thing could be done by this time next  week.  Long before Jones gets anywhere near Washington.  The final plan  agreed in principle to be unveiled on Friday.  And then, as you move on,  you've got the final votes, the House will vote on Tuesday.  And then, of  course, you've got the Senate that votes, and Donald Trump, the president,  would sign it on Wednesday.  </p><p>Now, some top Senators from the Democratic Party want to delay until Doug  Jones gets seated.  Chuck Schumer says it's the right thing to do.  Stephen  Moore helped draft Donald Trump's tax plan during the presidential  campaign.  Good to see you, Stephen.  </p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, CNN ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Hi, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  I can answer my own question here, or maybe you'll do it for me.  I  guess you don't think they should wait until Doug Jones gets seated in  January.  Do you think it's the right thing to go ahead now?  </p><p>MOORE:  Yes, you do it while you've got the votes.  That's the way politics  works.  And, look, I think they've got 51 votes.  I think they're going to  probably lose Senator Corker.  But they have -- it's a very slim majority.   Shame, by the way, Democrats, not a single Democrat will vote for this.   Just one slight correction on something you said.  I got some intelligence  today, Richard, that this is kind of unusual, but that the Senate will  actually vote before the House.  Usually, the House goes first and then the  Senate.  They want to have the Senate go first so the House can basically  know that it's done if they get it passed.  </p><p>[16:15:03] And you're right, the vote is scheduled for Tuesday.  And then  Wednesday or Thursday, you can have a presidential signing.  But I  guarantee you, they're not going to wait until the beginning of the year  when the new senator is sworn in.  </p><p>QUEST:  If it's gone through reconciliation and both sides are agreed in  reconciliation, I mean, it would be somewhat extraordinary to then lose it  in the full vote.  </p><p>MOORE:  It would be.  But, you know, I have seen -- I'm a sports fan.  I've  seen teams blow leads in the fourth quarter of the game.  So, you know, it  looks like they are in very good shape right now.  I would put pretty heavy  money on the fact they're going to pass this.  But, you know, I'll believe  it when I see it.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, what you understand is the difference.  Now a slight raise of 1  percent in the corporate tax.  </p><p>MOORE:  Corporate rate, yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  And a reduction in the top level of income tax, 39.6 down to 37  percent.  Why do you need to give the wealthy more?  </p><p>MOORE:  Because what we wanted to do, and as you know, I've been involved  with this for two years with Donald Trump, is get small businesses a tax  cut.  It turns out, about two-thirds of small businesses, the ones that are  really successful, are the ones that are people in that highest income tax  bracket.  So that is a tax cut that's really meant to grow small  businesses.  We get, Richard, about 60 percent of our jobs in this country  from small businesses.  So, people are -- and by the way, one other quick  thing.  This bill gets rid of something state and local tax deduction.  And  that's affecting very high-income people and very high-income states like  New York and California.  So, one of the tradeoffs was, we'll get rid of  the state and local tax deduction, but we'll reimburse people by cutting  that rate a little bit, so they don't get too clobbered.  </p><p>QUEST:  You mean those of us like -- that live in New York, just to rub  salt into the wound a little bit there.  </p><p>MOORE:  There you go.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  Let's move forward.  Let's assume this is done, deal -- it is  a victory.  No question about it for the president, to have got this  through in record time.  What's the next economic fight that you see on the  horizon?  </p><p>MOORE:  Well, by the way, again, I'm not sure I would say this was done in  record time, because it took a good year.  And Ronald Reagan passed a tax  cut in eight months.  So, I actually think it took too long.  But anyway,  what's the effect of this bill?  I think it's going to be very positive for  the economy.  We've gotten some good news on the economy here just in the  last couple weeks.  I just heard you talking about the stock market.  I  mean, there's no doubt investors love this tax cut.  Businesses love it.   They're anticipating the positive effects of this.  We have about 3 to 3.5  percent growth right now in the economy.  I'm going to predict on your show  that we get in the first six months of next year when this tax cut hits,  you know potentially 4 percent growth.  We haven't had that, you know, in  15 years in this country.  So, I'm expecting some big boosts in the economy  starting in January.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, you're asking us to believe a prediction from a man wearing  Santa's on his tie.  Is that the gist of it?  </p><p>MOORE:  I'm surprised you can see those.  But yes, I am asking you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good.  </p><p>MOORE:  And, look, I want to be on your show in February and March of 2018  and will see whether I'm right.  But you've got to admit, Richard, that the  market really loves this tax cut.  Another 150 points today on the Dow.  </p><p>QUEST:  Either in D.C.  or in New York, one of us is buying dinner.  All  right?  </p><p>MOORE:  You got it, my friend.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>MOORE:  OK.  </p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight, it's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, live from the  world's financial capital.  The Apple boost shares Finisar, up 23 percent.   Apple's investment we're going to explain in this hour.  And, of course,  the Brexit battle, part two.  Theresa May's long, dark night of the soul.   A government loses a key Brexit bill vote.  Will be in London after the  Break.  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tough night for Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, who's been  humiliated by her own party.  Her MPs and others voted to guarantee a  meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.  It's all about the ability of  Parliament to actually change the Brexit deal.  They tied Theresa May's  hands.  Bianca Nobilo in London, tell me more.  </p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN WESTMINSTER:  Tied her hands, Richard.  It means that  the government can no longer tinker with beginning to withdraw the U.K.  from the EU without getting parliament's approval first.  It just means  that this process has got a whole lot more difficult for the government.   They've said that they're disappointed by this result, given the strong  assurances they said they gave.  But it's going to make the next few months  even harder for the Prime Minister, and she's got one more vote left on  this bill and that's not looking good either.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  So why?  What was the fear?  Was it that through the  back door, they were going to start to implement Brexit before Parliament  had voted?  </p><p>NOBILO:  That was the concern.  Because they could in theory have done that  with the previous wording of the bill.  Brexit, in its entirety, was about  taking back control.  Parliament was arguing, yes, the British people  wanted to take back control.  But give it back to the British Parliament,  not to the prime minister, and to the government.  So, while it was a  defeat for Theresa May, it was a real victory for democracy and for the  Parliament this evening.  </p><p>QUEST:  Why would her own party want to do her in, in such a way?  </p><p>NOBILO:  According to them, that was not their intention.  This is because  they believe it's Parliament's job to ensure that powers don't get moved  away from the House of Commons and to retain them.  The lead rebel that  tabled this amendment was a former attorney general and Tory MP, Dominic  Grieve.  He made the case strongly today when he spoke.  He said this is  not about sabotage.  This is about trying to improve the legislation.  Of  course, Labour MPs, who supported this amendment, probably had ulterior  political motives, and indeed there were huge cheers and jeers from the  opposition benches.  Jeremy Corbyn got in there straightaway, saying this  is a humiliating defeat for the Prime Minister.  So, it's unfortunate.   There are two reasons why people supported this.  Some political and others  because they truly believe that it would be corrosive to democracy not to.  </p><p>QUEST:  Bianca Nobilo in London, thank you.  </p><p>A short time ago, I spoke Guy Verhofstadt, on \"QUEST EXPRESS.\"  He's the  Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament.  He's angry over what he  sees as a fudging of the agreement last Friday.  I asked if he was getting  reassurance from the British government.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUY VERHOFSTADT, BREXIT COORDINATOR, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Yes, I got a  phone conversation by Mr. Davis David, the Brexit negotiator.  And we said,  Yes, Yes, this statement of intent, the words that were used that were not  appropriate, in fact we stick to our commitments, not only I will stick to  the commitments we have made in this arrangement, but also the whole U.K.  government.  So, we were reassured.  So, the best way to be reassured,  Richard, is that all the commitments that have been taken in this agreement  are now translated into legal text of a withdrawal agreement.  So, what we  expect is that in the coming weeks, after the break, that there will be a  withdrawal agreement on the table in which all the commitments are  translated that have been taken by the U.K. side and by the EU side in this  agreement.  </p><p>QUEST:  If you accept the principle, as everybody does, that nothing is  agreed until everything is agreed, then all the commitments that were made  on Friday are, by definition, going to be circumspect to that which comes  next.  In other words, the trade negotiations.  </p><p>VERHOFSTADT:  No, that's not the way it works.  Because in the treaties of  the European Union, it's very clearly stated that the first thing to do  before you can talk about the future arrangements is that you have an  agreement on the withdrawal.  </p><p>[16:25:03] And an agreement of the withdrawal means three things.  First of  all a financial settlement.  Secondly, clarity on the border issue between  Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and three, the citizens Right.   And for us, for the Parliament, this is very important that these rights of  the EU citizens are guaranteed in the future.  And when you have an  agreement on this, you can go into the next phase of the negotiations.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  Janet Yellen has called bitcoin highly speculative.  But said a  crash, while it would hurt some investors, does not provide for systemic  economic risk.  Potential for chaos though is plain as Bitcoin booms, major  exchanges have suffered embarrassing outages, and some have suffered  setbacks.  On Tuesday, bitcoin exchanged Bitfinex and Coinbase both  reported problems with service.  Last week, more than $70 million were  stolen from NiceHash.  Bitfinex sufferer a similar hack last year.  It's a  matter of time, perhaps, before a collapse, as we've see Mt. Gox which fell  into bankruptcy after 460 million was stolen.  Paul Vinay is a Wall Street  Journal reporter.  Author of \"The Age of the Cryptocurrency.\"  He joins me  now.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>PAUL VIGRA, REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  How are you doing?</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Thank you for having me on.  </p><p>QUEST:  She's right, isn't she, Janet Yellen, highly speculative.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Yes, that's putting it light.  She's right about two things.  Yes,  it is highly speculative.  And if it did crash, it really would not affect  the wider economy.  I think the thing to keep in mind with bitcoin, there  is a lot of hype right now, a lot of mania, a lot of people want to get in.   But this is still a pretty small market.  Pretty disconnected from the  wider economy.  </p><p>QUEST:  She sort of said, this isn't legal tender.  It's not a --  basically, it's not a safe way to proceed.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Well, it's not legal tender in that the U.S. government has not  recognized it as such.  Whether or not that makes it safe or not isn't  really the case.  But the issue of safety is a legitimate one.  It's just  not a matter of because it's legal or not legal.  </p><p>QUEST:  There were two areas -- I've been reading the fascinating work  you've done.  There were two areas I want to talk about this safety.</p><p>VIGRA:  Sure.  </p><p>QUEST:  The first is whether it goes up or down in price.  The markets will  regulate that.  The second is these two keys that you have, the public and  the private.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Right.  </p><p>QUEST:  Who looks after your bitcoin wallet?  If my bitcoin wallet is on my  computer and the hard drive goes caput, what happens?  </p><p>VIGRA:  You are out of luck.  So, this is the thing.  In a real nutshell,  this is the thing about bitcoin that makes it interesting.  The idea is you  could have this currency that is not regulated by any one central party.   The way they do that is by having transactions on an open ledger that  cannot be changed.  Can't ever be altered.  So, the key thing is that once  a bitcoin transaction is confirmed it's confirmed for all-time.  As opposed  to, say, if you're -- if JPMorgan gets hacked, your bank account gets  hacked, your credit card get hacked, those charges can be reversed.   Bitcoin is different.  </p><p>QUEST:  But what do you do if you lose the key?  </p><p>VIGRA:  You are out of luck.  And this is what I'm talking about.  So, the  difference is, in the real-world transactions can be reversed.  So,  security is important, but you know there is somebody behind you that can  probably make you whole.  In bitcoin you can't be made whole.</p><p>QUEST:  OK.  </p><p>VIGRA:  So, what happens is, you have a wallet, which is really just an  online account.  There are two points of access to that online account.   These are the keys you're talking about.  There are two ways to move money  in and out of that.  One is the public key.  That is an address, it's like  an e-mail address.  Anybody can see it.  Anybody can use it.  I could use  it, I could use your public key for me to send bitcoin to your wallet.  The  other is the private key.  You're the only one -- or you should be,  Richard, the only one who has access to the private key.  That's your way  to unlock your account.  </p><p>QUEST:  But as we move to a situation where more ordinary investors want to  be at bitcoin, then the risk moves slightly, not just from my computer, but  I now contract with bitcoin exchange.  And you look after them.  And now my  risk is, are you good, are you secure, are you solid.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Right.  And that's the risk with any third party when you request  or rewrite.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Again, the difference is if -- and you talked about Mt. Gox, which  was an early bitcoin exchange.  It was very poorly constructed.  A lot of  money was tied up there.  A lot of money disappeared.  There was no real  recourse.  That money was gone.  That is a risk when you're going to have  your money with any third party.  That's why a lot of bitcoiners, they  don't want their money with any third party.  That's why they have the  wallet in the first place.  But the difference is, then the security is on  you.  And even sophisticated people who understand how these things can  work can lose access to their private key, they can lose access to their  wallet.  They can lose their bitcoins.  It's not for everybody.  </p><p>QUEST:  I'm having -- good to see you, sir.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>Republican control of the Senate is shrinking.  A real threat to the Trump  agenda.  A major voice from the Obama White House will be with us after the  break.  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment of course.  Apple invests in America $390 million.  Brings an  old factory back to life in Texas.  We'll talk about that.  And a first  look at \"The Last Jedi.\"  Fans line up for midnight screenings.  As we  continue, this is CNN.  And on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>President Trump's made his final pitch on tax reform amid words, House,  Senate and negotiators reached a tentative deal on a tax bill.  Just last  hour, Mr. Trump said he believes we are days away from seeing lawmakers  pass that bill.  </p><p>Fresh off his stunning win in the Alabama senate race, the Democrat, Doug  Jones, is speaking at a press conference.  He said he's received numerous  calls, including one from president Trump.  And from Democratic and  Republican colleagues.  He said he has not spoken to his Republican  opponent, Roy Moore.  </p><p>The White House now says an aide to Mr. Trump plans to leave the White  House next month.  Her resignation follows news that the president s deputy  national security adviser is also to leave.  </p><p>South African President, Jacob Zuma being ordered to launch an  investigation into himself.  The South African Supreme Court is forcing Mr.  Zuma to set up an official inquiry into allegations of corruption an  influence peddling.  He has 30 days to appoint the investigators.  </p><p>One of the world's top cyclists has failed a drug test that threatens his  victory in one of the most prestigious events.  Chris Froome says he has a  good excuse.  He's accused of exceeding the maximum allowable dosage of an  anti-asthma drug during the Vuelta a Espana in September.  He says he takes  the drug, not surprisingly, to treat his asthma and it had a particularly  violent attack.</p><p>A short time ago, President Trump said tax reform passage was just days  away.  But the loss of his senate seat, his legislative agenda is at risk.   And you'll see what I mean if you take a look here at what's happening.   These are the promises that Donald Trump said he was going to do.  You can  see how he has managed to do this.  President Trump's promises.  He was  going to halt the Muslim entry.  That's on hold although it is moving  forward.  </p><p>[16:35:00] He's going to renegotiate NAFTA.  These -- the withdrawal from  TPP, labelled China a currency manipulator is not there.  Repeal Obamacare  has not been done and defeat ISIS.  Well, we can argue about that, bearing  in mind what happened in Iraq over the last few days.  Jim Messina is a  former White House deputy chief of staff, responsible for setting  priorities with Congress.  He's also Barack Obama's campaign manager and  the Messina Group.  And good to see you.  </p><p>JIM MESSINA, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF:  Good to see you  too.  How are you?  </p><p>QUEST:  I'm very well, sir.  Very well.  Now, when you look -- when you  look at what has happened in this -- in Alabama, how -- where do you give  the credit?  </p><p>MESSINA:  Well, it gets probably the most stunning political upset of the  last decade, right?  Alabama is the second-most conservative state and  country.  Democrats hadn't won a senate seat there in 25 years.  And I  think you have to give a credit to three people.  One, the candidate,  Jones, who Doug Jones, who ran a great campaign.  Two, Roy Moore, who is  the worst nominee of any major political party of my lifetime.  And then  Donald Trump, who, you know, today a poll came out, he's at 32 percent  approval rating, which is the lowest of any president since Nixon.  </p><p>QUEST:  So how does -- forgive me.  How does the Democrats capitalize on  their strengthened position in the Senate in the New Year without being  seen as obstructionist, so that they lose the support of the public who  basically says a plague on everyone?  </p><p>MESSINA:  Right.  You're exactly right.  The worst thing the Democratic  Party could do is just say we're not going to do anything.  What we need to  do is come together with a very clear vision about an economic future for  this country.  And hold to it.  And you have seen Democratic Party numbers  rise during the tax debate, because Democrats have been very clear what  they're for, and what they're not for.  And I think this tax debate gives  us a crystal-clear ability to do that, and next year, you know, the one  place we do agree with president Trump is infrastructure reform, and  funding more of those programs.  And I think that's a place where we can  move forward and get something done for the country.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do the Democrats keep Alabama in 2020?  </p><p>MESSINA:  Well, that's a long way between now and then.  What is true is  that Doug Jones is the only southern Democrat in the Senate if you take out  Florida.  But he also showed a way to win last night.  He won a race that,  you know, as he said, about half an hour ago, he didn't even think he was  going to win last night.  And he did.  And so, there is a -- a plan for  that.  You know, I was privileged to run President Obama's campaign, and  people looked at that plan and started running campaigns like that.  So, I  think we all need to shut up and go down to Alabama and learn a couple  things from Doug Jones.  </p><p>QUEST:  The \"USA Today\" editorial that was published, describing President  Trump as uniquely awful, and not fit to clean the toilets of President  Obama's presidential library.  What significance do you get, or do you give  to such vitriol?  </p><p>MESSINA:  Look, it's unprecedented in my lifetime.  I've been involved, as  you know, in world politics for 25 years.  I've never seen anything like  that editorial.  But the truth is, you know, I've worked hard for 20 years  in the United States Senate before I went to the White House on both sides  of the aisle, trying to get things done.  And let's just be really clear  about it.  We have never had anyone this bad as President of the United  States.  And you showed it.  I thought you had the most interesting graph  I've seen recently.  He hasn't gotten anything done.  We're one year into  it, in a country that desperately needs some leadership and we have done  nothing.  It's not me saying that as a Democrat.  </p><p>QUEST:  I've got to correct you here.  You withdrew from TPP.  You  restarted oil pipelines, and the tax thing is just about done.  </p><p>MESSINA:  Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.  It's not done yet.  And  TPP was a disaster to get out, and our economy is going to feel that for  the next 10 years.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, Jim.  Please come up to New York.  Come and join  us on the set.  </p><p>MESSINA:  Any time, thanks.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>We continue tonight, President Trump wanted Apple to create jobs in the  U.S. and now it has.  We'll show you where and how after the break.</p><p>[16:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  A very busy day as you can tell.  Much enjoyment of the day.  But  we must have time for business on the move.  Abu Dhabi has seen its largest  IPO in a decade.  It's all to do with Adnoc, the retail distribution arm.   The IPO, you can see the closing price and the IPO price.  There again it  values the company $851 million at 8.5 in total.  </p><p>Target's buying same-day delivery service company Shipt for the price of  $550 million.  That is where Target will be delivering to 72 cities and  plans to expand.  It is competing, of course, with Amazon, and Fresh and  Google.  Amazon delivers in those parts of the country.  Apple -- the  Apple, who does this belong to?  Apple's investing $390 million to a U.S.  chipmaker Finisar.  Produces laser chips that power face IDs and indeed  these AirPods, however these are.  Maybe they won't miss them if they come  over here.  That's business on the move.  </p><p>Gene Munster is the expert on all things Apple.  Managing partner at Loup  Ventures joins me now.  Why does Apple want this company and invest in it  and why not just buy them?  </p><p>GENE MUNSTER, MANAGING PARTNER, LOUP VENTURES:  Because they can get  exactly what they want without spending more money.  So, they put $350  million in, and this gives them a pull position, which this is the most  important part here, in terms of the future of phones.  What we use phones  for are going to change, augmented reality is going to become a bigger part  of that.  But to answer your questions, they could achieve this opportunity  around gather and company without buying the whole company.  And also, an  important point is they can keep other suppliers in the game, because they  need other people like Lumentum to be building those components to fulfill  all their demands.  So, they accomplish two things.  </p><p>QUEST:  What does Finisar do that's worth $1 billion over time?  </p><p>MUNSTER:  What they do is they map the world extremely well, the real  world.  And so, when you think about augmented reality, in order for our  phones and eventually some form of glasses to be able to superimpose these  images on the real world, think of Pokemon, or Snapchat with images on our  face.  In order to do that, you need to do 3D mapping and that's what they  do.  They have a laser that maps the environment around you.  </p><p>QUEST:  When Apple has withdrawn support from a supplier in the past, the  supplier has collapsed.  I'm thinking of the English company, the British  company, which was a major supplier until Apple pulled out.  If I was  Finisar, might have a worry that at some point in the future might decide,  not today?  </p><p>MUNSTER:  Well, you would have a little bit of worry, because they have  done that.  If a supplier that they have invested in doesn't deliver on  what they say they're going to do, Apple will pull the plug.  And they have  let companies go bankrupt to do that.  But I would rather be in that  position than be a competitor that is trying to win the business or  currently has the business.  That would happen more frequently, as someone  is a supplier to Apple, and Apple just decides to go away.  </p><p>[16:45:02] And so, it is a ruthless customer, Apple is.  Obviously, it's a  huge opportunity for these suppliers.  But I would rather be the company  that has the investment then one that doesn't have the investment.  </p><p>QUEST:  As we have seen in recent days with other investments, Apple is  almost parsimonious when it comes to making their investments.  They -- I  mean, it's the opposite of Facebook in terms of getting out the checkbook  and writing a very large check.  They make sure they pay not a penny more  and not a penny less.  </p><p>MUNSTER:  Yes, that's exactly right.  I mean, you look at this -- last  week, they did Shazam for $450 million, at one-point value $1 billion.  But  that's exactly right.  They do not do multibillion, $20 billion  acquisitions.  WhatsApp from Facebook like you re mentioning.  And I don't  think you're going to see anything change.  And we've studied this over the  last 15 years, and the reality is Apple buys technology.  They don't buy  brands.  And most other big tech companies buy brands.  And Apple loves  their brand, and they're not going to buy someone else's brand.  </p><p>QUEST:  Gene, thank you helping us understand what this is about.  </p><p>MUNSTER:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Really appreciate it.  </p><p>Red, white and blue.  Not the typical options for wine.  It's the latest in  our trader series.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  The British wine importer, the wine  drinker, has a new offering for its client, the Olive Tree.  Its drink is  an unusual hue.  Diners will get to try a wine that's blue.  It was first  developed in 2014 by a handful of tech entrepreneurs in Spain who wanted to  shake things up in the countries traditional wine industry.  </p><p>TAIG MACCARTHY, CO-FOUNDER, GIK:  The wine in Spain is full of rules.  We  didn't really resonate with that.  So, we wanted to offer something to the  new generation of wine drinkers.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What started as a team of five young entrepreneurs  running the startup company called Gik has now grown to 14 employees.  Gik  blends red and white grapes sourced from nearby vineyards to craft the blue  wine.  </p><p>MACARTHY:  We had to choose the right grapes.  And to do this, it's very  important for us to work with the experts in the wineries.  This is how we  personally mix the pigment.  That comes from the skin of the red grapes  into the wine.  And in the second stage, once it's in the stainless tanks  we add once again the same pigment.  And this is how we make this neon blue  wine.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The tradenomics of the global wine market flowed to  almost $300 billion in 2016.  Five countries savor almost half of all the  world's wine.  Europe dominates wine production.  Vineyard's cover more of  Spain's landscape than any other nation.  But this delicate crop is  vulnerable to weather conditions.  Recent frosts and droughts have taken a  toll on grape harvests.  Three billion fewer bottles of wine were produced  in 2017 worldwide, increasing the cost of draining a glass.  </p><p>MACARTHY:  We really are at the risk of losing grapes because of the  climate changes.  We had a really rough winter.  So, it made an impact on  the amount of grapes we actually produced.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But Gik is still finding success.  Since launching, the  company's revenue is 2 million euros and it's now selling to 31 countries.  </p><p>MACARTHY:  It made a lot of sense to us to just export.  To countries from  the U.S. to Japan, where they're more open to wine innovation.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The internet has also helped the company take off with  a bright blue Spanish wine.  </p><p>MACARTHY:  We have wine e-commerce for each country in which we sell.  And  they're really key.  It has allowed us to reach the amount of customers  that otherwise wouldn't be possible to reach.  A new way of connecting with  customers, a new way of discovery and a new way of working.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  It's like Christmas, Halloween New Year's Eve, all at the same  time.  That's if you're a \"Star Wars\" geek.  The new film is out tomorrow.   A couple hours from now, some fans are too excited to sleep.  So, they're  going to sit in the middle of the night.  </p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Old friends, new faces and cute critters.  That's how the \"New York  Times\" described \"The Last Jedi,\" which opens on Thursday.  Fans in London  are about to see the very first public screenings.  There have been  premiers.  Anna Stewart's is in Leicester Square where a showtime is about  two hours away.  Good to see you.  Cold night in London.  Anna, who will be  at this first screening?  How difficult was it to get a ticket?  </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN PRODUCER:  Pretty darn difficult, Richard.  There are  1,100 people descending on this cinema to watch the first screening at  midnight.  And we've seen quite a few of them.  Lots of Jedi have turned  out.  We've just had a massive downpour here in London.  So, they have all  gone under cover.  But if that appetite is anything to go by, this movie is  going to do very well at the box office.  But the big question is, can it  do as well as the last movie in the saga, which was \"The Force Awakens, \"  which was something of a record-breaker.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB IGER, CEO, WALT DISNEY COMPANY:  We think the way we're releasing them  is the right way.  So that the trilogy in this case is every other year,  and we filled in the middle with something that is not part of the trilogy.   So, we don't think we're overdoing it at all.  You know, there's so much  interest in \"Star Wars,\" as you know, witness tonight.  And as long as  you're in business with great directors, great writers, good story-tellers,  then I think the audience can't get enough of it.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can I ask you, what's the latest on the Fox take over?</p><p>IGER:  I'm here for \"Star Wars.\"  I'm not going to say anything about that.   Thank you.  Sorry.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART:  So, there you have it from Bob Iger, the Disney CEO.  Now he  doesn't think there will be any franchise fatigue here in this movie  release.  But that is the worry in the industry.  Because if you think  about it, \"The Force Awakens,\" which had the highest grossing opening  weekend ever, was the first \"Star Wars\" movie after a ten-year gap.  This,  Richard, is the third \"Star Wars\" movie after three years.  So, there is a  bit of concern there.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  I mean, I've enjoyed \"Star Wars.\"  I can't say I particularly  could quote from it, unlike some of my colleagues in the studio.  From what  you've heard, from those who have seen, does it hit the grade?  </p><p>STEWART:  The reviews have been pretty kind to this movie, Richard.  So, I  would say probably yes.  But I haven't yet seen it myself.  It's got lots  of the old characters.  We have Luke Skywalker.  We have Princess Leia or  General Leia as she is in this movie.  And we also have some new creatures.   We have the Poe, which in one review described it as something between a  puffin and Justin Bieber.  So, if that doesn't make you want to see it, I  don't know what will.  </p><p>QUEST:  Final question.  It is coming up to 10 o'clock in London.  Have you  got a ticket?  Are you going in to watch it?  </p><p>STEWART:  You're keeping me too busy, Richard.  I would love to be in  there.  But I'm also a little late on the ticket sales, I fear.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  Anna Stewart, proving that duty comes first in Lester  Square.  Thank you very much, indeed.  Cold night in London.  </p><p>Final check of the markets.  Dow Jones, it was a record.  The Nasdaq and  the Dow ended high.  The S&amp;P was off just a tad.  The Dow is up 80 points.   Again, a third of 1 percent.  The S&amp;P was only lower.  Consumer and  industrials were the biggest gainers overall.  </p><p>You can download our show as a podcast.  </p><p>[16:55:00] It's available from all the main providers.  And you can also  listen to it at CNN.com/podcast.  And also, you can always, of course, e- mail me or tweet me as usual.  Will have a Profitable Moment after the  break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  You can see what a busy, complicated  world it is at the moment.  You have Donald Trump with tax.  You have the  markets at record highs.  You have change at the Fed with Janet Yellen,  talking about bitcoin and saying it's highly speculative.  And then at the  last minute, you have Theresa May losing a crucial vote before Parliament,  which basically will tie her hands in terms of the negotiations.   Fascinating undercurrents in the global economy.  And throughout all of  this, the stock market just keeps rising.  </p><p>Which gave rise to a question from one of my colleagues that if, for  instance, the tax plan failed would the stock market, or would it hit the  economy?  The answer is yes.  If there is more dislocation on Brexit, would  that hit the U.K. economy in the UK stock market?  Yes.  If there are  further problems with world trade as the WTO is talking about now.  Does  that hit global growth?  The answer is yes.  My point is simple.  There are  many pitfalls out careful.  Of which we need to be careful.  And what we've  seen tonight in this program, we just laid them out all for you.  But don't  worry.  It's nearly Christmas and the new year.  And that's QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up  to in the hours ahead I hope it's profitable.  Will do it again tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

The S&amp;P is hovering between a record  and not.  The Nasdaq is up, but not at a record.  It's been a very busy  day, as you'll hear over the next hour.  And -- oh.  Oh, that's what you  call a determined gavel.  Trading is over.  It's Wednesday, it's December  the 13th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a last hurrah for Janet Yellen.  The outgoing Fed chair raises rates  one more time before she's gone.  A setback for the Trump agenda.  Roy  Moore defeated in Alabama adds urgency to the push on taxes.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a humiliating defeat in Parliament for Theresa May.  Members of her own  party tie her hands, on Brexit.  </p><p>I'm Richard Quest.  We're live in the world's financial capital, New York.   Where I mean business.</p><p>Good evening.  In the past two hours, two pivotal moments in Washington for  the U.S. economy.  You're going to hear about them both in detail and with  analysis on this program.  At one end of the mile, the federal reserve  announced it was raising interest rates.  And moments later at the White  House, President Trump, at the other side of the mile, vowed to deliver on  the tax plan now agreed by Republicans, despite a humiliating setback in  Alabama.  We'll talk about that during the course of the show, as well.  </p><p>And the markets where at record high.  We've a high on the Dow, not on the  S&amp;P or the Nasdaq.  And an economy near full employment, more stimulus  coming down the Washington pipeline from the tax cuts and other policies.   And so, the Fed has raised rates.  It's the third time the Fed's moved this  year, and it's widely expected, although two board members did vote to keep  rates on hold.  That's what you see the target rate of the Fed.  They have  a lower in an upper band.  1.25 to 1.5.  We tend to talk about the  benchmark rate now standing at the upper end at 1.5 percent, although the  Feds hope the market committee attempts to keep it within that bound.   According to the so-called dot plot, most of the Fed is expecting three  rate rises next year.  In her final news conference as Fed chair, Yellen  said, there's not a great deal to be worried about with the U.S. economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR:  You know, I can always give you a  list of, you know, potential troubles, international developments, that  could result in down side economic risk.  But, look, at the moment, the  U.S. economy is performing well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Randall Kroszner, former Fed governor, is with me.  Good to see  you.  Are you a hawk or a dove?  Was this rate rise justified?  Two members  of the FOMC thought it was not.  </p><p>RANDALL KROSZNER, FORMER GOVERNOR, FEDERAL RESERVE:  Yes, the presence of  the Chicago and Minneapolis Fed, I call them the Midwest doves I guess I'm  more of a Chicago hawk and I think it was reasonable to raise rates now,  because the economy is doing quite well, as Janet Yellen had said.  It's  likely to continue to do well at least for the next year.  And although  inflation is not reaching the 2 percent target, I think it's much better  for the Fed to be ahead of the curve than behind it.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  Ahead of the curve, though.  But as long as I can recall, the  Fed's statements have talked about the medium term returning to the 2  percent inflation target.  They just never get there.  </p><p>KROSZNER:  It has been a long time since we've been there.  And that's one  of the reasons why inflation expectations are so much lower than they had  been from before.  But the economy overall is doing quite well.  And so, I  think buying a little bit of insurance through having rates a little bit  higher now rather than waiting, because we could suddenly get a boost up of  wage or inflation pressures, because the unemployment rate is quite low.   It's better to be I had been behind.  </p><p>QUEST:  The fifth rate rise since the whole tightening cycle began, this is  the stewardship of the Fed under Janet Yellen.  This was her last rate- setting meeting in that sense, and her last press conference.  How do you  grade her?  </p><p>KROSZNER:  I give her very high grades.  I think the U.S. economy has  created a lot of jobs over the last four years that she has been in.  I  think the growth rate has started to move up from 2 percent to now close to  3 percent over the last few quarters.  I don't think there have been any  disasters that have occurred.  The discussion of the winding down of the  portfolio has gone very smoothly.  </p><p>[16:05:00] And as exciting as watching paint dry, as she had said.  That  didn't happen in 2013, when we had the taper tantrum.  So, a lot of  difficult things I think she has handled quite well.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  On the core question though of the future direction of  monetary policy next year, the dot plot -- well, if we look at their  forecast -- FMC's forecast on unemployment it goes even lower.  Down into  the 3.  something percent.  Growth remains around about 3.2 to 3 percent.   Three rate rises next year.  Do you go along with that too?  </p><p>KROSZNER:  I think that's where we'll have to see how inflation is  evolving.  Because if inflation starts to move down, then I would be a  little bit more wary of doing that.  If inflation at least stays in the 1.5  to 2 percent area, I think, you know, a few more rate rises might be  justified.  But we're really going to have to see what those inflation  dynamics are, because they're quite different than what they traditionally  have been.  </p><p>QUEST:  Randall, good to see you, sir.  May I wish you and your family a  very happy holiday season, sir.  We're always grateful that you come on  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, thank you.  </p><p>Now we're going to head over to the trading post to talk about how the  market has moved today.  On the way, we see -- hey.  What are you doing  here?  You're going to help us understand, Teddy Weisberg.  </p><p>TED WEISBERG, PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES:  Well, of course.  </p><p>QUEST:  You make your way over there, while I update on the market.  Teddy  Weisberg will be with us in just a moment.  Record high on the Dow.  S&amp;P  off.  So, no records there.  Nasdaq up there.  I think we have to say,  there's two up, one down.  It's a green day on the market, thank you.  And  let's just update -- there we go.  So, we have a record on the Dow, which  proves 68, 60 and 70 so far for the markets.  The issue, of course, is what  was driving this.  And no, we still remain 20, 25 and 10 over on the  European boards.  But this is what we're talking about with Ted Weisberg,  who hopefully is now comfortable.  OK.  Today was an interesting session,  wasn't it?  Green for the markets, because the Dow and the Nasdaq are up.   What was the driving force?  </p><p>WEISBERG:  I think earlier in the day, it was there was a headline news  that both the Senate and the House had come to an agreement on the tax  bill.  So, we saw the market pop.  The market was up all day, but popped at  150.  And then once again, as you get into the weeds a little bit, you  know, we gave back -- </p><p>QUEST:  Why can't it hold on.  What happens during the latter part of the  day, particularly at the close, that means those early gains evaporate.  </p><p>WEISBERG:  Listen, we have a lot of cross currents, a lot of traders.  You  know, it just could be people lightning up.  You know, everyday there's a  new news cycle.  So, there's a reluctance on the part of traders, really  true traders to go home long anything.  </p><p>QUEST:  Ted, I need you to pause for a second.  Let's just have a look and  see.  Doug Jones is going to talk now.  He's listening.  We need to listen  in.  </p><p>DOUG JONES, ALABAMA SENATOR ELECT:  -- little bit of an orderly process.   Because I really want to get to as much as we can.  Let me just start out  by saying how thrilled that my family and I are for this win last night.   It has been a fun campaign, despite what people say and despite all of the  things that get thrown at you.  It was nothing that we didn't fully expect.  </p><p>Most important thing we've had an opportunity to travel around the state,  talking to so many people from so many walks of life.  Listening to their  cares, their concerns, their joys, their happiness.  And that's been so  gratifying.  And it is especially gratifying to know that in this day and  age, here in the state of Alabama, that a message of inclusiveness, a  message of equality, a message of dignity and respect, and importantly,  messages of issues that really are at the end of the day, those issues that  people care about.  The kitchen table issues that we have talked about,  that you guys have heard me preach about over and over.  It has been and  amazing night for us.  It has been an amazing day today.  I have received  calls from so many well-wishers, of friends and family.  But also, future  colleagues in Washington on both sides of the aisle.  I have received calls  from Democratic Senators.  I've received calls from my long-time friend -- </p><p>QUEST:  A bit of Doug Jones.  We are listening in for when he says  something that's, you know -- is significant in terms of the future of the  way he will be in the Senate.  Dan Merica is at the White House.  The  reverberations at the White House as a result of this.  Donald Trump's --  Donald Trump's tweet basically saying, I always knew that Moore was going  to lose.  Sounds like sour grapes.  </p><p>[16:10:00] DAN MERICA, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER:  Yes, it is sour grapes,  frankly.  I mean, there's no doubt that President Trump was fully behind  Roy Moore.  And this changes the calculation here at the White House.  I  mean, there's the practical matter.  Frankly, the Senate now has one less  Republican and one more Democrat, which really would imperil aspects of the  Trump agenda.  There are things that have happened in the last ten months  that wouldn't have happened with that kind of margin.  It also puts a lot  of power back into the hands of more moderate Republican Senators, Susan  Collins, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, those who have spoken out against the  president over the last few months.  </p><p>It also drives a division in the Republican Party, as well.  I mean, there  are many Republicans who are blaming Steve Bannon for this.  There are some  who are blaming Mitch McConnell.  You know, the blame game is alive and  well here in Washington, including here at the White House.  I don't think  Republicans have fully figured out how to blame for that loss.  But this  will cause, you know, kind of a moment of reckoning for many to figure out  what went wrong.  Was it just a candidate who had his own issues, or is  this a broader problem they'll have to confront in 2018?  </p><p>QUEST:  Just how difficult is it going to be with 51-49?  You talk about  the likes of Susan Collins and there's the moderates.  But at the end of  the day, if they scupper their own president or the president from their  own party, don't they de facto shoot themselves in the foot?  </p><p>MERICA:  I mean, you have to remember, some of these Senators who you're  mentioning are not running for re-election, namely Jeff Flake and Bob  Corker.  So they're, you know, unencumbered in many ways from President who  leads their party.  So, there are many members who certainly feel tied to  this president, because they will remain in office.  But many don't.  And  that is going to be a problem this White House is going to have to  confront.  You have seen the president take to Twitter, use events to  really go after Senators who have spoken out against him.  Said things  that, you know, somewhat would be seen as slights towards him.  He may not  be able to do that as freely if this -- this margin is less, because he's  going to need those Senators to pass things.  </p><p>As you see with this tax bill, they want to get this done before Doug Jones  is seated.  Now, president Trump said today that has nothing to do with the  loss in Alabama.  But if Doug Jones does get seated, and this moves past  this Christmas holiday, that is a very, very tricky predicament that the  White House has to confront.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, Dan.  </p><p>Donald Trump says passage of tax reform is only days away even after his  party suffered, what Dan was telling us about, the damaging defeat.  The  president has just finished what was billed as a final pitch on his tax  plan.  A package which is now all but agreed.  Speaking a few moments ago,  he said the bill could take effect within weeks.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If congress sends me a bill  before Christmas, the IRS -- this is just out.  This is breaking news.  Has  just confirmed that Americans will see lower taxes and bigger paychecks  beginning in February.  Just two short months from now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Republican aides tell CNN, they want to wrap-up the tax vote even  quicker after the Alabama result, of course, they don't want to wait until  Doug Jones gets seated.  The whole thing could be done by this time next  week.  Long before Jones gets anywhere near Washington.  The final plan  agreed in principle to be unveiled on Friday.  And then, as you move on,  you've got the final votes, the House will vote on Tuesday.  And then, of  course, you've got the Senate that votes, and Donald Trump, the president,  would sign it on Wednesday.  </p><p>Now, some top Senators from the Democratic Party want to delay until Doug  Jones gets seated.  Chuck Schumer says it's the right thing to do.  Stephen  Moore helped draft Donald Trump's tax plan during the presidential  campaign.  Good to see you, Stephen.  </p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, CNN ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Hi, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  I can answer my own question here, or maybe you'll do it for me.  I  guess you don't think they should wait until Doug Jones gets seated in  January.  Do you think it's the right thing to go ahead now?  </p><p>MOORE:  Yes, you do it while you've got the votes.  That's the way politics  works.  And, look, I think they've got 51 votes.  I think they're going to  probably lose Senator Corker.  But they have -- it's a very slim majority.   Shame, by the way, Democrats, not a single Democrat will vote for this.   Just one slight correction on something you said.  I got some intelligence  today, Richard, that this is kind of unusual, but that the Senate will  actually vote before the House.  Usually, the House goes first and then the  Senate.  They want to have the Senate go first so the House can basically  know that it's done if they get it passed.  </p><p>[16:15:03] And you're right, the vote is scheduled for Tuesday.  And then  Wednesday or Thursday, you can have a presidential signing.  But I  guarantee you, they're not going to wait until the beginning of the year  when the new senator is sworn in.  </p><p>QUEST:  If it's gone through reconciliation and both sides are agreed in  reconciliation, I mean, it would be somewhat extraordinary to then lose it  in the full vote.  </p><p>MOORE:  It would be.  But, you know, I have seen -- I'm a sports fan.  I've  seen teams blow leads in the fourth quarter of the game.  So, you know, it  looks like they are in very good shape right now.  I would put pretty heavy  money on the fact they're going to pass this.  But, you know, I'll believe  it when I see it.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, what you understand is the difference.  Now a slight raise of 1  percent in the corporate tax.  </p><p>MOORE:  Corporate rate, yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  And a reduction in the top level of income tax, 39.6 down to 37  percent.  Why do you need to give the wealthy more?  </p><p>MOORE:  Because what we wanted to do, and as you know, I've been involved  with this for two years with Donald Trump, is get small businesses a tax  cut.  It turns out, about two-thirds of small businesses, the ones that are  really successful, are the ones that are people in that highest income tax  bracket.  So that is a tax cut that's really meant to grow small  businesses.  We get, Richard, about 60 percent of our jobs in this country  from small businesses.  So, people are -- and by the way, one other quick  thing.  This bill gets rid of something state and local tax deduction.  And  that's affecting very high-income people and very high-income states like  New York and California.  So, one of the tradeoffs was, we'll get rid of  the state and local tax deduction, but we'll reimburse people by cutting  that rate a little bit, so they don't get too clobbered.  </p><p>QUEST:  You mean those of us like -- that live in New York, just to rub  salt into the wound a little bit there.  </p><p>MOORE:  There you go.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  Let's move forward.  Let's assume this is done, deal -- it is  a victory.  No question about it for the president, to have got this  through in record time.  What's the next economic fight that you see on the  horizon?  </p><p>MOORE:  Well, by the way, again, I'm not sure I would say this was done in  record time, because it took a good year.  And Ronald Reagan passed a tax  cut in eight months.  So, I actually think it took too long.  But anyway,  what's the effect of this bill?  I think it's going to be very positive for  the economy.  We've gotten some good news on the economy here just in the  last couple weeks.  I just heard you talking about the stock market.  I  mean, there's no doubt investors love this tax cut.  Businesses love it.   They're anticipating the positive effects of this.  We have about 3 to 3.5  percent growth right now in the economy.  I'm going to predict on your show  that we get in the first six months of next year when this tax cut hits,  you know potentially 4 percent growth.  We haven't had that, you know, in  15 years in this country.  So, I'm expecting some big boosts in the economy  starting in January.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, you're asking us to believe a prediction from a man wearing  Santa's on his tie.  Is that the gist of it?  </p><p>MOORE:  I'm surprised you can see those.  But yes, I am asking you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good.  </p><p>MOORE:  And, look, I want to be on your show in February and March of 2018  and will see whether I'm right.  But you've got to admit, Richard, that the  market really loves this tax cut.  Another 150 points today on the Dow.  </p><p>QUEST:  Either in D.C.  or in New York, one of us is buying dinner.  All  right?  </p><p>MOORE:  You got it, my friend.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>MOORE:  OK.  </p><p>QUEST:  As we continue tonight, it's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, live from the  world's financial capital.  The Apple boost shares Finisar, up 23 percent.   Apple's investment we're going to explain in this hour.  And, of course,  the Brexit battle, part two.  Theresa May's long, dark night of the soul.   A government loses a key Brexit bill vote.  Will be in London after the  Break.  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tough night for Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, who's been  humiliated by her own party.  Her MPs and others voted to guarantee a  meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.  It's all about the ability of  Parliament to actually change the Brexit deal.  They tied Theresa May's  hands.  Bianca Nobilo in London, tell me more.  </p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN WESTMINSTER:  Tied her hands, Richard.  It means that  the government can no longer tinker with beginning to withdraw the U.K.  from the EU without getting parliament's approval first.  It just means  that this process has got a whole lot more difficult for the government.   They've said that they're disappointed by this result, given the strong  assurances they said they gave.  But it's going to make the next few months  even harder for the Prime Minister, and she's got one more vote left on  this bill and that's not looking good either.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  So why?  What was the fear?  Was it that through the  back door, they were going to start to implement Brexit before Parliament  had voted?  </p><p>NOBILO:  That was the concern.  Because they could in theory have done that  with the previous wording of the bill.  Brexit, in its entirety, was about  taking back control.  Parliament was arguing, yes, the British people  wanted to take back control.  But give it back to the British Parliament,  not to the prime minister, and to the government.  So, while it was a  defeat for Theresa May, it was a real victory for democracy and for the  Parliament this evening.  </p><p>QUEST:  Why would her own party want to do her in, in such a way?  </p><p>NOBILO:  According to them, that was not their intention.  This is because  they believe it's Parliament's job to ensure that powers don't get moved  away from the House of Commons and to retain them.  The lead rebel that  tabled this amendment was a former attorney general and Tory MP, Dominic  Grieve.  He made the case strongly today when he spoke.  He said this is  not about sabotage.  This is about trying to improve the legislation.  Of  course, Labour MPs, who supported this amendment, probably had ulterior  political motives, and indeed there were huge cheers and jeers from the  opposition benches.  Jeremy Corbyn got in there straightaway, saying this  is a humiliating defeat for the Prime Minister.  So, it's unfortunate.   There are two reasons why people supported this.  Some political and others  because they truly believe that it would be corrosive to democracy not to.  </p><p>QUEST:  Bianca Nobilo in London, thank you.  </p><p>A short time ago, I spoke Guy Verhofstadt, on \"QUEST EXPRESS.\"  He's the  Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament.  He's angry over what he  sees as a fudging of the agreement last Friday.  I asked if he was getting  reassurance from the British government.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUY VERHOFSTADT, BREXIT COORDINATOR, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Yes, I got a  phone conversation by Mr. Davis David, the Brexit negotiator.  And we said,  Yes, Yes, this statement of intent, the words that were used that were not  appropriate, in fact we stick to our commitments, not only I will stick to  the commitments we have made in this arrangement, but also the whole U.K.  government.  So, we were reassured.  So, the best way to be reassured,  Richard, is that all the commitments that have been taken in this agreement  are now translated into legal text of a withdrawal agreement.  So, what we  expect is that in the coming weeks, after the break, that there will be a  withdrawal agreement on the table in which all the commitments are  translated that have been taken by the U.K. side and by the EU side in this  agreement.  </p><p>QUEST:  If you accept the principle, as everybody does, that nothing is  agreed until everything is agreed, then all the commitments that were made  on Friday are, by definition, going to be circumspect to that which comes  next.  In other words, the trade negotiations.  </p><p>VERHOFSTADT:  No, that's not the way it works.  Because in the treaties of  the European Union, it's very clearly stated that the first thing to do  before you can talk about the future arrangements is that you have an  agreement on the withdrawal.  </p><p>[16:25:03] And an agreement of the withdrawal means three things.  First of  all a financial settlement.  Secondly, clarity on the border issue between  Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and three, the citizens Right.   And for us, for the Parliament, this is very important that these rights of  the EU citizens are guaranteed in the future.  And when you have an  agreement on this, you can go into the next phase of the negotiations.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  Janet Yellen has called bitcoin highly speculative.  But said a  crash, while it would hurt some investors, does not provide for systemic  economic risk.  Potential for chaos though is plain as Bitcoin booms, major  exchanges have suffered embarrassing outages, and some have suffered  setbacks.  On Tuesday, bitcoin exchanged Bitfinex and Coinbase both  reported problems with service.  Last week, more than $70 million were  stolen from NiceHash.  Bitfinex sufferer a similar hack last year.  It's a  matter of time, perhaps, before a collapse, as we've see Mt. Gox which fell  into bankruptcy after 460 million was stolen.  Paul Vinay is a Wall Street  Journal reporter.  Author of \"The Age of the Cryptocurrency.\"  He joins me  now.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>PAUL VIGRA, REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  How are you doing?</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Thank you for having me on.  </p><p>QUEST:  She's right, isn't she, Janet Yellen, highly speculative.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Yes, that's putting it light.  She's right about two things.  Yes,  it is highly speculative.  And if it did crash, it really would not affect  the wider economy.  I think the thing to keep in mind with bitcoin, there  is a lot of hype right now, a lot of mania, a lot of people want to get in.   But this is still a pretty small market.  Pretty disconnected from the  wider economy.  </p><p>QUEST:  She sort of said, this isn't legal tender.  It's not a --  basically, it's not a safe way to proceed.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Well, it's not legal tender in that the U.S. government has not  recognized it as such.  Whether or not that makes it safe or not isn't  really the case.  But the issue of safety is a legitimate one.  It's just  not a matter of because it's legal or not legal.  </p><p>QUEST:  There were two areas -- I've been reading the fascinating work  you've done.  There were two areas I want to talk about this safety.</p><p>VIGRA:  Sure.  </p><p>QUEST:  The first is whether it goes up or down in price.  The markets will  regulate that.  The second is these two keys that you have, the public and  the private.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Right.  </p><p>QUEST:  Who looks after your bitcoin wallet?  If my bitcoin wallet is on my  computer and the hard drive goes caput, what happens?  </p><p>VIGRA:  You are out of luck.  So, this is the thing.  In a real nutshell,  this is the thing about bitcoin that makes it interesting.  The idea is you  could have this currency that is not regulated by any one central party.   The way they do that is by having transactions on an open ledger that  cannot be changed.  Can't ever be altered.  So, the key thing is that once  a bitcoin transaction is confirmed it's confirmed for all-time.  As opposed  to, say, if you're -- if JPMorgan gets hacked, your bank account gets  hacked, your credit card get hacked, those charges can be reversed.   Bitcoin is different.  </p><p>QUEST:  But what do you do if you lose the key?  </p><p>VIGRA:  You are out of luck.  And this is what I'm talking about.  So, the  difference is, in the real-world transactions can be reversed.  So,  security is important, but you know there is somebody behind you that can  probably make you whole.  In bitcoin you can't be made whole.</p><p>QUEST:  OK.  </p><p>VIGRA:  So, what happens is, you have a wallet, which is really just an  online account.  There are two points of access to that online account.   These are the keys you're talking about.  There are two ways to move money  in and out of that.  One is the public key.  That is an address, it's like  an e-mail address.  Anybody can see it.  Anybody can use it.  I could use  it, I could use your public key for me to send bitcoin to your wallet.  The  other is the private key.  You're the only one -- or you should be,  Richard, the only one who has access to the private key.  That's your way  to unlock your account.  </p><p>QUEST:  But as we move to a situation where more ordinary investors want to  be at bitcoin, then the risk moves slightly, not just from my computer, but  I now contract with bitcoin exchange.  And you look after them.  And now my  risk is, are you good, are you secure, are you solid.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Right.  And that's the risk with any third party when you request  or rewrite.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>VIGRA:  Again, the difference is if -- and you talked about Mt. Gox, which  was an early bitcoin exchange.  It was very poorly constructed.  A lot of  money was tied up there.  A lot of money disappeared.  There was no real  recourse.  That money was gone.  That is a risk when you're going to have  your money with any third party.  That's why a lot of bitcoiners, they  don't want their money with any third party.  That's why they have the  wallet in the first place.  But the difference is, then the security is on  you.  And even sophisticated people who understand how these things can  work can lose access to their private key, they can lose access to their  wallet.  They can lose their bitcoins.  It's not for everybody.  </p><p>QUEST:  I'm having -- good to see you, sir.  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>Republican control of the Senate is shrinking.  A real threat to the Trump  agenda.  A major voice from the Obama White House will be with us after the  break.  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment of course.  Apple invests in America $390 million.  Brings an  old factory back to life in Texas.  We'll talk about that.  And a first  look at \"The Last Jedi.\"  Fans line up for midnight screenings.  As we  continue, this is CNN.  And on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>President Trump's made his final pitch on tax reform amid words, House,  Senate and negotiators reached a tentative deal on a tax bill.  Just last  hour, Mr. Trump said he believes we are days away from seeing lawmakers  pass that bill.  </p><p>Fresh off his stunning win in the Alabama senate race, the Democrat, Doug  Jones, is speaking at a press conference.  He said he's received numerous  calls, including one from president Trump.  And from Democratic and  Republican colleagues.  He said he has not spoken to his Republican  opponent, Roy Moore.  </p><p>The White House now says an aide to Mr. Trump plans to leave the White  House next month.  Her resignation follows news that the president s deputy  national security adviser is also to leave.  </p><p>South African President, Jacob Zuma being ordered to launch an  investigation into himself.  The South African Supreme Court is forcing Mr.  Zuma to set up an official inquiry into allegations of corruption an  influence peddling.  He has 30 days to appoint the investigators.  </p><p>One of the world's top cyclists has failed a drug test that threatens his  victory in one of the most prestigious events.  Chris Froome says he has a  good excuse.  He's accused of exceeding the maximum allowable dosage of an  anti-asthma drug during the Vuelta a Espana in September.  He says he takes  the drug, not surprisingly, to treat his asthma and it had a particularly  violent attack.</p><p>A short time ago, President Trump said tax reform passage was just days  away.  But the loss of his senate seat, his legislative agenda is at risk.   And you'll see what I mean if you take a look here at what's happening.   These are the promises that Donald Trump said he was going to do.  You can  see how he has managed to do this.  President Trump's promises.  He was  going to halt the Muslim entry.  That's on hold although it is moving  forward.  </p><p>[16:35:00] He's going to renegotiate NAFTA.  These -- the withdrawal from  TPP, labelled China a currency manipulator is not there.  Repeal Obamacare  has not been done and defeat ISIS.  Well, we can argue about that, bearing  in mind what happened in Iraq over the last few days.  Jim Messina is a  former White House deputy chief of staff, responsible for setting  priorities with Congress.  He's also Barack Obama's campaign manager and  the Messina Group.  And good to see you.  </p><p>JIM MESSINA, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF:  Good to see you  too.  How are you?  </p><p>QUEST:  I'm very well, sir.  Very well.  Now, when you look -- when you  look at what has happened in this -- in Alabama, how -- where do you give  the credit?  </p><p>MESSINA:  Well, it gets probably the most stunning political upset of the  last decade, right?  Alabama is the second-most conservative state and  country.  Democrats hadn't won a senate seat there in 25 years.  And I  think you have to give a credit to three people.  One, the candidate,  Jones, who Doug Jones, who ran a great campaign.  Two, Roy Moore, who is  the worst nominee of any major political party of my lifetime.  And then  Donald Trump, who, you know, today a poll came out, he's at 32 percent  approval rating, which is the lowest of any president since Nixon.  </p><p>QUEST:  So how does -- forgive me.  How does the Democrats capitalize on  their strengthened position in the Senate in the New Year without being  seen as obstructionist, so that they lose the support of the public who  basically says a plague on everyone?  </p><p>MESSINA:  Right.  You're exactly right.  The worst thing the Democratic  Party could do is just say we're not going to do anything.  What we need to  do is come together with a very clear vision about an economic future for  this country.  And hold to it.  And you have seen Democratic Party numbers  rise during the tax debate, because Democrats have been very clear what  they're for, and what they're not for.  And I think this tax debate gives  us a crystal-clear ability to do that, and next year, you know, the one  place we do agree with president Trump is infrastructure reform, and  funding more of those programs.  And I think that's a place where we can  move forward and get something done for the country.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do the Democrats keep Alabama in 2020?  </p><p>MESSINA:  Well, that's a long way between now and then.  What is true is  that Doug Jones is the only southern Democrat in the Senate if you take out  Florida.  But he also showed a way to win last night.  He won a race that,  you know, as he said, about half an hour ago, he didn't even think he was  going to win last night.  And he did.  And so, there is a -- a plan for  that.  You know, I was privileged to run President Obama's campaign, and  people looked at that plan and started running campaigns like that.  So, I  think we all need to shut up and go down to Alabama and learn a couple  things from Doug Jones.  </p><p>QUEST:  The \"USA Today\" editorial that was published, describing President  Trump as uniquely awful, and not fit to clean the toilets of President  Obama's presidential library.  What significance do you get, or do you give  to such vitriol?  </p><p>MESSINA:  Look, it's unprecedented in my lifetime.  I've been involved, as  you know, in world politics for 25 years.  I've never seen anything like  that editorial.  But the truth is, you know, I've worked hard for 20 years  in the United States Senate before I went to the White House on both sides  of the aisle, trying to get things done.  And let's just be really clear  about it.  We have never had anyone this bad as President of the United  States.  And you showed it.  I thought you had the most interesting graph  I've seen recently.  He hasn't gotten anything done.  We're one year into  it, in a country that desperately needs some leadership and we have done  nothing.  It's not me saying that as a Democrat.  </p><p>QUEST:  I've got to correct you here.  You withdrew from TPP.  You  restarted oil pipelines, and the tax thing is just about done.  </p><p>MESSINA:  Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.  It's not done yet.  And  TPP was a disaster to get out, and our economy is going to feel that for  the next 10 years.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, Jim.  Please come up to New York.  Come and join  us on the set.  </p><p>MESSINA:  Any time, thanks.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>We continue tonight, President Trump wanted Apple to create jobs in the  U.S. and now it has.  We'll show you where and how after the break.</p><p>[16:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  A very busy day as you can tell.  Much enjoyment of the day.  But  we must have time for business on the move.  Abu Dhabi has seen its largest  IPO in a decade.  It's all to do with Adnoc, the retail distribution arm.   The IPO, you can see the closing price and the IPO price.  There again it  values the company $851 million at 8.5 in total.  </p><p>Target's buying same-day delivery service company Shipt for the price of  $550 million.  That is where Target will be delivering to 72 cities and  plans to expand.  It is competing, of course, with Amazon, and Fresh and  Google.  Amazon delivers in those parts of the country.  Apple -- the  Apple, who does this belong to?  Apple's investing $390 million to a U.S.  chipmaker Finisar.  Produces laser chips that power face IDs and indeed  these AirPods, however these are.  Maybe they won't miss them if they come  over here.  That's business on the move.  </p><p>Gene Munster is the expert on all things Apple.  Managing partner at Loup  Ventures joins me now.  Why does Apple want this company and invest in it  and why not just buy them?  </p><p>GENE MUNSTER, MANAGING PARTNER, LOUP VENTURES:  Because they can get  exactly what they want without spending more money.  So, they put $350  million in, and this gives them a pull position, which this is the most  important part here, in terms of the future of phones.  What we use phones  for are going to change, augmented reality is going to become a bigger part  of that.  But to answer your questions, they could achieve this opportunity  around gather and company without buying the whole company.  And also, an  important point is they can keep other suppliers in the game, because they  need other people like Lumentum to be building those components to fulfill  all their demands.  So, they accomplish two things.  </p><p>QUEST:  What does Finisar do that's worth $1 billion over time?  </p><p>MUNSTER:  What they do is they map the world extremely well, the real  world.  And so, when you think about augmented reality, in order for our  phones and eventually some form of glasses to be able to superimpose these  images on the real world, think of Pokemon, or Snapchat with images on our  face.  In order to do that, you need to do 3D mapping and that's what they  do.  They have a laser that maps the environment around you.  </p><p>QUEST:  When Apple has withdrawn support from a supplier in the past, the  supplier has collapsed.  I'm thinking of the English company, the British  company, which was a major supplier until Apple pulled out.  If I was  Finisar, might have a worry that at some point in the future might decide,  not today?  </p><p>MUNSTER:  Well, you would have a little bit of worry, because they have  done that.  If a supplier that they have invested in doesn't deliver on  what they say they're going to do, Apple will pull the plug.  And they have  let companies go bankrupt to do that.  But I would rather be in that  position than be a competitor that is trying to win the business or  currently has the business.  That would happen more frequently, as someone  is a supplier to Apple, and Apple just decides to go away.  </p><p>[16:45:02] And so, it is a ruthless customer, Apple is.  Obviously, it's a  huge opportunity for these suppliers.  But I would rather be the company  that has the investment then one that doesn't have the investment.  </p><p>QUEST:  As we have seen in recent days with other investments, Apple is  almost parsimonious when it comes to making their investments.  They -- I  mean, it's the opposite of Facebook in terms of getting out the checkbook  and writing a very large check.  They make sure they pay not a penny more  and not a penny less.  </p><p>MUNSTER:  Yes, that's exactly right.  I mean, you look at this -- last  week, they did Shazam for $450 million, at one-point value $1 billion.  But  that's exactly right.  They do not do multibillion, $20 billion  acquisitions.  WhatsApp from Facebook like you re mentioning.  And I don't  think you're going to see anything change.  And we've studied this over the  last 15 years, and the reality is Apple buys technology.  They don't buy  brands.  And most other big tech companies buy brands.  And Apple loves  their brand, and they're not going to buy someone else's brand.  </p><p>QUEST:  Gene, thank you helping us understand what this is about.  </p><p>MUNSTER:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Really appreciate it.  </p><p>Red, white and blue.  Not the typical options for wine.  It's the latest in  our trader series.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  The British wine importer, the wine  drinker, has a new offering for its client, the Olive Tree.  Its drink is  an unusual hue.  Diners will get to try a wine that's blue.  It was first  developed in 2014 by a handful of tech entrepreneurs in Spain who wanted to  shake things up in the countries traditional wine industry.  </p><p>TAIG MACCARTHY, CO-FOUNDER, GIK:  The wine in Spain is full of rules.  We  didn't really resonate with that.  So, we wanted to offer something to the  new generation of wine drinkers.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What started as a team of five young entrepreneurs  running the startup company called Gik has now grown to 14 employees.  Gik  blends red and white grapes sourced from nearby vineyards to craft the blue  wine.  </p><p>MACARTHY:  We had to choose the right grapes.  And to do this, it's very  important for us to work with the experts in the wineries.  This is how we  personally mix the pigment.  That comes from the skin of the red grapes  into the wine.  And in the second stage, once it's in the stainless tanks  we add once again the same pigment.  And this is how we make this neon blue  wine.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The tradenomics of the global wine market flowed to  almost $300 billion in 2016.  Five countries savor almost half of all the  world's wine.  Europe dominates wine production.  Vineyard's cover more of  Spain's landscape than any other nation.  But this delicate crop is  vulnerable to weather conditions.  Recent frosts and droughts have taken a  toll on grape harvests.  Three billion fewer bottles of wine were produced  in 2017 worldwide, increasing the cost of draining a glass.  </p><p>MACARTHY:  We really are at the risk of losing grapes because of the  climate changes.  We had a really rough winter.  So, it made an impact on  the amount of grapes we actually produced.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But Gik is still finding success.  Since launching, the  company's revenue is 2 million euros and it's now selling to 31 countries.  </p><p>MACARTHY:  It made a lot of sense to us to just export.  To countries from  the U.S. to Japan, where they're more open to wine innovation.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The internet has also helped the company take off with  a bright blue Spanish wine.  </p><p>MACARTHY:  We have wine e-commerce for each country in which we sell.  And  they're really key.  It has allowed us to reach the amount of customers  that otherwise wouldn't be possible to reach.  A new way of connecting with  customers, a new way of discovery and a new way of working.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  It's like Christmas, Halloween New Year's Eve, all at the same  time.  That's if you're a \"Star Wars\" geek.  The new film is out tomorrow.   A couple hours from now, some fans are too excited to sleep.  So, they're  going to sit in the middle of the night.  </p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Old friends, new faces and cute critters.  That's how the \"New York  Times\" described \"The Last Jedi,\" which opens on Thursday.  Fans in London  are about to see the very first public screenings.  There have been  premiers.  Anna Stewart's is in Leicester Square where a showtime is about  two hours away.  Good to see you.  Cold night in London.  Anna, who will be  at this first screening?  How difficult was it to get a ticket?  </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN PRODUCER:  Pretty darn difficult, Richard.  There are  1,100 people descending on this cinema to watch the first screening at  midnight.  And we've seen quite a few of them.  Lots of Jedi have turned  out.  We've just had a massive downpour here in London.  So, they have all  gone under cover.  But if that appetite is anything to go by, this movie is  going to do very well at the box office.  But the big question is, can it  do as well as the last movie in the saga, which was \"The Force Awakens, \"  which was something of a record-breaker.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB IGER, CEO, WALT DISNEY COMPANY:  We think the way we're releasing them  is the right way.  So that the trilogy in this case is every other year,  and we filled in the middle with something that is not part of the trilogy.   So, we don't think we're overdoing it at all.  You know, there's so much  interest in \"Star Wars,\" as you know, witness tonight.  And as long as  you're in business with great directors, great writers, good story-tellers,  then I think the audience can't get enough of it.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can I ask you, what's the latest on the Fox take over?</p><p>IGER:  I'm here for \"Star Wars.\"  I'm not going to say anything about that.   Thank you.  Sorry.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART:  So, there you have it from Bob Iger, the Disney CEO.  Now he  doesn't think there will be any franchise fatigue here in this movie  release.  But that is the worry in the industry.  Because if you think  about it, \"The Force Awakens,\" which had the highest grossing opening  weekend ever, was the first \"Star Wars\" movie after a ten-year gap.  This,  Richard, is the third \"Star Wars\" movie after three years.  So, there is a  bit of concern there.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK.  I mean, I've enjoyed \"Star Wars.\"  I can't say I particularly  could quote from it, unlike some of my colleagues in the studio.  From what  you've heard, from those who have seen, does it hit the grade?  </p><p>STEWART:  The reviews have been pretty kind to this movie, Richard.  So, I  would say probably yes.  But I haven't yet seen it myself.  It's got lots  of the old characters.  We have Luke Skywalker.  We have Princess Leia or  General Leia as she is in this movie.  And we also have some new creatures.   We have the Poe, which in one review described it as something between a  puffin and Justin Bieber.  So, if that doesn't make you want to see it, I  don't know what will.  </p><p>QUEST:  Final question.  It is coming up to 10 o'clock in London.  Have you  got a ticket?  Are you going in to watch it?  </p><p>STEWART:  You're keeping me too busy, Richard.  I would love to be in  there.  But I'm also a little late on the ticket sales, I fear.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  Anna Stewart, proving that duty comes first in Lester  Square.  Thank you very much, indeed.  Cold night in London.  </p><p>Final check of the markets.  Dow Jones, it was a record.  The Nasdaq and  the Dow ended high.  The S&amp;P was off just a tad.  The Dow is up 80 points.   Again, a third of 1 percent.  The S&amp;P was only lower.  Consumer and  industrials were the biggest gainers overall.  </p><p>You can download our show as a podcast.  </p><p>[16:55:00] It's available from all the main providers.  And you can also  listen to it at CNN.com/podcast.  And also, you can always, of course, e- mail me or tweet me as usual.  Will have a Profitable Moment after the  break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  You can see what a busy, complicated  world it is at the moment.  You have Donald Trump with tax.  You have the  markets at record highs.  You have change at the Fed with Janet Yellen,  talking about bitcoin and saying it's highly speculative.  And then at the  last minute, you have Theresa May losing a crucial vote before Parliament,  which basically will tie her hands in terms of the negotiations.   Fascinating undercurrents in the global economy.  And throughout all of  this, the stock market just keeps rising.  </p><p>Which gave rise to a question from one of my colleagues that if, for  instance, the tax plan failed would the stock market, or would it hit the  economy?  The answer is yes.  If there is more dislocation on Brexit, would  that hit the U.K. economy in the UK stock market?  Yes.  If there are  further problems with world trade as the WTO is talking about now.  Does  that hit global growth?  The answer is yes.  My point is simple.  There are  many pitfalls out careful.  Of which we need to be careful.  And what we've  seen tonight in this program, we just laid them out all for you.  But don't  worry.  It's nearly Christmas and the new year.  And that's QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in New York.  Whatever you're up  to in the hours ahead I hope it's profitable.  Will do it again tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

The S&amp;P is hovering between a record and not. The Nasdaq is up, but not at a record. It's been a very busy day, as you'll hear over the next hour. And -- oh. Oh, that's what you call a determined gavel. Trading is over. It's Wednesday, it's December the 13th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a last hurrah for Janet Yellen. The outgoing Fed chair raises rates one more time before she's gone. A setback for the Trump agenda. Roy Moore defeated in Alabama adds urgency to the push on taxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a humiliating defeat in Parliament for Theresa May. Members of her own party tie her hands, on Brexit.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest. We're live in the world's financial capital, New York. Where I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. In the past two hours, two pivotal moments in Washington for the U.S. economy. You're going to hear about them both in detail and with analysis on this program. At one end of the mile, the federal reserve announced it was raising interest rates. And moments later at the White House, President Trump, at the other side of the mile, vowed to deliver on the tax plan now agreed by Republicans, despite a humiliating setback in Alabama. We'll talk about that during the course of the show, as well.</p><p>And the markets where at record high. We've a high on the Dow, not on the S&amp;P or the Nasdaq. And an economy near full employment, more stimulus coming down the Washington pipeline from the tax cuts and other policies. And so, the Fed has raised rates. It's the third time the Fed's moved this year, and it's widely expected, although two board members did vote to keep rates on hold. That's what you see the target rate of the Fed. They have a lower in an upper band. 1.25 to 1.5. We tend to talk about the benchmark rate now standing at the upper end at 1.5 percent, although the Feds hope the market committee attempts to keep it within that bound. According to the so-called dot plot, most of the Fed is expecting three rate rises next year. In her final news conference as Fed chair, Yellen said, there's not a great deal to be worried about with the U.S. economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: You know, I can always give you a list of, you know, potential troubles, international developments, that could result in down side economic risk. But, look, at the moment, the U.S. economy is performing well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Randall Kroszner, former Fed governor, is with me. Good to see you. Are you a hawk or a dove? Was this rate rise justified? Two members of the FOMC thought it was not.</p><p>RANDALL KROSZNER, FORMER GOVERNOR, FEDERAL RESERVE: Yes, the presence of the Chicago and Minneapolis Fed, I call them the Midwest doves I guess I'm more of a Chicago hawk and I think it was reasonable to raise rates now, because the economy is doing quite well, as Janet Yellen had said. It's likely to continue to do well at least for the next year. And although inflation is not reaching the 2 percent target, I think it's much better for the Fed to be ahead of the curve than behind it.</p><p>QUEST: OK. Ahead of the curve, though. But as long as I can recall, the Fed's statements have talked about the medium term returning to the 2 percent inflation target. They just never get there.</p><p>KROSZNER: It has been a long time since we've been there. And that's one of the reasons why inflation expectations are so much lower than they had been from before. But the economy overall is doing quite well. And so, I think buying a little bit of insurance through having rates a little bit higher now rather than waiting, because we could suddenly get a boost up of wage or inflation pressures, because the unemployment rate is quite low. It's better to be I had been behind.</p><p>QUEST: The fifth rate rise since the whole tightening cycle began, this is the stewardship of the Fed under Janet Yellen. This was her last rate- setting meeting in that sense, and her last press conference. How do you grade her?</p><p>KROSZNER: I give her very high grades. I think the U.S. economy has created a lot of jobs over the last four years that she has been in. I think the growth rate has started to move up from 2 percent to now close to 3 percent over the last few quarters. I don't think there have been any disasters that have occurred. The discussion of the winding down of the portfolio has gone very smoothly.</p><p>[16:05:00] And as exciting as watching paint dry, as she had said. That didn't happen in 2013, when we had the taper tantrum. So, a lot of difficult things I think she has handled quite well.</p><p>QUEST: OK. On the core question though of the future direction of monetary policy next year, the dot plot -- well, if we look at their forecast -- FMC's forecast on unemployment it goes even lower. Down into the 3. something percent. Growth remains around about 3.2 to 3 percent. Three rate rises next year. Do you go along with that too?</p><p>KROSZNER: I think that's where we'll have to see how inflation is evolving. Because if inflation starts to move down, then I would be a little bit more wary of doing that. If inflation at least stays in the 1.5 to 2 percent area, I think, you know, a few more rate rises might be justified. But we're really going to have to see what those inflation dynamics are, because they're quite different than what they traditionally have been.</p><p>QUEST: Randall, good to see you, sir. May I wish you and your family a very happy holiday season, sir. We're always grateful that you come on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, thank you.</p><p>Now we're going to head over to the trading post to talk about how the market has moved today. On the way, we see -- hey. What are you doing here? You're going to help us understand, Teddy Weisberg.</p><p>TED WEISBERG, PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES: Well, of course.</p><p>QUEST: You make your way over there, while I update on the market. Teddy Weisberg will be with us in just a moment. Record high on the Dow. S&amp;P off. So, no records there. Nasdaq up there. I think we have to say, there's two up, one down. It's a green day on the market, thank you. And let's just update -- there we go. So, we have a record on the Dow, which proves 68, 60 and 70 so far for the markets. The issue, of course, is what was driving this. And no, we still remain 20, 25 and 10 over on the European boards. But this is what we're talking about with Ted Weisberg, who hopefully is now comfortable. OK. Today was an interesting session, wasn't it? Green for the markets, because the Dow and the Nasdaq are up. What was the driving force?</p><p>WEISBERG: I think earlier in the day, it was there was a headline news that both the Senate and the House had come to an agreement on the tax bill. So, we saw the market pop. The market was up all day, but popped at 150. And then once again, as you get into the weeds a little bit, you know, we gave back --</p><p>QUEST: Why can't it hold on. What happens during the latter part of the day, particularly at the close, that means those early gains evaporate.</p><p>WEISBERG: Listen, we have a lot of cross currents, a lot of traders. You know, it just could be people lightning up. You know, everyday there's a new news cycle. So, there's a reluctance on the part of traders, really true traders to go home long anything.</p><p>QUEST: Ted, I need you to pause for a second. Let's just have a look and see. Doug Jones is going to talk now. He's listening. We need to listen in.</p><p>DOUG JONES, ALABAMA SENATOR ELECT: -- little bit of an orderly process. Because I really want to get to as much as we can. Let me just start out by saying how thrilled that my family and I are for this win last night. It has been a fun campaign, despite what people say and despite all of the things that get thrown at you. It was nothing that we didn't fully expect.</p><p>Most important thing we've had an opportunity to travel around the state, talking to so many people from so many walks of life. Listening to their cares, their concerns, their joys, their happiness. And that's been so gratifying. And it is especially gratifying to know that in this day and age, here in the state of Alabama, that a message of inclusiveness, a message of equality, a message of dignity and respect, and importantly, messages of issues that really are at the end of the day, those issues that people care about. The kitchen table issues that we have talked about, that you guys have heard me preach about over and over. It has been and amazing night for us. It has been an amazing day today. I have received calls from so many well-wishers, of friends and family. But also, future colleagues in Washington on both sides of the aisle. I have received calls from Democratic Senators. I've received calls from my long-time friend --</p><p>QUEST: A bit of Doug Jones. We are listening in for when he says something that's, you know -- is significant in terms of the future of the way he will be in the Senate. Dan Merica is at the White House. The reverberations at the White House as a result of this. Donald Trump's -- Donald Trump's tweet basically saying, I always knew that Moore was going to lose. Sounds like sour grapes.</p><p>[16:10:00] DAN MERICA, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes, it is sour grapes, frankly. I mean, there's no doubt that President Trump was fully behind Roy Moore. And this changes the calculation here at the White House. I mean, there's the practical matter. Frankly, the Senate now has one less Republican and one more Democrat, which really would imperil aspects of the Trump agenda. There are things that have happened in the last ten months that wouldn't have happened with that kind of margin. It also puts a lot of power back into the hands of more moderate Republican Senators, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, those who have spoken out against the president over the last few months.</p><p>It also drives a division in the Republican Party, as well. I mean, there are many Republicans who are blaming Steve Bannon for this. There are some who are blaming Mitch McConnell. You know, the blame game is alive and well here in Washington, including here at the White House. I don't think Republicans have fully figured out how to blame for that loss. But this will cause, you know, kind of a moment of reckoning for many to figure out what went wrong. Was it just a candidate who had his own issues, or is this a broader problem they'll have to confront in 2018?</p><p>QUEST: Just how difficult is it going to be with 51-49? You talk about the likes of Susan Collins and there's the moderates. But at the end of the day, if they scupper their own president or the president from their own party, don't they de facto shoot themselves in the foot?</p><p>MERICA: I mean, you have to remember, some of these Senators who you're mentioning are not running for re-election, namely Jeff Flake and Bob Corker. So they're, you know, unencumbered in many ways from President who leads their party. So, there are many members who certainly feel tied to this president, because they will remain in office. But many don't. And that is going to be a problem this White House is going to have to confront. You have seen the president take to Twitter, use events to really go after Senators who have spoken out against him. Said things that, you know, somewhat would be seen as slights towards him. He may not be able to do that as freely if this -- this margin is less, because he's going to need those Senators to pass things.</p><p>As you see with this tax bill, they want to get this done before Doug Jones is seated. Now, president Trump said today that has nothing to do with the loss in Alabama. But if Doug Jones does get seated, and this moves past this Christmas holiday, that is a very, very tricky predicament that the White House has to confront.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, Dan.</p><p>Donald Trump says passage of tax reform is only days away even after his party suffered, what Dan was telling us about, the damaging defeat. The president has just finished what was billed as a final pitch on his tax plan. A package which is now all but agreed. Speaking a few moments ago, he said the bill could take effect within weeks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If congress sends me a bill before Christmas, the IRS -- this is just out. This is breaking news. Has just confirmed that Americans will see lower taxes and bigger paychecks beginning in February. Just two short months from now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Republican aides tell CNN, they want to wrap-up the tax vote even quicker after the Alabama result, of course, they don't want to wait until Doug Jones gets seated. The whole thing could be done by this time next week. Long before Jones gets anywhere near Washington. The final plan agreed in principle to be unveiled on Friday. And then, as you move on, you've got the final votes, the House will vote on Tuesday. And then, of course, you've got the Senate that votes, and Donald Trump, the president, would sign it on Wednesday.</p><p>Now, some top Senators from the Democratic Party want to delay until Doug Jones gets seated. Chuck Schumer says it's the right thing to do. Stephen Moore helped draft Donald Trump's tax plan during the presidential campaign. Good to see you, Stephen.</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, CNN ECONOMIC ANALYST: Hi, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: I can answer my own question here, or maybe you'll do it for me. I guess you don't think they should wait until Doug Jones gets seated in January. Do you think it's the right thing to go ahead now?</p><p>MOORE: Yes, you do it while you've got the votes. That's the way politics works. And, look, I think they've got 51 votes. I think they're going to probably lose Senator Corker. But they have -- it's a very slim majority. Shame, by the way, Democrats, not a single Democrat will vote for this. Just one slight correction on something you said. I got some intelligence today, Richard, that this is kind of unusual, but that the Senate will actually vote before the House. Usually, the House goes first and then the Senate. They want to have the Senate go first so the House can basically know that it's done if they get it passed.</p><p>[16:15:03] And you're right, the vote is scheduled for Tuesday. And then Wednesday or Thursday, you can have a presidential signing. But I guarantee you, they're not going to wait until the beginning of the year when the new senator is sworn in.</p><p>QUEST: If it's gone through reconciliation and both sides are agreed in reconciliation, I mean, it would be somewhat extraordinary to then lose it in the full vote.</p><p>MOORE: It would be. But, you know, I have seen -- I'm a sports fan. I've seen teams blow leads in the fourth quarter of the game. So, you know, it looks like they are in very good shape right now. I would put pretty heavy money on the fact they're going to pass this. But, you know, I'll believe it when I see it.</p><p>QUEST: So, what you understand is the difference. Now a slight raise of 1 percent in the corporate tax.</p><p>MOORE: Corporate rate, yes.</p><p>QUEST: And a reduction in the top level of income tax, 39.6 down to 37 percent. Why do you need to give the wealthy more?</p><p>MOORE: Because what we wanted to do, and as you know, I've been involved with this for two years with Donald Trump, is get small businesses a tax cut. It turns out, about two-thirds of small businesses, the ones that are really successful, are the ones that are people in that highest income tax bracket. So that is a tax cut that's really meant to grow small businesses. We get, Richard, about 60 percent of our jobs in this country from small businesses. So, people are -- and by the way, one other quick thing. This bill gets rid of something state and local tax deduction. And that's affecting very high-income people and very high-income states like New York and California. So, one of the tradeoffs was, we'll get rid of the state and local tax deduction, but we'll reimburse people by cutting that rate a little bit, so they don't get too clobbered.</p><p>QUEST: You mean those of us like -- that live in New York, just to rub salt into the wound a little bit there.</p><p>MOORE: There you go.</p><p>QUEST: OK. Let's move forward. Let's assume this is done, deal -- it is a victory. No question about it for the president, to have got this through in record time. What's the next economic fight that you see on the horizon?</p><p>MOORE: Well, by the way, again, I'm not sure I would say this was done in record time, because it took a good year. And Ronald Reagan passed a tax cut in eight months. So, I actually think it took too long. But anyway, what's the effect of this bill? I think it's going to be very positive for the economy. We've gotten some good news on the economy here just in the last couple weeks. I just heard you talking about the stock market. I mean, there's no doubt investors love this tax cut. Businesses love it. They're anticipating the positive effects of this. We have about 3 to 3.5 percent growth right now in the economy. I'm going to predict on your show that we get in the first six months of next year when this tax cut hits, you know potentially 4 percent growth. We haven't had that, you know, in 15 years in this country. So, I'm expecting some big boosts in the economy starting in January.</p><p>QUEST: So, you're asking us to believe a prediction from a man wearing Santa's on his tie. Is that the gist of it?</p><p>MOORE: I'm surprised you can see those. But yes, I am asking you.</p><p>QUEST: Good.</p><p>MOORE: And, look, I want to be on your show in February and March of 2018 and will see whether I'm right. But you've got to admit, Richard, that the market really loves this tax cut. Another 150 points today on the Dow.</p><p>QUEST: Either in D.C. or in New York, one of us is buying dinner. All right?</p><p>MOORE: You got it, my friend.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>MOORE: OK.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, it's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, live from the world's financial capital. The Apple boost shares Finisar, up 23 percent. Apple's investment we're going to explain in this hour. And, of course, the Brexit battle, part two. Theresa May's long, dark night of the soul. A government loses a key Brexit bill vote. Will be in London after the Break. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Tough night for Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, who's been humiliated by her own party. Her MPs and others voted to guarantee a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal. It's all about the ability of Parliament to actually change the Brexit deal. They tied Theresa May's hands. Bianca Nobilo in London, tell me more.</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN WESTMINSTER: Tied her hands, Richard. It means that the government can no longer tinker with beginning to withdraw the U.K. from the EU without getting parliament's approval first. It just means that this process has got a whole lot more difficult for the government. They've said that they're disappointed by this result, given the strong assurances they said they gave. But it's going to make the next few months even harder for the Prime Minister, and she's got one more vote left on this bill and that's not looking good either.</p><p>QUEST: All right. So why? What was the fear? Was it that through the back door, they were going to start to implement Brexit before Parliament had voted?</p><p>NOBILO: That was the concern. Because they could in theory have done that with the previous wording of the bill. Brexit, in its entirety, was about taking back control. Parliament was arguing, yes, the British people wanted to take back control. But give it back to the British Parliament, not to the prime minister, and to the government. So, while it was a defeat for Theresa May, it was a real victory for democracy and for the Parliament this evening.</p><p>QUEST: Why would her own party want to do her in, in such a way?</p><p>NOBILO: According to them, that was not their intention. This is because they believe it's Parliament's job to ensure that powers don't get moved away from the House of Commons and to retain them. The lead rebel that tabled this amendment was a former attorney general and Tory MP, Dominic Grieve. He made the case strongly today when he spoke. He said this is not about sabotage. This is about trying to improve the legislation. Of course, Labour MPs, who supported this amendment, probably had ulterior political motives, and indeed there were huge cheers and jeers from the opposition benches. Jeremy Corbyn got in there straightaway, saying this is a humiliating defeat for the Prime Minister. So, it's unfortunate. There are two reasons why people supported this. Some political and others because they truly believe that it would be corrosive to democracy not to.</p><p>QUEST: Bianca Nobilo in London, thank you.</p><p>A short time ago, I spoke Guy Verhofstadt, on \"QUEST EXPRESS.\" He's the Brexit coordinator for the European Parliament. He's angry over what he sees as a fudging of the agreement last Friday. I asked if he was getting reassurance from the British government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUY VERHOFSTADT, BREXIT COORDINATOR, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Yes, I got a phone conversation by Mr. Davis David, the Brexit negotiator. And we said, Yes, Yes, this statement of intent, the words that were used that were not appropriate, in fact we stick to our commitments, not only I will stick to the commitments we have made in this arrangement, but also the whole U.K. government. So, we were reassured. So, the best way to be reassured, Richard, is that all the commitments that have been taken in this agreement are now translated into legal text of a withdrawal agreement. So, what we expect is that in the coming weeks, after the break, that there will be a withdrawal agreement on the table in which all the commitments are translated that have been taken by the U.K. side and by the EU side in this agreement.</p><p>QUEST: If you accept the principle, as everybody does, that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then all the commitments that were made on Friday are, by definition, going to be circumspect to that which comes next. In other words, the trade negotiations.</p><p>VERHOFSTADT: No, that's not the way it works. Because in the treaties of the European Union, it's very clearly stated that the first thing to do before you can talk about the future arrangements is that you have an agreement on the withdrawal.</p><p>[16:25:03] And an agreement of the withdrawal means three things. First of all a financial settlement. Secondly, clarity on the border issue between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and three, the citizens Right. And for us, for the Parliament, this is very important that these rights of the EU citizens are guaranteed in the future. And when you have an agreement on this, you can go into the next phase of the negotiations.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Janet Yellen has called bitcoin highly speculative. But said a crash, while it would hurt some investors, does not provide for systemic economic risk. Potential for chaos though is plain as Bitcoin booms, major exchanges have suffered embarrassing outages, and some have suffered setbacks. On Tuesday, bitcoin exchanged Bitfinex and Coinbase both reported problems with service. Last week, more than $70 million were stolen from NiceHash. Bitfinex sufferer a similar hack last year. It's a matter of time, perhaps, before a collapse, as we've see Mt. Gox which fell into bankruptcy after 460 million was stolen. Paul Vinay is a Wall Street Journal reporter. Author of \"The Age of the Cryptocurrency.\" He joins me now. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>PAUL VIGRA, REPORTER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": How are you doing?</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>VIGRA: Thank you for having me on.</p><p>QUEST: She's right, isn't she, Janet Yellen, highly speculative.</p><p>VIGRA: Yes, that's putting it light. She's right about two things. Yes, it is highly speculative. And if it did crash, it really would not affect the wider economy. I think the thing to keep in mind with bitcoin, there is a lot of hype right now, a lot of mania, a lot of people want to get in. But this is still a pretty small market. Pretty disconnected from the wider economy.</p><p>QUEST: She sort of said, this isn't legal tender. It's not a -- basically, it's not a safe way to proceed.</p><p>VIGRA: Well, it's not legal tender in that the U.S. government has not recognized it as such. Whether or not that makes it safe or not isn't really the case. But the issue of safety is a legitimate one. It's just not a matter of because it's legal or not legal.</p><p>QUEST: There were two areas -- I've been reading the fascinating work you've done. There were two areas I want to talk about this safety.</p><p>VIGRA: Sure.</p><p>QUEST: The first is whether it goes up or down in price. The markets will regulate that. The second is these two keys that you have, the public and the private.</p><p>VIGRA: Right.</p><p>QUEST: Who looks after your bitcoin wallet? If my bitcoin wallet is on my computer and the hard drive goes caput, what happens?</p><p>VIGRA: You are out of luck. So, this is the thing. In a real nutshell, this is the thing about bitcoin that makes it interesting. The idea is you could have this currency that is not regulated by any one central party. The way they do that is by having transactions on an open ledger that cannot be changed. Can't ever be altered. So, the key thing is that once a bitcoin transaction is confirmed it's confirmed for all-time. As opposed to, say, if you're -- if JPMorgan gets hacked, your bank account gets hacked, your credit card get hacked, those charges can be reversed. Bitcoin is different.</p><p>QUEST: But what do you do if you lose the key?</p><p>VIGRA: You are out of luck. And this is what I'm talking about. So, the difference is, in the real-world transactions can be reversed. So, security is important, but you know there is somebody behind you that can probably make you whole. In bitcoin you can't be made whole.</p><p>QUEST: OK.</p><p>VIGRA: So, what happens is, you have a wallet, which is really just an online account. There are two points of access to that online account. These are the keys you're talking about. There are two ways to move money in and out of that. One is the public key. That is an address, it's like an e-mail address. Anybody can see it. Anybody can use it. I could use it, I could use your public key for me to send bitcoin to your wallet. The other is the private key. You're the only one -- or you should be, Richard, the only one who has access to the private key. That's your way to unlock your account.</p><p>QUEST: But as we move to a situation where more ordinary investors want to be at bitcoin, then the risk moves slightly, not just from my computer, but I now contract with bitcoin exchange. And you look after them. And now my risk is, are you good, are you secure, are you solid.</p><p>VIGRA: Right. And that's the risk with any third party when you request or rewrite.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>VIGRA: Again, the difference is if -- and you talked about Mt. Gox, which was an early bitcoin exchange. It was very poorly constructed. A lot of money was tied up there. A lot of money disappeared. There was no real recourse. That money was gone. That is a risk when you're going to have your money with any third party. That's why a lot of bitcoiners, they don't want their money with any third party. That's why they have the wallet in the first place. But the difference is, then the security is on you. And even sophisticated people who understand how these things can work can lose access to their private key, they can lose access to their wallet. They can lose their bitcoins. It's not for everybody.</p><p>QUEST: I'm having -- good to see you, sir. Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>Republican control of the Senate is shrinking. A real threat to the Trump agenda. A major voice from the Obama White House will be with us after the break. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment of course. Apple invests in America $390 million. Brings an old factory back to life in Texas. We'll talk about that. And a first look at \"The Last Jedi.\" Fans line up for midnight screenings. As we continue, this is CNN. And on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>President Trump's made his final pitch on tax reform amid words, House, Senate and negotiators reached a tentative deal on a tax bill. Just last hour, Mr. Trump said he believes we are days away from seeing lawmakers pass that bill.</p><p>Fresh off his stunning win in the Alabama senate race, the Democrat, Doug Jones, is speaking at a press conference. He said he's received numerous calls, including one from president Trump. And from Democratic and Republican colleagues. He said he has not spoken to his Republican opponent, Roy Moore.</p><p>The White House now says an aide to Mr. Trump plans to leave the White House next month. Her resignation follows news that the president s deputy national security adviser is also to leave.</p><p>South African President, Jacob Zuma being ordered to launch an investigation into himself. The South African Supreme Court is forcing Mr. Zuma to set up an official inquiry into allegations of corruption an influence peddling. He has 30 days to appoint the investigators.</p><p>One of the world's top cyclists has failed a drug test that threatens his victory in one of the most prestigious events. Chris Froome says he has a good excuse. He's accused of exceeding the maximum allowable dosage of an anti-asthma drug during the Vuelta a Espana in September. He says he takes the drug, not surprisingly, to treat his asthma and it had a particularly violent attack.</p><p>A short time ago, President Trump said tax reform passage was just days away. But the loss of his senate seat, his legislative agenda is at risk. And you'll see what I mean if you take a look here at what's happening. These are the promises that Donald Trump said he was going to do. You can see how he has managed to do this. President Trump's promises. He was going to halt the Muslim entry. That's on hold although it is moving forward.</p><p>[16:35:00] He's going to renegotiate NAFTA. These -- the withdrawal from TPP, labelled China a currency manipulator is not there. Repeal Obamacare has not been done and defeat ISIS. Well, we can argue about that, bearing in mind what happened in Iraq over the last few days. Jim Messina is a former White House deputy chief of staff, responsible for setting priorities with Congress. He's also Barack Obama's campaign manager and the Messina Group. And good to see you.</p><p>JIM MESSINA, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: Good to see you too. How are you?</p><p>QUEST: I'm very well, sir. Very well. Now, when you look -- when you look at what has happened in this -- in Alabama, how -- where do you give the credit?</p><p>MESSINA: Well, it gets probably the most stunning political upset of the last decade, right? Alabama is the second-most conservative state and country. Democrats hadn't won a senate seat there in 25 years. And I think you have to give a credit to three people. One, the candidate, Jones, who Doug Jones, who ran a great campaign. Two, Roy Moore, who is the worst nominee of any major political party of my lifetime. And then Donald Trump, who, you know, today a poll came out, he's at 32 percent approval rating, which is the lowest of any president since Nixon.</p><p>QUEST: So how does -- forgive me. How does the Democrats capitalize on their strengthened position in the Senate in the New Year without being seen as obstructionist, so that they lose the support of the public who basically says a plague on everyone?</p><p>MESSINA: Right. You're exactly right. The worst thing the Democratic Party could do is just say we're not going to do anything. What we need to do is come together with a very clear vision about an economic future for this country. And hold to it. And you have seen Democratic Party numbers rise during the tax debate, because Democrats have been very clear what they're for, and what they're not for. And I think this tax debate gives us a crystal-clear ability to do that, and next year, you know, the one place we do agree with president Trump is infrastructure reform, and funding more of those programs. And I think that's a place where we can move forward and get something done for the country.</p><p>QUEST: Do the Democrats keep Alabama in 2020?</p><p>MESSINA: Well, that's a long way between now and then. What is true is that Doug Jones is the only southern Democrat in the Senate if you take out Florida. But he also showed a way to win last night. He won a race that, you know, as he said, about half an hour ago, he didn't even think he was going to win last night. And he did. And so, there is a -- a plan for that. You know, I was privileged to run President Obama's campaign, and people looked at that plan and started running campaigns like that. So, I think we all need to shut up and go down to Alabama and learn a couple things from Doug Jones.</p><p>QUEST: The \"USA Today\" editorial that was published, describing President Trump as uniquely awful, and not fit to clean the toilets of President Obama's presidential library. What significance do you get, or do you give to such vitriol?</p><p>MESSINA: Look, it's unprecedented in my lifetime. I've been involved, as you know, in world politics for 25 years. I've never seen anything like that editorial. But the truth is, you know, I've worked hard for 20 years in the United States Senate before I went to the White House on both sides of the aisle, trying to get things done. And let's just be really clear about it. We have never had anyone this bad as President of the United States. And you showed it. I thought you had the most interesting graph I've seen recently. He hasn't gotten anything done. We're one year into it, in a country that desperately needs some leadership and we have done nothing. It's not me saying that as a Democrat.</p><p>QUEST: I've got to correct you here. You withdrew from TPP. You restarted oil pipelines, and the tax thing is just about done.</p><p>MESSINA: Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's not done yet. And TPP was a disaster to get out, and our economy is going to feel that for the next 10 years.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, Jim. Please come up to New York. Come and join us on the set.</p><p>MESSINA: Any time, thanks.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>We continue tonight, President Trump wanted Apple to create jobs in the U.S. and now it has. We'll show you where and how after the break.</p><p>[16:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: A very busy day as you can tell. Much enjoyment of the day. But we must have time for business on the move. Abu Dhabi has seen its largest IPO in a decade. It's all to do with Adnoc, the retail distribution arm. The IPO, you can see the closing price and the IPO price. There again it values the company $851 million at 8.5 in total.</p><p>Target's buying same-day delivery service company Shipt for the price of $550 million. That is where Target will be delivering to 72 cities and plans to expand. It is competing, of course, with Amazon, and Fresh and Google. Amazon delivers in those parts of the country. Apple -- the Apple, who does this belong to? Apple's investing $390 million to a U.S. chipmaker Finisar. Produces laser chips that power face IDs and indeed these AirPods, however these are. Maybe they won't miss them if they come over here. That's business on the move.</p><p>Gene Munster is the expert on all things Apple. Managing partner at Loup Ventures joins me now. Why does Apple want this company and invest in it and why not just buy them?</p><p>GENE MUNSTER, MANAGING PARTNER, LOUP VENTURES: Because they can get exactly what they want without spending more money. So, they put $350 million in, and this gives them a pull position, which this is the most important part here, in terms of the future of phones. What we use phones for are going to change, augmented reality is going to become a bigger part of that. But to answer your questions, they could achieve this opportunity around gather and company without buying the whole company. And also, an important point is they can keep other suppliers in the game, because they need other people like Lumentum to be building those components to fulfill all their demands. So, they accomplish two things.</p><p>QUEST: What does Finisar do that's worth $1 billion over time?</p><p>MUNSTER: What they do is they map the world extremely well, the real world. And so, when you think about augmented reality, in order for our phones and eventually some form of glasses to be able to superimpose these images on the real world, think of Pokemon, or Snapchat with images on our face. In order to do that, you need to do 3D mapping and that's what they do. They have a laser that maps the environment around you.</p><p>QUEST: When Apple has withdrawn support from a supplier in the past, the supplier has collapsed. I'm thinking of the English company, the British company, which was a major supplier until Apple pulled out. If I was Finisar, might have a worry that at some point in the future might decide, not today?</p><p>MUNSTER: Well, you would have a little bit of worry, because they have done that. If a supplier that they have invested in doesn't deliver on what they say they're going to do, Apple will pull the plug. And they have let companies go bankrupt to do that. But I would rather be in that position than be a competitor that is trying to win the business or currently has the business. That would happen more frequently, as someone is a supplier to Apple, and Apple just decides to go away.</p><p>[16:45:02] And so, it is a ruthless customer, Apple is. Obviously, it's a huge opportunity for these suppliers. But I would rather be the company that has the investment then one that doesn't have the investment.</p><p>QUEST: As we have seen in recent days with other investments, Apple is almost parsimonious when it comes to making their investments. They -- I mean, it's the opposite of Facebook in terms of getting out the checkbook and writing a very large check. They make sure they pay not a penny more and not a penny less.</p><p>MUNSTER: Yes, that's exactly right. I mean, you look at this -- last week, they did Shazam for $450 million, at one-point value $1 billion. But that's exactly right. They do not do multibillion, $20 billion acquisitions. WhatsApp from Facebook like you re mentioning. And I don't think you're going to see anything change. And we've studied this over the last 15 years, and the reality is Apple buys technology. They don't buy brands. And most other big tech companies buy brands. And Apple loves their brand, and they're not going to buy someone else's brand.</p><p>QUEST: Gene, thank you helping us understand what this is about.</p><p>MUNSTER: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Really appreciate it.</p><p>Red, white and blue. Not the typical options for wine. It's the latest in our trader series.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): The British wine importer, the wine drinker, has a new offering for its client, the Olive Tree. Its drink is an unusual hue. Diners will get to try a wine that's blue. It was first developed in 2014 by a handful of tech entrepreneurs in Spain who wanted to shake things up in the countries traditional wine industry.</p><p>TAIG MACCARTHY, CO-FOUNDER, GIK: The wine in Spain is full of rules. We didn't really resonate with that. So, we wanted to offer something to the new generation of wine drinkers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What started as a team of five young entrepreneurs running the startup company called Gik has now grown to 14 employees. Gik blends red and white grapes sourced from nearby vineyards to craft the blue wine.</p><p>MACARTHY: We had to choose the right grapes. And to do this, it's very important for us to work with the experts in the wineries. This is how we personally mix the pigment. That comes from the skin of the red grapes into the wine. And in the second stage, once it's in the stainless tanks we add once again the same pigment. And this is how we make this neon blue wine.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The tradenomics of the global wine market flowed to almost $300 billion in 2016. Five countries savor almost half of all the world's wine. Europe dominates wine production. Vineyard's cover more of Spain's landscape than any other nation. But this delicate crop is vulnerable to weather conditions. Recent frosts and droughts have taken a toll on grape harvests. Three billion fewer bottles of wine were produced in 2017 worldwide, increasing the cost of draining a glass.</p><p>MACARTHY: We really are at the risk of losing grapes because of the climate changes. We had a really rough winter. So, it made an impact on the amount of grapes we actually produced.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But Gik is still finding success. Since launching, the company's revenue is 2 million euros and it's now selling to 31 countries.</p><p>MACARTHY: It made a lot of sense to us to just export. To countries from the U.S. to Japan, where they're more open to wine innovation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The internet has also helped the company take off with a bright blue Spanish wine.</p><p>MACARTHY: We have wine e-commerce for each country in which we sell. And they're really key. It has allowed us to reach the amount of customers that otherwise wouldn't be possible to reach. A new way of connecting with customers, a new way of discovery and a new way of working.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: It's like Christmas, Halloween New Year's Eve, all at the same time. That's if you're a \"Star Wars\" geek. The new film is out tomorrow. A couple hours from now, some fans are too excited to sleep. So, they're going to sit in the middle of the night.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Old friends, new faces and cute critters. That's how the \"New York Times\" described \"The Last Jedi,\" which opens on Thursday. Fans in London are about to see the very first public screenings. There have been premiers. Anna Stewart's is in Leicester Square where a showtime is about two hours away. Good to see you. Cold night in London. Anna, who will be at this first screening? How difficult was it to get a ticket?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN PRODUCER: Pretty darn difficult, Richard. There are 1,100 people descending on this cinema to watch the first screening at midnight. And we've seen quite a few of them. Lots of Jedi have turned out. We've just had a massive downpour here in London. So, they have all gone under cover. But if that appetite is anything to go by, this movie is going to do very well at the box office. But the big question is, can it do as well as the last movie in the saga, which was \"The Force Awakens, \" which was something of a record-breaker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB IGER, CEO, WALT DISNEY COMPANY: We think the way we're releasing them is the right way. So that the trilogy in this case is every other year, and we filled in the middle with something that is not part of the trilogy. So, we don't think we're overdoing it at all. You know, there's so much interest in \"Star Wars,\" as you know, witness tonight. And as long as you're in business with great directors, great writers, good story-tellers, then I think the audience can't get enough of it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can I ask you, what's the latest on the Fox take over?</p><p>IGER: I'm here for \"Star Wars.\" I'm not going to say anything about that. Thank you. Sorry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART: So, there you have it from Bob Iger, the Disney CEO. Now he doesn't think there will be any franchise fatigue here in this movie release. But that is the worry in the industry. Because if you think about it, \"The Force Awakens,\" which had the highest grossing opening weekend ever, was the first \"Star Wars\" movie after a ten-year gap. This, Richard, is the third \"Star Wars\" movie after three years. So, there is a bit of concern there.</p><p>QUEST: OK. I mean, I've enjoyed \"Star Wars.\" I can't say I particularly could quote from it, unlike some of my colleagues in the studio. From what you've heard, from those who have seen, does it hit the grade?</p><p>STEWART: The reviews have been pretty kind to this movie, Richard. So, I would say probably yes. But I haven't yet seen it myself. It's got lots of the old characters. We have Luke Skywalker. We have Princess Leia or General Leia as she is in this movie. And we also have some new creatures. We have the Poe, which in one review described it as something between a puffin and Justin Bieber. So, if that doesn't make you want to see it, I don't know what will.</p><p>QUEST: Final question. It is coming up to 10 o'clock in London. Have you got a ticket? Are you going in to watch it?</p><p>STEWART: You're keeping me too busy, Richard. I would love to be in there. But I'm also a little late on the ticket sales, I fear.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. Anna Stewart, proving that duty comes first in Lester Square. Thank you very much, indeed. Cold night in London.</p><p>Final check of the markets. Dow Jones, it was a record. The Nasdaq and the Dow ended high. The S&amp;P was off just a tad. The Dow is up 80 points. Again, a third of 1 percent. The S&amp;P was only lower. Consumer and industrials were the biggest gainers overall.</p><p>You can download our show as a podcast.</p><p>[16:55:00] It's available from all the main providers. And you can also listen to it at CNN.com/podcast. And also, you can always, of course, e- mail me or tweet me as usual. Will have a Profitable Moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment. You can see what a busy, complicated world it is at the moment. You have Donald Trump with tax. You have the markets at record highs. You have change at the Fed with Janet Yellen, talking about bitcoin and saying it's highly speculative. And then at the last minute, you have Theresa May losing a crucial vote before Parliament, which basically will tie her hands in terms of the negotiations. Fascinating undercurrents in the global economy. And throughout all of this, the stock market just keeps rising.</p><p>Which gave rise to a question from one of my colleagues that if, for instance, the tax plan failed would the stock market, or would it hit the economy? The answer is yes. If there is more dislocation on Brexit, would that hit the U.K. economy in the UK stock market? Yes. If there are further problems with world trade as the WTO is talking about now. Does that hit global growth? The answer is yes. My point is simple. There are many pitfalls out careful. Of which we need to be careful. And what we've seen tonight in this program, we just laid them out all for you. But don't worry. It's nearly Christmas and the new year. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead I hope it's profitable. Will do it again tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017121301cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5R-NW51-DXH2-622V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 13, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Banking: Taxes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brexit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Movie Industry</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Deductions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzUxOEVGNkQ4OEYyNDYyQUJCQTkzNURBNUI1RjQ4Njc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE0NjkzMzBBOTBBNDg4Mjk2QzlBRTA4NjVEMUI3MzE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

All right, coming up this morning and joining the conversation, Dagen McDowell, Jon Hilsenrath and Cabot Phillips, great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Great to see you.</p><p>CABOT PHILLIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First though, some of the top stories we're watching right now, President Trump is expected to sign an executive order on police reform today as calls for change grow nationwide. It will promote a community- based policing strategy focused on officer behavior, use of force and information-sharing about bad cops in an effort to rebuild trust.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have mostly great people. I know so many of them, law enforcement. But we will do better, even better, and we're going to try and do it fast. But this is about law and order, but it's about justice also and it's about safety.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The executive order includes creating credentialing and certification incentives, improving officer retention and recruitment, and also prioritizing correspondent services. House Democrats start marking up their justice in policing act today with a floor vote expected on Thursday.

The president of the New York City Police Union says the officers were working protest detail when they discovered a toxic substance believed to be bleach in their beverages.</p><p>The officers are expected to recover. Shake Shack tweeted this, this morning. \"Our team is working hard to get the full picture. In the meantime, we're relieved to hear the officers are all OK.\" From Shake Shack. Meanwhile, President Trump is slamming Seattle leaders for failing to break up an occupied zone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: These people have taken over a vast part of -- a major part of a very good part of a place called Seattle. Seattle is big stuff. That's a major city. We have a governor that doesn't do a damn thing about it, and you have a mayor that doesn't know she's alive.</p><p>If they don't do the job, I'll do the job. And I've already spoken to the Attorney General about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The occupation of chop, that is the Capitol Hill organized protest, is in its second week. Seattle's police chief says that despite claims the area is cop-free, officers will respond if there's a threat to safety. A landmark decision for LGBT workers, the Supreme Court ruling a key part of the 1964 civil rights act protects gay and transgender workers from discrimination in the workplace.</p><p>Two conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts joining liberals on the high court on the ruling, which comes five years after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. And Apple is facing new scrutiny this morning by the European Union. Anti-trust regulators have opened two investigations into the company's Apple Pay service and its App Store.</p><p>At issue is whether the company violated competition laws. Apple could be fined up to 10 percent of its annual revenue and forced to make changes to how it does business. The company says it's disappointed with the EU's inquiries. Taking a look at the stock this morning in the pre-market, it is still up, better than 1 percent at $347 a share. Markets poised for a rebound this morning, gains prompted by reports that the Trump administration is planning a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to stimulate the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>This plan is being prepared by the Department of Transportation. The president is expected to discuss it on Thursday. Joining me right now is former White House acting Chief of Staff, former OMB Director Mick Mulvaney. And Mick, it's great to have you this morning, thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, FORMER ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Maria, it's been too long, it's good to be back, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How accurate in your view, pardon me, is a stimulus plan, this next stimulus plan, focused on infrastructure, or are there other things in the way of relief that you believe are needed right now?</p><p>MULVANEY: Yes, I think a couple of different things about that. First of all, infrastructure is a really difficult tool to use as stimulus because it simply takes too long to get the money into the system. I've had this conversations with folks in the administration, and it could take years for money to get for things like roads and bridges and so forth.</p><p>We learned that during the Obama administration. Infrastructure sounds great, but it's really a very poor sort of short-term stimulative tool. If we're going to look at a larger package, we're going to look at a package, and my guess is Congress will, that's just what Congress does. I hope we look at it through the eyes of the economic need and not sort of the political expediency. I hope it's -- if Steven Mnuchin and Kevin Hassett go to the president of the United States and say we need these economic policies, these economic stimuli, that's a good reason to move forward.</p><p>If the political advisors come in and say we need to do this in order to help us with the election. You can't buy elections. We should be looking at this through a very sort of disciplined economic approach, and if we need more economic stimulus, then let's get it. I'm not convinced we do yet just because so much of the money that we've already appropriated already passed a previous legislation, has not entered the system yet. And I don't want to see us act too quickly and over-stimulate the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so where are the needs, though, right now then, Mick? I mean, when you look at where you're seeing the most trouble, I mean, you've got certain industries like hotels and restaurants needing stimulus badly. They are living on cash flow and there's none of it during the shutdown. You also have community banks, this is where main street America banks, the community banks.</p><p>They're talking about needing stimulus. So in your view right now, knowing of all of the trillions that have already been thrown at this economy, where are the needs today?</p><p>MULVANEY: Thank you. But a lot of those trillions that have been thrown haven't hit the economy yet. But to your point, I think it's real difficult for the government to pick winners and losers when it comes to industries, to say we're going to help hotels but not cruise lines or airlines, but not Boeing. That's really difficult to do and it would open anybody up to sort of second-guessing after the fact, again, lessons that were learned after the financial crisis of the last decade.</p><p>I think it's better to look at sort of the larger market drivers, is capital available, to your point? Are community banks able to lend money to small businesses? Are the capital markets functioning properly? Are payrolls flowing? I think those are the type of things you should look at as opposed to saying, yes, to this industry and no to that industry.</p><p>So, any good stimulus package, I think is going to look at the big picture, and not try and pick winners or losers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, in terms of winners or losers, we've already seen certain money going to certain industries, the airlines obviously --</p><p>MULVANEY: Yes --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Getting a big help from government where there were stakes taken. Payroll tax holiday is something your colleague, former colleague, Larry Kudlow talked about on Sunday. Here's what he said about the next relief package. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are the must-haves in the next stimulus package to keep this economy going and growing?</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL, UNITED STATES: The president has talked about a payroll tax holiday for the workforce. That will provide a terrific incentive for them to go back to work. I think it's a great idea. He's talked about capital gains. He has indeed talked about as my colleague, Navarro has said, let's try to help bring American companies back home from China which has been an unreliable place. We can use tax incentives and other ways and means to help them come home.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you believe those things will be in the next released package, bringing supply chains incentives to get companies to bring their supply chains back to America or out of China --</p><p>MULVANEY: Yes, those are --</p><p>BARTIROMO: At a minimum?</p><p>MULVANEY: Yes, those are the types of sort of general policies that I was talking about a second ago that I think actually could be helpful. You're not targeting this industry or that or this business or that, you're sort of trying to change the environment that we're in. On a middle class -- on a payroll tax cut, yes, it's a good way to get money to the middle class in a quick fashion which is good.</p><p>That being said, it does sort of undermine the long-term viability of the various trust funds, social security and Medicare. So we have to be careful with that. But you talk about what must -- what has to be in a must pass. I hope that we also sit back and realize that -- and I know I'm going to sound ideological, but it's important to think about this for a second. We are going to grow government in leaps and bounds.</p><p>In fact, we already have. I hope that if we look at a stimulus package going forward, another bill that we find ways to make sure that we can shrink the government back down to a normal size when this need has passed. My fear is that all we're doing is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>MULVANEY: Raising the base, and that there's never going to be -- we do the same thing we did back in 2008, 2009, which is we grew the government and the government never got any smaller after that. So are there things in the stimulus to allow us to shrink the government, control growth, control spending. Will there be a way for example to have civil service reform to allow any president of the United States to fire underperforming federal workers. Things like that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>MULVANEY: Should be included in the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point, yes --</p><p>MULVANEY: Stimulus package.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that was my next question, when did the chickens come home to roost? I mean, you're talking about $10 trillion in stimulus. Now, we look at the economy and the debt, almost the same size, $22 trillion in debt, rivaling the size of the entire economy. What's the solution? Will taxes have to go up in the coming years, Mick? I mean, is that a certainty?</p><p>MULVANEY: Well, I think as soon as the Democrats have the ability to pass legislation, taxes are going to go up. They're very straightforward about that. This goes back to the classic sort of debate that you and I have talked about before, which is, look, I love to think that we could cut our way to spend, to reduce spending in this country.</p><p>We've just not been able to do it. The center of gravity in Congress is always to spend more money. And until we change that, there's only two pieces left, which is either you have to raise revenues, which means raising taxes or you grow the government -- excuse me, you grow the economy which is what I think we were doing with such great success before the COVID crisis.</p><p>We were proving that supply side economics works. I think one of the great stories of this administration, 10, 20 years from now will be to look back from an economics standpoint and realize a supply side economics work. We were able to have really sustained growth, really low unemployment rates with really low inflation.</p><p>And demand-siders will tell you can't do that. But we prove that supply side economics works. So I hope that we get a chance to continue that experiment as we come out the backside of this COVID crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll be watching, Mick Mulvaney, good to see you this morning, sir, thanks so much.</p><p>MULVANEY: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. We still got a lot ahead. Coming up next hour, don't miss my first on Fox Business interview with former senior adviser to President Obama and the author of \"Finding My Voice\", Valerie Jarrett is here. I'll ask her about her stance on President Trump's executive order on police reform. The shortlist for presumptive Democratic candidate Joe Biden's vice president and a lot more. That's coming up right here, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New concerns this morning from the trucking industry. Many drivers are anxious about traveling through areas that could see disbanded police departments. Jeff Flock is live this morning in Lake Station, Indiana with a new take from truckers. Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: From the website Cdllife.com, Maria, that stands of course for commercial driver's license, CDL life did a poll of its truckers and asked the question, would you deliver or pick up in cities that had disbanded or defunded police departments? Of the 1,200 or so respondents, 79 percent said that they would not do so. Among the comments from the truckers, one saying I have already informed my dispatcher that I will refuse all loads to cities that have defunded police departments.</p><p>And others saying this is not an area you need to act fearless and think you'd look like a fool for saying no. Yet another, if something was to happen and you have to take matters into your own hands, then you could be prosecuted for protecting yourself. I point out to you, Maria, that according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, trucking is the -- at least, it was in 2018 the most deadly profession followed by construction workers, farmers, ranchers and maintenance workers.</p><p>I will point out that on that cdllife.com website, one African-American trucker wrote this, and I'll quote him. He said \"we say black lives matter, not only black lives matter. We know that all lives matter, we just need your help with black lives matter right now because black lives are in danger.\" All viewpoints made clear. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jeff, thank you. Jeff Flock this morning. In Indiana, we'll take a short break. More MORNINGS WITH MARIA when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Lawmakers in Washington sending a clear signal to Beijing, they will not stand by in the face of China's human rights abuses. Congress overwhelmingly passing the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, sanctioning Chinese officials for forcibly detaining up to 2 million ethnic Muslims in internment camps.</p><p>Some are pushing the Trump administration to go even further. Joining me right now is Attorney, Co-founder and Board Chairman of the Uyghur Human Rights Project, Nury Turkel. Nury, it's good to have you this morning, thanks very much for joining us. And we should point out your parents were among those in Uyghur camps at one point or your -- some in your family. Explain the connection.</p><p>NURY TURKEL, ATTORNEY &amp; CO-FOUNDER, UYGHUR HUMAN RIGHTS PROJECT: Thank you very much, Maria, good to be with you. Actually, I was born in the re- education camp at the height of the cultural revolution. But the Uyghur suffering has been going on as long as I have been breathing. To the Chinese government, the Uyghur people are different, being different is unacceptable.</p><p>Therefore, the Uyghur people has to go through what they call as the transformation process, which is one of the key objectives of the Chinese government towards the Uyghur people, to go through this human engineering that we're seeing in 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So explain what has taken place, Nury. I mean, you say that the U.S. should sanction Chinese officials and Congress should pass a second bill for anyone involved in this. In other words, there are individuals who want to study their own religion, whether it be Muslim, Tibetan, whatever, that's not allowed in China. So, they put people -- lock these people up in camps and force them to study Chinese culture. What else are they doing to those people, Nury?</p><p>TURKEL: The U.S. ambassador for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback said it best that the Chinese Communist Party is on a war -- unsafe. So any western religion, Islamic, Christianity, to the Chinese government have been perceived as a sign of disloyalty. So, as long as you practice religion, as long as you believe in something that is not in line with Xi Jinping's thoughts in these days, that there's a thing called Xi Jinping thoughts.</p><p>And also as long as you maintain your religious and ethnic background practices, way of life, like the Tibetans and Uyghurs, the Chinese government see you as a potential threat. In the last three years, the Chinese government through a \"legislative process\", quote, unquote, much like the one that they put in place for Hong Kong, legitimized its operation, criminalizing over 40 behaviors that are acceptable, cherished and protected in civilized society, such as growing beard, wearing head scarves, adhering to a certain diet and encouraging that children to stay in their marriage within the ethnic group.</p><p>So that kind of basic forms of social behavior, cultural appreciation has been criminalized by the Communist Party and Xi Jinping's China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, we heard stories of you know, for example, during Ramadan, officers going over there and forcing them to eat pork. I'm talking about serious human rights abuses, slave labor. Are you seeing any of that at these camps? Explain what goes on at those camps, Nury, because there are some people out there who refer to them as concentration camps which is obviously an incredibly aggressive way to, you know, name these camps. How do you see it?</p><p>TURKEL: Three things are happening in Xi Jinping's China. One, since late 2016 under the leadership of Chen Quanguo who used to be the head of the Communist Party in Tibet, the Chinese government turned an area that is known as East Turkestan to the Uyghurs and known as Xinjiang by the Chinese government into an open air prison-like environment.</p><p>They built a pervasive surveillance apparatus, monitoring every aspect of Uyghur lives and also engaging in mass detention of the Uyghurs into the modern day concentration camps. Those concentration camps that the Chinese government built share a lot of commonality with the ones that we have seen them in history. And then third, the Chinese government through his re- education camp process, concentration camp, and now the labor camps, polluted the global supply chain.</p><p>So if you're buying anything made in China, cotton products, there's a chance -- there's a high likelihood that they have been made in the forced labor camps. As being recorded --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow --</p><p>TURKEL: Over 80 percent of the cotton products made in China are sourced in the Uyghur region. One quarter of the world's supply chain made in that part of the world made up of cotton --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>TURKEL: Likely or possibly been produced by forced labor. So slavery is back. Whenever the cotton is being mentioned, the American people can relate to that history. So, it is disturbing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>TURKEL: That the Chinese government is using the Uyghurs, particularly since COVID, they transferred a large number of Uyghurs based on the \"China Morning Post\", and also \"Radio for Asia\", and large numbers of Uyghurs have been transferred into the coastal assembly lines to work and fill up the labor shortage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my goodness, really tough stories. Real quick, before you go, Nury, you said at the top of this interview you were born in the middle of this. How did you get out?</p><p>TURKEL: I was -- my mother was six months pregnant when she was detained for what they call the political history. So we spent -- I was born in the captivity. My mother was cast down because of the beating and abuses that she suffered. And we were released several months after I was born. So I suffered a very extensive medical condition. So, you know, that's the different type of camp that we have seen in history, it was mostly focused on ideology.</p><p>But the current camps that the Chinese government set up in the last three years has a racist purpose and a genocidal --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK --</p><p>TURKEL: Intention.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really hard stuff to take. I'm sorry that you had to endure all of that, Nury, and we will watch the progress here. President Trump expected to sign that into law, the Uyghur Bill. Nury Turkel, thanks very much for your insights this morning and for joining us with all of that. Nury Turkel joining us there.</p><p>Quick break and then the U.S. jobs market attempting to recover, we're taking a look at how and in terms of radiology, this is emerging as an up and coming industry for American jobs post-pandemic. We're going to tell you what training skills are needed. Then keeping big tech in check, Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos reportedly agreeing to testify on Capitol Hill amid anti-trust investigations into big technology companies. All the details right after this. Stay with us.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NEWS HOST: Welcome back to Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 16. Your top stories right now 7:32 AM on the East Coast.</p><p>Boosting the American economy, the Federal Reserve buy individual corporate bonds and the White House is reportedly working on a $1 trillion infrastructure package leading to a global rally this morning.

The BOJ also taking action, increasing lending to cash strapped businesses. They went from 700 billion to $1 trillion in aid from the Bank of Japan.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's Jeff Bezos set to make his first appearance before Congress. Cheryl Casone with those details right now. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It's going to be something Maria. Good morning again. Well, according to The New York Times, Amazon lawyers have told lawmakers Bezos will testify before the House Judiciary Committee as part of its anti-trust investigation into Big Tech companies.</p><p>Lawmakers are expected to ask Bezos to respond to claims that his company uses its power against small businesses that sell on its site. Those third party sellers and he will likely be asked about alleged mistreatment of warehouse workers during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>That hearing which could include other Big Tech CEOs is expected to take place sometime this summer. Ahead of the opening bell shows the Amazon were up more than one percent right now.</p><p>Well, United Airlines rolling out a strict new facemask policy, starting this Thursday. If you're not wearing a mask, you're going to be denied boarding and placed on an internal travel restriction list. Mask will be given to passengers if they don't have one and passengers will also have to complete a health self-assessment form.</p><p>Airlines have been requiring customers to wear masks on board since May and most passengers, they say have complied. Stock up about 8 percent right now. United like other major airlines trying to recover from the pandemic's effect on air travel.</p><p>30 percent of United flights likely are going to be in the air, next month. Just 30 percent.

Maria, if I was with you in the same studio, I'd bring you one but alas, we are socially distanced. So we can just think about it together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: See, another impact of this pandemic and shut down. There you go. There's that too, Cheryl. Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: you bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We got a market rallying this morning. Futures indicating a triple digit move right out of the gate. Dow industrials up 437 points right now on reports that the Trump administration is considering more stimulus, this time a $1 trillion infrastructure package. Most of the money set aside for traditional projects like roads and bridges but there could be fun for 5G wireless infrastructure and rural broadband as well, we understand.</p><p>Joining me right now over the phone is Cornerstone Macros Co-founder and Chief Economist Nancy Lazar. Nancy, it is always a pleasure to talk to you. Thanks very much for joining me and I am looking at your most recent report, talking about some of the flattening of the curve and the flattening of the spread.</p><p>Are you not worried that as the economy reopens then we are or could be seeing spikes in certain corners of the country and these worries over a second wave of this disease, Nancy?</p><p>NANCY LAZAR, CO-FOUNDER, CORNERSTONE MACROS &amp; CHIEF ECONOMIST (on the phone): Well, there's no question you need to be worried about it but I still think you're going to get an economic recovery because there has been so much support from the federal government and indeed you're opening up the economy.</p><p>So I'm calling it a wavy recovery but I think it is going to be a recovery none the less and I do think we're getting a big rebound in a lot of the economic data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we were just talking about the second quarter and one of our guests were looking for a contraction of 28 percent in the second quarter. How do you see it in terms of growth, this year Nancy?</p><p>Do you think that that is going to be the most sizable contraction second quarter but then we see growth in the second half of the year as the administration seems to believe?</p><p>LAZAR: I do. I think this is probably going to be the shortest recession on record and I have also GDP data of 25 percent for the - for the second quarter but as you know, the May data have already turned over and we're going to get more of that data this morning at 8:30, with retail - with retail sales.</p><p>So yes, 2Q is going to be massively negative but I think that's old news. The new news is we're seeing this big rebound in economic data which to be sure, will slow down as we go into the back half of the year, potentially become a second - a second wave but none the less recovery and a sustainable recovery here and around - around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the Federal Reserve and what we're going today and tomorrow from J. Powell. He's delivering his semi-annual policy report to Congress. The Central Bank said to begin using its new secondary market corporate credit facility to buy individual corporate bonds from eligible issuers. The Fed opened at $600 billion mainstreet lending program on Monday.</p><p>That's benefiting small and midsize businesses, Nancy. Do you think these new facilities are going to keep the economy get it as you say growing in the second half? Give us your take on what we might hear from J. Powell today.</p><p>LAZAR: I think it's perfectly clear, don't fight the Fed. I know that's a bad, an old cliche but I think it is very, very true from the Fed to the BOJ to the ECB, policy makers around the world arms are going to make sure to increase the odds that indeed this recovery can continue.</p><p>And the reason that I'm - I'm potentially more confident than - than some is because I've already seen signs that all this stimulus in which they are - they are doing more and I think that will be the message today. They will do whatever it takes to strive you said years ago.</p><p>You're already seen evidence that the stimulus is working, you've got a very clear rebound in house, very strong rebound in housing unfolding. We haven't seen that early pick up in housing in 20 years. That is the last - the last expansion, housing did not rebound for obvious reasons.</p><p>You were unwinding - unwinding the bubble so housing rebounding early in expansion is a classic sign that policy is working. Consumers are confident and obviously investing in a large - in a large ticket item so yes, policy is already working. They're going to continue to do more, not only here but around the world.</p><p>And that's important that we're seeing global stimulus because we're not the loan you know man in a forest. We've got a lot of support from policy makers around the world, increasing the odds that this is a synchronized global recovery, not just the recovery here in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, really fascinating stuff that the Federal Reserve is going to be buying bonds from companies like Microsoft, Apple and yet you hear what J. Powell said last week that some companies, some people will not be able to go back to the jobs that they had, that this is going to be a long recovery.</p><p>Nancy, what are you telling clients in terms of allocating capital in an environment where there is this kind of uncertainty and a sizeable amount of debt once we get out of this?</p><p>LAZAR: So first, I don't mean to downplay at all what's going on with Covid, it's a unique crisis to be sure but coming out of every recession, there is always a part of the economy that struggles. We all remember the housing about when housing was not a part of the last expansion.</p><p>If you look historically, manufacturing from 2002 to 2007 during that expansion, manufacturing jobs declined by two million so I'll stop but I can go back historically. There is always a headwind coming out of recession. This is a unique head wind and that it wasn't caused and that you didn't have a particular bubble bursting in this recession.</p><p>But there is a consequence of the leisure industry being a headwind to employment going forward. The last 2010-2019 expansion, employment did not hit a new high for four years from its trough and quite frankly, and that was in part because of the headwinds from housing and that's probably going to be the same thing today.</p><p>Quite frankly, I had forgotten that employment was so weak for so long in the last expansion because by the back half of the expansion, obviously things were pretty - were pretty robust. So yes, there's going to be an adjustment coming out of this crisis. The key is that the Federal Reserve is encouraging companies to potentially reinvest in this country of two special support for capital spending in this country.</p><p>One, corporate bond yields prior to the Fed moves yesterday were already down over 150 basis points. They're going to be down even more given what the Fed announced yesterday. That's important for capital spending and then back and obviously the on-shoring theme is also important for capital spending.</p><p>So my point is there will be new drivers of growth, I think one will be manufacturing in part because of the capital spending is likely to happen for many, many reasons and - and to be sure this onshoring theme is one of them because that's how you actually create new jobs.</p><p>So I'm trying to look through and - and it's not again, downplay the Covid crisis but look through it, look longer term. Are there longer term growth drivers in this country and the answer is yes. Capital spending, manufacturing are going to create jobs and as well as housing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you make so many important points especially since we know that Peter Navarro is the point man on trying to work on getting manufacturing supply chains from China, out of China and in the United States or elsewhere.</p><p>We're going to need that manufacturing base to get fired up again, Nancy. We love hearing from you this morning. Thank you so much. We'll be watching your research certainly. Nancy Lazar joining us from Cornerstone Macros. Thank you Nancy. Have a good day. Coming up, the U.S. jobs market attempting to recover. We're taking a look at how radiology is an emerging and up and coming industry for American jobs, post pandemic.</p><p>That's coming up and then so long standardized testing. Bye - bye. Another major university joins the long list of colleges not requiring the ACT and SAT exams. We'll tell you which one. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The next jobs in America. The coronavirus pandemic creating an enhanced focus on medicine and prevention and a huge amount of job opportunities in radiology. The specialty is one of the vital services used to help diagnose the most severe cases of Covid-19.</p><p>Joining me right now is Zwagner-Pesiri Radiology, Chief Operating Officer and licensed to X-ray, MRI and CT technologist, Robert Day. Robert, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. Tell us about radiology jobs. What types of jobs will be in the most demand?</p><p>Sure, good morning. So it was actually a boon for us during the pandemic. One of the things at the very beginning on the onset of the pandemic, when testing was at a premium. One of the things that we saw personally here at the practice was that chest X-rays were actually what we were using to help diagnose positive cases of Covid.</p><p>It became very important to kind of help direct the patients that were having trouble getting into the hospital or having trouble becoming - being tested, we were using chest X-rays, the most basic form of what we do.</p><p>I mean, radiology is you know, been around forever. It's a growing field as the modalities kind of develop and the technology advances but right now X- ray is something that's blooming in the medical field.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I mean you know just about a year ago, I was on doing a special on AI and everything I did on AI on radiology pointed to radiology jobs are going to get targeted by AI, that Artificial Intelligence can understand how to operate radiology machines and that people would be out of work and now all of a sudden we're seeing job opportunities in radiology.</p><p>What about technology and AI replacing those jobs? Is this a short term boost in job opportunities in radiology or do you see this longer lasting?</p><p>DAY: I see it as something that you know believe it or not, AI's been part of part of the field for a while. AI is something that we use to enhance and streamline workflows but at the end of the day, radiology is a very hands-on, patient-orientated, clinical you know, job where you still, even with AI helping us do our jobs, making this more efficient, we still need technologist to you know, talk to and put the patients on the table, understand why we're doing a study and you know the AI is going to help us and enhance what we're doing.</p><p>But it will be a long, long road to actually replace the technologist.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So real good before you go, real quick before you go Robert, what are the skillsets and training that one needs to get to get a job in radiology?</p><p>DAY: Yes, it's you know kind of the sweet spot because you know, I always explain to people, it's kind of almost like doing an apprenticeship so you do need a 2-year Associate's degree to become a licensed X-ray, tech CT, MRI, nuclear medicine or sonography. It's a 2-year degree that's required.</p><p>But a lot of the training is not so much didactic. It's more of a hands-on, clinical training so it's kind of like an apprenticeship. It's kind of like learning how to become an electrician. Most of the training is actually done, doing the procedure so it's a - part of it's you know, that that skill of education where you going to need to go and learn some anatomy and physiology and physics.</p><p>But most of the training, the really intense training, what will make you a proficient and a highly skilled technologist is actually hands-on, doing the job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, we will leave it there. Robert, it's great to get your insights on this. Thanks so much. Robert Day joining us there on opportunities in radiology. Still ahead so long standardized testing. Another major university joining the long list of colleges not requiring the ACT or SAT exams. We'll say which ones right after this. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the morning buzz. First up, Harvard University dropping standardized test requirements for 2021. Applicants will not have to submit ACT or SAT scores due to the coronavirus disruptions, Cabot, your reaction.</p><p>CABOT PHILIPS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUSREFORM.ORG: Well, this is nothing to do with coronavirus. They're trying to make it sound like well, the SAT tests have been disrupted around the country. That's why we're doing this but this has a lot more to do with them wanting to take away this requirement. We covered the campus reform, how Harvard faced a big lawsuit earlier in the year because they were discriminating its Asian students.</p><p>The average Asian student has a score 220 points on average, higher than the average student of other races. They faced that lawsuit, it's bad publicity for them and so they're trying to remove anything that's politically incorrect.</p><p>And in this case they say and they feel in many ways that the SAT test can be discriminatory to students of different backgrounds even though I think a lot of people look at the SAT tests as a perfect barometer where all other things are taken into account and it's a way to grade students based on their ability.</p><p>So this is happening around the country. I think a lot of other schools are going to be following suit now that Harvard has set the precedent because you know, universities are facing kind of a politically incorrect you know, accusations because they put so much weight on the SAT.</p><p>So this is going to be the new growing trend in academia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, really interesting actually and then next, United Airlines doubles down on its flyers. United now making wearing a mask mandatory to fly as of Thursday. Passengers not comply will be denied boarding and placed on an internal travel restriction list. Dagen, what do you think?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: How far are they going to go in policing this because I'd say a solid one third of the people I see walking around New York City wearing masks have them below their nose, is that really the way to wear it?</p><p>So now the job of the flight attendant will not only to be to make sure people have masks on, to make sure that they are positioned properly. Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jon, what do you think?</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: You know, I'm interested in that - interested in that Harvard case. I mean, there's been a lot of debate over the years about the SAT and ACT and whether they're discriminatory by race or income level. There's a lawsuit in California over this.</p><p>So to a certain extent yes, this - I think this is going to be a test case of whether schools can you know process all these applications without depending too much on SAT and ACT.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How about this? Tom Brady's new look, we're going to see it. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers asking fans over social media when the team should release photos of Brady in his new uniform. Brady responding, simply saying, tomorrow. What do you think about that, Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'm a Giants' fan, you know. Good luck Tom Brady down in Florida, in Florida. I hope I never have to deal with you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh God. Dagen, you want to see his new uniform?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sure. If - I think it's probably makes more palatable shirtless.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A vision to go to commercial break on. Thank you everybody. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020061602cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:604Y-FV81-DXH2-64K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7120\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 16, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>U.S. Fed</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police Reform</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Seattle</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Covid- 19</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Harvard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SAT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ACT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United Airlines</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jeff Bezos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Denver Broncos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FanDuel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fed</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>stimulus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tom Brady</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>radiology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Hearings &amp;
