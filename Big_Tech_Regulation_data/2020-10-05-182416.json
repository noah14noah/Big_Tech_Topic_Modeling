ELIZABETH WARREN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: OK.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Because you're one of the few candidates with a really significant, clear message that you have lived throughout your life and you have worked for the same issues, on the same issues since you were in college, in graduate school. And I love that. So I want to ask you some questions about other issues that would -- you would confront as president. Rapid-fire. </p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: So just your gut. Your gut on these core things. </p><p>So, as a parent, how much sympathy would you have for these parents who are embroiled in this alleged cheating scandal? </p><p>WARREN: Zero. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Zero. OK.</p><p>Would \"President Warren\" ground the 737 Max 8 right now? </p><p>WARREN: Yes. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Absolutely.</p><p>Is Brexit good for the U.S. and why? </p><p>WARREN: No. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Why?</p><p>WARREN: Because having our close ally, Great Britain, in such economic turmoil is not helpful to us. We need our allies to be strong. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: How would \"President Elizabeth Warren\" neutralize the North Korean nuclear and missile programs when the last four presidents have not been able to do so? </p><p>WARREN: Boy, it is a tough one and we just have to start out by acknowledging that. But the first thing you do, is you don't head off to a summit without doing your homework. </p><p>The tough part has got to be sitting down with the North Koreans. And it's the pain-staking work of diplomacy where you figure out what it is that they need, what it is that we can supply, how many allies we can pull into this to bring pressure on North Korea. The idea of simply giving away to North Korea what they want, which is the big photo-op with the president of the United States, and get the president of the United States to say what China has always wanted them to say about how provocative it is that we're doing military exercises with our allies, the South Koreans and the Japanese, is just giving things up without getting anything in return. I guarantee that's not a path to success. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Yes, there wasn't a -- it doesn't appear that there was a lot of advance work for these summits. </p><p>WARREN: You know, and that's the problem. You can't walk into these things and somehow think that a personality, an eye-to-eye and sending love letters is going to take care of it. It's hard work. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Is Saudi Arabia and ally of the United States? </p><p>WARREN: Well, it is officially an ally of the United States, but it is an ally where I think we really have to keep pushing on this relationship. Right now it's engaged in a war in Yemen that the United States has gotten itself deeply threaded into without any authorization from Congress. </p><p>In addition, the killing of a journalist is just a reminder that Saudi Arabia is a government right now that does not believe in accountability. You know, that's the job of the journalist, is to hold people -- hold officials accountable. And they wipe one out and so far the response of the Trump administration has been nothing. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: So what would be your public position on Saudi Arabia right now? What would you be saying and telegraphing? </p><p>WARREN: So -- so it's both halfs. The killing of Khashoggi is absolutely unacceptable. There needs to be some accountability in the government for that. </p><p>But the second would also be to say no on Yemen. We are not going to supply arms. We're not going to be helpful for them for a war in Yemen. </p><p>Yemen is now one of the biggest manmade humanitarian crises of the last half century. And the United States plays a role in this through its ally, Saudi Arabia. For a long time we were actually helping them pick bombing sights even. We refueled their airplanes. We've sold them the weapons. We're working hand in glove with them in a war we have no business being part of. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Can you name one, two or three Pentagon programs that you think could be eliminated? </p><p>WARREN: Hmm, that's interesting --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: That's a good one. That's a tricker.</p><p>WARREN: Yes, it is. And I have to think about what -- what the programs are. But let me -- can I describe it this way and tell you what the --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Yes.</p><p>WARREN: The range is? </p><p>We have to stop the Pentagon from building the best possible 20th century military and urge the Pentagon over to the 21st century military. And here's my example of that. </p><p>A lot of new tech. A lot of new cyber. The 21st century threats and the 21st century responses are not places where a 20th century military has real strength. It's much more about conventional weapons and large armies and so on and, you know, the ability to engage in lots of shooting wars around the world. </p><p>And the problem kind of coherent problem at the Pentagon is that there's always somebody in the room to defend an existing program, no matter how old it is, no matter how much circumstances have changed. Somebody is at the head of that program. Somebody hands out the dollars to the defense industry that supports that program.</p><p>There's rarely somebody in the room for the next idea, for the place we need to be. And yet to have an effective military, we've got to be on the front edge, not the back edge, of development. </p><p>So I can tell you where I'd spend a lot more money, it's only a very small part of the Pentagon budget, is on research, it's on development, it's on cyber. That's the place we've got to get the Pentagon more focused in that direction. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Back to rapid-fire. </p><p>WARREN: Sure. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: What has Donald Trump done that you think could be considered impeachable? </p><p>WARREN: Oh, come on now. No, but here's -- here's my rule on this one. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: OK. </p><p>WARREN: We're about to get the Mueller report. And --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Back up.</p><p>WARREN: We have a lot of other information. Let's wait until we've got the Mueller report, combine it with everything else we've seen, then we'll know what to do. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: So you agree with Nancy Pelosi's approach on this?</p><p>WARREN: I'm not sure where Nancy is when she says --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Well, she said he's not worth it at that point. So divisive.</p><p>WARREN: No. It's -- that's not the point. What I see is that the Mueller report is coming. Let's all take a look at the Mueller report. And when the Mueller report comes, we'll know exactly what to do. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: What was wrong, if anything, with the statements that Representative Ilhan Omar made about Israel? </p><p>WARREN: You know, the way I see it is that we should -- we are a great deliberative body in Congress. And it is important for us to be able to debate issues, to do so respectfully. Any anti-Semitism or Islamophobia should be called out and condemned. But when should encourage our members --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: So what she said were troupes and they were not worth --</p><p>WARREN: Well, when she'd doing that, then -- then that's a problem. But the -- but here's -- here's the part I -- I really want to make strongly. We've got to be a place that can have robust discussion. Not anti-Semitism, not Islamophobia, but robust discussion. And that's what we need to have. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: What is it about Bernie Sanders that makes him so popular with progressives? </p><p>WARREN: You know, because he fights for what he believes in. Bernie and I have been friends forever and ever.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Bernie's at the top of the list in these polls right now --</p><p>WARREN: That's right.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Except for Biden, if he runs. </p><p>WARREN: That's right. But, you know, I've been friends with Bernie from long, long before I ever ended up in politics. And Bernie's out there fighting for what he believes in. And I think that -- that means a lot to people. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: All right, two -- two more. </p><p>Is Mike Pence an honorable man? </p><p>WARREN: No. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: OK. Would you like to expound upon that? </p><p>WARREN: Sure. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Yes.</p><p>WARREN: Anyone who engages in the kind of homophobia and attacks on people who are different from himself is not an honorable person. That's not -- that's not what honorable people do. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Should Bill Clinton have left office after having an affair with a much younger staffer in the White House? </p><p>WARREN: I don't know. I can't go back and litigate the 1990s. That one -- that one is beyond me.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Did the 1990s get us here, though, to an extent? </p><p>WARREN: Of course it did. And -- but I don't have the time machine to go back and change the '90s. All I can do is change this world going forward. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: OK, Willie Geist, you can take over from here.</p><p>Willie.</p><p>WARREN: Go, Willie. </p><p>WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC CO-HOST: OK, senator, good to see you, as always.</p><p>I want to ask you about your \"Medium\" post last week --</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>GEIST: Where you talked about the breakup of big tech. The headline is, it's time to break up Amazon, Google and FaceBook. I think your argument was a little more nuance perhaps in the headline. Can you explain what you meant there? </p><p>WARREN: Sure. Let's use the example of Amazon. Amazon runs two kinds of businesses. One is it runs a platform. And that's the place where all the small businesses come and they trade and they -- buyer and sellers meet. And Amazon runs that platform, but also sucks out tons of information from every single transaction. </p><p>It then uses that information that nobody else is privy to, to look out and say, oh, there's a profitable business. We think we'll go into competition with them. And so it then puts out a product in competition with the pillow sales guy and then moves the profitable business back to page six and puts Amazon right at the front, Amazon's own business. </p><p>So, the way I see this, it's a little like baseball. We'll use a baseball analogy here. You can be the umpire, that's the platform, or you can have a team in the game, that's running these individual businesses that meet on the platform. But you don't get to do both simultaneously. So I think those ought to be broken apart. </p><p>GEIST: So another way to explain that too is let's take Apple. Obviously a very popular company. It has an app store. </p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>GEIST: Do you believe that Apple should be allowed to sell its own apps on its app store? </p><p>WARREN: So it needs to do one or the other. Either it runs that platform, the app store, or it's selling its own products on the app store, but it doesn't do both of those simultaneously because whenever it does, it has this enormous competitive advantage that wipes out all the other little businesses. In fact, did you know, Willie, that it's now referred to, this zone around folks like Apple and Google and Amazon, anyone that moves into the competition space, it's called the kill zone. And venture capitalists are investing about 20 percent less than they used to on these start-up companies because they know if they go into the kill zone, one of two things will happen. They'll either get gobbled up by the giant or they'll get wiped out by the giant, but they won't have a chance to grow and develop into what they might have been.</p><p>GEIST: So do you believe that Google, Amazon and FaceBook all are monopolies by your definition? </p><p>WARREN: Oh, I -- let's put it this way, they are huge. They have market dominance and they behave like monopolists. And that's a big part of the reason they need to be broken apart. </p><p>Look at -- look at what happened with FaceBook. I don't know about you, but a lot of people are really uneasy about how FaceBook handles their data. </p><p>GEIST: Yes.</p><p>WARREN: So, along comes What's App, right? And What's App says, I tell you what we'll do, we'll give a whole lot better protection for your privacy. And you watch a bunch of people move from FaceBook over to What's App. Now, that puts FaceBook in the position of doing one of two things, either they have to get better to meet the competition, that's what a good, robust market is all about, or, if you're already huge and dominate the field, just buy the competition and take their data. FaceBook, of course, chose to do the latter. They shouldn't be allowed to do that. That is not furthering competition. </p><p>You know, Willie, I believe in markets, but it's when markets have rules, when markets have a cops on the beat to make sure that the giants aren't gobbling up everyone else and eliminating competition. That's when markets work. </p><p>GEIST: So would you have worked to stop, in 2012, FaceBook purchase of Instagram? </p><p>WARREN: Yes. And we can -- here's the thing. We can go back and still do it. It's possible to go back under anti-trust laws and just say, look, we let this merger go through. Often the mergers are on conditions, conditional that they're not going to do this or they're not going to do that, but let the merger go through and look at it and say, it turns out it has anti-competitive effects. And if it has anti-competitive effects, then we can go back and unwind these and break these pieces apart. </p><p>Understand, for anybody who still wants to go on FaceBook and check out their old college roommates or anyone who still wants to go to Amazon and price out 46 coffee makers and get the one that can be delivered in 24 hours, or anybody who wants to go on Google and check out the capital of North Dakota, that will all still be possible. The platforms will still be there. What will be different is that the companies that are selling on those platforms will be in a real marketplace where they compete straight up based on price and service and quality of goods, not having the platform owner able to come in and have this enormous advantage to be able to scoop up all the business and kill off the little businesses, the entrepreneurs and the start-ups. </p><p>GEIST: You know, as you know well, senator, there's been this tension during the presidential campaign and it's come from comments from members of your party who are not running for president in many cases about capitalism versus socialism. And I've been interested to hear you say time and again and one -- you said I'm a capitalist to the bone. You were asked just on Sunday by John Heilemann on the circus (ph) if you were a capitalist. You said, yes, I'm a capitalist. </p><p>WARREN: Yes. </p><p>GEIST: We know how you feel about new government programs, things you're going to add there. </p><p>How do you explain where you are on the question of capitalism/socialism and where do they marry each other? </p><p>WARREN: So, look, I believe in markets. That's where this whole point about tech is all about. I see the benefits that markets can produce. I love the fact that there are a zillion people out there developing new apps or starting new businesses or trying a second one. I think that's fabulous. I think it's great that little businesses are trying to get to be medium sized businesses and medium sized businesses are trying to get to be large businesses. </p><p>But, understand this, markets without rules are theft. And there's got to be rules and there's got to be a cop on the beat. </p><p>You and I go a long way back. You remember back before the crash that what had happened basically was the financial giants had figured out they could make buckets of money by cheating their customers, mortgages, credit cards. And, sure enough, that's what they were doing. The cops on the beat, the regulators, just looked the other way, paid no attention. And the consequence was, big banks made a lot of money. They broke the backs of millions of families and ultimately crashed our economy. That's why we needed rules. </p><p>So, I came in with the idea of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We got that bureau in place. And now you begin to see a much more level playing field. When there's a cop on the beat, those markets start to work again and banks, in that case, are forced to develop their profit models, not on cheating people, but on actually offering a better product.</p><p>Now, Wells Fargo proves they're still willing to get out there and try to cheat people, but at least we had some cops who caught them and have hauled them in and are trying to make changes in the company. That's what it takes. Markets have a lot to produce, but only if they have rules and if they have a cop that's enforcing those rules. </p><p>GEIST: So, senator, despite its flaws, some of which you've laid out there, do you believe capitalism over the course of history has been a force for good? </p><p>WARREN: So I -- yes, I do. I think it also, when -- when it doesn't work, it's been a force for bad, but that's been true of every form of government that we can identify, that we've gotten it right sometimes and gotten it wrong sometimes. When you let markets work with rules and with people on the beat to enforce those rules, we can produce a lot of wealth in this country. That's what we've done for a very long time. We have to recognize there are areas where markets don't work. </p><p>Health care, for example. Somebody having a heart attack is not somebody who's going to shop around to six different emergency rooms and say, which one is going to give me the best price? </p><p>Their -- education. Public education. That's not a place where a market works. </p><p>But there are places where markets do work. Coffee makers, pet pillows. I'm in. We need robust markets for those. That's how we produce. </p><p>By the way, that's how we ended up producing the Amazon's and Googles and FaceBooks of the world is the fact that markets could grow these incredible, incredible businesses. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: So let me close by asking you, a lot of people seem to think the Democrats are most interested in having someone who can beat Trump and Trump is a street fighter and he plays by unfair rules. I feel like, just my opinion here, that Hillary Clinton was a bit boxed in on the debate stage, especially on issues pertaining to misogyny and sexism. I just feel like it's -- it was an area where she was extremely uncomfortable. </p><p>How would nominee Elizabeth Warren handle President Trump on the debate stage? Would you call him out on his misogyny? Would you call him out on his treatment of women? Would you call him out on his record? And how would you fight back when he calls you names? </p><p>WARREN: So I'm not afraid --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: I want to know what this looks like. </p><p>WARREN: OK. Let's start with, I am not afraid of anyone, and particularly not Donald Trump. People have told me, for most of my life, what's too hard to get done. And my response has always been to fight back. The consumer agency, right? So, after the big crash -- </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by Elizabeth Warren. </p><p>WARREN: That's right. I -- I came in and said, we need this agency. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Yes.</p><p>WARREN: You know what people in Washington said to me? They said two things. The first one is, that's a great idea. That would actually change the world. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Yes. </p><p>WARREN: The second is, don't do it. Don't even try because it's too hard. You won't be able to get it done. You'll be up against the banks. They'll spend millions of dollars a day lobbying against this thing. And you know what my response was, I just got in the fight. And I got in the fight and I stayed in the fight. And today the consumer agency is the law of the land.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI: Are you afraid to get into his fight and to get into his face when one needs to? </p><p>WARREN: Not even a little bit. </p><p>BRZEZINSKI: OK. All right, you've got it go, I know. You've got a train to catch. </p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank you very much. It's great to have you.

ELIZABETH WARREN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC ANCHOR</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]     MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC ANCHOR:  And let's, right away, bring inDemocratic Presidential Candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren ofMassachusetts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I have Willie with me, but I'll start things out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'd like to try something different --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  OK.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Because you're one of the few candidates with areally significant, clear message that you have lived throughoutyour life and you have worked for the same issues, on the sameissues since you were in college, in graduate school. And I lovethat. So I want to ask you some questions about other issues thatwould -- you would confront as president. Rapid-fire.</p><p>WARREN:  OK.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So just your gut. Your gut on these core things.</p><p>So, as a parent, how much sympathy would you have for theseparents who are embroiled in this alleged cheating scandal?</p><p>WARREN:  Zero.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Zero. OK.</p><p>Would \"President Warren\" ground the 737 Max 8 right now?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Absolutely.</p><p>Is Brexit good for the U.S. and why?</p><p>WARREN:  No.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Why?</p><p>WARREN:  Because having our close ally, Great Britain, in sucheconomic turmoil is not helpful to us. We need our allies to bestrong.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  How would \"President Elizabeth Warren\" neutralizethe North Korean nuclear and missile programs when the last fourpresidents have not been able to do so?</p><p>WARREN:  Boy, it is a tough one and we just have to start out byacknowledging that. But the first thing you do, is you don't headoff to a summit without doing your homework.</p><p>The tough part has got to be sitting down with the NorthKoreans. And it's the pain-staking work of diplomacy where youfigure out what it is that they need, what it is that we can supply,how many allies we can pull into this to bring pressure on NorthKorea. The idea of simply giving away to North Korea what they want,which is the big photo-op with the president of the United States,and get the president of the United States to say what China hasalways wanted them to say about how provocative it is that we'redoing military exercises with our allies, the South Koreans and theJapanese, is just giving things up without getting anything inreturn. I guarantee that's not a path to success.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes, there wasn't a -- it doesn't appear that therewas a lot of advance work for these summits.</p><p>WARREN:  You know, and that's the problem. You can't walk intothese things and somehow think that a personality, an eye-to-eye andsending love letters is going to take care of it. It's hard work.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Is Saudi Arabia and ally of the United States?</p><p>WARREN:  Well, it is officially an ally of the United States,but it is an ally where I think we really have to keep pushing onthis relationship. Right now it's engaged in a war in Yemen that theUnited States has gotten itself deeply threaded into without anyauthorization from Congress.</p><p>In addition, the killing of a journalist is just a reminderthat Saudi Arabia is a government right now that does not believe inaccountability. You know, that's the job of the journalist, is tohold people -- hold officials accountable. And they wipe one out andso far the response of the Trump administration has been nothing.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So what would be your public position on SaudiArabia right now? What would you be saying and telegraphing?</p><p>WARREN:  So -- so it's both halfs. The killing of Khashoggi isabsolutely unacceptable. There needs to be some accountability inthe government for that.</p><p>But the second would also be to say no on Yemen. We are notgoing to supply arms. We're not going to be helpful for them for awar in Yemen.</p><p>Yemen is now one of the biggest manmade humanitarian crises ofthe last half century. And the United States plays a role in thisthrough its ally, Saudi Arabia. For a long time we were actuallyhelping them pick bombing sights even. We refueled their airplanes.We've sold them the weapons. We're working hand in glove with themin a war we have no business being part of.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Can you name one, two or three Pentagon programsthat you think could be eliminated?</p><p>WARREN:  Hmm, that's interesting --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  That's a good one. That's a tricker.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes, it is. And I have to think about what -- what theprograms are. But let me -- can I describe it this way and tell youwhat the --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  The range is?</p><p>We have to stop the Pentagon from building the best possible20th century military and urge the Pentagon over to the 21st centurymilitary. And here's my example of that.</p><p>A lot of new tech. A lot of new cyber. The 21st century threatsand the 21st century responses are not places where a 20th centurymilitary has real strength. It's much more about conventionalweapons and large armies and so on and, you know, the ability toengage in lots of shooting wars around the world.</p><p>And the problem kind of coherent problem at the Pentagon isthat there's always somebody in the room to defend an existingprogram, no matter how old it is, no matter how much circumstanceshave changed. Somebody is at the head of that program. Somebodyhands out the dollars to the defense industry that supports thatprogram.</p><p>There's rarely somebody in the room for the next idea, for theplace we need to be. And yet to have an effective military, we'vegot to be on the front edge, not the back edge, of development.</p><p>So I can tell you where I'd spend a lot more money, it's only avery small part of the Pentagon budget, is on research, it's ondevelopment, it's on cyber. That's the place we've got to get thePentagon more focused in that direction.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Back to rapid-fire.</p><p>WARREN:  Sure.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  What has Donald Trump done that you think could beconsidered impeachable?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, come on now. No, but here's -- here's my rule onthis one.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  OK.</p><p>WARREN:  We're about to get the Mueller report. And --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Back up.</p><p>WARREN:  We have a lot of other information. Let's wait untilwe've got the Mueller report, combine it with everything else we'veseen, then we'll know what to do.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So you agree with Nancy Pelosi's approach on this?</p><p>WARREN:  I'm not sure where Nancy is when she says --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Well, she said he's not worth it at that point. Sodivisive.</p><p>WARREN:  No. It's -- that's not the point. What I see is thatthe Mueller report is coming. Let's all take a look at the Muellerreport. And when the Mueller report comes, we'll know exactly whatto do.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  What was wrong, if anything, with the statementsthat Representative Ilhan Omar made about Israel?</p><p>WARREN:  You know, the way I see it is that we should -- we area great deliberative body in Congress. And it is important for us tobe able to debate issues, to do so respectfully. Any anti-Semitismor Islamophobia should be called out and condemned. But when shouldencourage our members --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So what she said were troupes and they were notworth --</p><p>WARREN:  Well, when she'd doing that, then -- then that's aproblem. But the -- but here's -- here's the part I -- I really wantto make strongly. We've got to be a place that can have robustdiscussion. Not anti-Semitism, not Islamophobia, but robustdiscussion. And that's what we need to have.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  What is it about Bernie Sanders that makes him sopopular with progressives?</p><p>WARREN:  You know, because he fights for what he believes in.Bernie and I have been friends forever and ever.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Bernie's at the top of the list in these pollsright now --</p><p>WARREN:  That's right.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Except for Biden, if he runs.</p><p>WARREN:  That's right. But, you know, I've been friends withBernie from long, long before I ever ended up in politics. AndBernie's out there fighting for what he believes in. And I thinkthat -- that means a lot to people.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  All right, two -- two more.</p><p>Is Mike Pence an honorable man?</p><p>WARREN:  No.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  OK. Would you like to expound upon that?</p><p>WARREN:  Sure.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  Anyone who engages in the kind of homophobia andattacks on people who are different from himself is not an honorableperson. That's not -- that's not what honorable people do.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Should Bill Clinton have left office after havingan affair with a much younger staffer in the White House?</p><p>WARREN:  I don't know. I can't go back and litigate the 1990s.That one -- that one is beyond me.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Did the 1990s get us here, though, to an extent?</p><p>WARREN:  Of course it did. And -- but I don't have the timemachine to go back and change the '90s. All I can do is change thisworld going forward.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  OK, Willie Geist, you can take over from here.</p><p>Willie.</p><p>WARREN:  Go, Willie.</p><p>WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC CO-HOST:  OK, senator, good to see you, asalways.</p><p>I want to ask you about your \"Medium\" post last week --</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>GEIST:  Where you talked about the breakup of big tech. Theheadline is, it's time to break up Amazon, Google and FaceBook. Ithink your argument was a little more nuance perhaps in theheadline. Can you explain what you meant there?</p><p>WARREN:  Sure. Let's use the example of Amazon. Amazon runs twokinds of businesses. One is it runs a platform. And that's the placewhere all the small businesses come and they trade and they -- buyerand sellers meet. And Amazon runs that platform, but also sucks outtons of information from every single transaction.</p><p>It then uses that information that nobody else is privy to, tolook out and say, oh, there's a profitable business. We think we'llgo into competition with them. And so it then puts out a product incompetition with the pillow sales guy and then moves the profitablebusiness back to page six and puts Amazon right at the front,Amazon's own business.</p><p>So, the way I see this, it's a little like baseball. We'll usea baseball analogy here. You can be the umpire, that's the platform,or you can have a team in the game, that's running these individualbusinesses that meet on the platform. But you don't get to do bothsimultaneously. So I think those ought to be broken apart.</p><p>GEIST:  So another way to explain that too is let's take Apple.Obviously a very popular company. It has an app store.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>GEIST:  Do you believe that Apple should be allowed to sell itsown apps on its app store?</p><p>WARREN:  So it needs to do one or the other. Either it runs thatplatform, the app store, or it's selling its own products on the appstore, but it doesn't do both of those simultaneously becausewhenever it does, it has this enormous competitive advantage thatwipes out all the other little businesses. In fact, did you know,Willie, that it's now referred to, this zone around folks like Appleand Google and Amazon, anyone that moves into the competition space,it's called the kill zone. And venture capitalists are investingabout 20 percent less than they used to on these start-up companiesbecause they know if they go into the kill zone, one of two thingswill happen. They'll either get gobbled up by the giant or they'llget wiped out by the giant, but they won't have a chance to grow anddevelop into what they might have been.</p><p>GEIST:  So do you believe that Google, Amazon and FaceBook allare monopolies by your definition?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, I -- let's put it this way, they are huge. Theyhave market dominance and they behave like monopolists. And that's abig part of the reason they need to be broken apart.</p><p>Look at -- look at what happened with FaceBook. I don't knowabout you, but a lot of people are really uneasy about how FaceBookhandles their data.</p><p>GEIST:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  So, along comes What's App, right? And What's App says,I tell you what we'll do, we'll give a whole lot better protectionfor your privacy. And you watch a bunch of people move from FaceBookover to What's App. Now, that puts FaceBook in the position of doingone of two things, either they have to get better to meet thecompetition, that's what a good, robust market is all about, or, ifyou're already huge and dominate the field, just buy the competitionand take their data. FaceBook, of course, chose to do the latter.They shouldn't be allowed to do that. That is not furtheringcompetition.</p><p>You know, Willie, I believe in markets, but it's when marketshave rules, when markets have a cops on the beat to make sure thatthe giants aren't gobbling up everyone else and eliminatingcompetition. That's when markets work.</p><p>GEIST:  So would you have worked to stop, in 2012, FaceBookpurchase of Instagram?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes. And we can -- here's the thing. We can go back andstill do it. It's possible to go back under anti-trust laws and justsay, look, we let this merger go through. Often the mergers are onconditions, conditional that they're not going to do this or they'renot going to do that, but let the merger go through and look at itand say, it turns out it has anti-competitive effects. And if it hasanti-competitive effects, then we can go back and unwind these andbreak these pieces apart.</p><p>Understand, for anybody who still wants to go on FaceBook andcheck out their old college roommates or anyone who still wants togo to Amazon and price out 46 coffee makers and get the one that canbe delivered in 24 hours, or anybody who wants to go on Google andcheck out the capital of North Dakota, that will all still bepossible. The platforms will still be there. What will be differentis that the companies that are selling on those platforms will be ina real marketplace where they compete straight up based on price andservice and quality of goods, not having the platform owner able tocome in and have this enormous advantage to be able to scoop up allthe business and kill off the little businesses, the entrepreneursand the start-ups.</p><p>GEIST:  You know, as you know well, senator, there's been thistension during the presidential campaign and it's come from commentsfrom members of your party who are not running for president in manycases about capitalism versus socialism. And I've been interested tohear you say time and again and one -- you said I'm a capitalist tothe bone. You were asked just on Sunday by John Heilemann on thecircus (ph) if you were a capitalist. You said, yes, I'm acapitalist.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>GEIST:  We know how you feel about new government programs,things you're going to add there.</p><p>How do you explain where you are on the question ofcapitalism/socialism and where do they marry each other?</p><p>WARREN:  So, look, I believe in markets. That's where this wholepoint about tech is all about. I see the benefits that markets canproduce. I love the fact that there are a zillion people out theredeveloping new apps or starting new businesses or trying a secondone. I think that's fabulous. I think it's great that littlebusinesses are trying to get to be medium sized businesses andmedium sized businesses are trying to get to be large businesses.</p><p>But, understand this, markets without rules are theft. Andthere's got to be rules and there's got to be a cop on the beat.</p><p>You and I go a long way back. You remember back before thecrash that what had happened basically was the financial giants hadfigured out they could make buckets of money by cheating theircustomers, mortgages, credit cards. And, sure enough, that's whatthey were doing. The cops on the beat, the regulators, just lookedthe other way, paid no attention. And the consequence was, big banksmade a lot of money. They broke the backs of millions of familiesand ultimately crashed our economy. That's why we needed rules.</p><p>So, I came in with the idea of the Consumer FinancialProtection Bureau. We got that bureau in place. And now you begin tosee a much more level playing field. When there's a cop on the beat,those markets start to work again and banks, in that case, areforced to develop their profit models, not on cheating people, buton actually offering a better product.</p><p>Now, Wells Fargo proves they're still willing to get out thereand try to cheat people, but at least we had some cops who caughtthem and have hauled them in and are trying to make changes in thecompany. That's what it takes. Markets have a lot to produce, butonly if they have rules and if they have a cop that's enforcingthose rules.</p><p>GEIST:  So, senator, despite its flaws, some of which you'velaid out there, do you believe capitalism over the course of historyhas been a force for good?</p><p>WARREN:  So I -- yes, I do. I think it also, when -- when itdoesn't work, it's been a force for bad, but that's been true ofevery form of government that we can identify, that we've gotten itright sometimes and gotten it wrong sometimes. When you let marketswork with rules and with people on the beat to enforce those rules,we can produce a lot of wealth in this country. That's what we'vedone for a very long time. We have to recognize there are areaswhere markets don't work.</p><p>Health care, for example. Somebody having a heart attack is notsomebody who's going to shop around to six different emergency roomsand say, which one is going to give me the best price?</p><p>Their -- education. Public education. That's not a place wherea market works.</p><p>But there are places where markets do work. Coffee makers, petpillows. I'm in. We need robust markets for those. That's how weproduce.</p><p>By the way, that's how we ended up producing the Amazon's andGoogles and FaceBooks of the world is the fact that markets couldgrow these incredible, incredible businesses.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So let me close by asking you, a lot of people seemto think the Democrats are most interested in having someone who canbeat Trump and Trump is a street fighter and he plays by unfairrules. I feel like, just my opinion here, that Hillary Clinton was abit boxed in on the debate stage, especially on issues pertaining tomisogyny and sexism. I just feel like it's -- it was an area whereshe was extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>How would nominee Elizabeth Warren handle President Trump onthe debate stage? Would you call him out on his misogyny? Would youcall him out on his treatment of women? Would you call him out onhis record? And how would you fight back when he calls you names?</p><p>WARREN:  So I'm not afraid --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  I want to know what this looks like.</p><p>WARREN:  OK. Let's start with, I am not afraid of anyone, andparticularly not Donald Trump. People have told me, for most of mylife, what's too hard to get done. And my response has always beento fight back. The consumer agency, right? So, after the big crash--</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created byElizabeth Warren.</p><p>WARREN:  That's right. I -- I came in and said, we need thisagency.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  You know what people in Washington said to me? Theysaid two things. The first one is, that's a great idea. That wouldactually change the world.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  The second is, don't do it. Don't even try because it'stoo hard. You won't be able to get it done. You'll be up against thebanks. They'll spend millions of dollars a day lobbying against thisthing. And you know what my response was, I just got in the fight.And I got in the fight and I stayed in the fight. And today theconsumer agency is the law of the land.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Are you afraid to get into his fight and to getinto his face when one needs to?</p><p>WARREN:  Not even a little bit.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  OK. All right, you've got it go, I know. You've gota train to catch.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank you very much. It's great tohave you.

ELIZABETH WARREN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Because you're one of the few candidates with a really significant, clear message that you have lived throughout your life and you have worked for the same issues, on the same issues since you were in college, in graduate school. And I love that. So I want to ask you some questions about other issues that would -- you would confront as president. Rapid-fire.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  So just your gut. Your gut on these core things.   </p><p>      So, as a parent, how much sympathy would you have for these parents who are embroiled in this alleged cheating scandal?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Zero.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Zero. OK.  </p><p>      Would \"President Warren\" ground the 737 Max 8 right now?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p>      Is Brexit good for the U.S. and why?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Why?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Because having our close ally, Great Britain, in such economic turmoil is not helpful to us. We need our allies to be strong.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  How would \"President Elizabeth Warren\" neutralize the North Korean nuclear and missile programs when the last four presidents have not been able to do so?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Boy, it is a tough one and we just have to start out by acknowledging that. But the first thing you do, is you don't head off to a summit without doing your homework.   </p><p>      The tough part has got to be sitting down with the North Koreans. And it's the pain-staking work of diplomacy where you figure out what it is that they need, what it is that we can supply, how many allies we can pull into this to bring pressure on North Korea. The idea of simply giving away to North Korea what they want, which is the big photo-op with the president of the United States, and get the president of the United States to say what China has always wanted them to say about how provocative it is that we're doing military exercises with our allies, the South Koreans and the Japanese, is just giving things up without getting anything in return. I guarantee that's not a path to success.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Yes, there wasn't a -- it doesn't appear that there was a lot of advance work for these summits.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  You know, and that's the problem. You can't walk into these things and somehow think that a personality, an eye-to-eye and sending love letters is going to take care of it. It's hard work.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Is Saudi Arabia and ally of the United States?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Well, it is officially an ally of the United States, but it is an ally where I think we really have to keep pushing on this relationship. Right now it's engaged in a war in Yemen that the United States has gotten itself deeply threaded into without any authorization from Congress.   </p><p>      In addition, the killing of a journalist is just a reminder that Saudi Arabia is a government right now that does not believe in accountability. You know, that's the job of the journalist, is to hold people -- hold officials accountable. And they wipe one out and so far the response of the Trump administration has been nothing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  So what would be your public position on Saudi Arabia right now? What would you be saying and telegraphing?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So -- so it's both halfs. The killing of Khashoggi is absolutely unacceptable. There needs to be some accountability in the government for that.   </p><p>      But the second would also be to say no on Yemen. We are not going to supply arms. We're not going to be helpful for them for a war in Yemen.   </p><p>      Yemen is now one of the biggest manmade humanitarian crises of the last half century. And the United States plays a role in this through its ally, Saudi Arabia. For a long time we were actually helping them pick bombing sights even. We refueled their airplanes. We've sold them the weapons. We're working hand in glove with them in a war we have no business being part of.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Can you name one, two or three Pentagon programs that you think could be eliminated?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hmm, that's interesting --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  That's a good one. That's a tricker.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes, it is. And I have to think about what -- what the programs are. But let me -- can I describe it this way and tell you what the --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  The range is?   </p><p>      We have to stop the Pentagon from building the best possible 20th century military and urge the Pentagon over to the 21st century military. And here's my example of that.   </p><p>      A lot of new tech. A lot of new cyber. The 21st century threats and the 21st century responses are not places where a 20th century military has real strength. It's much more about conventional weapons and large armies and so on and, you know, the ability to engage in lots of shooting wars around the world.   </p><p>      And the problem kind of coherent problem at the Pentagon is that there's always somebody in the room to defend an existing program, no matter how old it is, no matter how much circumstances have changed. Somebody is at the head of that program. Somebody hands out the dollars to the defense industry that supports that program.  </p><p>      There's rarely somebody in the room for the next idea, for the place we need to be. And yet to have an effective military, we've got to be on the front edge, not the back edge, of development.   </p><p>      So I can tell you where I'd spend a lot more money, it's only a very small part of the Pentagon budget, is on research, it's on development, it's on cyber. That's the place we've got to get the Pentagon more focused in that direction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Back to rapid-fire.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Sure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  What has Donald Trump done that you think could be considered impeachable?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, come on now. No, but here's -- here's my rule on this one.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  OK.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  We're about to get the Mueller report. And --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Back up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  We have a lot of other information. Let's wait until we've got the Mueller report, combine it with everything else we've seen, then we'll know what to do.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  So you agree with Nancy Pelosi's approach on this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I'm not sure where Nancy is when she says --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Well, she said he's not worth it at that point. So divisive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  No. It's -- that's not the point. What I see is that the Mueller report is coming. Let's all take a look at the Mueller report. And when the Mueller report comes, we'll know exactly what to do.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  What was wrong, if anything, with the statements that Representative Ilhan Omar made about Israel?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  You know, the way I see it is that we should -- we are a great deliberative body in Congress. And it is important for us to be able to debate issues, to do so respectfully. Any anti-Semitism or Islamophobia should be called out and condemned. But when should encourage our members --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  So what she said were troupes and they were not worth --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Well, when she'd doing that, then -- then that's a problem. But the -- but here's -- here's the part I -- I really want to make strongly. We've got to be a place that can have robust discussion. Not anti-Semitism, not Islamophobia, but robust discussion. And that's what we need to have.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  What is it about Bernie Sanders that makes him so popular with progressives?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  You know, because he fights for what he believes in. Bernie and I have been friends forever and ever.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Bernie's at the top of the list in these polls right now --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Except for Biden, if he runs.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  That's right. But, you know, I've been friends with Bernie from long, long before I ever ended up in politics. And Bernie's out there fighting for what he believes in. And I think that -- that means a lot to people.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  All right, two -- two more.   </p><p>      Is Mike Pence an honorable man?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  OK. Would you like to expound upon that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Sure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Anyone who engages in the kind of homophobia and attacks on people who are different from himself is not an honorable person. That's not -- that's not what honorable people do.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Should Bill Clinton have left office after having an affair with a much younger staffer in the White House?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I don't know. I can't go back and litigate the 1990s. That one -- that one is beyond me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Did the 1990s get us here, though, to an extent?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Of course it did. And -- but I don't have the time machine to go back and change the '90s. All I can do is change this world going forward.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  OK, Willie Geist, you can take over from here.  </p><p>      Willie.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Go, Willie.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC CO-HOST</emphasis>:  OK, senator, good to see you, as always.  </p><p>      I want to ask you about your \"Medium\" post last week --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GEIST</emphasis>:  Where you talked about the breakup of big tech. The headline is, it's time to break up Amazon, Google and FaceBook. I think your argument was a little more nuance perhaps in the headline. Can you explain what you meant there?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Sure. Let's use the example of Amazon. Amazon runs two kinds of businesses. One is it runs a platform. And that's the place where all the small businesses come and they trade and they -- buyer and sellers meet. And Amazon runs that platform, but also sucks out tons of information from every single transaction.   </p><p>      It then uses that information that nobody else is privy to, to look out and say, oh, there's a profitable business. We think we'll go into competition with them. And so it then puts out a product in competition with the pillow sales guy and then moves the profitable business back to page six and puts Amazon right at the front, Amazon's own business.   </p><p>      So, the way I see this, it's a little like baseball. We'll use a baseball analogy here. You can be the umpire, that's the platform, or you can have a team in the game, that's running these individual businesses that meet on the platform. But you don't get to do both simultaneously. So I think those ought to be broken apart.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GEIST</emphasis>:  So another way to explain that too is let's take Apple. Obviously a very popular company. It has an app store.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GEIST</emphasis>:  Do you believe that Apple should be allowed to sell its own apps on its app store?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So it needs to do one or the other. Either it runs that platform, the app store, or it's selling its own products on the app store, but it doesn't do both of those simultaneously because whenever it does, it has this enormous competitive advantage that wipes out all the other little businesses. In fact, did you know, Willie, that it's now referred to, this zone around folks like Apple and Google and Amazon, anyone that moves into the competition space, it's called the kill zone. And venture capitalists are investing about 20 percent less than they used to on these start-up companies because they know if they go into the kill zone, one of two things will happen. They'll either get gobbled up by the giant or they'll get wiped out by the giant, but they won't have a chance to grow and develop into what they might have been.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GEIST</emphasis>:  So do you believe that Google, Amazon and FaceBook all are monopolies by your definition?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, I -- let's put it this way, they are huge. They have market dominance and they behave like monopolists. And that's a big part of the reason they need to be broken apart.   </p><p>      Look at -- look at what happened with FaceBook. I don't know about you, but a lot of people are really uneasy about how FaceBook handles their data.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GEIST</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, along comes What's App, right? And What's App says, I tell you what we'll do, we'll give a whole lot better protection for your privacy. And you watch a bunch of people move from FaceBook over to What's App. Now, that puts FaceBook in the position of doing one of two things, either they have to get better to meet the competition, that's what a good, robust market is all about, or, if you're already huge and dominate the field, just buy the competition and take their data. FaceBook, of course, chose to do the latter. They shouldn't be allowed to do that. That is not furthering competition.   </p><p>      You know, Willie, I believe in markets, but it's when markets have rules, when markets have a cops on the beat to make sure that the giants aren't gobbling up everyone else and eliminating competition. That's when markets work.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GEIST</emphasis>:  So would you have worked to stop, in 2012, FaceBook purchase of Instagram?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes. And we can -- here's the thing. We can go back and still do it. It's possible to go back under anti-trust laws and just say, look, we let this merger go through. Often the mergers are on conditions, conditional that they're not going to do this or they're not going to do that, but let the merger go through and look at it and say, it turns out it has anti-competitive effects. And if it has anti-competitive effects, then we can go back and unwind these and break these pieces apart.   </p><p>      Understand, for anybody who still wants to go on FaceBook and check out their old college roommates or anyone who still wants to go to Amazon and price out 46 coffee makers and get the one that can be delivered in 24 hours, or anybody who wants to go on Google and check out the capital of North Dakota, that will all still be possible. The platforms will still be there. What will be different is that the companies that are selling on those platforms will be in a real marketplace where they compete straight up based on price and service and quality of goods, not having the platform owner able to come in and have this enormous advantage to be able to scoop up all the business and kill off the little businesses, the entrepreneurs and the start-ups.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GEIST</emphasis>:  You know, as you know well, senator, there's been this tension during the presidential campaign and it's come from comments from members of your party who are not running for president in many cases about capitalism versus socialism. And I've been interested to hear you say time and again and one -- you said I'm a capitalist to the bone. You were asked just on Sunday by John Heilemann on the circus (ph) if you were a capitalist. You said, yes, I'm a capitalist.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GEIST</emphasis>:  We know how you feel about new government programs, things you're going to add there.   </p><p>      How do you explain where you are on the question of capitalism/socialism and where do they marry each other?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, look, I believe in markets. That's where this whole point about tech is all about. I see the benefits that markets can produce. I love the fact that there are a zillion people out there developing new apps or starting new businesses or trying a second one. I think that's fabulous. I think it's great that little businesses are trying to get to be medium sized businesses and medium sized businesses are trying to get to be large businesses.   </p><p>      But, understand this, markets without rules are theft. And there's got to be rules and there's got to be a cop on the beat.   </p><p>      You and I go a long way back. You remember back before the crash that what had happened basically was the financial giants had figured out they could make buckets of money by cheating their customers, mortgages, credit cards. And, sure enough, that's what they were doing. The cops on the beat, the regulators, just looked the other way, paid no attention. And the consequence was, big banks made a lot of money. They broke the backs of millions of families and ultimately crashed our economy. That's why we needed rules.   </p><p>      So, I came in with the idea of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We got that bureau in place. And now you begin to see a much more level playing field. When there's a cop on the beat, those markets start to work again and banks, in that case, are forced to develop their profit models, not on cheating people, but on actually offering a better product.  </p><p>      Now, Wells Fargo proves they're still willing to get out there and try to cheat people, but at least we had some cops who caught them and have hauled them in and are trying to make changes in the company. That's what it takes. Markets have a lot to produce, but only if they have rules and if they have a cop that's enforcing those rules.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GEIST</emphasis>:  So, senator, despite its flaws, some of which you've laid out there, do you believe capitalism over the course of history has been a force for good?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So I -- yes, I do. I think it also, when -- when it doesn't work, it's been a force for bad, but that's been true of every form of government that we can identify, that we've gotten it right sometimes and gotten it wrong sometimes. When you let markets work with rules and with people on the beat to enforce those rules, we can produce a lot of wealth in this country. That's what we've done for a very long time. We have to recognize there are areas where markets don't work.   </p><p>      Health care, for example. Somebody having a heart attack is not somebody who's going to shop around to six different emergency rooms and say, which one is going to give me the best price?   </p><p>      Their -- education. Public education. That's not a place where a market works.   </p><p>      But there are places where markets do work. Coffee makers, pet pillows. I'm in. We need robust markets for those. That's how we produce.   </p><p>      By the way, that's how we ended up producing the Amazon's and Googles and FaceBooks of the world is the fact that markets could grow these incredible, incredible businesses.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  So let me close by asking you, a lot of people seem to think the Democrats are most interested in having someone who can beat Trump and Trump is a street fighter and he plays by unfair rules. I feel like, just my opinion here, that Hillary Clinton was a bit boxed in on the debate stage, especially on issues pertaining to misogyny and sexism. I just feel like it's -- it was an area where she was extremely uncomfortable.   </p><p>      How would nominee Elizabeth Warren handle President Trump on the debate stage? Would you call him out on his misogyny? Would you call him out on his treatment of women? Would you call him out on his record? And how would you fight back when he calls you names?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So I'm not afraid --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  I want to know what this looks like.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  OK. Let's start with, I am not afraid of anyone, and particularly not Donald Trump. People have told me, for most of my life, what's too hard to get done. And my response has always been to fight back. The consumer agency, right? So, after the big crash --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by Elizabeth Warren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  That's right. I -- I came in and said, we need this agency.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  You know what people in Washington said to me? They said two things. The first one is, that's a great idea. That would actually change the world.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  The second is, don't do it. Don't even try because it's too hard. You won't be able to get it done. You'll be up against the banks. They'll spend millions of dollars a day lobbying against this thing. And you know what my response was, I just got in the fight. And I got in the fight and I stayed in the fight. And today the consumer agency is the law of the land.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  Are you afraid to get into his fight and to get into his face when one needs to?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Not even a little bit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRZEZINSKI</emphasis>:  OK. All right, you've got it go, I know. You've got a train to catch.   </p><p>      Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank you very much. It's great to have you. Come back anytime.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, it's so good to be here.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMR-XSB1-F15W-H18K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

ELIZABETH WARREN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC ANCHOR</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]     MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC ANCHOR:  And let's, right away, bring inDemocratic Presidential Candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren ofMassachusetts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I have Willie with me, but I'll start things out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'd like to try something different --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  OK.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Because you're one of the few candidates with areally significant, clear message that you have lived throughoutyour life and you have worked for the same issues, on the sameissues since you were in college, in graduate school. And I lovethat. So I want to ask you some questions about other issues thatwould -- you would confront as president. Rapid-fire.</p><p>WARREN:  OK.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So just your gut. Your gut on these core things.</p><p>So, as a parent, how much sympathy would you have for theseparents who are embroiled in this alleged cheating scandal?</p><p>WARREN:  Zero.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Zero. OK.</p><p>Would \"President Warren\" ground the 737 Max 8 right now?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Absolutely.</p><p>Is Brexit good for the U.S. and why?</p><p>WARREN:  No.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Why?</p><p>WARREN:  Because having our close ally, Great Britain, in sucheconomic turmoil is not helpful to us. We need our allies to bestrong.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  How would \"President Elizabeth Warren\" neutralizethe North Korean nuclear and missile programs when the last fourpresidents have not been able to do so?</p><p>WARREN:  Boy, it is a tough one and we just have to start out byacknowledging that. But the first thing you do, is you don't headoff to a summit without doing your homework.</p><p>The tough part has got to be sitting down with the NorthKoreans. And it's the pain-staking work of diplomacy where youfigure out what it is that they need, what it is that we can supply,how many allies we can pull into this to bring pressure on NorthKorea. The idea of simply giving away to North Korea what they want,which is the big photo-op with the president of the United States,and get the president of the United States to say what China hasalways wanted them to say about how provocative it is that we'redoing military exercises with our allies, the South Koreans and theJapanese, is just giving things up without getting anything inreturn. I guarantee that's not a path to success.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes, there wasn't a -- it doesn't appear that therewas a lot of advance work for these summits.</p><p>WARREN:  You know, and that's the problem. You can't walk intothese things and somehow think that a personality, an eye-to-eye andsending love letters is going to take care of it. It's hard work.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Is Saudi Arabia and ally of the United States?</p><p>WARREN:  Well, it is officially an ally of the United States,but it is an ally where I think we really have to keep pushing onthis relationship. Right now it's engaged in a war in Yemen that theUnited States has gotten itself deeply threaded into without anyauthorization from Congress.</p><p>In addition, the killing of a journalist is just a reminderthat Saudi Arabia is a government right now that does not believe inaccountability. You know, that's the job of the journalist, is tohold people -- hold officials accountable. And they wipe one out andso far the response of the Trump administration has been nothing.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So what would be your public position on SaudiArabia right now? What would you be saying and telegraphing?</p><p>WARREN:  So -- so it's both halfs. The killing of Khashoggi isabsolutely unacceptable. There needs to be some accountability inthe government for that.</p><p>But the second would also be to say no on Yemen. We are notgoing to supply arms. We're not going to be helpful for them for awar in Yemen.</p><p>Yemen is now one of the biggest manmade humanitarian crises ofthe last half century. And the United States plays a role in thisthrough its ally, Saudi Arabia. For a long time we were actuallyhelping them pick bombing sights even. We refueled their airplanes.We've sold them the weapons. We're working hand in glove with themin a war we have no business being part of.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Can you name one, two or three Pentagon programsthat you think could be eliminated?</p><p>WARREN:  Hmm, that's interesting --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  That's a good one. That's a tricker.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes, it is. And I have to think about what -- what theprograms are. But let me -- can I describe it this way and tell youwhat the --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  The range is?</p><p>We have to stop the Pentagon from building the best possible20th century military and urge the Pentagon over to the 21st centurymilitary. And here's my example of that.</p><p>A lot of new tech. A lot of new cyber. The 21st century threatsand the 21st century responses are not places where a 20th centurymilitary has real strength. It's much more about conventionalweapons and large armies and so on and, you know, the ability toengage in lots of shooting wars around the world.</p><p>And the problem kind of coherent problem at the Pentagon isthat there's always somebody in the room to defend an existingprogram, no matter how old it is, no matter how much circumstanceshave changed. Somebody is at the head of that program. Somebodyhands out the dollars to the defense industry that supports thatprogram.</p><p>There's rarely somebody in the room for the next idea, for theplace we need to be. And yet to have an effective military, we'vegot to be on the front edge, not the back edge, of development.</p><p>So I can tell you where I'd spend a lot more money, it's only avery small part of the Pentagon budget, is on research, it's ondevelopment, it's on cyber. That's the place we've got to get thePentagon more focused in that direction.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Back to rapid-fire.</p><p>WARREN:  Sure.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  What has Donald Trump done that you think could beconsidered impeachable?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, come on now. No, but here's -- here's my rule onthis one.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  OK.</p><p>WARREN:  We're about to get the Mueller report. And --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Back up.</p><p>WARREN:  We have a lot of other information. Let's wait untilwe've got the Mueller report, combine it with everything else we'veseen, then we'll know what to do.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So you agree with Nancy Pelosi's approach on this?</p><p>WARREN:  I'm not sure where Nancy is when she says --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Well, she said he's not worth it at that point. Sodivisive.</p><p>WARREN:  No. It's -- that's not the point. What I see is thatthe Mueller report is coming. Let's all take a look at the Muellerreport. And when the Mueller report comes, we'll know exactly whatto do.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  What was wrong, if anything, with the statementsthat Representative Ilhan Omar made about Israel?</p><p>WARREN:  You know, the way I see it is that we should -- we area great deliberative body in Congress. And it is important for us tobe able to debate issues, to do so respectfully. Any anti-Semitismor Islamophobia should be called out and condemned. But when shouldencourage our members --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So what she said were troupes and they were notworth --</p><p>WARREN:  Well, when she'd doing that, then -- then that's aproblem. But the -- but here's -- here's the part I -- I really wantto make strongly. We've got to be a place that can have robustdiscussion. Not anti-Semitism, not Islamophobia, but robustdiscussion. And that's what we need to have.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  What is it about Bernie Sanders that makes him sopopular with progressives?</p><p>WARREN:  You know, because he fights for what he believes in.Bernie and I have been friends forever and ever.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Bernie's at the top of the list in these pollsright now --</p><p>WARREN:  That's right.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Except for Biden, if he runs.</p><p>WARREN:  That's right. But, you know, I've been friends withBernie from long, long before I ever ended up in politics. AndBernie's out there fighting for what he believes in. And I thinkthat -- that means a lot to people.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  All right, two -- two more.</p><p>Is Mike Pence an honorable man?</p><p>WARREN:  No.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  OK. Would you like to expound upon that?</p><p>WARREN:  Sure.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  Anyone who engages in the kind of homophobia andattacks on people who are different from himself is not an honorableperson. That's not -- that's not what honorable people do.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Should Bill Clinton have left office after havingan affair with a much younger staffer in the White House?</p><p>WARREN:  I don't know. I can't go back and litigate the 1990s.That one -- that one is beyond me.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Did the 1990s get us here, though, to an extent?</p><p>WARREN:  Of course it did. And -- but I don't have the timemachine to go back and change the '90s. All I can do is change thisworld going forward.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  OK, Willie Geist, you can take over from here.</p><p>Willie.</p><p>WARREN:  Go, Willie.</p><p>WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC CO-HOST:  OK, senator, good to see you, asalways.</p><p>I want to ask you about your \"Medium\" post last week --</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>GEIST:  Where you talked about the breakup of big tech. Theheadline is, it's time to break up Amazon, Google and FaceBook. Ithink your argument was a little more nuance perhaps in theheadline. Can you explain what you meant there?</p><p>WARREN:  Sure. Let's use the example of Amazon. Amazon runs twokinds of businesses. One is it runs a platform. And that's the placewhere all the small businesses come and they trade and they -- buyerand sellers meet. And Amazon runs that platform, but also sucks outtons of information from every single transaction.</p><p>It then uses that information that nobody else is privy to, tolook out and say, oh, there's a profitable business. We think we'llgo into competition with them. And so it then puts out a product incompetition with the pillow sales guy and then moves the profitablebusiness back to page six and puts Amazon right at the front,Amazon's own business.</p><p>So, the way I see this, it's a little like baseball. We'll usea baseball analogy here. You can be the umpire, that's the platform,or you can have a team in the game, that's running these individualbusinesses that meet on the platform. But you don't get to do bothsimultaneously. So I think those ought to be broken apart.</p><p>GEIST:  So another way to explain that too is let's take Apple.Obviously a very popular company. It has an app store.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>GEIST:  Do you believe that Apple should be allowed to sell itsown apps on its app store?</p><p>WARREN:  So it needs to do one or the other. Either it runs thatplatform, the app store, or it's selling its own products on the appstore, but it doesn't do both of those simultaneously becausewhenever it does, it has this enormous competitive advantage thatwipes out all the other little businesses. In fact, did you know,Willie, that it's now referred to, this zone around folks like Appleand Google and Amazon, anyone that moves into the competition space,it's called the kill zone. And venture capitalists are investingabout 20 percent less than they used to on these start-up companiesbecause they know if they go into the kill zone, one of two thingswill happen. They'll either get gobbled up by the giant or they'llget wiped out by the giant, but they won't have a chance to grow anddevelop into what they might have been.</p><p>GEIST:  So do you believe that Google, Amazon and FaceBook allare monopolies by your definition?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, I -- let's put it this way, they are huge. Theyhave market dominance and they behave like monopolists. And that's abig part of the reason they need to be broken apart.</p><p>Look at -- look at what happened with FaceBook. I don't knowabout you, but a lot of people are really uneasy about how FaceBookhandles their data.</p><p>GEIST:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  So, along comes What's App, right? And What's App says,I tell you what we'll do, we'll give a whole lot better protectionfor your privacy. And you watch a bunch of people move from FaceBookover to What's App. Now, that puts FaceBook in the position of doingone of two things, either they have to get better to meet thecompetition, that's what a good, robust market is all about, or, ifyou're already huge and dominate the field, just buy the competitionand take their data. FaceBook, of course, chose to do the latter.They shouldn't be allowed to do that. That is not furtheringcompetition.</p><p>You know, Willie, I believe in markets, but it's when marketshave rules, when markets have a cops on the beat to make sure thatthe giants aren't gobbling up everyone else and eliminatingcompetition. That's when markets work.</p><p>GEIST:  So would you have worked to stop, in 2012, FaceBookpurchase of Instagram?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes. And we can -- here's the thing. We can go back andstill do it. It's possible to go back under anti-trust laws and justsay, look, we let this merger go through. Often the mergers are onconditions, conditional that they're not going to do this or they'renot going to do that, but let the merger go through and look at itand say, it turns out it has anti-competitive effects. And if it hasanti-competitive effects, then we can go back and unwind these andbreak these pieces apart.</p><p>Understand, for anybody who still wants to go on FaceBook andcheck out their old college roommates or anyone who still wants togo to Amazon and price out 46 coffee makers and get the one that canbe delivered in 24 hours, or anybody who wants to go on Google andcheck out the capital of North Dakota, that will all still bepossible. The platforms will still be there. What will be differentis that the companies that are selling on those platforms will be ina real marketplace where they compete straight up based on price andservice and quality of goods, not having the platform owner able tocome in and have this enormous advantage to be able to scoop up allthe business and kill off the little businesses, the entrepreneursand the start-ups.</p><p>GEIST:  You know, as you know well, senator, there's been thistension during the presidential campaign and it's come from commentsfrom members of your party who are not running for president in manycases about capitalism versus socialism. And I've been interested tohear you say time and again and one -- you said I'm a capitalist tothe bone. You were asked just on Sunday by John Heilemann on thecircus (ph) if you were a capitalist. You said, yes, I'm acapitalist.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>GEIST:  We know how you feel about new government programs,things you're going to add there.</p><p>How do you explain where you are on the question ofcapitalism/socialism and where do they marry each other?</p><p>WARREN:  So, look, I believe in markets. That's where this wholepoint about tech is all about. I see the benefits that markets canproduce. I love the fact that there are a zillion people out theredeveloping new apps or starting new businesses or trying a secondone. I think that's fabulous. I think it's great that littlebusinesses are trying to get to be medium sized businesses andmedium sized businesses are trying to get to be large businesses.</p><p>But, understand this, markets without rules are theft. Andthere's got to be rules and there's got to be a cop on the beat.</p><p>You and I go a long way back. You remember back before thecrash that what had happened basically was the financial giants hadfigured out they could make buckets of money by cheating theircustomers, mortgages, credit cards. And, sure enough, that's whatthey were doing. The cops on the beat, the regulators, just lookedthe other way, paid no attention. And the consequence was, big banksmade a lot of money. They broke the backs of millions of familiesand ultimately crashed our economy. That's why we needed rules.</p><p>So, I came in with the idea of the Consumer FinancialProtection Bureau. We got that bureau in place. And now you begin tosee a much more level playing field. When there's a cop on the beat,those markets start to work again and banks, in that case, areforced to develop their profit models, not on cheating people, buton actually offering a better product.</p><p>Now, Wells Fargo proves they're still willing to get out thereand try to cheat people, but at least we had some cops who caughtthem and have hauled them in and are trying to make changes in thecompany. That's what it takes. Markets have a lot to produce, butonly if they have rules and if they have a cop that's enforcingthose rules.</p><p>GEIST:  So, senator, despite its flaws, some of which you'velaid out there, do you believe capitalism over the course of historyhas been a force for good?</p><p>WARREN:  So I -- yes, I do. I think it also, when -- when itdoesn't work, it's been a force for bad, but that's been true ofevery form of government that we can identify, that we've gotten itright sometimes and gotten it wrong sometimes. When you let marketswork with rules and with people on the beat to enforce those rules,we can produce a lot of wealth in this country. That's what we'vedone for a very long time. We have to recognize there are areaswhere markets don't work.</p><p>Health care, for example. Somebody having a heart attack is notsomebody who's going to shop around to six different emergency roomsand say, which one is going to give me the best price?</p><p>Their -- education. Public education. That's not a place wherea market works.</p><p>But there are places where markets do work. Coffee makers, petpillows. I'm in. We need robust markets for those. That's how weproduce.</p><p>By the way, that's how we ended up producing the Amazon's andGoogles and FaceBooks of the world is the fact that markets couldgrow these incredible, incredible businesses.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  So let me close by asking you, a lot of people seemto think the Democrats are most interested in having someone who canbeat Trump and Trump is a street fighter and he plays by unfairrules. I feel like, just my opinion here, that Hillary Clinton was abit boxed in on the debate stage, especially on issues pertaining tomisogyny and sexism. I just feel like it's -- it was an area whereshe was extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>How would nominee Elizabeth Warren handle President Trump onthe debate stage? Would you call him out on his misogyny? Would youcall him out on his treatment of women? Would you call him out onhis record? And how would you fight back when he calls you names?</p><p>WARREN:  So I'm not afraid --</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  I want to know what this looks like.</p><p>WARREN:  OK. Let's start with, I am not afraid of anyone, andparticularly not Donald Trump. People have told me, for most of mylife, what's too hard to get done. And my response has always beento fight back. The consumer agency, right? So, after the big crash--</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created byElizabeth Warren.</p><p>WARREN:  That's right. I -- I came in and said, we need thisagency.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  You know what people in Washington said to me? Theysaid two things. The first one is, that's a great idea. That wouldactually change the world.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Yes.</p><p>WARREN:  The second is, don't do it. Don't even try because it'stoo hard. You won't be able to get it done. You'll be up against thebanks. They'll spend millions of dollars a day lobbying against thisthing. And you know what my response was, I just got in the fight.And I got in the fight and I stayed in the fight. And today theconsumer agency is the law of the land.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  Are you afraid to get into his fight and to getinto his face when one needs to?</p><p>WARREN:  Not even a little bit.</p><p>BRZEZINSKI:  OK. All right, you've got it go, I know. You've gota train to catch.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, thank you very much. It's great tohave you. Come back anytime.</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, it's so good to be here.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2190452395</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMV-VTK1-DY0W-40JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3234\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ Roll Call Mar 13, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Department of Defense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>MSNBC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Yemen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Saudi Arabia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Warren, Elizabeth</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>21st century</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidential elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Personal bankruptcy</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 928110</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 511140</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 515210</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921110MM</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ</classCode><className>The Presidency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Elizabeth Warren pledged on Friday to take aim at Amazon, Facebook and Google if she is elected president in 2020, breaking apart each of the big tech companies and introducing sweeping new regulation of Silicon Valley. </p><p>The proposal marks the most ambitious and aggressive effort targeting the tech industry offered by any Democratic contender for the White House, and it could put pressure on other presidential aspirants to offer similar plans for more aggressive tech oversight.'To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies,' Warren said. Warren's proposal has two key elements. First, the Democratic lawmaker said her administration would appoint 'regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,' including Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Facebook's tie-up with WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.Most Read Nation ...rld StoriesSecond, Warren said she would push legislation that would label key services \u2014 such as Amazon's marketplace for goods and Google search \u2014 as 'platform utilities,' which would have to be spun off from those tech giants' business on those platforms. Her plan primarily targets only those companies with annual revenue over $90 billion, and it would embolden federal and state regulators to issue steep fines and other penalties that harm competition or consumers. Even web users could sue Amazon, Facebook and Google if they violated Warren's proposed federal rules. Warren's blueprint \u2014 detailed in a Medium post \u2014 comes as she prepares to speak to supporters in Long Island City, New York, where Amazon initially sought to construct one of two new headquarters. The company ultimately withdrew from the city amid staunch local opposition and fierce criticism from national figures, like Warren, who felt Amazon had received 'taxpayer bribes' from New York. 'We must ensure that today's tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy,' Warren said Friday.

The plan also includes the appointment of regulators that would \"unwind anti-competitive mergers,\" including Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos; Facebook's deals to buy WhatsApp and Instagram; and Google's acquisitions of Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>\"I want a government that makes sure everybody\u200a\u2014\u200aeven the biggest and most powerful companies in America\u200a\u2014\u200aplays by the rules,\" Warren said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">in a statement.</url> \"And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish. To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\"</p><p>\"To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies,\" she added.</p><p>If elected president, Warren's administration would take a two-pronged approach to breaking up large tech companies. The first would include \"passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as 'Platform Utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform.\"</p><p>Companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchangeor a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as \u201cplatform utilities,\" according to Warren.</p><p>Under this approach, Amazon Marketplace and Basics would split, Google's ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would have to split andGoogle Search wouldbe spun off from Google.</p><p>The second phase of Warren's proposal would subject smaller companies to the same set of regulations, but wouldn't force them to separate themselves from the online marketplace, according to her online statement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RELATED: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fiercetelecom.com/regulatory/democrats-tackle-net-neutrality-save-internet-act\">Democrats tackle net neutrality with 'Save the Internet Act'</url></emphasis></p><p>Not surprisingly, Warren's proposal came under criticism not long after it was announced.</p><p>\"Politicians and their technocrats hacking up big tech companies is bad news for consumers, innovation, stockholders, and private property rights,\" said Jessica Melugin, associate director, <url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/staff/jessica-melugin\">Center for Technology and Innovation</url>, in a statement emailed to FierceTelecom. \"There's no need to run this doomed regulatory experiment in the U.S.; European-style meddling has left that continent without one tech company in the global top ten and, more generally, government control of industry is currently on full and tragic display in Venezuela.\"</p><p>\u201cThe next wave of technological innovations will likely require enormous economies of scale to serve consumers.

Dianne Feinstein, D-California, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Led By Senators Dianne Feinstein (Judiciary Committee), Maria Cantwell (Commerce Committee), Sherrod Brown (Banking Committee) and Patty Murray (HELP Committee), Senate Democrats Say New Principles Should Be The Baseline For Any Comprehensive Federal Privacy And Data Security Legislation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>The top Democrats across four key Senate committees (Commerce, Judiciary, Banking, and HELP) today unveiled a new set of core principles they say should be the baseline for any comprehensive federal privacy and data protection legislation. Under the new framework agreed upon by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) consumers would be able to control their personal information, and corporations, non-profits, and political entities would be held to higher standards for when and how they collect, use, share and protect consumer data.</p><p>Specifically, the privacy principles strengthen individual consumer and civil rights protections, including for children and teens, invigorate competition by increasing consumer choice, establish data safeguards to ensure use abides by consumer expectations and increase accountability over data practices by those at the highest levels of organizations. The principles also put more teeth into enforcement by ensuring that both regulators and individuals have the tools they need to aggressively identify harmful or invasive privacy practices and pursue legal remedies.</p><p>The group of Senate Democratic ranking members first came together after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) tasked the committees of primary jurisdiction over various privacy and data protection issues, like data security and civil rights, with developing principles to fill in the serious gaps in consumer protection not currently covered by existing federal laws and provide a strong nationwide foundation for comprehensive federal legislation. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) were also consulted and support the new principles.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of laws that are designed to protect privacy, however these laws provide specific privacy protections and are limited in scope by data types such as credit information protected by the Financial Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), protected health information created and maintained by payers and providers of healthcare, as is governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or safeguards afforded to children's data by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The newly unveiled principles should not be interpreted to change or displace existing privacy laws, or privacy laws scheduled to go into effect.</p><p>The Senate Democrats' privacy principles can be found here.</p><p>\"Individuals should have the ability to control their personal data, period. To prevent companies from abusing our personal data, we need to create more transparency and accountability and allow individuals to determine how their data is used. That is what we hope to accomplish with this framework,\" said Senator Feinstein.</p><p>\"In an ever-evolving information age, consumers deserve to have protections from websites and online services harvesting their personal data. They deserve to have privacy rights and have those rights protected,\" said Senator Cantwell.</p><p>\"Too many corporations require Americans to sacrifice their privacy and share the most intimate details of their lives just to visit a website or to receive and use services,\" said Senator Brown. \"We must establish rules that take the power away from companies like Facebook, Equifax, and others to violate Americans' privacy for profits and give it back to hardworking Americans.\"</p><p>\"As data continues to play an important new role in families' lives in the 21st century, we need to make sure the constant development of new technology is matched by the development of new best practices and protections that speak to the needs for security, privacy, and good data stewardship,\" said Senator Murray. \"People should be able to expect tech companies are going to treat their most sensitive information responsibly, and give them the tools they need to be able to control how and when their information is disclosed. Our objective should be to make sure tech companies are putting people in the driver's seat, not the other way around.\"</p><p>\"I applaud my colleagues for their great work and am proud to support these strong principles,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>\"I've said for more than a year now that corporations need to mind their own business when it comes to misusing Americans' private information. These principles make clear that Democrats support strong new protections for Americans' data, unprecedented transparency over how our information is used, and new enforcement with teeth that will hold corporations accountable,\" said Senator Wyden. \"Leader Schumer and Ranking Members Cantwell, Feinstein, Brown and Murray deserve enormous credit for putting together a tough, comprehensive list of principles to protect Americans' private data and put consumers back in control of their most sensitive information.\"</p><p>\"I know from having fought for stronger privacy protection over decades, federal action is woefully overdue and urgently necessary now. I will continue to work for bipartisan federal action because Americans absolutely want stronger privacy protection,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"They know from painful experience that the intimate details of our personal lives are used against us every day by unaccountable corporations and foreign actors, deeply endangering our safety and democracy. Americans deserve and rightly expect stronger privacy safeguards, regardless of their politics or their personal circumstance. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass--as soon as possible--new privacy laws that are as strong and comprehensive as possible.\"</p><p>\"We need to update our privacy laws for the internet age.\" said Senator Schatz. \"When consumers let companies use their information they should be able to trust that it will be protected, used ethically, and won't be used to harm them. These principles provide a framework for clear rules of the road for companies, and would give prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"The American people are overdue for a privacy bill of rights that puts consumers first and effectively protects our personal information. And any comprehensive privacy legislation must include heightened safeguards for children and teens, who are uniquely vulnerable in today's digital age,\" said Senator Markey. \"We cannot afford to shrug off the daily data breaches and privacy invasions as a new normal. I am pleased to work with my colleagues on this framework for comprehensive privacy legislation, and I look forward to continuing this important collaboration.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6931344 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6931344</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ4-M7D1-JC11-153P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1186\"/><timeReceived>8:34 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I pointed out that there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate and that I wasn't one of them, but he said he needed Members with my perspective on the committee. I wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it did--almost immediately--when in December of that year, Comcast announced its intention to acquire NBCUniversal.</p><p>I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it is the American consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on its platform.</p><p>It was through my work on Comcast and NBCUniversal that I learned about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data they were collecting on a perpetual basis.</p><p>I believe consumers have a fundamental right to know what information is being collected about them. I believe they have a right to decide whether they want to share that information and with whom they want to share it and when. I believe consumers have a right to expect that companies that store their personal information will store it securely.</p><p>I also believe all Americans deserve affordable access to high- quality telecommunications services--services they depend on to communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. I believe the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression it has always been.</p><p>Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate, very few Members of Congress were talking about corporate consolidation, commercial privacy, or net neutrality--issues that have gained much deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the reason for other Members' hesitance, I felt it was incumbent upon me to get into the weeds on these issues so I could be a leader in the Senate and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary Minnesotans.</p><p>That is why, when the interests of the American consumers have clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology companies, I have always tried to put the public first and to fight on their behalf by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the tools at my disposal to curb them.</p><p>Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee--and, more specifically, my work on media and technology policy--that I believe my perspective from my previous career has been of most value.</p><p>Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable because I had seen their motives for this deal before. In 1993, during my 13th season at \"Saturday Night Live,\" the Big Three networks--NBC, CBS, and ABC--pressured Congress to change the rules that had previously prevented them from owning any of the shows they aired in prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming competing programming.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks--contrary to their guarantees and assurances they had given Congress--began giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time, \"Seinfeld,\" which aired on NBC, was not owned by NBC and had been produced before the rules had changed--was the No. 1 show on television, which made the Thursday night timeslot following \"Seinfeld\" the most valuable real estate on television. I watched as shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned, at least in part, by NBC.</p><p>So when I became a Senator, one of the first major deals I opposed was Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. As in the case of AT&amp;T's current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCUniversal would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that programming. I knew these incentives would hurt competing content creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm consumers.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements with the FCC and the Department of Justice, favoring its own news programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and failing to live up to its promises regarding offering affordable standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming--they did not live up to their promises there--and online video distribution. Because merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce, competition and consumers were harmed in the process.</p><p>Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It was also one of the major reasons I believe that later deal was ultimately dropped after objections from the FCC and the Department of Justice.</p><p>For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a year, I was the only Senator to oppose Comcast's proposals to buy Time Warner Cable--a deal that would have given the combined company 57 percent of the broadband market--but advocates and ordinary citizens raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal.</p><p>Most recently, I have led my colleagues in scrutinizing AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I have once again called on regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will cause to competition and consumers.</p><p>I have been proud to lead these efforts, and I leave here in a much different environment than when I arrived. I know there are strong voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I am gone.</p><p>These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a very important, larger development we have seen in our country. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's-- and, in turn, Congress's--interest in combating corporate consolidation.</p><p>When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure most Americans understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to combine. Vertical integration and antitrust laws sounded like obscure, almost boring, topics, but more and more Americans are getting educated about these issues, and more and more Members of Congress are working to get Washington focused on how they affect the lives of real people.</p><p>Just look at the fight for net neutrality. For many of the same reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal, I have long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T.</p><p>Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive-- even when they are up against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here is just one example I found useful in explaining net neutrality:</p><p>In 2005, three guys set up shop over a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, CA, where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video- sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something that preceded it called Google Video, but Google Video wasn't very good. Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to compete with Google Video on a level playing field. The giant internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumer homes.</p><p>They were treated the same, neutrally. The content was neutral--net neutrality. People really liked YouTube. They preferred YouTube to Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it for stock valued at $1.65 billion. That is a nice chunk for three guys over a pizzeria in San Mateo.</p><p>It is not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on open internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that \"every retailer with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing, every bank offering online account management, every company with a website--every business in America interacting with its customers online is dependent upon an open Internet.\" I have repeated this quote on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue.</p><p>Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep- pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it.</p><p>If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we will be entering a digital world where the powerful outrank the majority, a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how users get their information, and a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane.</p><p>For nearly 9 years, I have been calling net neutrality the free speech issue of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has aspired so many of us in recent months--and has effected real change, like in the fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the Affordable Care Act--has depended in no small part on a free and open internet.</p><p>In 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers under title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good things for net neutrality; it also had important implications for consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority and the responsibility to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win. Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to Americans' right to privacy.</p><p>For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. I believe they deserve both transparency and accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible. This transparency and accountability should come from all the companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This includes internet service providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T but also edge providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</p><p>In 2011, I served as chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law--a subcommittee that I founded after it became abundantly clear that our Nation's privacy laws had failed to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies.</p><p>When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we have seen a fundamental shift in who has our information and what they are doing with it. That is not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about protecting ourselves from government abuses, but now we also have relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing, sharing and in many cases selling enormous amounts of our personal information.</p><p>When the Constitution was written, the Founders had no way of anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example, and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Founders had no idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was also a search that required court approval. All of this is a good thing. Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology and changing expectations of American society. This is why the Constitution is often called a living document. But we have a long way to go to get to the point where our modern laws are in line with modern technology.</p><p>My goal for the subcommittee was to help members understand both the benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate the public and raise awareness about how their data is being collected, used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the law. When politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed companies--many of them more than once--to be more transparent about how they were treating their customers' private information, including users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and face prints.</p><p>As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans' personal information. But unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of information isn't just a side project they can choose to halt at any given time; for many of them, it is their whole business model. We are not their customers; we are their product.</p><p>Recently, we have seen just how scary this business model can be. In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 campaign, and both the public and Members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives, based primarily on the mass collection of personal information and complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy. Not only do these companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance--specifically in the market of information--now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. Unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be up to the challenge that they have created for themselves.</p><p>The size of these companies is not--in isolation--the problem, but I am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans' personal information to further solidify their market power and consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and innovators who rely on their platforms to reach consumers. As has become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism. It should go without saying that such power comes with great responsibility.</p><p>Everyone is currently and rightfully focused on Russian manipulation of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the broader questions: How did big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives? How is it using our personal information to strengthen its reach and its bottom line? Are these companies engaging in anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information in commerce? Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and to protect our democracy? And finally, what role should these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward?</p><p>Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our lives, and it has given us extraordinary benefits. As these companies continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we have recently confronted in the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity of our democracy.</p><p>I will not be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to find the answers from the outside, but it is my colleagues in the Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There is simply too much at stake. I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and encouragement of the American people.</p><p>I have witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson I have learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason and despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the public's interests that can ultimately prevail.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6115528 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6115528</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R7J-7RK1-DYG2-R17F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3047\"/><timeReceived>4:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 22, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I pointed out that there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate, and that I wasn't one of them, but he said that he needed members with my perspective on the Committee. I wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it did - almost immediately - when in December of that year, Comcast announced its intention to acquire NBCUniversal.</p><p>I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it's the American consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on its platform.</p><p>And it was through my work on Comcast-NBCUniversal that I learned about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data that they were collecting on a perpetual basis.</p><p>I believe that consumers have a fundamental right to know what information is being collected about them. I believe that they have a right to decide whether they want to share that information, and with whom they want to share it and when. And I believe that consumers have a right to expect that companies that store their personal information will store it securely.</p><p>I also believe that all Americans deserve affordable access to high-quality telecommunications services - services they depend on to communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. And I believe that the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression that it has always been.</p><p>Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate, very few members of Congress were talking about corporate consolidation or commercial privacy or net neutrality - issues that have gained much-deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the reason for other members' hesitance, I felt that it was incumbent on me to get in the weeds on these issues, so that I could be a leader on them in the Senate and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary Minnesotans.</p><p>That's why when the interests of the American consumer have clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology companies, I've always tried to put the public first and to fight on their behalf - by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the tools at my disposal to curb them.</p><p>Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee - and more specifically my work on media and technology policy - that I believe my perspective from my previous career has been of most value.</p><p>Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable because I'd seen their motives for this deal before.</p><p>In 1993, during my thirteenth season at Saturday Night Live, the Big Three networks - NBC, CBS, and ABC - pressured Congress to change the rules that had previously prevented them from owning any of the shows that they aired in prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming competing programming.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks began giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time, Seinfeld, which aired on NBC, was the number one show on TV, which made the Thursday night time slot following Seinfeld the most valuable real estate on television. And I watched as the shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned, at least in part, by NBC.</p><p>So, when I became a senator, one of the first major deals that I opposed was Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. As in the case of ATandT's current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCU would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that programming. I knew that these incentives would hurt competing content creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm consumers.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements with the FCC and DOJ, favoring its own news programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and failing to live up to its promises regarding affordable standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming, and online video distribution. And because merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce, competition and consumers were harmed in the process.</p><p>Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It's also one of the major reasons I believe that that later deal was ultimately dropped after objections from the FCC and DOJ.</p><p>For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a year, I was the only senator to oppose Comcast's proposal to buy Time Warner Cable - a deal that would have given the combined company 57 percent of the broadband market. But advocates and ordinary citizens raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal.</p><p>Most recently, I've led my Senate colleagues in scrutinizing ATandT's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I've once again called on regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will cause to competition and consumers.</p><p>I've been proud to lead these efforts. And I leave here in a much different environment than when I arrived. I know that there are strong voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I'm gone.</p><p>These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a very important, larger development we've seen in our country. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's - and, in turn, Congress' - interest in combatting corporate consolidation.</p><p>When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure that most Americans understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to combine. Vertical integration and antitrust law sounded like obscure, almost boring, topics. But more and more Americans are getting educated about these issues, and more and more members of Congress are working to get Washington focused on how they affect the real lives of real people.</p><p>Just look at the fight for net neutrality.</p><p>For many of the same reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCU, I have long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and ATandT.</p><p>Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive - even when they're up against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here's just one example that I've always found useful.</p><p>In 2005, three guys set up shop above a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, California, where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something called \"Google Video.\" But Google Video wasn't very good.</p><p>Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to compete with Google on a level playing field. The giant internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumers' homes. Unsurprisingly, people liked YouTube a lot more than Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it for stock valued at $1.65 billion - nice chunk for three guys over a pizzeria in San Mateo.</p><p>But it's not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on an open internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that QUOTE \"Every retailer with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing, every bank offering online account management, every company with a website-every business in America interacting with its customers online is dependent upon an open Internet.\"</p><p>I've repeated this quote on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue. Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep-pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it.</p><p>If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we'll be entering a digital world where the powerful outrank the majority; a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how users get their information; and a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane.</p><p>For nearly nine years, I have been calling net neutrality the free speech issue of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has inspired so many of us in recent months - and has effected real change, like in the fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the Affordable Care Act--have depended, in no small part, on a free and open internet.</p><p>Now, in 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good things for net neutrality--it also had important implications for consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority - and the responsibility - to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win.</p><p>Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to Americans' right to privacy.</p><p>For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. I believe that they deserve both transparency and accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible.</p><p>This transparency and accountability should come from all the companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This includes internet service providers like Comcast and ATandT, but also edge providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</p><p>In 2011, I served as Chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law - a subcommittee that I founded after it became abundantly clear that our nation's privacy laws had failed to keep pace with rapidly-evolving technologies.</p><p>When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we've seen a fundamental shift in who has our information and what they're doing with it. That's not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about protecting ourselves from government abuses. But now, we also have relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing, sharing -- and in many cases, selling -- enormous amounts of our personal information.</p><p>When the Constitution was written, the founders had no way of anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example, and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The founders had no idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was also a search that required court approval.</p><p>All of this is a good thing: Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology and the changing expectations of American society. This is why the Constitution is often called a \"living\" document. But we have a long way to go to get our modern laws in line with modern technology.</p><p>My goal for the Subcommittee was to help members understand both the benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate the public and raise awareness about how their data are being collected, used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the law. And when politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed companies - many of them more than once - to be more transparent about how they were treating their customers' private information, including users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and face prints.</p><p>As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans' personal information, but unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of information isn't just a side project that they can choose to halt at any given time; for many of them, it's their whole business model. We are not their customers; we are their product.</p><p>Recently, we've seen just how scary this business model can be. In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 election, and both the public and members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives, based primarily on the mass collection of our personal information and complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy.</p><p>Not only do these companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance - specifically in the market of information - now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. And unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be up to the challenge that they've created for themselves.</p><p>The size of these companies is not - in isolation - the problem. But I am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans' personal information to further solidify their market power and consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and innovators that rely on their platforms to reach consumers. And as has become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism. It should go without saying that such power comes with great responsibility.</p><p>Everyone is currently - and rightfully - focused on Russian manipulation of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the broader questions. How did big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives\" How is it using our personal information to strengthen its reach and its bottom line\" Are these companies engaging in anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information and commerce\" Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and protect our democracy\" And finally, what role should these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward?</p><p>Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our lives. And it's given us extraordinary benefits. But as these companies continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we've recently confronted on the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity of our democracy.</p><p>Now, I won't be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to find the answers from the outside, but it's my colleagues in the Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There's simply too much at stake. And I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and encouragement of the American people.</p><p>I've witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson that I've learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason, and despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the public's interests that can ultimately prevail.</p><p>Thank you, M. President.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COS1V612202017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R78-YH31-JCCP-00SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3275\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 20, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjFBOUI3RTA1N0NBNDk2MUFFQzkyQzhFNTY1NDQ4NjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

President, I rise today to deliver the second in a series of floor speeches that I offer as I close out my time in the Senate.</p><p>This evening, I want to talk about Americans' relationship with telecommunications and technology companies, and what that means for their access to essential services and for their privacy.</p><p>When I entered the Senate in July 2009, then Majority Leader Reid asked me to serve on the Judiciary Committee. I pointed out that there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate, and that I wasn't one of them, but he said that he needed members with my perspective on the Committee. I wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it did - almost immediately - when in December of that year, Comcast announced its intention to acquire NBCUniversal.</p><p>I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it's the American consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on its platform.</p><p>And it was through my work on Comcast-NBCUniversal that I learned about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data that they were collecting on a perpetual basis.</p><p>I believe that consumers have a fundamental right to know what information is being collected about them. I believe that they have a right to decide whether they want to share that information, and with whom they want to share it and when. And I believe that consumers have a right to expect that companies that store their personal information will store it securely.</p><p>I also believe that all Americans deserve affordable access to high-quality telecommunications services - services they depend on to communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. And I believe that the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression that it has always been.</p><p>Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate, very few members of Congress were talking about corporate consolidation or commercial privacy or net neutrality - issues that have gained much-deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the reason for other members' hesitance, I felt that it was incumbent on me to get in the weeds on these issues, so that I could be a leader on them in the Senate and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary Minnesotans.</p><p>That's why when the interests of the American consumer have clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology companies, I've always tried to put the public first and to fight on their behalf - by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the tools at my disposal to curb them.</p><p>Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee - and more specifically my work on media and technology policy - that I believe my perspective from my previous career has been of most value.</p><p>Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable because I'd seen their motives for this deal before.</p><p>In 1993, during my thirteenth season at Saturday Night Live, the Big Three networks - NBC, CBS, and ABC - pressured Congress to change the rules that had previously prevented them from owning any of the shows that they aired in prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming competing programming.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks began giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time, Seinfeld, which aired on NBC, was the number one show on TV, which made the Thursday night time slot following Seinfeld the most valuable real estate on television. And I watched as the shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned, at least in part, by NBC.</p><p>So, when I became a senator, one of the first major deals that I opposed was Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. As in the case of ATandT's current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCU would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that programming. I knew that these incentives would hurt competing content creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm consumers.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements with the FCC and DOJ, favoring its own news programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and failing to live up to its promises regarding affordable standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming, and online video distribution. And because merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce, competition and consumers were harmed in the process.</p><p>Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It's also one of the major reasons I believe that that later deal was ultimately dropped after objections from the FCC and DOJ.</p><p>For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a year, I was the only senator to oppose Comcast's proposal to buy Time Warner Cable - a deal that would have given the combined company 57 percent of the broadband market. But advocates and ordinary citizens raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal.</p><p>Most recently, I've led my Senate colleagues in scrutinizing ATandT's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I've once again called on regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will cause to competition and consumers.</p><p>I've been proud to lead these efforts. And I leave here in a much different environment than when I arrived. I know that there are strong voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I'm gone.</p><p>These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a very important, larger development we've seen in our country. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's - and, in turn, Congress' - interest in combatting corporate consolidation.</p><p>When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure that most Americans understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to combine. Vertical integration and antitrust law sounded like obscure, almost boring, topics. But more and more Americans are getting educated about these issues, and more and more members of Congress are working to get Washington focused on how they affect the real lives of real people.</p><p>Just look at the fight for net neutrality.</p><p>For many of the same reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCU, I have long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and ATandT.</p><p>Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive - even when they're up against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here's just one example that I've always found useful.</p><p>In 2005, three guys set up shop above a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, California, where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something called \"Google Video.\" But Google Video wasn't very good.</p><p>Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to compete with Google on a level playing field. The giant internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumers' homes. Unsurprisingly, people liked YouTube a lot more than Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it for stock valued at $1.65 billion - nice chunk for three guys over a pizzeria in San Mateo.</p><p>But it's not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on an open internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that QUOTE \"Every retailer with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing, every bank offering online account management, every company with a website-every business in America interacting with its customers online is dependent upon an open Internet.\"</p><p>I've repeated this quote on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue. Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep-pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it.</p><p>If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we'll be entering a digital world where the powerful outrank the majority; a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how users get their information; and a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane.</p><p>For nearly nine years, I have been calling net neutrality the free speech issue of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has inspired so many of us in recent months - and has effected real change, like in the fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the Affordable Care Act-have depended, in no small part, on a free and open internet.</p><p>Now, in 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good things for net neutrality-it also had important implications for consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority - and the responsibility - to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win.</p><p>Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to Americans' right to privacy.</p><p>For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. I believe that they deserve both transparency and accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible.</p><p>This transparency and accountability should come from all the companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This includes internet service providers like Comcast and ATandT, but also edge providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</p><p>In 2011, I served as Chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law - a subcommittee that I founded after it became abundantly clear that our nation's privacy laws had failed to keep pace with rapidly-evolving technologies.</p><p>When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we've seen a fundamental shift in who has our information and what they're doing with it. That's not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about protecting ourselves from government abuses. But now, we also have relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing, sharing - and in many cases, selling - enormous amounts of our personal information.</p><p>When the Constitution was written, the founders had no way of anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example, and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The founders had no idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was also a search that required court approval.</p><p>All of this is a good thing: Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology and the changing expectations of American society. This is why the Constitution is often called a \"living\" document. But we have a long way to go to get our modern laws in line with modern technology.</p><p>My goal for the Subcommittee was to help members understand both the benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate the public and raise awareness about how their data are being collected, used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the law. And when politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed companies - many of them more than once - to be more transparent about how they were treating their customers' private information, including users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and face prints.</p><p>As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans' personal information, but unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of information isn't just a side project that they can choose to halt at any given time; for many of them, it's their whole business model. We are not their customers; we are their product.</p><p>Recently, we've seen just how scary this business model can be. In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 election, and both the public and members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives, based primarily on the mass collection of our personal information and complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy.</p><p>Not only do these companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance - specifically in the market of information - now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. And unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be up to the challenge that they've created for themselves.</p><p>The size of these companies is not - in isolation - the problem. But I am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans' personal information to further solidify their market power and consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and innovators that rely on their platforms to reach consumers. And as has become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism. It should go without saying that such power comes with great responsibility.</p><p>Everyone is currently - and rightfully - focused on Russian manipulation of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the broader questions. How did big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives? How is it using our personal information to strengthen its reach and its bottom line? Are these companies engaging in anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information and commerce? Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and protect our democracy? And finally, what role should these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward?</p><p>Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our lives. And it's given us extraordinary benefits. But as these companies continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we've recently confronted on the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity of our democracy.</p><p>Now, I won't be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to find the answers from the outside, but it's my colleagues in the Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There's simply too much at stake. And I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and encouragement of the American people.</p><p>I've witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson that I've learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason, and despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the public's interests that can ultimately prevail.</p><p>Thank you, M. President.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1121806123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R7B-0HT1-JCBF-S4Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3222\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 21, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

President, I rise today to deliver the second in a series of floor speeches that I offer as I close out my time in the Senate.</p><p>This evening, I want to talk about Americans' relationship with telecommunications and technology companies, and what that means for their access to essential services and for their privacy.</p><p>When I entered the Senate in July 2009, then Majority Leader Reid asked me to serve on the Judiciary Committee. I pointed out that there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate, and that I wasn't one of them, but he said that he needed members with my perspective on the Committee. I wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it did - almost immediately - when in December of that year, Comcast announced its intention to acquire NBCUniversal.</p><p>I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it's the American consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on its platform.</p><p>And it was through my work on Comcast-NBCUniversal that I learned about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data that they were collecting on a perpetual basis.</p><p>I believe that consumers have a fundamental right to know what information is being collected about them. I believe that they have a right to decide whether they want to share that information, and with whom they want to share it and when. And I believe that consumers have a right to expect that companies that store their personal information will store it securely.</p><p>I also believe that all Americans deserve affordable access to high-quality telecommunications services - services they depend on to communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. And I believe that the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression that it has always been.</p><p>Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate, very few members of Congress were talking about corporate consolidation or commercial privacy or net neutrality - issues that have gained much-deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the reason for other members' hesitance, I felt that it was incumbent on me to get in the weeds on these issues, so that I could be a leader on them in the Senate and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary Minnesotans.</p><p>That's why when the interests of the American consumer have clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology companies, I've always tried to put the public first and to fight on their behalf - by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the tools at my disposal to curb them.</p><p>Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee - and more specifically my work on media and technology policy - that I believe my perspective from my previous career has been of most value.</p><p>Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable because I'd seen their motives for this deal before.</p><p>In 1993, during my thirteenth season at Saturday Night Live, the Big Three networks - NBC, CBS, and ABC - pressured Congress to change the rules that had previously prevented them from owning any of the shows that they aired in prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming competing programming.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks began giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time, Seinfeld, which aired on NBC, was the number one show on TV, which made the Thursday night time slot following Seinfeld the most valuable real estate on television. And I watched as the shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned, at least in part, by NBC.</p><p>So, when I became a senator, one of the first major deals that I opposed was Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. As in the case of ATandT's current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCU would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that programming. I knew that these incentives would hurt competing content creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm consumers.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements with the FCC and DOJ, favoring its own news programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and failing to live up to its promises regarding affordable standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming, and online video distribution. And because merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce, competition and consumers were harmed in the process.</p><p>Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It's also one of the major reasons I believe that that later deal was ultimately dropped after objections from the FCC and DOJ.</p><p>For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a year, I was the only senator to oppose Comcast's proposal to buy Time Warner Cable - a deal that would have given the combined company 57 percent of the broadband market. But advocates and ordinary citizens raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal.</p><p>Most recently, I've led my Senate colleagues in scrutinizing ATandT's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I've once again called on regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will cause to competition and consumers.</p><p>I've been proud to lead these efforts. And I leave here in a much different environment than when I arrived. I know that there are strong voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I'm gone.</p><p>These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a very important, larger development we've seen in our country. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's - and, in turn, Congress' - interest in combatting corporate consolidation.</p><p>When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure that most Americans understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to combine. Vertical integration and antitrust law sounded like obscure, almost boring, topics. But more and more Americans are getting educated about these issues, and more and more members of Congress are working to get Washington focused on how they affect the real lives of real people.</p><p>Just look at the fight for net neutrality.</p><p>For many of the same reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCU, I have long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and ATandT.</p><p>Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive - even when they're up against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here's just one example that I've always found useful.</p><p>In 2005, three guys set up shop above a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, California, where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something called \"Google Video.\" But Google Video wasn't very good.</p><p>Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to compete with Google on a level playing field. The giant internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumers' homes. Unsurprisingly, people liked YouTube a lot more than Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it for stock valued at $1.65 billion - nice chunk for three guys over a pizzeria in San Mateo.</p><p>But it's not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on an open internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that QUOTE \"Every retailer with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing, every bank offering online account management, every company with a website-every business in America interacting with its customers online is dependent upon an open Internet.\"</p><p>I've repeated this quote on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue. Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep-pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it.</p><p>If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we'll be entering a digital world where the powerful outrank the majority; a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how users get their information; and a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane.</p><p>For nearly nine years, I have been calling net neutrality the free speech issue of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has inspired so many of us in recent months - and has effected real change, like in the fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the Affordable Care Act-have depended, in no small part, on a free and open internet.</p><p>Now, in 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good things for net neutrality-it also had important implications for consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority - and the responsibility - to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win.</p><p>Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to Americans' right to privacy.</p><p>For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. I believe that they deserve both transparency and accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible.</p><p>This transparency and accountability should come from all the companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This includes internet service providers like Comcast and ATandT, but also edge providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</p><p>In 2011, I served as Chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law - a subcommittee that I founded after it became abundantly clear that our nation's privacy laws had failed to keep pace with rapidly-evolving technologies.</p><p>When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we've seen a fundamental shift in who has our information and what they're doing with it. That's not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about protecting ourselves from government abuses. But now, we also have relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing, sharing - and in many cases, selling - enormous amounts of our personal information.</p><p>When the Constitution was written, the founders had no way of anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example, and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The founders had no idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was also a search that required court approval.</p><p>All of this is a good thing: Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology and the changing expectations of American society. This is why the Constitution is often called a \"living\" document. But we have a long way to go to get our modern laws in line with modern technology.</p><p>My goal for the Subcommittee was to help members understand both the benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate the public and raise awareness about how their data are being collected, used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the law. And when politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed companies - many of them more than once - to be more transparent about how they were treating their customers' private information, including users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and face prints.</p><p>As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans' personal information, but unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of information isn't just a side project that they can choose to halt at any given time; for many of them, it's their whole business model. We are not their customers; we are their product.</p><p>Recently, we've seen just how scary this business model can be. In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 election, and both the public and members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives, based primarily on the mass collection of our personal information and complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy.</p><p>Not only do these companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance - specifically in the market of information - now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. And unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be up to the challenge that they've created for themselves.</p><p>The size of these companies is not - in isolation - the problem. But I am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans' personal information to further solidify their market power and consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and innovators that rely on their platforms to reach consumers. And as has become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism. It should go without saying that such power comes with great responsibility.</p><p>Everyone is currently - and rightfully - focused on Russian manipulation of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the broader questions. How did big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives? How is it using our personal information to strengthen its reach and its bottom line? Are these companies engaging in anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information and commerce? Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and protect our democracy? And finally, what role should these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward?</p><p>Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our lives. And it's given us extraordinary benefits. But as these companies continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we've recently confronted on the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity of our democracy.</p><p>Now, I won't be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to find the answers from the outside, but it's my colleagues in the Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There's simply too much at stake. And I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and encouragement of the American people.</p><p>I've witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson that I've learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason, and despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the public's interests that can ultimately prevail.</p><p>Thank you, M. President.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=press_releaseandid=3810\">https://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=press_releaseandid=3810</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSSMC21752X9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R7G-XN21-JCCP-01TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3247\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 21, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjFBOUI3RTA1N0NBNDk2MUFFQzkyQzhFNTY1NDQ4NjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Lindsey Graham assumes the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee, most of the discussion has centered around how he will handle judicial nominations, oversight of the border, and the alleged abusive behavior of the Big Tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While all these issues are as important as ever given our current political climate, there remain serious matters in the South Carolina business community that must be addressed by the body Graham now leads. Our policymakers' ultimate decisions on these issues will certainly have a more immediate and substantial impact on small businesses and everyday people than will the favored subjects of the Beltway reporters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Small businesses in our state are all too well acquainted with some of these judicial matters. In fact, over a dozen of the Palmetto State's establishments, from Fleet Landing in Charleston to Rush's Food Systems in Columbia to the Coastal Carolina Winery in Myrtle Beach, have joined my company, Stems &amp; Skins in North Charleston, in addressing the need for officials like Sen. Graham to keep institutional monopoly power under control. Specifically, we are advocating for the preservation of the Justice Department's regulatory barriers on two music copyright organizations known as ASCAP and BMI - rules that save consumers and the restaurants, breweries and shops they support significant degrees of money and frustration every year.</p><p>ASCAP and BMI, which are essentially the end-product of independent music publishers unionizing together, control the performing rights to close to every song that has ever been recorded. Thanks to the existence of these institutions, companies like the one I own are not faced with the impossible task of negotiating with every copyright stakeholder of every unique song for usage rights. However, the only reason the current system works is because of the regulations the government implemented to ensure ASCAP and BMI don't use their high market share to raise prices on the American people.</p><p>To prevent this inevitability from occurring, years ago the Justice Department had these two organizations agree to terms spelled out within federal consent decrees. The settlements ASCAP and BMI signed indicate they must provide licenses for their entire repertoires at reasonable rates and face a rate court when there is no agreement to clear allegations of abuse. This system has for decades prevented the prevalence of anti-competitive behavior, all while ASCAP and BMI attain record revenue numbers on an almost annual basis.</p><p>Although the entire business community has become dependent on the consent decrees' existence, in a surprise twist of fate, the future of these critical market protections has become uncertain. Currently, the Department of Justice is reviewing the ASCAP and BMI decrees and assessing whether they are still needed today.</p><p>Making the wrong decision could have significant economic implications, which is why so many South Carolina establishments have joined Stems &amp; Skins in voicing their concerns to Washington.</p><p>Thankfully, the people of the Palmetto State have their own watchdog in Washington that can help steer the Justice Department's review process in the right direction. Because of the Music Modernization Act, a bill passed by Congress last year, the Justice Department must deliberate and share all pertinent information on its review process with Congress, especially the relevant committees. One of the most important ones concerning this issue is the Judiciary Committee - the very body that Sen. Graham now leads in the Senate.</p><p>The people of South Carolina do not deserve yet another hidden tax, especially one that exists for the sole purpose of allowing the Hollywood bosses running the big music publishing houses to become just a bit richer.</p><p>We have confidence that Sen. Graham, now a member of the inner leadership team in Washington, D.C., will answer our calls for help in ensuring that the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees remain in place.</p><p>Matt Tunstall is the co-owner of Stems &amp; Skins in North Charleston.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5c4233d95e89aimage\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In a file photo from Wednesday, Sept. 26, 2018.

Hawley Drops Section 230 Bill, Drawing Speech Concerns From Key Republicans</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced legislation to remove Section 230 immunity for big tech companies unless they prove to the FTC every two years that content removal decisions are politically neutral. The bill drew concern from House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., and House Commerce Committee ranking member Greg Walden, R-Ore. They warned against government regulation of speech.</p><p>The Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act would apply to companies with at least 30 million active monthly U.S. users, at least 300 million global monthly users or more than $500 million in global annual revenue. Large tech companies would be forced, through audits, to give the FTC clear and convincing evidence their algorithms and content-removal practices are \"politically neutral.\" The agency would certify companies every two years for immunity through a supermajority vote, and the companies would cover the costs of the audits. There's growing evidence big tech companies are \"making editorial decisions to censor viewpoints they disagree with,\" Hawley said. \"Even worse, the entire process is shrouded in secrecy because these companies refuse to make their protocols public.\"</p><p>In separate interviews, Collins and Walden, who weren't up to speed on bill specifics, asked who would determine evidence of bias. \"He wants a governmental board to determine political bias?\" Collins asked. \"I haven't read his bill, [but] that would tend to be concerning.\" Walden equated the measure to the fairness doctrine, a defunct policy that required broadcasters to present balanced views on public interest issues. \"As an old broadcaster, I was never in favor of the fairness doctrine. I never wanted the government deciding speech. I don't know how you make that work\" with First Amendment principles, Walden said.</p><p>There needs to be oversight to ensure bias doesn't influence platform algorithms, but the FTC might not be the best entity, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told us. \"I don't want to destroy the industry,\" he said. \"If you're liable for everything anybody says or does on these networks, you probably won't stay in business very long.\" But Congress needs to address the consolidation of \"an enormous amount of power in the hands of people without a whole lot of accountability,\" he said.</p><p>A bill like Hawley's \"would get my attention, but I'm not sure I want to say right now that that's the answer,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. He agreed there's a \"major problem\" that needs to be addressed to ensure fairness for content on platforms. Like Collins and Walden, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., raised constitutional issues, citing \"political content speech on the internet.\"</p><p>This legislation would give tech companies an impossible choice, said Internet Association CEO Michael Beckerman: \"either host reprehensible, but First Amendment protected speech, or lose legal protections that allow them to moderate illegal content like human trafficking and violent extremism. That shouldn't be a tradeoff.\" Restricting the legal protection that enables platforms to police content would allow more hate speech and illegal material, said Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association CEO Ed Black. \"This is an unbelievable disregard for the essence of the First Amendment and attempt to overlay a lens of partisan politics over the communications of millions of Americans.\"</p><p>Americans for Prosperity Policy Analyst Billy Easley took issue with \"stricter government control\" over free expression: \"Eroding the crucial protections that exist under Section 230 creates a scenario where government has the ability to police your speech and determine what you can or cannot say online.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDM-C8J1-JC8G-81WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"621\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 20, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Josh Hawley announced a bill Monday that allows Americans to block tech companies from tracking people's locations without direct consent. Hawley's legislation creates a program similar to the national Do Not Call list that gives people the power to prevent online companies from collecting any more data than what is otherwise necessary for the companies' services. </p><p>It also prohibits entities like Google from profiling Americans who activate the so-called Do Not Track program. 'Big tech companies collect incredible amounts of deeply personal, private data from people without giving them the option to meaningfully consent,' Hawley noted in a press statement[1].(Article Continues Below Advertisement) He said these companies have employed 'creepy surveillance tactics on their users,' adding that 'too often the extent of this data extraction is only known after a tech company irresponsibly handles the data.' The legislation, if passed, could seriously alter the business models of many online companies. The Missouri Republican's bill also bans Google and others from transferring data to other companies unless the first company is an intended intermediary. Google has come under scrutiny recently over its collection of personal data. An executive at Google admitted during a March congressional testimony[2] that the company still tracks a user's geolocation after the person turns off location history, a feature that allows people to hide their location. Hawley has made a name for himself recently as a Republican who is lending some intellectual might to concerns about the nature of big tech. He has introduced several pieces[3] of legislation aimed at cracking down on what conservatives believe is Google's misuse of consumers' private data.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) One bill, introduced May 14, requires[4] President Donald Trump to restrict any technology to China that would contribute to the communist country's military. That legislation, if it passes, places heavy restrictions on technology that influences artificial intelligence, semiconductors and robots. It also restricts any kind of tech China might use to violate human rights. Another piece oflegislation bans[5] 'pay-to-win' apps targeted at children, which pay for upgrades and other rewards even though the applications are initially provided for free. Hawley cited Candy Crush as one of the biggest culprits of leveraging children's willingness to learn for profit. His flurry of parliamentary procedure comes as conservatives haggle over how to approach regulating Facebook and Twitter. The debate is heating up as media reports show[6]Facebook, which has been criticized in the past for reportedly suppressing conservative content, banned Alex Jones and his outlet, Infowars; political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos; radio host Paul Joseph Watson; activist Laura Loomer and former congressional candidate Paul Nehlen. The Silicon Valley titan also nixed Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a move thatultimately received[7]scorn from rapper Snoop Dogg, among others. Trump, for his part, dinged Facebook for taking action against Watson, telling[8] his Twitter followers May 3 he is surprised to see 'conservative thinkers like Paul Watson banned from Facebook!' Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act [1]. The bill restricts the applicability of legal liability protections for online service providers, currently found in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. </p><p>The legislation would only apply to the largest platforms, defined as \u201cedge providers\u201d in the bill\u2019s text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following may be attributed to Daisy Soderberg-Rivkin [2], Resident Fellow for Technology Policy at the R Street Institute and former legal removal associate at Google:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis legislation is another in a long series of misguided attacks on Section 230. This time, it puts platforms on the receiving end of unending lawsuits for their moderation decisions, thereby disincentivizing any moderation at all.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe bill uses strategically vague language to attack the perceived suppression of conservative speech on the largest social media platforms. Going well beyond reasonable community guidelines, this bill introduces undefined and indeterminate concepts like \u2018bad faith\u2019 and \u2018intentionally selective enforcement\u2019 that will raise questions in the courts and trigger waves of litigation for years to come.

JOHN CORNYN DELIVERS REMARKS AT THE ANNUAL CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL ACTION CONFERENCE AND CONSERVATISM 2.0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FEBRUARY 27, 2009</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R-TEXAS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COLLEEN HOLMES, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, EAGLE FORUM</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] HOLMES: Good morning. My name is Colleen Holmes. I am the executive director of Eagle Forum here in Washington, D.C., and it is a great honor this morning to introduce our speaker.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As any gentleman will tell, it takes a real patriot and a truly dedicated public servant to leave the great state of Texas to come to Washington, D.C. Well, we've got some Texans in the House this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's especially true when you have a career that's as distinguished as Senator John Cornyn. Before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002, he served as Texas District Court judge, a member of the Texas Supreme Court and Texas attorney general.</p><p>Senator Cornyn's colleagues have joked that he is the only person in the Senate to have practiced real law and that grounding in real life is more important than ever in these times where we're hearing about so many different brands and justice, social justice, economic justice, even environmental justice.</p><p>But as a seasoned jurist, Senator Cornyn knows that true justice does not have a political agenda. And for that reason, he has taken unwavering stance, calling for strict constructionists' jurisprudence, and he strongly condemned the practice of judges legislating from the bench.</p><p>Throughout his career, Senator Cornyn has tirelessly advocated for open government and accountable government. Or as he would put it, he started to bring some Texas sunshine to Washington and, boy, do we need that?</p><p>Part of these efforts include his instrumental role in passing the 2007 OPEN Government Act, which extensively reformed the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p>Senator Cornyn currently sits on the Senate finance judiciary and budget committees and serves as a top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Refugees and Border Security Subcommittee.</p><p>He also serves as the deputy -- on the Deputy Whip team after just one year in office and has been a member of the Republican Senate Leadership since 2006. He has served as the vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.</p><p>And in November of 2008, his colleagues chose him to lead their National Republican Senatorial Committee where he continues to advocate for strong conservative principles of bolstering our national defense, repairing our broken immigration system and securing our borders and strengthening the economy by expanding job opportunities, keeping taxes low and reducing spending.</p><p>Senator Cornyn is a graduate of Trinity University and St. Mary School of Law, both in Texas, and he earned the masters of law from the University of Virginia Law School. I hope the Texas will forgive him that. And as further evidence of his excellent judgment and something that we at Eagle Forum certainly appreciate, I understand that Senator Cornyn has a unique appreciation and often expresses his appreciation for conservative women. He married one and raised two.</p><p>He has been married to his wife, Sandy, who is with him today for 29 years. Please welcome Senator John Cornyn.</p><p>CORNYN: Thank you very much. Ms. Colleen, thank you for that very nice introduction, and it's great to be with all of you here at CPAC.</p><p>I appreciate all of the conservatives coming from around the country to here to Washington, D.C., because the fact is, as you have heard learned that change has indeed come to Washington. You can see it as you ride around the public transportation system where it's now more crowded under the bus than it is on the bus.</p><p>And you can see this as you stroll by the office of the IRS, where it's now, of course, patriotic to pay your taxes unless, of course, you are a member of Obama's cabinet.</p><p>And just this week, the Democrats have tried change the District of Columbia to the State of Columbia with its own representative in Congress and perhaps some day to senators too.</p><p>But one thing will never change. The elites in Washington and the media will continue to betray conservatives as out of touch, out of fashion and out of luck. But one thing hasn't changed: they are wrong.</p><p>Following the thumping we got in the last election, the conservative movement is regrouping, reorganizing and renewing itself. And we're bringing forward new leaders to restore America's strength and prosperity and to defend our enduring values.</p><p>Conservatives have been in the wilderness before. And as before, we can begin the work of picking ourself up and dusting ourself off right here at CPAC.</p><p>Back in 1977, after Democrats had taken control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Ron Reagan came to CPAC and reminded us that America's values had not changed.</p><p>He said, \"We who are proud to call ourselves conservative are not a minority of a minority party. We are part of the great majority of Americans of both parties and of most independence as well.\"</p><p>Of course, four years later, Ronald Reagan returned to CPAC as president of the United States. And soon after that, America began one of its longest periods of economic expansion. And the Soviet Union was on its way to the ash heap of history.</p><p>As President Reagan was beginning his second term, I first ran for public office. Back then, Texas was a one-party state, Democratic, and they held the stranglehold on virtually every office from the local level to the state level. And perhaps unsurprisingly, corruption was a serious problem.</p><p>Well, despite the odds and a few of us decided to buck the system and run. We ran as Republicans. More importantly perhaps, we ran as reformers. And we won.</p><p>Since then, I have had the honor to serve in all three branches of government, the judicial, the executive and now on the legislative branch as United States senator, representing my beloved Texas. Make sure you give the Texans time to applause there.</p><p>As a conservative, I can't tell you that I won every battle I have engaged in. As a conservative, I had to keep learning about how to apply our principles to new challenges.</p><p>But as a conservative, I found that when you stand on principle consistently, you can earn the public trust and even the respect of your adversaries and good things can happen.</p><p>I still believe good things can happen. Following his primary defeat in 1976, Ronald Reagan was quoted in old Irish ballad, and said, \"I will lay me down and bleed a while. Though I am wounded, I am not slain. I will rise and fight again.\"</p><p>I believe as conservatives, we spend enough time bleeding. And now, it's the time to get back in the battle and fight. I do believe that we need to choose our battles wisely.</p><p>With a new president, with the kind of popularity new presidents tend to have, we need to pick those battles, but make no -- have no doubt about it. It is a time to fight back. And that's why I agree to take on a new job in addition to new six-year term as United States senator from Texas, as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.</p><p>In case you haven't noticed, the Republican caucus in the Senate is a lot smaller than it was just a few years ago.</p><p>In fact, in 2002, when I came to Washington representing Texas, we had 55 Republican senators. And now, they are 41. I think it's just obvious that if we don't turn this around, then soon we will be able to run out the Republican cloakroom and just meet on the elevator.</p><p>But you all understand what having 41 senators means. It means we barely have enough votes to deny cloture in the Senate, and that is if all Republicans stick together. No easy task depending on the issue.</p><p>Having 41 means that we have leverage to block bad legislation or perhaps more importantly to shape it, and to bring Democrats to the negotiating table, so we can actually improve it and send a bill to the president that he will and should sign.</p><p>Having 41 Republicans means that Harry Reid is only one vote away on each and every piece of legislation from having filibuster-proof majority, and having in effect what Nancy Pelosi has in the House. So I think it's just obvious as a nose on our face, our mission is clear, we must win more Republican seats. We must build a new majority.</p><p>And this is just as important. In the process we must regain the trust and confidence of the American people. Our first task is to support a good man, Norm Coleman in Minnesota,</p><p>Norm is a fantastic human being and he is a great leader that Minnesotans can be proud of. The Democrats, of course, are up to their old tricks, up there in the land of 10,000 lakes, which has now become the land of 10,000 lawyers, as Al Franken continues to try to steal this election,</p><p>Now, I believe that Norm has a real shot at pulling this out in the recount litigation that's occurring right now. I am still calling him \"old number 42.\" We'll continue to support Norm, and I encourage you to do so as well, because we need him back, </p><p>Our second task is to be honest with ourselves about why we lost so many seats over these last two cycles. And I believe it boils down to this.</p><p>We lost the trust of the American people. A post-election survey sums it up. When asked which party sticks to their principles more often, only 37 percent said Republicans, while 44 percent said the Democratic Party -- shocking to me,</p><p>The good news is our conservative principles weren't the problem. According to the same survey, 69 percent of the American people describe themselves as fiscal conservatives, while only 27 percent said they were liberals on issues like taxes and spending, and 53 percent describe themselves as social conservatives, Compared to 40 percent, who say they are liberals on issues like abortion or same sex marriage.</p><p>Democrats understand these numbers too, that's why they recruited a junior senator from Pennsylvania who is pro-life and a junior senator from New York who sleeps with guns under her bed,</p><p>And that's why Obama, quite skillfully, but deceptively promised tax cuts to 95 percent of the American people, and promised it so often that by the end of the presidential campaign, as amazing as it may sound, more voters thought he would be better bet on taxes than John McCain,</p><p>So the message to the voters seems pretty clear to me. The American people will support us if we stick to our principles and they will abandon us if we don't.</p><p>Now to reclaim our party's identity, we must demonstrate our principles in respectful opposition. Principle opposition means supporting the idea of the stimulus bill, if it's timely targeted and temporary, and opposing when it's not.</p><p>Principle opposition means supporting the administration, when it calls for greater transparency and accountability in government, and exposing their hypocrisy when their rhetoric doesn't match reality.</p><p>And principle opposition means reading the fine print on what the Democrats are actually doing and explaining the American people what they're trying to get away with.</p><p>One example of reading the fine print is drawing attention to what I call, \"Bailouts for Trial Lawyers,\" the Democrats moved through Congress recently.</p><p>Now, trial lawyers have give a big money to the Democrats and they seem to be getting their money's worth for their investment.</p><p>In the stimulus bill, in the so called Lilly Ledbetter Act, and another legislation moving through Congress, the Democrats are encouraging more litigation and creating more uncertainty in the workplace.</p><p>Now I think the last thing in our businesses and our job creators need is to worry about the threat of more litigation, but that's exactly what the democrats are trying to do.</p><p>We must read the fine print and help the American people understand what it means. The simple truth is for millions of voters who voted for this president, they didn't think they were voting for bailouts for trial lawyers, but that's what they got.</p><p>Our task is to show them what's really going on here in Washington. So that the furlong (ph) they are saying that's simply is not what we bargained for in this last election.</p><p>The fourth thing we need to do is to recruit good candidates to run as Republicans in 2010. Right now, I see the landscape is pretty promising. There are some incumbent seats in the U.S. Senate that we've got to defend, and open seats we must hold, like Ohio, Missouri and Florida.</p><p>And we may even have some unexpected opportunities in places like New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Arkansas, Colorado, Nevada, and yes, even California. </p><p>As somebody who has run in 14 contested elections, I'm a strong believer that getting the right candidate is 90 percent of the game, getting candidates who can communicate our principles, who will work hard, and will connect with the voters in their states.</p><p>And the National Republican Senatorial Committee, working with Michael Steele at the RNC, and my friend Pete Sessions over at the Congressional Committee -- we can offer good candidates the tools they need in order to win.</p><p>Now, not all of these candidates are going to be as conservative as I am on each and every issue, it's critical that we get candidates that will fit their states and who can get elected.</p><p>But I don't think there's any contradiction between being principled and pragmatic. As I said, I'm one of -- I'm proud to be the fourth most conservative Republican in the United States Senate. Back in Texas, we call that mainstream.</p><p>But I have to tell you, I would rather have a Republican who votes with me 80 percent of the time than a liberal Democrat who will vote with me zero percent of the time. You can sign me up on each and every occasion to support that Republican for election and to oppose that Democrat.</p><p>Now I understand that, occasionally, we get frustrated by the way some of my colleagues vote -- I do to. But a circular firing squad is no solution to the problems our party finds itself to in right now.</p><p>Remember that Ronald Reagan was able to accomplish quite a lot with Republican caucus that was not as conservative as our caucus is even today, because, and this is important, because he had a Republican majority in United States Senate.</p><p>When today's Republican recapture the majority, we will be able to control the agenda. As you know, the chairman of a committee determines what bills are called up in the committee. The majority leader, when Mitch McConnell is majority leader then he will be able to determine which bills actually come to the floor of the Senate.</p><p>And we will be able to keep the worse liberal ideas off the floor entirely, and. of course in doing so, to limit the chances of division among our rights.</p><p>So to be a national party we have to put blue and purple states into play. We must be a national party and we must run candidates that can win in every region of the country.</p><p>Now this brings me to my final point. I believe it's very important that we broaden our party and we increase our appeal among groups that share our values, conservative values, but they don't necessarily identify themselves as Republicans or maybe even identify themselves as conservatives.</p><p>Some of these people I'm talking about are independents. Some are young people, who are just forming their own thoughts about how government should work. Many are Hispanics, African-Americans or members of other ethnic and religious communities.</p><p>Reaching to these people doesn't mean apologizing for our principles or watering them down, it doesn't mean saying, yes, but less to every liberal initiative.</p><p>Above all it doesn't mean playing the game of identity politics that the Democrats seem to play so well. Conservatives must resist the poisonous liberal notion that political convictions come from your race, or your class, rather than your head and your heart.</p><p>Reaching out does mean getting out there and leaving with these folks, and welcome them, and explaining to them, who we are and inviting them to join us.</p><p>But I believe the sage philosopher Woody Allen it about right. When he said that 80 percent of success in life is showing up then we need show up. We need to show up not just at election time, but all the time.</p><p>Now, some of the way we can show up, but we can't do so when person is by embracing new technology. And we have learnt from Obama how devastating that new technology can be when used against us. But we've got to embrace it and used it ourselves. And we have to use new networking compatibilities in order to reach out.</p><p>But some times -- and I think most of the time -- the best way to show up is just to sit down with people face to face, and treat them with the dignity that they deserve, and explain to them why we are conservatives, and why we believe conservative principles affirm that human dignity, and are the best way for us to exercise our freedoms here in America.</p><p>Let me give you just one example. Last November, I won 36 percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas. Now I wish that number were higher, I won't lie to you, but I'm proud that I got so high in a pretty tough election.</p><p>36 percent of the vote was actually 5 points higher than Senator McCain got nation wide among Hispanics and I had a Hispanic opponent.</p><p>Despite...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CORNYN: Now, despite broad Hispanic support for the McCain- Kennedy immigration bill, as you know, I had major reservations about it and I ended up voting no.</p><p>But nevertheless, many Hispanics...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CORNYN: Many Hispanics, Republicans, independents and Democrats ended up supporting me for one simple reason.</p><p>We took the time and effort to build relationships within the Hispanic community.</p><p>We demonstrated our respect by showing up and telling them both what we were doing and listening to their concerns in responding.</p><p>As we build these relationships, we discovered that something I think that is very important for all of us here at CPAC to understand, Hispanics are among the most conservative voters in the nation when it comes to their basic core values.</p><p>Hispanics own small businesses, so they respond to our economic message of lower taxes and sensible regulation.</p><p>Hispanics are social conservatives and believe in traditional marriage and the sanctity of human life.</p><p>And many Hispanics appreciate the facts that Republicans are the ones that stand up when it comes to trade and foreign policy. We reject demigods like Hugo Chavez; we support reformers like President Calderon in Mexico, and President Reuben in Columbia.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CORNYN: And we work to expand trade throughout our hemisphere and around the globe, because we believe that creates jobs and opportunity right here at home.</p><p>The false liberal narrative that conservatives want to push people out of the movement is just that. It's false.</p><p>The truth is our principles when correctly explained can draw people in.</p><p>Well, it's been a tough year for conservatives, there's no question about it.</p><p>As many people predicted here at CPAC, just a year ago, as our dear departed friend Tony Snow reminded us then when one act of the drama ends, another is sure to begin.</p><p>This is our moment Tony said, \"This is the time to do what we do best, turn adversity into strength.\"</p><p>We're not about to walk back from the high ideals and grand accomplishments that we've achieved over the last generation.</p><p>Ronald Reagan, Tony Snow, and so many others who have inspired us are gone, but their principles, the principles that inspired them are still with us because they lived for lives on.</p><p>We who gathered here at CPAC are some of those who will carry that conservative banner forward.</p><p>Others will join us from every state across the land, and together we can earn the support of the American people and create a new era of opportunity.</p><p>Thank you, very much and God bless you all.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(UNKNOWN): Anybody have any doubt? Right, Texans are awfully proud of Senator John Cornyn...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(UNKNOWN): Every right today. Introducing our next guest is Larry Hart.</p><p>He is the director of government relations for the American Conservative Union and brings 13 years of experience in the legislative and executive branches of the government.</p><p>In 1999, he formed Hartco Strategies, a media relations and political consulting firm whose clients ranged from members of Congress to non-profits, and he's been involved in politics at every level throughout his career. </p><p>He also served as the professional staff of the House science committee, on subcommittee on energy and environment for four years after a three-year stint at the Department of Energy, issues that are increasingly important to all of us.</p><p>Earlier, he was communications director for Congressman Dana Rohrabacher of California and, before that, the late Herb Bateman of Virginia.</p><p>He's also been active in efforts to rebuild Afghanistan, serving as pro-bono executive director of the Afghanistan-America Foundation, and in 2002, produced \"Life After War,\" a documentary focusing on NPR with war correspondent Sarah Chayes who left media to help rebuild a village near Kandahar.</p><p>He's also, for those who may stay up late and watch late night, was a child actor and for the all-night cable enthusiast you may see him occasionally on the \"The Real McCoys\" and \"The Donna Reed Show,\" making a rare, early morning appearance, Larry Hart.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>HART: Good morning. Good looking morning, crowd. You know one of the hardest things in politics is to give up a safe seat in Congress to run for higher office. Particularly, when it means taking on your parties establishment in a primary.</p><p>Many consider it, few do it. But that's exactly what our next speaker did in 2004, when he gave up his House seat to run for the Senate.</p><p>Jim DeMint took on former South Carolina Governor David Beasley and a wealthy developer and finished second, well behind Beasley in the first round of the primary.</p><p>Undaunted, he persuade and won the run off easily, then went on to defeat the well known state education superintendent in the general election.</p><p>Well, taking on tough challenges as characterized Jim DeMint's Senate career as he is the leading opponent of the Senate, of the ultimate bipartisan sacred cow, the earmark.</p><p>For this...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>HART: ...For this Bob Novak has called him a hero, and the Wall Street Journal Steve Moore, the taxpayers greatest allay for saving the taxpayers some $17 billion by his actions.</p><p>Now among some of his colleagues, there are few less laudatory labels. But at the American Conservative Union, we call him a defender of liberty, for being the only senator to score 100 on our ratings for 2008.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>HART: A year that's all Republicans barely divided on the best course of action. Well for Jim DeMint, the course of action was clear.</p><p>Apply conservative principals to every vote you cast.</p><p>He defines it this way. \"The greatness of a country is found in its people and its values, not in its governments.\"</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>HART: Jim DeMint is applying those principles to the chairmanship of the Senate's steering committee, which includes a majority of the Republican conference and works to advance conservative causes in the Senate.</p><p>Just yesterday, he forced the Senate to vote on his amendment to repudiate efforts to restore the so-called \"Fairness Doctrine.\"</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>HART: It carried overwhelmingly.</p><p>Pleasure to introduce Senator Jim DeMint.</p><p>(APPLUASE)</p><p>DEMINT: I need you folks to get me out of bed every morning. I think, I am ready to go fly.</p><p>I can't thank you enough. You don't know how encouraging it is to those who of us who are in the fight for 9000 of you to come from all over the country to encourage us, and to create that critical mass that keeps us moving forward.</p><p>So, thank you for being here and thanks for getting up so early this morning to listen to us.</p><p>I am just back from the frontlines and we do have a few things to celebrate from yesterday. </p><p>And we are seeing with examples like this fairness doctrine that with the support of the American people through bloggers and radio talk shows, we can get people to speak out and to stand up and to call-in and e-mail, and we can change the minds of so many senators if we have people who are willing to stand up and fight.</p><p>Yesterday we did, force a vote. They wouldn't allow this vote in the House, but I worked with members of the House. We worked together to work the media, to get the message and the truth to the people that this potential of the fairness doctrine coming back was a real threat.</p><p>And they couldn't get a vote in the House for because the rules in the Senate, we could add it as an amendment to something else, and we forced the Democrats out of their closets and we got 87 votes to kill the fairness doctrine.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>DEMINT: And we need to take that same idea, that same process of engaging the American people to take back our government and to take back our country and I believe that we can and I believe in some ways it's starting right here this week with you folks converging on Washington to tell us that you are behind us.</p><p>Well, I am excited about yesterday, but I am actually more excited about something else.</p><p>My wife and I are on baby watch, grand baby watch actually.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>DEMINT: Now, we're expecting our second grandson tomorrow actually.</p><p>So, if you see me run off the stage, you see I got a better offer than you have here this morning.</p><p>When our first grandson, he's two-and-a-half years, his name is Jimbo (ph). That's a good New England name, right?</p><p>You could tell on from south of the Mason-Dixon Line.</p><p>But I tell you this, and I could see some of you in the audience who are probably grandparents too and you know it's true when I say it that the only thing in life, it's not overrated, is being a grandparent.</p><p>But it does -- it gives you new perspective of what we are working for here, and it is about our children and grand children, and the future of the country, carrying on with so many who fought and died for. </p><p>It's a very real cause that we are here fighting for.</p><p>I really appreciate my good friend, John Cornyn.</p><p>He's not only part of our elected leadership and responsible for getting a Republicans elected to the Senate, but he is one of the conservative leaders that sits around a small table with me on the steering committee to help move our Republican conferences back towards conservative principles.</p><p>He's got a tough job. He has got a tough job, and he is right. We have to find ways to appeal to a larger number of American voters. And I believe we can, but not by saying one thing and doing another, not by talking about limited government, while increasing the number of earmarks, expanding government, spending in debt to historic levels.</p><p>Before we earn the votes of Americans, we must re-earn the trust of the American people.</p><p>The current majority and the new administration has plans to expand the reach of government beyond anything that we've ever imagined. Now is the time for conservatives to champion the ideas that have worked and will work for America. Now is the time to show America the real differences between the parties.</p><p>The party politics and political labels will not win elections. We must stand for the principles that work, the principles that made America great and will make America great in the future. I believe we can win the hearts and minds of many more Americans, but not by changing what we believe, not by abandoning our principles.</p><p>We can do it by convincing Hispanics, Sacraments (ph), blacks, white, poor, rich, by convincing all Americans that we are better off when we're free, that we will be more prosperous and more secure when we can make our own choices from many alternatives in all areas of our lives based on the things that we value as individuals and as families.</p><p>We will win the hearts and the votes of the American people when we convince them that freedom will work for them, their families and for every American.</p><p>When we stand together for Americans to make their own choices about where their children go to school and their way to choose their own doctors and to own a health plan, a health plan that they can afford and keep from job to job; when we fight for them to have a choice to own their own social security account and to keep a larger share of what they earn in their paychecks; when American see us fighting, not just talking, but fighting for their rights and freedom, then we will earn their trust and their votes.</p><p>Most Americans don't expect the government to give them the American dream. But they do expect their elected officials to make sure that they have the opportunity to work for it and to earn it. That dream begins with individuals, not the government.</p><p>The American dream will be within reach for all our citizens, when our families, schools, churches, businesses and community organizations, all of our institutions work together to equip our citizens with the character, the skills and the capabilities to succeed in a free society.</p><p>When the majority of Americans are responsible for themselves and accountable for their own decisions, then we will have an America where freedom works. When we can convince Americans that this freedom will work for them, that this freedom will give them and their children a better life, more prosperity and security, then we'll win the votes of the American people and then we will deserve the votes of the American people. Thank you.</p><p>For years, I have been burdened by a growing concern that Americans have lost the knowledge and the understanding of what freedom is and how it works. We still hear freedom mentioned in political speeches, but politicians of all stripes like pied pipers leading children to their demise have been successful in lowering Americans into more and more dependence on government.</p><p>We really shouldn't be surprised. A nation that raises its children in government schools cannot expect its people to stand for the principles of freedom.</p><p>You know, I have spilled these burdens along with my heart and soul along to the pages of our new book that I have titled \"Saving Freedom\". The subtitle is we can stop America slide into socialism. The publisher is V&amp;H International (ph). The book will be introduced on July 4th under their new Fidelis (ph) imprint.</p><p>My goal with this book is to remind Americans of how important freedom has been to the success of our country and how important it is to our future, to explain how freedom works and how we can preserve and protect it.</p><p>I am convinced that neither Congress nor the president will save freedom. In fact, unless Americans fight back, the federal government will continue to erode freedom in every area of our lives. Only the American people, informed, engaged, activated and enraged can save our country now.</p><p>I believe Americans are sick of politics, as they should be. I think they're thirsty for common sense solutions and the truth. I am convinced that if we show them the right target, if we tell them how they can help save freedom, they will shoot.</p><p>Unfortunately, over 10 years, neither Republicans nor Democrats have offered very good choices. It's time for that to change.</p><p>Earlier this week, we heard the world's best salesman of socialism address the nation. I was right there right on the second row, and it sounded so good. But like so much political doublespeak, President Obama's speech was designed to mislead the American people.</p><p>He is not confident in our people or in our free markets or our free institutions. He believes in government, and most of his solutions are more government spending and new government programs. He spoke of lofty goals and how government was going to fix everything that is wrong with America.</p><p>I agree with many of his goals. We need to fix our financial system, fix our schools and reform healthcare. We need to make America more energy independent and cut wasteful programs and improve our nation's infrastructure. We all agree on those things, but we can't accomplish these goals with more government programs and spending. Think about it. We just need America to think about it. The president lambasted the greed and waste of banks and Wall Street, but what bank would make a loan to someone they knew couldn't pay it back unless the government was there to buy that loan.</p><p>You know, and what securities firm or asset managers on Wall Street would buy a bundle of these loans unless it came with a government guarantee. It wouldn't happen.</p><p>Hey -- and why not buy these securities with borrowed money when the Federal Reserve offers an interest rates that's lower than the guaranteed return rate on the securities they guarantee. Folks, this is just human nature of good common sense. The free markets and deregulation did not wreck our credit markets in our economy; the government and political greed.</p><p>It is government and political greed or on the bulls eye of the target of what's wrong with our economy. Stupid government policies have destroyed the accountability of the free markets.</p><p>The president presented some devastating statistics about education in America. But who has been running our schools for the last 40 years? It's really the federal government and our courts. We spend more on education as a nation than any other government program, more per child than any other nation in the world.</p><p>Obama believes that more federal control and more spending is the answer. But that is completely irrational. In America, we'll know it if we tell them the truth. I'll make my own guarantee. If we let the $10,000 plus a year that we are now spending on every student in America, if we let that money follow the student to the school of their parents' choice, public or private, secular or religious, I will guarantee that within five years America will have the best schools in the world.</p><p>I worked all my life in the free markets, and I'll tell you what would happen. The America -- America's investment in education would likely double with no additional government spending, as the private sector employed its best minds and technologies to produce a wide variety of learning environments designed to win market share by meeting the needs of a wide variety of students.</p><p>Teachers would have many different choices of jobs, and teaching would become a sought-after, well-paid profession. Freedom will work in education if we will just let it.</p><p>The president also said that education begins at home. But who has messed up the family structure in America? The government welfare policies increased unwed mothers (ph) from 8 percent to 35 percent and climbing. Government policies have severely damaged the family structure in America. And now, the government wonders why children can't read when they get to school.</p><p>The president said we need to reform healthcare because it's too expensive and too many people are uninsured. But is more government the answer? I don't think so. Once again, government has caused the problem. We can't allow our government to control over half of the insurance market and still expect the private markets to work.</p><p>We can't help employers by health insurance, but then make it impossible, almost impossible, for individuals to find affordable policies for themselves. And then we act surprised that millions of Americans don't have insurance.</p><p>We can't limit competition between health insurance companies by restricting Americans to only those policies they can get in their state, and still expect health insurance to be competitively priced.</p><p>I mean this is not rocket science. Why not let freedom work in healthcare. Every American could have a health insurance plan that they could afford, own and keep, without the government spending, one additional value (ph).</p><p>This could go on and on. President Obama complained that America is dependent on foreign countries for 70 percent of our oil, but who has been restricting the drilling of oil?</p><p>Who has been restricting the development of clean burning, domestically produced, natural gas? Who has stopped the development of no emission, nuclear energy? Its been our government. Government is the problem.</p><p>You know Democrats complained about American manufacturing jobs going overseas, but who loads the highest corporate tax rates onto the backs of American businesses? And who holds businesses hostage with the threat of more lawsuits than any other country in the world? And who strangles American business with regulations? Folks, we're not letting freedom work, but we are blaming freedom for the problems.</p><p>President and the Democratic Congress are blaming America's problems on free markets and free people, but the truth is beginning to hit the American people, right in the face.</p><p>The government is not the answer to our problems, the government is the problem. Freedom is a powerful, but delicate and endangered thing.</p><p>When Ronald Reagan said freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp, when he said that the entire federal budget was one-tenth the size of the stimulus package that we passed two weeks ago.</p><p>We need to think about where we're going. Government is out of control, and freedom is the only solution. In American freedom is built on the principles and values that are derived from Judeo- Christian religious convictions.</p><p>If we allow this government to continue to purge religion and faith, religious values and the principles that are derived from our culture, we will loose our freedom.</p><p>Freedom sits on the foundations of the values and principles that are derived from faith. But it's built with the support beams of constitutionally limited government in the rule of law. If we allow Congress and the president to continue to ignore the constitution, and compromise the rule of law, we will loose our freedom.</p><p>Freedom solutions will work in education, healthcare, energy, housing and all areas of our economy and culture. Government has never or will it ever, solve our problems. </p><p>The good news is that Americans have gotten a glimpse of the big government plans of Obama and the Democrats and millions are ready to stand up, speak out, and yes, even take to the streets to stop America's slide into socialism.</p><p>Now, we're looking for leaders, and everyone seems to be asking, who will be the new leaders of the Republican Party in the conservative movement.</p><p>First, I hope these two groups will be one and the same in the future.</p><p>Let's not rush to pick leaders based on, who is the best speaker, the best personality, the best politician, or the best looking. That would eliminate me right away.</p><p>But just give me a teleprompter. I don't know these were here this morning. If you could just see me with a teleprompter you would (inaudible).</p><p>We need to look for those men and women, who are willing to stand and fight for the principles of freedom. We will know that we have found our new leaders, when we see people with character and conviction, stand with courage for the principles of freedom.</p><p>When we see American's, black and white, men and women, immigrants, poor, old, young, Republicans, independents, even some democrats, when we see these American's inspired and responding to those among us, who are standing for freedom, we will know that we have found our leaders.</p><p>Thank you, for standing for freedom, with courage and conviction for the cause of freedom.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): Thank you, senator. Isn't it clear that those on the left, you say Republicans are just obstructionist, the conservatives are offering no alternatives, clearly, they are just not listening. And maybe they need to listen lot more carefully.</p><p>Grover Norquist is our next introducer. He is the president of Americans for Tax Reform, a grass roots tax payer group, founded at the request of President Reagan in 1986. I just refer to him as The President and still do.</p><p>ATR asked our candidates to sign the tax payer protection pledge, committing themselves in writing, not just in words, to oppose all tax increases. He serves on boards of National Rifle Association. The American Conservative Union and serves as president of the American Society of Competitiveness.</p><p>He also rocked the house, the story of 1994 Republican sweep of Congress and most recently has written Leave Us Alone: Getting the Government's Hands Off Our Money, Our Guns, Our Lives.</p><p>He also chairs the Wednesday meeting in Washington DC, were over 120, to 150 activists gather each week to promote conservative ideas and a pro-freedom coalition.</p><p>Please welcome Grover Norquist.</p><p>NORQUIST: Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to introduce John Boehner. Who is the gentleman, who when he came to Congress from Ohio, told his constituents, if you want somebody to go to Washington and steel money and bring it back to the district, what they call earmarks, you want to vote for somebody else.</p><p>And in his time in Washington, he has kept that commitment, and then a leader to keep spending down, not one of the shoplifters that thought their job was to bring goodies back to their friends.</p><p>He is one of the gang of seven. The original effort by Republicans to reform the way Congress worked, and moved and he became a leader in the effort for the contract with America, which helped us Republican control of the House and Senate.</p><p>But now he is the Republican leader in the house. And he just did a very amazing thing. It's the first step on our road back to a Republican and conservative House of Representatives, and that was to hold every single Republican to say no to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid spending...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>NORQUIST: That was step one on the road to a majority. Imagine the billions and tens of billions of dollars and your tax dollars that were dangled in front of people asking to please be bipartisan, set your principles aside, and give us the votes and every hour under Congressman Boehner's leadership said no.</p><p>Please write down and remember a couple of numbers. We need, in 2010 to win 40 House seats, presently held by Democrats. Some masquerading as conservatives, but everyone of them -- Nancy Pelosi, liberal in their voting and that are fact.</p><p>We need to pick up 40 seats after the March 31, election in New York. 20, we will need to 39 seats. So as Alfred Hitchcock would say, there are 39 steps to a Republican majority.</p><p>One other number, there are 46 Democrat members in Congress today, sitting in seats that voted in '84 and '88 for Bush and McCain at the presidential levels. Those were not exactly our strongest presidential years, but 46 Ds sitting seats that actually want to elect Republicans. It is my honor to introduce to you leader Boehner, the next speaker of the House of Representatives.</p><p>BOEHNER: Good morning to all of you. On the way here this morning, I remember that my first visit to CPAC occurred 24 years ago in 1985, when I was brand new state representative.</p><p>Some of my friends from my state rep district suggested I come to this gathering. And I came here in 1985, 1986, and really, I came here to learn more about our movement.</p><p>And is see some of my friends here KD (ph) and Dave Kern, couple of constituents, who have taken upon themselves back in the late 80s and early 90s to make sure that I never wavered from the truth. Dave, KD (ph), thank you very much for your help.</p><p>Not many of you know a whole lot about me, but I come from Cincinnati. I grew up there. I have 11 brothers and sisters, and my dad owned a bar, all right.</p><p>Now, there is a lot that I can say about that, the skills I learned growing up or the skills I need to my job today. Growing up in a big family, you have to learn get along with each other, get things done together, gets thing done as a family.</p><p>I grew up work at a bar, mopping the floors, waiting tables, attending bar and there you learned to deal with every character that walks in the door. Trust me. I need all of these skills to do my job today.</p><p>But I was lucky enough to have parents who cared. And parents who insisted that we get a decent education. I was lucky enough to begin my own business, and to grow my business. And along the way, I got involved in my neighborhood homeowners associations and ended up in the United States Congress.</p><p>This too could happen to you. But I got involved in this for one big reason that the opportunities that were available to me and the opportunities that were available to all of you, I thought were slowly disappearing and I thought someone from the real world would (ph) take more active role in their government.</p><p>Now that's what got me involved and that that's what keeps me involved.</p><p>I didn't come into Congress because I wanted to be a congressman. I came here to do something to preserve the opportunities that were available to us so that were available to our kids and theirs.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BOEHNER: But that's freedom that we enjoyed, economic freedom is really under assault today. And I think the stimulus was the opening of salvo. It was supposed to be focused on jobs, jobs, jobs and it turned into nothing more than spending, spending, and more spending.</p><p>But when you put this in the hands of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reed, it obviously became a gravy train for leftwing pork, and I knew something was wrong when I read the first version of the bill, and it had the word contraceptives in it, $230 million.</p><p>And I brought up to everyone's attention and guess what they have finally decided to take it out, but...</p><p>Sitting in my desk right when this outline came out before -- long before they have resolved the bill, and I was looking at this outline eating my lunch, getting ready up to the press gallery and talk a little bit about it, and all I could think of was, \"oh my god.\"</p><p>When you look at all of the spending that was in there, for every leftwing idea there whatever it was, you began to realize that we were on the wrong path.</p><p>And while they got the contraceptive language out there, it's still has money in there for (inaudible) just watch, because as this bill starts to get implemented, I will assure you that you will know how every dime of this bill is going to be spent.</p><p>And now this bill set the stage for government controlled healthcare, began to dismantle the welfare reforms for 1997 by relaxing the work requirements.</p><p>And most of the tax relief was really welfare, tax relief to people who don't pay income taxes.</p><p>And how do you make the economy better by encouraging people to work less and making them more dependant on our government?</p><p>There was one Congressman though -- one Congressman who vote to president and they asked him, well, why did you vote president.</p><p>And he said, \"Well, because that's how President Obama used to vote when he had the vote on lousy bills.\"</p><p>Well, let me tell you that, there wasn't one Republican who voted to president, there wasn't one Republican who voted yes, we all voted no.</p><p>The liberals and the mainstream media, they just didn't know how to deal with it.</p><p>First they said, we (inaudible) no, and then when I pointed out, well no, they have an alternative, an alternative that would have cost half as much as the Democrats and would have created twice as many jobs in America.</p><p>Then they said, well, they are committing political suicide. But Nelson and I (ph) pointed out that some 53 percent of Americans think the stimulus will either won't help or will hurt our economy.</p><p>But that wasn't the end of what's happened here in the first five weeks of the Obama administration.</p><p>This spending barrage was just beginning. This week, the House passed an omnibus appropriations bill, the largest spending bill that we passed since the stimulus, $410 billion, $30 billion over budget, the largest increase in the domestic discretionary spending since (inaudible) years, and a bill that had 9,000 earmarks in it.</p><p>And as Webber pointed out, \"I've never asked for an earmark, I'll never ask for one. My job wasn't to come to Washington and steal from public treasury for my districts. It was to stand up for my district and to fight for freedom for the American people.\"</p><p>And while they had money in this bill for blueberry research on nature center, a whole bunch of other beautification projects, they couldn't find money to continue the D.C. scholarship program to help poor kids get out of some of the most rotten schools in America and give them a chance at a decent education.</p><p>One of the issues that I hope put into law of some seven or eight years ago, but they've made it clear they're going to kill this program, that's how bad this is.</p><p>One day after President Obama gave the speech about hope, Nancy Pelosi passed a bill that takes away hope for thousands of American kids here in D.C. They have a chance at this decent education.</p><p>But that wasn't enough. The stimulus, the omnibus, and then yesterday what happens, the budget comes out.</p><p>This budget is nothing more than a job killer, plain and simple.</p><p>It erases taxes on all Americans in the midst of a recession.</p><p>It relies on tax increases on small business, family firms, middle class families, retirees, charities, every American with a 401 (k) and yes, any American who dares to flip on a light switch and all. They are all going to pay higher taxes under this budget.</p><p>The government tried to raise taxes in a recession once before.</p><p>It was the Hoover administration, we all know what happened.</p><p>But this budget also includes the so-called cap-and-trade system for global climate change, which is a French term for pink slip or as what I'd like to call it another code word for a carbon tax in America.</p><p>American jobs are going to be under threat and if we do this with our industrialized countries working together with us we will ship millions of American jobs overseas. And I can say that I my demo -- Republican colleagues and all democrat members of the Congress are never going to stand to see taxes raised on Americans to the tune of $1.3 trillion and they ship millions of American jobs overseas, it's just not going to happen.</p><p>Well, the stimulus, the omnibus, the budget, it's all one big down payment on a new American socialist experiment.</p><p>They're laying the groundwork for everything in these bills, expanded welfare, government run healthcare, green jobs, the works.</p><p>They even want to pay irresponsible neighbors mortgage off for them.</p><p>All this is being done though on the backs of our kids and our grand kids, and all of these bills seek to replace our economic freedom of what their wins and mandates of politicians and bureaucrats.</p><p>Listen, I took to meet from liberals for my speech on the House floor opposing the stimulus.</p><p>They didn't like it when I pointed out, but no member of the Congress had read the nearly 11,000 -- 1,100 pages in this bill.</p><p>And they didn't really didn't like it when I toss this bill on the floor of the House. They called it disrespectable.</p><p>Well, I tell you it was disrespectable, it's taken a trillion dollars from our kids and grandkids and giving it out to people like A. Corman (ph) and other liberal groups at America.</p><p>Disrespectful is spending a trillion dollars of money that our kinds and grandkids going to have to pay for in the dark of night behind closed doors without even giving the Americans more -- less than a day to actually read the bill. Don't talk to me about disrespectful.</p><p>And all the way the new democratic Congress handled the stimulus and handled the omnibus tends to reminds me of what happened in the early 90s.</p><p>This was common practice. We changed that. Newt Gingrich, Vin Weber, Bob Walker, Dick Armey, we stood up against the democrat majority and we changed it. We won.</p><p>We've got a new generation of leaders now in the same fight. People like Eric Cantor, Mike Finn, Mitch McConnell (ph), Paul Ryan.</p><p>We all know these names; you ought to get to know them. Because they and other GOP performers are working with me to rebuild our party, rebuild our party on sound principles.</p><p>The principles that we believe of a smaller less costly and more accountable government. Ronald Regan, when he as governor of California near the end of his term, wrote a letter to his friend who was a banker in Houston, Texas.</p><p>And I'm going to just read one paragraph of this letter to you, where he says, \"I agree with you about the two parties. If the Republican Party is to look at all, it must know the side what it believes and stand on that and raise a banner to which all who believe can rally. Failing this, I see no future for the party, if it listens to those who say we must become even more like our opponents in order to win elections.\"</p><p>I believe the people are telling that this won't work. Let me tell you what I couldn't agree with Ronald Regan more.</p><p>I didn't come here. I didn't come here to be a little less like my colleagues across the aisle.</p><p>I came here to promote economic freedom. I came here to make sure that the opportunities that were available to all of us will in fact be available to our kids and grandkids.</p><p>And so to win in 2010, we've got to be the party of new solutions. There are issues that Americans care about, but we have to build solutions on the principles in which we believe in.</p><p>We need to explore new ways of connecting with the grassroots and our potential supporters, and we must be prepared to compete everywhere in America.</p><p>And how would we do all of this? As I said, we are not just going to be the party of no. We're just not going to be the party of opposition.</p><p>We really are going to be the party of better solutions. We are for better solutions rooted in the enduring conservative principles of freedom and security that have been associated with our parties since Lincoln.</p><p>New solutions doesn't mean new big government programs. It means unleashing the power of freedom around our country in the lives of every single Americans.</p><p>And there is another issue where a better solution was already known, and that's the issue that we've known about for thousands of years and it's the issue of life.</p><p>Republicans have been known as the pro-life party, and I'm going to tell you the truth is the American people been on our side throughout this life and you will see Republicans as we get in to these appropriation bills, and if we see the freedom of choice act, I stand up and defend the sanctity of life.</p><p>My mother had us 12 of us one at a time, and I'm sure wasn't convenient for her to have us -- to have 12 of us, but I'm sure glad that she did. And if we were to grow our movement, we have to learn how to use the new media, how to connect with more people around our -- the country. And whether it's all of the events that the RNC is putting put together -- they have got a big tech summit coming. All of the new tools available to -- for us to reach people in ways that we have never been able to reach them before.</p><p>Today, in booth 610, you stop by the Freedom Project. My Political Action Committee that helps candidates all around the country who believe in what we need to believe in.</p><p>As I said, we also need to compete everywhere. And when I say compete everywhere, New York 20 is probably the best example. This is where Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed to the Senate. It's an open race. Jim Tedisco is the minority leader in the New York assembly. He is our candidate.</p><p>This election is on March 31st, and it is a giant opportunity for us to let America know that America is on our side. And so, if you're looking for ways to get plugged in, go get plugged in.</p><p>So if you really want to know what we think and you want to help us understand what you think, stop by the Freedom Project booth today.</p><p>freedomproject.org, you can go to our Web site. We can tell you about the races that are coming up. And you can find out over there what's going on in the House of Representatives and how Republicans are standing up and defending the values that we all believe in.</p><p>You know, I am really proud to be here. I am doing something I never thought in my wildest dreams I'd ever have a chance to do. But I had an opportunity growing up to play football in high school for a guy named Gerry Faust. He went on to coach at Notre Dame, but I played at Moeller High School. They won a lot of state football championships after I left, all right.</p><p>But I and my eight brothers went to Moeller, and I played for Coach Faust. So we won a lot of games. We won a lot of games not because we were bigger, not because we were stronger, not because we had more ability. We won because we believed we were going to win. We won because we believed in ourselves.</p><p>And one of the things that I have been trying to drive into our colleagues and demonstrated by the stimulus bill is that when we stand on principle and we do what's right for America, the right things will happen. And our members are getting their footing. They do believe in themselves.</p><p>When I got into high school, I began to think more about what I learned from Coach Faust. And it was really this. There is nothing in this world that you can't accomplish, nothing that you can't succeed at, if you are willing to work hard enough and if you are willing to make the sacrifices that are necessary.</p><p>And I look back over my life and my career, that formula has worked pretty well. And I think if you look back over your own life and your own career, you realize that that formula has worked for you as well.</p><p>I am a big believer in America that our best days are ahead, that our responsibility whether that's those of us elected or those of us that are here, our responsibility is to make sure that the opportunities that were available to us or available to our kids and our grandkids, and a lot of Americans don't believe that that is the case today. Why do?</p><p>But we've got to make the decisions about the future for them. We've got to make tough decisions today that will ensure that they have a brighter future. And I also want to say to all of you, \"This is a fight that we need to fight. This is a fight that we need to win. Please come and join the fight.\" Thank you very much.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): Man, if that didn't get you fired up, you're not waking. You need some more coffee. And I ought to get it done.</p><p>Matt Schlapp will introduce Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He has previously served as deputy assistant to the president and director of political affairs in the White House. Prior to his appointment, Schlapp worked in the Bush-Cheney 2000 campaign where he served as regional political director; and in 1994, helped to led Kansas representative, Todd Tiahrt, from Kansas to the U.S. House of Representatives; one of the continuing rising bright stars in Kansas and in the Congress.</p><p>And he served as his Chief of Staff. Schlapp is a member of the American Conservative Union board of directors. Give him a big round of applause.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Good morning, everyone. I hope you've recovered from last night festivities, I feel pretty excited about where everything is. And I am really honored to be standing with you here today to have the privilege to introduce our leader, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell.</p><p>We know what's at stake and we know now is the time when we really need experienced leadership. We need to have a clear understanding of what we believe in, and we need to know how to make it happen. Let's face it. We need our Republican leaders to be tenacious and to be clever and to know what we have to get done.</p><p>When I think of Mitch McConnell taking the lead in the Senate, I feel a lot better, especially when I pose a few questions, a few questions about what's at stake. And you've heard about these things from your speakers throughout the conference.</p><p>But are you ready to stop the largest tax increase in the history of the globe? Are you ready to stand up and say that when they talk about capping carbon, whenever that is, and talk about cap-and-trade, which is a large tax increase, that we're going to stand up and say, \"This is not the right time. This is never the right time.\"</p><p>Are you ready to stop the government from stepping in and mandating the wages of factories and mills and businesses all over the country, the government making those decisions in the form of what they call card check? We need to stand up and say, \"This is never going to be the right time for that in America.\"</p><p>And if you are ready to put away America's credit card, if you're ready to put the checkbook up and away for a while, you need some adult supervision. If you are ready to say no to the bailouts and the giveaways and rewarding and insuring failure, then I think you'll join with me in welcoming our next speaker who is not only the leader of our Republicans in the Senate, but he is our leader.</p><p>And without further ado, I want to give you a wonderful public servant, someone who is the longest-serving Senator in Kentucky history, someone who knows what we have to do. He is the right man for the right time, Mitch McConnell.</p><p>MCCONNELL: Thank you very much, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here.</p><p>I've been to a number of these CPAC conferences over the years, and this room is packed, and I can't tell you how excited I am to see all of you this morning.</p><p>We've had a great line up of speakers. I just saw my friend, John Boehner, on the way out. He is a great teammate here in Congress; John Cornyn, doing a wonderful job to the people of Texas. He is head of our National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is our campaign arm; Jim DeMint, one of the strongest advocates of conservative principles we have. And I know that you're all as impressed as I am with the leadership of Dr. Tom Coburn.</p><p>And I want to thank David Keene for inviting me. David has been one of the great thinkers and foot soldiers in the battle of ideas over the years. He has been organizing this conference longer than most of you been alive. And they get better every year.</p><p>In fact, some people call CPAC the conservative spring break. And David is, of course, the driving force. He can be proud of that. And I know he is proud to be the father of a brave young soldier serving our nation on a second tour of duty in Iraq.</p><p>You know, the organizers of CPAC probably thought they had done a pretty good job when about 200 people showed up to hear a speech by a Republican governor from California named Ronald Reagan. </p><p>At that time, if you could have guessed that the man they have come to hear would do so very much to revive our nation's fortunes and to help secure the freedom of so many millions overseas and if you could have known how important CPAC would prove to be during that period and still is today.</p><p>CPAC has been the host of presidents, lawmakers and some of the nation's top opinion leaders. And most importantly, it's been a training ground for young minds.</p><p>Of the record 8,500 registrants this year, 8500 registrants this year, more than half are college students, including I'm told a good number from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Compare that to the left's annual attempt to imitate CPAC, the so called kick Take Back America conference, which last year drew about a third as many people at CPAC. What this proves, of course, is that conservatives are more fun and interesting than liberals.</p><p>I mean let's be honest. Who wants to hang out with guys like Paul Krugman and Robert Wright when you can be with Roger Hollander (ph).</p><p>There are some in the media I'd like to thank that the conservative movement is on the way out, that it's devoid of energy and enthusiasm. Well, they should come to CPAC. I know it might be a disappointment to many of them, but they'd see what I see. The conservative movement is alive and well.</p><p>But even if we put on a better confidence than our friends on the other side, they've got quite a bit more influence regretfully at the moment. And they have big plans for the country.</p><p>And since all of you are on the frontlines, the volunteers, the organizers, the future opinion leaders who are carrying and will carry our message to a new generation.</p><p>This morning, I thought I would discuss some of things that I think we all need to do if you are going to stage a comeback and we must stage a comeback.</p><p>Now, the first step in my view is to remind ourselves where we are. The political landscape is a lot different today than it was Kentuckians first send me to Washington.</p><p>Imagine this, back then, the Republican governor of New Jersey had just been reelected with 70 percent of the vote. Republicans had just taken over both legislative chambers in Connecticut. And Republican candidate for president had just 49 of 50 states.</p><p>For republicans, 1984, the political compass didn't point in one direction. Our principles, as we know, are universal, but back then it really showed, not so today.</p><p>As we look over the political landscape in 2009, we see that every single one of New England's 21 House members is a Democrat, that there isn't a single Republican senator representing tens of millions of American on the West Coast.</p><p>And that you can walk from Canada to Mexico, and from Montano to Maine, without ever leaving a state in this country that has a Democratic governor.</p><p>We are fast becoming a regional party, instead of national one, and there is name for regional party, it's called the minority party. Being in a minority party might be OK, if you are a college debating society. On today's campuses it might even be fun in a counter- cultural sort of way, but I assure you it's not good for America when we are in the minority and none of us should be content to stay there. I should note that looking at the list of events this weekend, it appears that no one at CPAC seems to least bit content about our current political standing or at least with relying on old methods for building the party and communicating our message to the broader public.</p><p>One of the reasons, so many of you are here is that somebody else told you, through base book or tweeter, that they were going.</p><p>And before you leave many will have heard about the best and latest strategies for raising funds, recruiting candidates or building coalitions for conservative causes among minority groups. All of these things must be at the heart of our renewal.</p><p>But the instrument is only as good as the strategy. And the strategy has to improve. First and foremost, we need to search out those who have left our party, wherever they are, and give them a good reason to take a second look.</p><p>These people were Republican for a reason. We need to remind them why. As we do this we shouldn't fall for the false temptation of diluting our principles. You don't expand your appeal by turning away from those who are the most loyal.</p><p>Instead you work harder to appeal to everybody else. But this much is clear, our message isn't getting out to as many people as it should and that needs to change.</p><p>Second, we need to be concerned that the very wealthy and the very poor, the most and least educated, and a majority of minority voters have stopped paying attention to us.</p><p>We've made the case to Hispanic and African American voters that our policies are best suited to the aspirations of these communities, yet in the last election, Hispanic voters turned out in far greater numbers for the Democratic candidates. And sadly, the party that was founded on the principle of racial equality attracted just 4 percent of the African-American vote in the last presidential election.</p><p>These are not reasons to abandon the effort. They're reasons to work twice as hard. And in this regard it's encouraging to say that CPAC is hosting a panel this year on the building of Hispanic coalitions. This is a necessary work and it shouldn't be an uphill battle.</p><p>Ronald Reagan once said, Hispanic voters are Republicans, they just don't know it yet. It's up to all of you to show Hispanics, in the search for the American dream, that the Republican Party is their home.</p><p>As we seek to reach...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCONNELL: As we seek to reach old friends and find new ones, we need to expand our principles. As conservative, we believe a big and encroaching government is a threat to liberty.</p><p>That greater liberty and freedom lead to greater prosperity, stronger families and communities; that workers should be allowed to keep more of what they earn; the judges should follow what the constitution says, not what they wanted to; and that human life is sacred.</p><p>I was disappointed that one of the first things the new administration did was to reverse the Mexico City Policy. Americans do not want their tax dollars to be used promoting abortion either here or abroad.</p><p>Conservatives also believe that the government has no more solemn duty than to protect the people who established it. And on this last point, let's be very clear about something else.</p><p>When it comes to Guantanamo, the new administration needs to show us more concerned with safety than with symbolism. Many of those still detained are serious threats to the safety of our citizens, serious threats. In fact, several of these terrorists still proudly proclaim their desire to kill more Americans.</p><p>Now the new attorney general visited Guantanamo earlier this week and returned with a glowing report. He said; it was well run, that he is impressed with the people in charge and that every single person there has to be moved out of Guantanamo and it has to be shut down in less than a year.</p><p>The Obama administration needs to answer a very simple question, where exactly do you expect to send these guys? </p><p>Well, they don't have an answer to that question. they don't have an answer to that question, but I do...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Those are all very good suggestions. Well, let me tell you where they are to be. They are to be right there in the jail in Guantanamo.</p><p>You guys get it. You don't take much prompting at all. I mean, obviously, that's where they belong.</p><p>Over the past few months, we've seen a big government mentality creep back into (inaudible) Capitol Hill. It seems that failed big government solutions of the Carter era are back -- making a come back.</p><p>And I assure you Republicans are going to do everything we can to make sure that the failed policies of the past stay where they belong.</p><p>And let me tell you where they belong. They belong right next to the bell bottoms and the leisure suits. And no one doubts that government should have a role. Indeed some challenges are so great or so urgent that they do require government to act.</p><p>Government can also play an important role in helping Americans meet 20 percent through challenges, through things like education reform, making healthcare more efficient and more affordable for everyone, and increasing energy exploration.</p><p>But in the face of new challenges, Democrats seem to be reverting to the old play book of blotted government, out of control spending, and higher and higher taxes to pay for all of it.</p><p>During the last administration they never passed up an opportunity to wring their hands about the spending that both parties approved to recover from a horrific terrorist attack, to fight two wars, and to rebuild after the single worse disaster in U.S. history.</p><p>But now the shoe is on the other foot. And what have we seen? Well in just one month -- just one month, the Democrats have spent more than President Bush spent in seven years on the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina combined -- in one month.</p><p>If the overall spending has been jaw dropping, then the individual proposals have been even more troubling. Everyone is familiar with the $1 trillion stimulus bill. A bill that was supposed to be timely, temporary and targeted turned out to be none of the above.</p><p>Much of the spending won't go into affect for literally years, much of it is directed in wasteful projects, like government golf carts.</p><p>And much of the new government spending will be virtually impossible to cut off once the economy recovers. Next week, we'll be voting on another spending bill, the Annual Appropriation Bill that covers spending through October.</p><p>We had a couple of days to look at what the Democrats are proposing and it looks a lot like the stimulus bill. And that may be the stimulus bill wasn't just enough, because as it turns out the Appropriation Bill double dips by including money for 122 programs that were in the stimulus bill.</p><p>We hear a lot from Democrats these days about the needs for Americans to sacrifice for the good of the whole. Yet, at a time when Americans are tightening their belts, Democrats in Washington were letting there's out a notch or two.</p><p>And they're not pushing back from the table yet. When it comes to fiscal responsibility, Democrats are clearly telling Americans to do as they say, not as they do.</p><p>What does all this mean? Well, one way to look at it is that for more than two centuries, Americans have embraced a simple principle that's at the heart of who we are as Americans.</p><p>The principle said that we work hard so our kids can have a better life and more opportunities than we had.</p><p>Well, it seems that this Congress wants to reverse the order. It seems they want our children to work hard to pay the debt that we ran up, because we don't have the will to make the hard choices now.</p><p>The government first approach isn't unlimited to spending tax dollars. It also extends to the Democrats approach to free speech.</p><p>On this issue, the constitution could not be clear. The founders felt so strongly about government limitations on speech that they prohibited it in the very first amendment.</p><p>Yet today, some on the other side want to shut you up by enforcing limits on what's said on the airways. They called it the fairness doctrine.</p><p>What they should call it is the, we can't compete with conservative talk radioactive 2009. </p><p>And let me tell you this, let me tell you this. It will be an honor for Republicans to make sure that this unconstitutional proposal never becomes law. </p><p>Now that the government first approach is evident in Washington, it's effort to stifle the freedom of workers in this country to decide without coercion or intimidation whether they want to belong to a union.</p><p>Workers should be free to vote the way they want without a union boss or a company manager looking over their shoulder.</p><p>And Republicans will make sure that this union power grab never becomes law.</p><p>Look, pushing back these efforts to basically European as a mirror will not be easy.</p><p>It will require a committed effort on the part of everyone in this room. It will require carrying our message to those who have left our party and to many more who are receptive to our message.</p><p>Meanwhile, Republicans and Congress will be vigilant about promoting their ideals, the ideals that made our nation great, and we will be relentless in proposing new solutions for the 21st century challenges we face.</p><p>Some people look at Republican losses and places like the north east and the west coast and say it's over in these places that we need to focus on our strongholds.</p><p>If that's not the kind of -- but that's not the kind of party I've signed up for and I bet you didn't either.</p><p>Looks, if conservative principles were right then they were right for everyone and for all times and in every state in America.</p><p>I know we can compete in those places without diluting our message, because I've seen it done.</p><p>I described earlier what most of the country look like in 1984. I didn't see what Kentucky look like in 1984. Well, it didn't look like it does today and there's an important lesson here.</p><p>The year I was elected to the Senate, both senators in my state were Democrat the year I ran.</p><p>Of the seven congressional districts in our state, Republicans held only two.</p><p>Six years later, I was reelected and set in plan a motion -- a plan in place. I knew that Kentuckians like most Americans were common sense conservatives.</p><p>Many of them had been registered Democrats still are, but on almost all the issues, they actually agreed with us.</p><p>My strategy was simple; first, find good candidates. If they could win on their own, let them. If they couldn't, surround them with people who could push them over the line. It was hard work, but it paid off.</p><p>Just nine years after that, both U.S. Senators in Kentucky were Republicans. Five of our six congressional seats were Republican and in the final count of state Senate flipped to a Republican control when a long time Democrat agreed to switch parties in my living room.</p><p>So, don't tell me we can't do this working together, we can. Over the years Kentuckians got comfortable -- not a bad slogan, it works better for us.</p><p>What happened to my state is over the years Kentuckians got comfortable with Republicans, and they are comfortable sending other Republicans to the state capital, to the nation's capital.</p><p>Believe me, it's amazing how much people will start to trust somebody with an R after their name, once he's been around for a little while, shown them what a good conservative government can be like and the difference it can make in their lives.</p><p>It happened in their commonwealth of Kentucky, and it happened last fall in New Orleans; it sent a Republican to Congress for the first time since 1891, a Republican who also happens to be the first Vietnamese American member of Congress in our history.</p><p>And with your hard work and creativity, it will happen in every other state and city in American in the months and years ahead.</p><p>So, my message to you is this. Be proud of your principles. Be daring in recruiting new candidates and never ever tire of fighting for the ideas that will ensure the safety and prosperity of this great country.</p><p>You are the soldiers. You will do all these things. You will get others to do them too, and before you know it, we'll have made our comeback.</p><p>Thank you very much. God bless you all. Good luck.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(UNKNOWN): Are we all socialists now? Let's talk a little bit about that.</p><p>Newsweek has declared it so, but who cares what they have to say. With this Congressmen Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Congressman Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and to moderate this panel, Matt Kibbe of FreedomWorks.</p><p>If you all will join us; Matt Kibbe, who he will be moderating this panel is the President, CEO of FreedomWorks, this position he has held for the last four years. Previously, he was FreedomWorks executive vice president.</p><p>He manages Freedom Works overall operations and strategy including public policy development, grassroots operations and state and federal issue campaigns of the organization.</p><p>Prior to joining FreedomWorks, Matt served as chief of staff in House budget committee associate for U.S. Representative Dan Miller of Florida from 1993 to 1996.</p><p>He also has served as director of Federal Budget Policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>He has has written extensively on economics, public policy and politics. His writings have appeared in outlets such as USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, Reason market process, and the journal of regulation and social cause.</p><p>Please give a big resounding welcome to our panel to talk about socialism.</p><p>KIBBE: Fun fact of the day. In 2008, General Motors lost $84 million a day, that's the bad news.</p><p>The good news is Congressman Barney Frank thinks he knows how to run a car company and no matter how many billions of dollars we pout into this failing businesses, he has got a better ideas. So, it's all good.</p><p>This didn't have to be this way. You'll recall that the troubled asset relief funds was used late last year to bailout GM and Chrysler for a purpose that no one intended it to be for.</p><p>We had an opportunity last year to kill that bill and to stop this lush fund that the Obama administration is now using, and I'm happy to say that our two elected officials that were sitting in the House of Representatives last fall during this note voted no not once, but twice against that bailout.</p><p>I'm going to go straight into the panelists. Our first panelist is Representative Todd Tiahrt, who began serving the 4th District of Kansas in Congress in 1995.</p><p>He was appointed to the House for operations committee in 1997, and currently serves as Senior Republican on the appropriation sub committee on labor health, human services and education. Congressman Tiahrt.</p><p>TIAHRT: Thank you. Good morning. It's great to see you all here and I'm really pleased that you are so involved that you want to come here and find out what you can do to change America.</p><p>Last fall, we heard a lot about promises and we heard a lot about hope, because promises do build hope, but keeping promises build trust.</p><p>But do you trust this administration to do the right thing for your future? You don't? I don't either.</p><p>This week we passed $410 billion spending package that was about a 9 percent increase over the last year.</p><p>Last week, we passed $1.2 trillion in this stimulus bill. Will you saw the president's budget was on your chair $7.37 trillion, how much is this, how much is a trillion dollars? Has anybody written a check for a trillion dollars?</p><p>If you had started the business the day after Christ rose from the dead and made a million dollars that day and everyday until today, in other words a million dollars for 2,000 years, you would not yet have made a trillion dollars. You'd only be about three-fourths the way there. Think about that, million dollars a day for 2,000 years is a not a trillion dollars.</p><p>7.37 trillion, it's a lot of money. And it's money that we don't have. The government doesn't have it. It's your money, and you don't have it either. So, where is it going to come from?</p><p>Well, I am tired of the bailouts. In fact, I filed legislation this week that says \"no more bailouts.\" Last year should be known as the year of the bailout. We bailed out Fannie Mae. We bailed out Freddie Mac. We bailed out Wall Street. We bailed out the car dealers, although they call it bridge loans.</p><p>We had TARP 1, Troubled Asset Relief Program, the first round. We have another round glooming right now. But the entities that received that $350 billion on September 2nd were worth $319 billion. Today, they are worth $86 billion, one-fourth their value after receiving $350 billion of money that we don't have. We're going to have to go and borrow and get it and pay it back.</p><p>I mean can you imagine? We're not here to a Coke machine and pulling out a dollar and sticking it in that Coke machine and pressing the button, and nothing comes out. And so, you go back to your wallet and you start fishing around and you find another dollar. And you stick it in there and you press the button and no more -- and another Coke doesn't come out. How long would you repeat that process?</p><p>Well, in the 1930s, we borrowed money for government programs, and it did not work. In the 1970s, we borrowed money for government programs to overcome our recession then, and it did not work. In the 1990s, Japan tried it. They borrowed money, started government programs to overcome their recession. They call it the lost decade. And their average per capita income went from second in the world to 10th in the world. It did not work.</p><p>And now, we're doing it again. We are sticking another dollar in the Coke machine and we expect a different result.</p><p>In July, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 11,378. Today, it's 7,182. It doesn't work.</p><p>So, what should we tell Congress? What should we tell the elected members in your district? No more bailouts. Can I hear it? No more bailouts. No more bailouts. I am tired of it. It doesn't work. Let's not stick another dollar into the machine.</p><p>You know, what we ought to be doing is strengthening our economy. If you want to help the auto dealers, why don't we give each one of us a $20,000 tax cut to go buy an American made automobile? You've got to buy a car, wouldn't you? I would.</p><p>We have to stabilize the dollar, revise regulations so that it helps workers in businesses, reform mark-to-market rules because it's crushing our trust in our financial institutions, reduce our taxes and renew our access to capital.</p><p>I am going to end up, so we get time for some questions, by telling you, I want you to be determined to get this done.</p><p>There was a farmer back in the Midwest during the 30s named JW. And he wasn't a very big man. Even though he was less than six foot tall, he probably weighed 135 pounds. And he typically wore a hat, plaid shirt, bibblerolls (ph), boots and long-handle underwear.</p><p>He brought a brand new threshing machine. And he went on to run it. First time, he ran it, it got clogged up. He went around the back and tried to pull out the chaff so that he could get the weed through the machine. You know, being from Kansas, we are concerned about that.</p><p>And it got a hold of his -- one of those cogs got a hold of his shirt's sleeve and started pulling him in that machine. And he held it back with his hand. And pretty soon, it pulled him till there was nothing but his elbow holding him from getting wrapped up in that machine. And then it was his back, and then all a sudden, he was free of that machine. And he was standing there with nothing but his boots and his bibblerolls (ph) on.</p><p>And around the cog on that chain was going his plaid shirt and his long-handle underwear. He was determined not to let that machine get in. And I am glad he did, because JW was my grandfather. And I wouldn't be here today if he hadn't done that.</p><p>That's how determined I am to stop the bailout and securing this economy around. I want you to be just as determined. Come to Kansas. Help me get elected to the Senate. And we will stop the bailouts and secure this economy, secure your future.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I am Jason Chaffetz, and I got to tell you I am fired up, because I got to tell you a little bit about how I got here, because I am so concerned that this country is turning towards socialism.</p><p>I ran my campaign and ran against the 12-year incumbent. I ran (ph) one of our own. I ran against Mr. Cannon who is a nice gentleman. But you know what he told me? He was Mr. Conservative.</p><p>And I said, \"You know, what? When you took office, the budget was 1.5 trillion. Now it's $3.1 trillion. There doesn't seem to be too much conservative about that now that we're $10 trillion in debt.\"</p><p>So I wanted to do something about it. I want to be a part of the solution, not just part of the problem. I had no campaign staff. I had no campaign office. I refused to buy somebody a free meal.</p><p>I told the voters, if you want to participate with me, I am sorry, no free meals as far as I am concerned. I refused to go into debt. I argue that how you run campaign is very indicative of how you are going to be in office. And I refused to go in debt.</p><p>Yes, I was outspent by $600,000, and I won by 20 points. The point is the thing that I said at the very beginning of the campaign is that this is a campaign about who can do more with less.</p><p>I think how you run this country is an issue about who can do more with less. As we go into 2010 and 2012, this is the argument that we need to make to the American people that the Republicans and their conservative values are the way to go forward in this country. It's about empowering people, not towards socialism.</p><p>When our president says only government can solve these problems, that scares the living daylights out of me. It's empowering entrepreneurs. It's empowering the American work force. It's about empowering the individual to be the best that they can be.</p><p>The only way, the best way to solve our problem is not just spending more money. We can no longer run this country on a credit card. And that's where we are going.</p><p>Our President Obama said he wanted maximum openness and transparency. He promised this that we would have five days to see a bill on the Internet before it was voted on. The United States Congress unanimously, unanimously passed the resolution that said we'd have 48 hours to review a bill before we voted on it. And yet, the single largest spending bill in the history of the United States, a $1 trillion-plus expenditure, had the light of day for just about 13 hours.</p><p>There is not one member of Congress that actually read that bill. And it passed. 13 hours, and nobody read it. It had so many pages, 1,400 something pages. They didn't even have time to put pages numbers on it. Our president is the one that said that he wanted -- this is going to be jobs bill. Nancy Pelosi said it was a jobs bill. And yet, less than 1 percent are tax cuts for businesses. And yet, we know 70 percent of our job</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: ... go to Facebook, go to Twitter on \"Jason in the House,\" find me. I'd like to love to communicate with you. And thank you. I appreciate it.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): By the way, Congressman Chaffetz, one of the issues you ran on was against the bailout.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): And it was unconventional, but not only good policy, but good politics.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): Next, Congressman Scott Garrett, one of the good guys, as I like to say, who is recently sworn in to his fourth term in United States House of Representatives, representing New Jersey's Fifth Congressional District.</p><p>GARRETT: Thank you. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. It is indeed a pleasure to be here with all of you, my colleagues here on the desk, good conservatives all. It's good to be in the room with fellow likeminded conservative thinkers that we are right here in this room.</p><p>I think unfortunately, we're probably a minority in the city, as being if that's the case (ph). But we are -- so we are not a minority nationally, because I honestly I do believe that this country is a right of center country and that we are the party and the people of the right ideas and the American people are behind us in that.</p><p>This panel right here, very briefly, has been talking about bailing out big business and ROE and all socialists now, and I heard you say before, no, no.</p><p>But we've certainly seen an unprecedented leap towards that over the last several years and of course with this new administration. And now with this budget that came out, it's a 10-year plan, I guess this is variation of the old Soviet five-year plan twice over.</p><p>And so, well, it's certainly going down that path. And I would just give you two reasons why I think this is happening at the heart of this move towards socialism.</p><p>First is, that there isn't a -- Washington has adopted this mantra of trying to delay pain or prevent pain, whether it's a pain on Wall Street or pain for the people who made bad decisions in their housing market or pain to other people who made other bad decision. Government thinks that somehow or other they can intervene and actually prevent thing. And obviously, you can't.</p><p>The second thing, what brings us to where we are right now, is the belief by some here in Washington that there is a small group of elites that here in the nation's capital knows better than the collective wisdom of the American public. And we know that is not true.</p><p>Consider for a moment what this administration has either considered or already done or talks about dealing. They've considered appointing a health czar and energy czar, a chief deployment czar, a climate change czar, a technology czar, a drug czar and an urban affairs czar.</p><p>So, it's not maybe that we are moving towards socialism. Maybe we are all Bolsheviks now.</p><p>Now, before assessing upon, and Todd just talked about this before, looking forward for a second, let's see where we've been. I am on financial services side. I deal a lot with those issues over there.</p><p>We spent about $29 billion to bail out Bear Sterns; $400 billion, 200 and 200 to bail out the GSE's Fannie and Freddie; $153 billion for AIG, more to come; $308 billion to bail out Citigroup, more to come; $39 billion to bail out the auto manufacturers, more to come; and of course, $800 billion to bail out just about everybody else including the bad state governments.</p><p>Now, these numbers by the way don't include something else, its not talk about very much, and that's the Federal Reserve, who was an agency that needs to be certainly reigned in.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has increased its balance sheet from around $800 billion to $2.3 trillion. And so, when you sit back for one second it's almost a mind numbing aspect when you consider these dollars -- unbelievable numbers.</p><p>And that's actually part of the game plan I think on the other sides, because they could say that -- numbers are so mind numbing that they can say while we spent $700 billion to bailout Wall Street, can we spent $600 billion to give Universal Healthcare or other such things. So that's a direction that we're going.</p><p>And it's going to get worse, as Todd indicated, we have tax increases of $1.4 trillion, entitlement up by a $1 trillion, non defense by $9.3 billion. At the end of day, I'll conclude on this.</p><p>It's really very thin, if you're a conservative politician in this town, somebody who believes in capitalism in the free markets and the fact that we have seen much lack of accountability at various levels, government, corporate and otherwise. What's happening now is that there is a game in Washington of one -- every politician trying to updo or outdo the other politician.</p><p>To be able to say that Washington is able to once do -- pick through the winners will be through all these bailouts options (inaudible).</p><p>I'm not sure, at the end of the day, who the bailouts will benefit and who the winners will be. I can just close on this and say I know who the losers are going to be and that's the tax payer and that's everyone who believes in liberty and freedom in this country.</p><p>So I just ask you to consider this, Barney Frank and who was the one of my...</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>...Barney Frank and others have led the charge on the other side of the isle to say, what brought us to this point is deregulation and a lack of government spending and a lack government involvement.</p><p>What we must be all charged with doing is to tell the true story that we are here in this fiscal situation that we are in now because of too much government involvement, too much government interference, and the answer is to unleash the potential of private capital and simply getting the government out of the way.</p><p>God bless you for...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>UNKNOWN: We are down -- we are down, there are last five minutes and I have the honor of introducing Fred Smith, who is a force of nature, one of the smartest guys I know and the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.</p><p>SMITH: Like Hubert Humphrey, I talk very fast and I can hit gust of 250 words a minute, watch out OK.</p><p>No we're not all socialist, yet capitalism is really in crisis, I think we should all recognize that, in the bumper sticker story, as the congressmen just mentioned is easy.</p><p>Greedy capitalist operating in a Republican deregulated world ran amuck taking money and candy from babies and orphans.</p><p>Markets have failed, governments must succeed and certainly there were a lot of fools and frauds operating in the housing markets. But why? Why were there so many and why housing particularly?</p><p>Well there are many factors, but the major element is, as the congressmen just alluded to, is that we have moved in a way from the honest socialism of the past, where government actually owned things and was held responsible when they failed to the mixed economy dishonest socialism of today.</p><p>The left -- old left used to say when the new problem came up, new government agency is run by ourselves and we will spend money wisely.</p><p>Well they're not so sure about that. First, social expenses are on one budget, secondly they are held accountable when they fail, and thirdly, they basically have to get appropriations each year, much better to leave in place a nominal private sector or create nominal private entities and then assign to them the responsibility of carrying out the political mandate you want to see.</p><p>In the housing area, we created Fannie and Freddie. Now that requires at least a bill in this audience. And we and others try to explain to people, what it meant to create an organization that had profit side -- of course, you can pay Franklin Raines any figure you wanted to do</p><p>They can operate like a cowboy in an open plain. But if anything went wrong you and I were on the hook. It had the moral hazard problem associated with government guarantees for whatever it did wrong.</p><p>We testified. We were criticized. We were doomers and gloomers. We were too negative. They had a high yield</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>(UNKNOWN): Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Bridgett Wagner of The Heritage Foundation.</p><p>WAGNER: Thank you all. It's great to be back at CPAC this year. The Heritage Foundation is the proud co-sponsor again now for many, many years of CPAC, we look forward to coming. Now you guys have been here a day and I am sure you have all heard the news that the era of big government is back.</p><p>The Obama administration's new 3.7 trillion, yes trillion with a \"T\" budget, includes vast new spending program on healthcare, climate change and welfare programs, financed by new taxes and cuts in our military spending.</p><p>It increases spending to the highest levels since the Second World War and explodes the deficit in to new uncharted territory, but that's all OK, because they have a plan to cut the deficit, with more taxes.</p><p>Even the Democrats in this morning's paper are saying it will be tough to find the votes for this budget. We hope so.</p><p>And as if we didn't already know this mornings' Washington Post, helpfully reminded us that President Obama's agenda seeks to \"faster redistribution of wealth.\" And it is likely to spark fierce political battles on an array of fronts from social spending, to energy spending, to healthcare and taxes.</p><p>Well, as one famous governor I am sure you all know my face, fierce political battles, you bet it.</p><p>Our next speaker is someone we can count on to be on the frontlines of those fights in Congress. Tom Coburn is a real citizen legislator.</p><p>He's taken the term limit pledge and honored it by serving three terms in the House and returning to Oklahoma and running for the Senate.</p><p>And because he's pledged to serve only two terms there, he's a man on a mission. He believes in reforming government programs and cutting waste, fraud and abuse in the central budget.</p><p>He also believes in expanding access and affordability to healthcare by putting the patients, not the government in charge. And by as a practicing OBGYN, who's delivered more than 4,000 babies, his commitment to the sanctity of life is a commitment lived not just spoken.</p><p>Dr. Coburn is one of those rare politicians who's actually run a business and created jobs himself. In the House, he has played an influential role in reforming welfare and other entitlement programs and trimming the budget, and in the Senate, he has championed transparency and accountability and that will pork in all its forms and flavors, both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>His fight over the bridge to where there is (ph) more to educate the public on the spending practices of our elected officials, he has been a library of think-tank papers, or a lifetime of conferences and panel discussions, and that's coming from a think-tank worker myself.</p><p>His port busting activity is legendary and I should say not necessarily appreciated on Capitol Hill.</p><p>His office Web site, if you go to it, has a link for the Washington Waste of the Week. But I checked it this morning and when you click through the site, it actually gives you a daily update on the Waste of the Day. That's how bad it is.</p><p>And if you are a real port-buster, you can follow Tom Coburn and tweeter, and get a running commentary on the current legislation and debates in the Congress. </p><p>Dr. Coburn wrote an op-ed last year before the election, and said, \"For Republicans to regain their brand as the party of fiscal discipline, they would have to rejoin Americans in the real world of budget choices and priorities, and leave behind the fantasyland of borrowing without limits.\"</p><p>And he said, \"They must start the -- restart the permanent campaign against the government. They should tear up the emergency credit card, the emergency spending credit card and refuse to accept any new spending, whatsoever, until Congress does its job of eliminating wasteful spending.\" Something we haven't heard this new administration speak of at all.</p><p>Regaining their brand Senator Coburn said it was not about messaging, it was about action and courage and setting priorities.</p><p>And most of all he said that's about being willing to give up their political careers, so our grandkids don't have to grow up in a debtor's prison, or a world in which other nations can tell a weakened and bankrupt America where we can and can't defend liberty, pursue terrorists, or show compassion. Ladies and gentlemen that sounds like change we can believe and help me welcome Tom Coburn of the great State of Oklahoma.</p><p>COBURN: Good morning. Thank you. Have your seat. Let me just give you a little upfront notice, I'm only going to speak about two or three minutes.</p><p>One of the things that don't happen in meetings like this is you don't get to ask enough questions.</p><p>So, if you're going to want to ask question to me, please line up the microphones now so that we don't hustle forward.</p><p>Look, we are in (inaudible) as we say in Oklahoma, but we're not in such (inaudible) that we can't get our way out of it.</p><p>And the way we get out of it is go back and understand what made this country great, and it's three basic principles. Personal accountability, individual responsibility, and freedom that's greater than anywhere else in the world. That's what we need, that's what we need to be about. </p><p>Our country was built on a heritage of sacrifice and what we have today and what we've had in recent years is a reversal of that trend.</p><p>What used to happen is one generation would sacrifice for the generation following us so that opportunity and advancement would take place. We're operating just in the reverse of that now.</p><p>We are stealing from the next two -- I use to say the next generation, it's not true anymore.</p><p>We're now stealing from the next two generations and what we're stealing is a standard of living that has been 30 percent greater than anywhere else in the rest of the world, and we're about to steal that from the next two generations.</p><p>It does not have to be that way. So, what has to change is the willingness to fight even when you know you are going to lose so you can make sure that the story is out there and the comparative choice that the American people can see.</p><p>The Obama administration and Barack Obama will have a different philosophy. And there is nothing wrong with them having that philosophy, but there is plenty wrong when we don't challenge it intellectually and we don't put forward the competing view that is based on what has made this country great and has made it greater than any civilized society in the history of the world.</p><p>So, courage is the number one character quality that we should be looking for in the leadership among the conservatives in this country.</p><p>If you're not willing to fight even if you lose but still fight then you don't belong in this movement. </p><p>We need people of strong character with the courage to fight even if we loose.</p><p>And the reason is as we lose, we educate the American people between the choices and that's what has not happened in the last six to eight years in Congress.</p><p>So, if you want to ask questions, what I'd like you to do is -- I guess they are lined up, I can't see you for the lights. So, we're going to go with that. I want to leave you with one last little tidbit.</p><p>When I decided to run for the Senate, the first thousand dollar check I got was from a guy from San Francisco by the name of Milton Friedman.</p><p>And he said me one of his quotes, and he said, \"We don't do these things and say these things because we think we can ultimately persuade the other side in a debate. What we say these things and do these things because when their ideas fail, we will be there at the ready at the willing with ideas that work,\" and he was right.</p><p>So, who goes first? Where are we, right here.</p><p>QUESTION: Senator, thank you for your leadership. If we only had 51 senators like you, I wouldn't have to ask.</p><p>COBURN: Well, we actually need 60.</p><p>QUESTION: So, I'm a Goldwater Republican for 40 years. I dreamed, dreamed of a conservative majority in Congress who would limit the growth of government.</p><p>Unfortunately, we tried that and so far, it hasn't worked. And so, my question to you is, is it time for grassroots conservatives to start thinking about constitutional limits to the spending and borrowing and growth of government and those constitutional limits would have to be initiated from the states, since Congress will never do it themselves. What do think of that strategy?</p><p>COBURN: Well, first of all let me say that we haven't had a conservative majority in the U.S. Senate in sometime, and that's evident by what's passed in the Congress.</p><p>We're never going to do it on our own. The grassroots affects though is to challenge. Look, we let career (ph) politicians off easy.</p><p>When they are in their state, we need you there asking the hard questions and making them explain their positions of how they rationalize their position for the next election instead of rationalize a position against the constitution of the United States, and against the numerated power that it lies within it.</p><p>So, I think anything you want to do. I think most important, that is the big hill to climb will be very, very difficult that I'm not sure we are climb. Most important is to organize so that you are in front of those politicians when they are in front of the public where they get question and hit for the things that do not line up with a limited government, a pre-society, and a infringement on your right.</p><p>You know as the government grows your freedom declines and that's what the Obama budget is all about. It's about taken your freedom away.</p><p>It's not about just growing the government because every time the government grows by 1/10th of 1 percent, you have less freedom.</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION: Dr. Coburn. Actually...</p><p>COBURN: Where are you? </p><p>QUESTION: I am right here.</p><p>COBURN: OK.</p><p>QUESTION: I am waving my arms frantically.</p><p>(UNKNOWN): I am sorry about that. Go ahead.</p><p>QUESTION: First of all, thank you very much for your service for smaller government conservatives like me. There's not lot of us out there anymore, you give me hope and you've been my favorite senator for years. That's great. And I actually follow you Twitter. You're awesome. </p><p>I was wondering, in prior years of Congress in the Senate, if you had just one particular favorite, or I guess at least favorite bit of report that, like our past and it's just sounded to you that even somebody would even try to get federal money for this.</p><p>If you just could share with us your, I guess favorite?</p><p>COBURN: Oh! Gosh, I'm picking from millions. Look, the bridge to nowhere was perfect.</p><p>We did that on purpose, because people could relate to that. But what we should be is astounded and the all others that are there.</p><p>In this bill, we have a $2 million in this $410 billion bill is going to be in the Senate. We got $2 million for pork odor next week, $2 million to study pork smell.</p><p>You know, you might want to study why pigs smell bad, I would tell you why. Look, where they live.</p><p>But the point is, is that a priority? Think of -- the thing we need to relate to is look into the eyes of your children and your grand children and what do you see.</p><p>In this country you see hope. You see expectation. You see -- a look at the brighter future.</p><p>And as we continue to do what Congress is doing, we're dimming the glimmer in that eye of our children. It's got to stop.</p><p>This grand experiment that has grown a society and a material increase in standard of living at 50 percent greater than every other society in the world for years, especially since post World War II.</p><p>When we have earmarks that are not priority for the country, I held assemble (ph) two week ago in Congress. I borrowed it from a lady downstairs in the actual Senate chamber.</p><p>That's about how much common sense is there. And no, I am not kidding. And I want you to think about it.</p><p>Politicians are wonderful people, they care about this country whether they are Democrats or Republicans, but they lack a frame of reference to the real world. They haven't signed at both sides of the paycheck.</p><p>They haven't tried to negotiate a contract with the union, they haven't try to pay the bills when their incoming money slowing down.</p><p>They haven't stayed up all night worried and how they are going to take care of their employees.</p><p>What they have is the easiest of all joys -- jobs, and that is the wonderful pleasure of spending somebody else's money.</p><p>And when you do that without any perspective, what you're going to do spend it wrongly.</p><p>Next question, last one I am told.</p><p>QUESTION: Senator.</p><p>COBURN: Yes sir.</p><p>QUESTION: You are looking my way, thank you. I think it's important we emphasize that the freedom that our all speakers are talking about is the freedom from our own government.</p><p>I don't think that message has been made clear. Secondly... </p><p>(UNKNOWN): I agree.</p><p>QUESTION: ...all our speakers have said that we got to get the word out. How do we do it in a nation that is plagued and even dated by a press with whom I have had experiences since 1964 when I got Barry Goldwater elected in my pressings.</p><p>But the press is biased, prejudiced, not very intelligent, and will not report our message.</p><p>How do we get around the press with its love affair with the present administration? COBURN: Well, I think you are starting to see that. I mean that's one of the reasons that the fairness doctrine needs to be opposed. Not only directly but indirectly as they are going to come through with licensing renewals and try to do it.</p><p>But you are starting to see it. In the wonderful age of the Internet, it's going to make a big difference.</p><p>The daily newspaper is going to die, and the competitive channels on cable were starting to see some reflection at least there is two view points in this country today where there used to be only one.</p><p>You are also seeing the innovation with twitter and the e-mail messages, and text messages, and connections through that and YouTube and all these other things.</p><p>The Senate has this new YouTube Senate.hub where many of the senators are on there explaining the positions.</p><p>So, I think technology as usual is going to come back and benefit freedom from oppression of the government.</p><p>Let me just follow-up on your point. I was this week I talked with some people in the natural gas industry and I ask them, are we ever going to see -- our fertilizer sources are made from natural gas and we've lost 85 percent of that industry offshore.</p><p>And I asked -- with process low, are we going to see the fertilizer industry to will come back. They said, \"Absolutely not.\" And I said, well, why not.</p><p>They said because of the cost of regulation from the government is so onerous that no one would ever build a new fertilizer factory and hydrous ammonia or ammonium nitrate factory in this country of which if you think about, think about risk for us.</p><p>One of our greatest assets is our ability to produce agricultural products efficiently and massively, but we can't do that without fertilizer.</p><p>Now, we've -- through government regulation, we have setup a limitation on our ability to do that if in fact we ever gotten a pinch.</p><p>So, your concept, our founders believed, our freedom was inherent in us, not inherent in the government and the government should be the least to impose against that freedom. </p><p>Final point: We only change America if all of us work to change it, and you can have great members of Congress, but if we are in the minority, we are not going to get it done.</p><p>We can be abolished for what you feel and know to be true about the foundational principles of this country.</p><p>And I know you -- I'm talking to the working crowd here.

My name is Colleen Holmes.  I am the executive director of Eagle Forum here in Washington, D.C., and it is a great honor this morning to introduce our speaker.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      As any gentleman will tell, it takes a real patriot and a truly dedicated public servant to leave the great state of Texas to come to Washington, D.C.  Well, we've got some Texans in the House this morning.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      That's especially true when you have a career that's as distinguished as Senator John Cornyn.  Before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002, he served as Texas District Court judge, a member of the Texas Supreme Court and Texas attorney general.  </p><p>      Senator Cornyn's colleagues have joked that he is the only person in the Senate to have practiced real law and that grounding in real life is more important than ever in these times where we're hearing about so many different brands and justice, social justice, economic justice, even environmental justice.  </p><p>      But as a seasoned jurist, Senator Cornyn knows that true justice does not have a political agenda.  And for that reason, he has taken unwavering stance, calling for strict constructionists' jurisprudence, and he strongly condemned the practice of judges legislating from the bench.  </p><p>      Throughout his career, Senator Cornyn has tirelessly advocated for open government and accountable government.  Or as he would put it, he started to bring some Texas sunshine to Washington and, boy, do we need that?  </p><p>      Part of these efforts include his instrumental role in passing the 2007 OPEN Government Act, which extensively reformed the Freedom of Information Act.  </p><p>      Senator Cornyn currently sits on the Senate finance judiciary and budget committees and serves as a top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Refugees and Border Security Subcommittee.  </p><p>      He also serves as the deputy -- on the Deputy Whip team after just one year in office and has been a member of the Republican Senate Leadership since 2006.  He has served as the vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.  </p><p>      And in November of 2008, his colleagues chose him to lead their National Republican Senatorial Committee where he continues to advocate for strong conservative principles of bolstering our national defense, repairing our broken immigration system and securing our borders and strengthening the economy by expanding job opportunities, keeping taxes low and reducing spending.  </p><p>      Senator Cornyn is a graduate of Trinity University and St.  Mary School of Law, both in Texas, and he earned the masters of law from the University of Virginia Law School.  I hope the Texas will forgive him that.        And as further evidence of his excellent judgment and something that we at Eagle Forum certainly appreciate, I understand that Senator Cornyn has a unique appreciation and often expresses his appreciation for conservative women.  He married one and raised two.  </p><p>      He has been married to his wife, Sandy, who is with him today for 29 years.  Please welcome Senator John Cornyn.  </p><p>      CORNYN:  Thank you very much.  Ms. Colleen, thank you for that very nice introduction, and it's great to be with all of you here at CPAC.  </p><p>      I appreciate all of the conservatives coming from around the country to here to Washington, D.C., because the fact is, as you have heard learned that change has indeed come to Washington.  You can see it as you ride around the public transportation system where it's now more crowded under the bus than it is on the bus.  </p><p>      And you can see this as you stroll by the office of the IRS, where it's now, of course, patriotic to pay your taxes unless, of course, you are a member of Obama's cabinet.  </p><p>      And just this week, the Democrats have tried change the District of Columbia to the State of Columbia with its own representative in Congress and perhaps some day to senators too.  </p><p>      But one thing will never change.  The elites in Washington and the media will continue to betray conservatives as out of touch, out of fashion and out of luck.  But one thing hasn't changed:  they are wrong.  </p><p>      Following the thumping we got in the last election, the conservative movement is regrouping, reorganizing and renewing itself. And we're bringing forward new leaders to restore America's strength and prosperity and to defend our enduring values.  </p><p>      Conservatives have been in the wilderness before.  And as before, we can begin the work of picking ourself up and dusting ourself off right here at CPAC.  </p><p>      Back in 1977, after Democrats had taken control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Ron Reagan came to CPAC and reminded us that America's values had not changed.  </p><p>      He said, \"We who are proud to call ourselves conservative are not a minority of a minority party.  We are part of the great majority of Americans of both parties and of most independence as well.\"  </p><p>      Of course, four years later, Ronald Reagan returned to CPAC as president of the United States.  And soon after that, America began one of its longest periods of economic expansion.  And the Soviet Union was on its way to the ash heap of history.  </p><p>      As President Reagan was beginning his second term, I first ran for public office.  Back then, Texas was a one-party state, Democratic, and they held the stranglehold on virtually every office from the local level to the state level.  And perhaps unsurprisingly, corruption was a serious problem.  </p><p>      Well, despite the odds and a few of us decided to buck the system and run.  We ran as Republicans.  More importantly perhaps, we ran as reformers.  And we won.  </p><p>      Since then, I have had the honor to serve in all three branches of government, the judicial, the executive and now on the legislative branch as United States senator, representing my beloved Texas.  Make sure you give the Texans time to applause there.  </p><p>      As a conservative, I can't tell you that I won every battle I have engaged in.  As a conservative, I had to keep learning about how to apply our principles to new challenges.  </p><p>      But as a conservative, I found that when you stand on principle consistently, you can earn the public trust and even the respect of your adversaries and good things can happen.  </p><p>      I still believe good things can happen.  Following his primary defeat in 1976, Ronald Reagan was quoted in old Irish ballad, and said, \"I will lay me down and bleed a while.  Though I am wounded, I am not slain.  I will rise and fight again.\"  </p><p>      I believe as conservatives, we spend enough time bleeding.  And now, it's the time to get back in the battle and fight.  I do believe that we need to choose our battles wisely.  </p><p>      With a new president, with the kind of popularity new presidents tend to have, we need to pick those battles, but make no -- have no doubt about it.  It is a time to fight back.  And that's why I agree to take on a new job in addition to new six-year term as United States senator from Texas, as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  </p><p>      In case you haven't noticed, the Republican caucus in the Senate is a lot smaller than it was just a few years ago.  </p><p>      In fact, in 2002, when I came to Washington representing Texas, we had 55 Republican senators.  And now, they are 41.  I think it's just obvious that if we don't turn this around, then soon we will be able to run out the Republican cloakroom and just meet on the elevator.  </p><p>      But you all understand what having 41 senators means.  It means we barely have enough votes to deny cloture in the Senate, and that is if all Republicans stick together.  No easy task depending on the issue.  </p><p>      Having 41 means that we have leverage to block bad legislation or perhaps more importantly to shape it, and to bring Democrats to the negotiating table, so we can actually improve it and send a bill to the president that he will and should sign.  </p><p>      Having 41 Republicans means that Harry Reid is only one vote away on each and every piece of legislation from having filibuster-proof majority, and having in effect what Nancy Pelosi has in the House.        So I think it's just obvious as a nose on our face, our mission is clear, we must win more Republican seats.  We must build a new majority.  </p><p>      And this is just as important.  In the process we must regain the trust and confidence of the American people.  Our first task is to support a good man, Norm Coleman in Minnesota,  </p><p>      Norm is a fantastic human being and he is a great leader that Minnesotans can be proud of.  The Democrats, of course, are up to their old tricks, up there in the land of 10,000 lakes, which has now become the land of 10,000 lawyers, as Al Franken continues to try to steal this election,  </p><p>      Now, I believe that Norm has a real shot at pulling this out in the recount litigation that's occurring right now.  I am still calling him \"old number 42.\"  We'll continue to support Norm, and I encourage you to do so as well, because we need him back,  </p><p>      Our second task is to be honest with ourselves about why we lost so many seats over these last two cycles.  And I believe it boils down to this.  </p><p>      We lost the trust of the American people.  A post-election survey sums it up.  When asked which party sticks to their principles more often, only 37 percent said Republicans, while 44 percent said the Democratic Party -- shocking to me,  </p><p>      The good news is our conservative principles weren't the problem. According to the same survey, 69 percent of the American people describe themselves as fiscal conservatives, while only 27 percent said they were liberals on issues like taxes and spending, and 53 percent describe themselves as social conservatives, Compared to 40 percent, who say they are liberals on issues like abortion or same sex marriage.  </p><p>      Democrats understand these numbers too, that's why they recruited a junior senator from Pennsylvania who is pro-life and a junior senator from New York who sleeps with guns under her bed,  </p><p>      And that's why Obama, quite skillfully, but deceptively promised tax cuts to 95 percent of the American people, and promised it so often that by the end of the presidential campaign, as amazing as it may sound, more voters thought he would be better bet on taxes than John McCain,  </p><p>      So the message to the voters seems pretty clear to me.  The American people will support us if we stick to our principles and they will abandon us if we don't.  </p><p>      Now to reclaim our party's identity, we must demonstrate our principles in respectful opposition.  Principle opposition means supporting the idea of the stimulus bill, if it's timely targeted and temporary, and opposing when it's not.  </p><p>      Principle opposition means supporting the administration, when it calls for greater transparency and accountability in government, and exposing their hypocrisy when their rhetoric doesn't match reality.  </p><p>      And principle opposition means reading the fine print on what the Democrats are actually doing and explaining the American people what they're trying to get away with.  </p><p>      One example of reading the fine print is drawing attention to what I call, \"Bailouts for Trial Lawyers,\" the Democrats moved through Congress recently.  </p><p>      Now, trial lawyers have give a big money to the Democrats and they seem to be getting their money's worth for their investment.  </p><p>      In the stimulus bill, in the so called Lilly Ledbetter Act, and another legislation moving through Congress, the Democrats are encouraging more litigation and creating more uncertainty in the workplace.  </p><p>      Now I think the last thing in our businesses and our job creators need is to worry about the threat of more litigation, but that's exactly what the democrats are trying to do.  </p><p>      We must read the fine print and help the American people understand what it means.  The simple truth is for millions of voters who voted for this president, they didn't think they were voting for bailouts for trial lawyers, but that's what they got.  </p><p>      Our task is to show them what's really going on here in Washington.  So that the furlong (ph) they are saying that's simply is not what we bargained for in this last election.  </p><p>      The fourth thing we need to do is to recruit good candidates to run as Republicans in 2010.  Right now, I see the landscape is pretty promising.  There are some incumbent seats in the U.S. Senate that we've got to defend, and open seats we must hold, like Ohio, Missouri and Florida.  </p><p>      And we may even have some unexpected opportunities in places like New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Arkansas, Colorado, Nevada, and yes, even California.  </p><p>      As somebody who has run in 14 contested elections, I'm a strong believer that getting the right candidate is 90 percent of the game, getting candidates who can communicate our principles, who will work hard, and will connect with the voters in their states.  </p><p>      And the National Republican Senatorial Committee, working with Michael Steele at the RNC, and my friend Pete Sessions over at the Congressional Committee -- we can offer good candidates the tools they need in order to win.  </p><p>      Now, not all of these candidates are going to be as conservative as I am on each and every issue, it's critical that we get candidates that will fit their states and who can get elected.  </p><p>      But I don't think there's any contradiction between being principled and pragmatic.  As I said, I'm one of -- I'm proud to be the fourth most conservative Republican in the United States Senate. Back in Texas, we call that mainstream.  </p><p>      But I have to tell you, I would rather have a Republican who votes with me 80 percent of the time than a liberal Democrat who will vote with me zero percent of the time.  You can sign me up on each and every occasion to support that Republican for election and to oppose that Democrat.  </p><p>      Now I understand that, occasionally, we get frustrated by the way some of my colleagues vote -- I do to.  But a circular firing squad is no solution to the problems our party finds itself to in right now.  </p><p>      Remember that Ronald Reagan was able to accomplish quite a lot with Republican caucus that was not as conservative as our caucus is even today, because, and this is important, because he had a Republican majority in United States Senate.  </p><p>      When today's Republican recapture the majority, we will be able to control the agenda.  As you know, the chairman of a committee determines what bills are called up in the committee.  The majority leader, when Mitch McConnell is majority leader then he will be able to determine which bills actually come to the floor of the Senate.  </p><p>      And we will be able to keep the worse liberal ideas off the floor entirely, and.  of course in doing so, to limit the chances of division among our rights.  </p><p>      So to be a national party we have to put blue and purple states into play.  We must be a national party and we must run candidates that can win in every region of the country.  </p><p>      Now this brings me to my final point.  I believe it's very important that we broaden our party and we increase our appeal among groups that share our values, conservative values, but they don't necessarily identify themselves as Republicans or maybe even identify themselves as conservatives.  </p><p>      Some of these people I'm talking about are independents.  Some are young people, who are just forming their own thoughts about how government should work.  Many are Hispanics, African-Americans or members of other ethnic and religious communities.  </p><p>      Reaching to these people doesn't mean apologizing for our principles or watering them down, it doesn't mean saying, yes, but less to every liberal initiative.  </p><p>      Above all it doesn't mean playing the game of identity politics that the Democrats seem to play so well.  Conservatives must resist the poisonous liberal notion that political convictions come from your race, or your class, rather than your head and your heart.  </p><p>      Reaching out does mean getting out there and leaving with these folks, and welcome them, and explaining to them, who we are and inviting them to join us.  </p><p>      But I believe the sage philosopher Woody Allen it about right. When he said that 80 percent of success in life is showing up then we need show up.  We need to show up not just at election time, but all the time.  </p><p>      Now, some of the way we can show up, but we can't do so when person is by embracing new technology.  And we have learnt from Obama how devastating that new technology can be when used against us.  But we've got to embrace it and used it ourselves.  And we have to use new networking compatibilities in order to reach out.  </p><p>      But some times -- and I think most of the time -- the best way to show up is just to sit down with people face to face, and treat them with the dignity that they deserve, and explain to them why we are conservatives, and why we believe conservative principles affirm that human dignity, and are the best way for us to exercise our freedoms here in America.  </p><p>      Let me give you just one example.  Last November, I won 36 percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas.  Now I wish that number were higher, I won't lie to you, but I'm proud that I got so high in a pretty tough election.  </p><p>      36 percent of the vote was actually 5 points higher than Senator McCain got nation wide among Hispanics and I had a Hispanic opponent.  </p><p>      Despite...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      CORNYN:  Now, despite broad Hispanic support for the McCain- Kennedy immigration bill, as you know, I had major reservations about it and I ended up voting no.  </p><p>      But nevertheless, many Hispanics...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      CORNYN:  Many Hispanics, Republicans, independents and Democrats ended up supporting me for one simple reason.  </p><p>      We took the time and effort to build relationships within the Hispanic community.  </p><p>      We demonstrated our respect by showing up and telling them both what we were doing and listening to their concerns in responding.  </p><p>      As we build these relationships, we discovered that something I think that is very important for all of us here at CPAC to understand, Hispanics are among the most conservative voters in the nation when it comes to their basic core values.  </p><p>      Hispanics own small businesses, so they respond to our economic message of lower taxes and sensible regulation.  </p><p>      Hispanics are social conservatives and believe in traditional marriage and the sanctity of human life.  </p><p>      And many Hispanics appreciate the facts that Republicans are the ones that stand up when it comes to trade and foreign policy.        We reject demigods like Hugo Chavez; we support reformers like President Calderon in Mexico, and President Reuben in Columbia.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      CORNYN:  And we work to expand trade throughout our hemisphere and around the globe, because we believe that creates jobs and opportunity right here at home.  </p><p>      The false liberal narrative that conservatives want to push people out of the movement is just that.  It's false.  </p><p>      The truth is our principles when correctly explained can draw people in.  </p><p>      Well, it's been a tough year for conservatives, there's no question about it.  </p><p>      As many people predicted here at CPAC, just a year ago, as our dear departed friend Tony Snow reminded us then when one act of the drama ends, another is sure to begin.  </p><p>      This is our moment Tony said, \"This is the time to do what we do best, turn adversity into strength.\"  </p><p>      We're not about to walk back from the high ideals and grand accomplishments that we've achieved over the last generation.  </p><p>      Ronald Reagan, Tony Snow, and so many others who have inspired us are gone, but their principles, the principles that inspired them are still with us because they lived for lives on.  </p><p>      We who gathered here at CPAC are some of those who will carry that conservative banner forward.  </p><p>      Others will join us from every state across the land, and together we can earn the support of the American people and create a new era of opportunity.  </p><p>      Thank you, very much and God bless you all.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Anybody have any doubt?  Right, Texans are awfully proud of Senator John Cornyn...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Every right today.  Introducing our next guest is Larry Hart.  </p><p>      He is the director of government relations for the American Conservative Union and brings 13 years of experience in the legislative and executive branches of the government.  </p><p>      In 1999, he formed Hartco Strategies, a media relations and political consulting firm whose clients ranged from members of Congress to non-profits, and he's been involved in politics at every level throughout his career.  </p><p>      He also served as the professional staff of the House science committee, on subcommittee on energy and environment for four years after a three-year stint at the Department of Energy, issues that are increasingly important to all of us.  </p><p>      Earlier, he was communications director for Congressman Dana Rohrabacher of California and, before that, the late Herb Bateman of Virginia.  </p><p>      He's also been active in efforts to rebuild Afghanistan, serving as pro-bono executive director of the Afghanistan-America Foundation, and in 2002, produced \"Life After War,\" a documentary focusing on NPR with war correspondent Sarah Chayes who left media to help rebuild a village near Kandahar.  </p><p>      He's also, for those who may stay up late and watch late night, was a child actor and for the all-night cable enthusiast you may see him occasionally on the \"The Real McCoys\" and \"The Donna Reed Show,\" making a rare, early morning appearance, Larry Hart.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      HART:  Good morning.  Good looking morning, crowd.  You know one of the hardest things in politics is to give up a safe seat in Congress to run for higher office.  Particularly, when it means taking on your parties establishment in a primary.  </p><p>      Many consider it, few do it.  But that's exactly what our next speaker did in 2004, when he gave up his House seat to run for the Senate.  </p><p>      Jim DeMint took on former South Carolina Governor David Beasley and a wealthy developer and finished second, well behind Beasley in the first round of the primary.  </p><p>      Undaunted, he persuade and won the run off easily, then went on to defeat the well known state education superintendent in the general election.  </p><p>      Well, taking on tough challenges as characterized Jim DeMint's Senate career as he is the leading opponent of the Senate, of the ultimate bipartisan sacred cow, the earmark.  </p><p>      For this...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      HART:  ...For this Bob Novak has called him a hero, and the Wall Street Journal Steve Moore, the taxpayers greatest allay for saving the taxpayers some $17 billion by his actions.  </p><p>      Now among some of his colleagues, there are few less laudatory labels.        But at the American Conservative Union, we call him a defender of liberty, for being the only senator to score 100 on our ratings for 2008.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      HART:  A year that's all Republicans barely divided on the best course of action.  Well for Jim DeMint, the course of action was clear.  </p><p>      Apply conservative principals to every vote you cast.  </p><p>      He defines it this way.  \"The greatness of a country is found in its people and its values, not in its governments.\"  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      HART:  Jim DeMint is applying those principles to the chairmanship of the Senate's steering committee, which includes a majority of the Republican conference and works to advance conservative causes in the Senate.  </p><p>      Just yesterday, he forced the Senate to vote on his amendment to repudiate efforts to restore the so-called \"Fairness Doctrine.\"  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      HART:  It carried overwhelmingly.  </p><p>      Pleasure to introduce Senator Jim DeMint.  </p><p>      (APPLUASE)  </p><p>      DEMINT:  I need you folks to get me out of bed every morning.  I think, I am ready to go fly.  </p><p>      I can't thank you enough.  You don't know how encouraging it is to those who of us who are in the fight for 9000 of you to come from all over the country to encourage us, and to create that critical mass that keeps us moving forward.  </p><p>      So, thank you for being here and thanks for getting up so early this morning to listen to us.  </p><p>      I am just back from the frontlines and we do have a few things to celebrate from yesterday.  </p><p>      And we are seeing with examples like this fairness doctrine that with the support of the American people through bloggers and radio talk shows, we can get people to speak out and to stand up and to call-in and e-mail, and we can change the minds of so many senators if we have people who are willing to stand up and fight.  </p><p>      Yesterday we did, force a vote.  They wouldn't allow this vote in the House, but I worked with members of the House.        We worked together to work the media, to get the message and the truth to the people that this potential of the fairness doctrine coming back was a real threat.  </p><p>      And they couldn't get a vote in the House for because the rules in the Senate, we could add it as an amendment to something else, and we forced the Democrats out of their closets and we got 87 votes to kill the fairness doctrine.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      DEMINT:  And we need to take that same idea, that same process of engaging the American people to take back our government and to take back our country and I believe that we can and I believe in some ways it's starting right here this week with you folks converging on Washington to tell us that you are behind us.  </p><p>      Well, I am excited about yesterday, but I am actually more excited about something else.  </p><p>      My wife and I are on baby watch, grand baby watch actually.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      DEMINT:  Now, we're expecting our second grandson tomorrow actually.  </p><p>      So, if you see me run off the stage, you see I got a better offer than you have here this morning.  </p><p>      When our first grandson, he's two-and-a-half years, his name is Jimbo (ph).  That's a good New England name, right?  </p><p>      You could tell on from south of the Mason-Dixon Line.  </p><p>      But I tell you this, and I could see some of you in the audience who are probably grandparents too and you know it's true when I say it that the only thing in life, it's not overrated, is being a grandparent.  </p><p>      But it does -- it gives you new perspective of what we are working for here, and it is about our children and grand children, and the future of the country, carrying on with so many who fought and died for.  </p><p>      It's a very real cause that we are here fighting for.  </p><p>      I really appreciate my good friend, John Cornyn.  </p><p>      He's not only part of our elected leadership and responsible for getting a Republicans elected to the Senate, but he is one of the conservative leaders that sits around a small table with me on the steering committee to help move our Republican conferences back towards conservative principles.  </p><p>      He's got a tough job.  He has got a tough job, and he is right.        We have to find ways to appeal to a larger number of American voters.  And I believe we can, but not by saying one thing and doing another, not by talking about limited government, while increasing the number of earmarks, expanding government, spending in debt to historic levels.  </p><p>      Before we earn the votes of Americans, we must re-earn the trust of the American people.  </p><p>      The current majority and the new administration has plans to expand the reach of government beyond anything that we've ever imagined.  Now is the time for conservatives to champion the ideas that have worked and will work for America.  Now is the time to show America the real differences between the parties.  </p><p>      The party politics and political labels will not win elections. We must stand for the principles that work, the principles that made America great and will make America great in the future.  I believe we can win the hearts and minds of many more Americans, but not by changing what we believe, not by abandoning our principles.  </p><p>      We can do it by convincing Hispanics, Sacraments (ph), blacks, white, poor, rich, by convincing all Americans that we are better off when we're free, that we will be more prosperous and more secure when we can make our own choices from many alternatives in all areas of our lives based on the things that we value as individuals and as families.  </p><p>      We will win the hearts and the votes of the American people when we convince them that freedom will work for them, their families and for every American.  </p><p>      When we stand together for Americans to make their own choices about where their children go to school and their way to choose their own doctors and to own a health plan, a health plan that they can afford and keep from job to job; when we fight for them to have a choice to own their own social security account and to keep a larger share of what they earn in their paychecks; when American see us fighting, not just talking, but fighting for their rights and freedom, then we will earn their trust and their votes.  </p><p>      Most Americans don't expect the government to give them the American dream.  But they do expect their elected officials to make sure that they have the opportunity to work for it and to earn it. That dream begins with individuals, not the government.  </p><p>      The American dream will be within reach for all our citizens, when our families, schools, churches, businesses and community organizations, all of our institutions work together to equip our citizens with the character, the skills and the capabilities to succeed in a free society.  </p><p>      When the majority of Americans are responsible for themselves and accountable for their own decisions, then we will have an America where freedom works.  When we can convince Americans that this freedom will work for them, that this freedom will give them and their children a better life, more prosperity and security, then we'll win the votes of the American people and then we will deserve the votes of the American people.  Thank you.  </p><p>      For years, I have been burdened by a growing concern that Americans have lost the knowledge and the understanding of what freedom is and how it works.  We still hear freedom mentioned in political speeches, but politicians of all stripes like pied pipers leading children to their demise have been successful in lowering Americans into more and more dependence on government.  </p><p>      We really shouldn't be surprised.  A nation that raises its children in government schools cannot expect its people to stand for the principles of freedom.  </p><p>      You know, I have spilled these burdens along with my heart and soul along to the pages of our new book that I have titled \"Saving Freedom\".  The subtitle is we can stop America slide into socialism. The publisher is V&amp;H International (ph).  The book will be introduced on July 4th under their new Fidelis (ph) imprint.  </p><p>      My goal with this book is to remind Americans of how important freedom has been to the success of our country and how important it is to our future, to explain how freedom works and how we can preserve and protect it.  </p><p>      I am convinced that neither Congress nor the president will save freedom.  In fact, unless Americans fight back, the federal government will continue to erode freedom in every area of our lives.  Only the American people, informed, engaged, activated and enraged can save our country now.  </p><p>      I believe Americans are sick of politics, as they should be.  I think they're thirsty for common sense solutions and the truth.  I am convinced that if we show them the right target, if we tell them how they can help save freedom, they will shoot.  </p><p>      Unfortunately, over 10 years, neither Republicans nor Democrats have offered very good choices.  It's time for that to change.  </p><p>      Earlier this week, we heard the world's best salesman of socialism address the nation.  I was right there right on the second row, and it sounded so good.  But like so much political doublespeak, President Obama's speech was designed to mislead the American people.  </p><p>      He is not confident in our people or in our free markets or our free institutions.  He believes in government, and most of his solutions are more government spending and new government programs. He spoke of lofty goals and how government was going to fix everything that is wrong with America.  </p><p>      I agree with many of his goals.  We need to fix our financial system, fix our schools and reform healthcare.  We need to make America more energy independent and cut wasteful programs and improve our nation's infrastructure.  We all agree on those things, but we can't accomplish these goals with more government programs and spending.        Think about it.  We just need America to think about it.  The president lambasted the greed and waste of banks and Wall Street, but what bank would make a loan to someone they knew couldn't pay it back unless the government was there to buy that loan.  </p><p>      You know, and what securities firm or asset managers on Wall Street would buy a bundle of these loans unless it came with a government guarantee.  It wouldn't happen.  </p><p>      Hey -- and why not buy these securities with borrowed money when the Federal Reserve offers an interest rates that's lower than the guaranteed return rate on the securities they guarantee.  Folks, this is just human nature of good common sense.  The free markets and deregulation did not wreck our credit markets in our economy; the government and political greed.  </p><p>      It is government and political greed or on the bulls eye of the target of what's wrong with our economy.  Stupid government policies have destroyed the accountability of the free markets.  </p><p>      The president presented some devastating statistics about education in America.  But who has been running our schools for the last 40 years?  It's really the federal government and our courts.  We spend more on education as a nation than any other government program, more per child than any other nation in the world.  </p><p>      Obama believes that more federal control and more spending is the answer.  But that is completely irrational.  In America, we'll know it if we tell them the truth.  I'll make my own guarantee.  If we let the $10,000 plus a year that we are now spending on every student in America, if we let that money follow the student to the school of their parents' choice, public or private, secular or religious, I will guarantee that within five years America will have the best schools in the world.  </p><p>      I worked all my life in the free markets, and I'll tell you what would happen.  The America -- America's investment in education would likely double with no additional government spending, as the private sector employed its best minds and technologies to produce a wide variety of learning environments designed to win market share by meeting the needs of a wide variety of students.  </p><p>      Teachers would have many different choices of jobs, and teaching would become a sought-after, well-paid profession.  Freedom will work in education if we will just let it.  </p><p>      The president also said that education begins at home.  But who has messed up the family structure in America?  The government welfare policies increased unwed mothers (ph) from 8 percent to 35 percent and climbing.  Government policies have severely damaged the family structure in America.  And now, the government wonders why children can't read when they get to school.  </p><p>      The president said we need to reform healthcare because it's too expensive and too many people are uninsured.  But is more government the answer?  I don't think so.  Once again, government has caused the problem.  We can't allow our government to control over half of the insurance market and still expect the private markets to work.  </p><p>      We can't help employers by health insurance, but then make it impossible, almost impossible, for individuals to find affordable policies for themselves.  And then we act surprised that millions of Americans don't have insurance.  </p><p>      We can't limit competition between health insurance companies by restricting Americans to only those policies they can get in their state, and still expect health insurance to be competitively priced.  </p><p>      I mean this is not rocket science.  Why not let freedom work in healthcare.  Every American could have a health insurance plan that they could afford, own and keep, without the government spending, one additional value (ph).  </p><p>      This could go on and on.  President Obama complained that America is dependent on foreign countries for 70 percent of our oil, but who has been restricting the drilling of oil?  </p><p>      Who has been restricting the development of clean burning, domestically produced, natural gas?  Who has stopped the development of no emission, nuclear energy?  Its been our government.  Government is the problem.  </p><p>      You know Democrats complained about American manufacturing jobs going overseas, but who loads the highest corporate tax rates onto the backs of American businesses?  And who holds businesses hostage with the threat of more lawsuits than any other country in the world?  And who strangles American business with regulations?  Folks, we're not letting freedom work, but we are blaming freedom for the problems.  </p><p>      President and the Democratic Congress are blaming America's problems on free markets and free people, but the truth is beginning to hit the American people, right in the face.  </p><p>      The government is not the answer to our problems, the government is the problem.  Freedom is a powerful, but delicate and endangered thing.  </p><p>      When Ronald Reagan said freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp, when he said that the entire federal budget was one-tenth the size of the stimulus package that we passed two weeks ago.  </p><p>      We need to think about where we're going.  Government is out of control, and freedom is the only solution.  In American freedom is built on the principles and values that are derived from Judeo- Christian religious convictions.  </p><p>      If we allow this government to continue to purge religion and faith, religious values and the principles that are derived from our culture, we will loose our freedom.  </p><p>      Freedom sits on the foundations of the values and principles that are derived from faith.  But it's built with the support beams of constitutionally limited government in the rule of law.        If we allow Congress and the president to continue to ignore the constitution, and compromise the rule of law, we will loose our freedom.  </p><p>      Freedom solutions will work in education, healthcare, energy, housing and all areas of our economy and culture.  Government has never or will it ever, solve our problems.  </p><p>      The good news is that Americans have gotten a glimpse of the big government plans of Obama and the Democrats and millions are ready to stand up, speak out, and yes, even take to the streets to stop America's slide into socialism.  </p><p>      Now, we're looking for leaders, and everyone seems to be asking, who will be the new leaders of the Republican Party in the conservative movement.  </p><p>      First, I hope these two groups will be one and the same in the future.  </p><p>      Let's not rush to pick leaders based on, who is the best speaker, the best personality, the best politician, or the best looking.  That would eliminate me right away.  </p><p>      But just give me a teleprompter.  I don't know these were here this morning.  If you could just see me with a teleprompter you would (inaudible).  </p><p>      We need to look for those men and women, who are willing to stand and fight for the principles of freedom.  We will know that we have found our new leaders, when we see people with character and conviction, stand with courage for the principles of freedom.  </p><p>      When we see American's, black and white, men and women, immigrants, poor, old, young, Republicans, independents, even some democrats, when we see these American's inspired and responding to those among us, who are standing for freedom, we will know that we have found our leaders.  </p><p>      Thank you, for standing for freedom, with courage and conviction for the cause of freedom.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Thank you, senator.  Isn't it clear that those on the left, you say Republicans are just obstructionist, the conservatives are offering no alternatives, clearly, they are just not listening. And maybe they need to listen lot more carefully.  </p><p>      Grover Norquist is our next introducer.  He is the president of Americans for Tax Reform, a grass roots tax payer group, founded at the request of President Reagan in 1986.  I just refer to him as The President and still do.  </p><p>ATR asked our candidates to sign the tax payer protection pledge, committing themselves in writing, not just in words, to oppose all tax increases.        He serves on boards of National Rifle Association.  The American Conservative Union and serves as president of the American Society of Competitiveness.  </p><p>      He also rocked the house, the story of 1994 Republican sweep of Congress and most recently has written Leave Us Alone:  Getting the Government's Hands Off Our Money, Our Guns, Our Lives.  </p><p>      He also chairs the Wednesday meeting in Washington DC, were over 120, to 150 activists gather each week to promote conservative ideas and a pro-freedom coalition.  </p><p>      Please welcome Grover Norquist.  </p><p>      NORQUIST:  Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to introduce John Boehner.  Who is the gentleman, who when he came to Congress from Ohio, told his constituents, if you want somebody to go to Washington and steel money and bring it back to the district, what they call earmarks, you want to vote for somebody else.  </p><p>      And in his time in Washington, he has kept that commitment, and then a leader to keep spending down, not one of the shoplifters that thought their job was to bring goodies back to their friends.  </p><p>      He is one of the gang of seven.  The original effort by Republicans to reform the way Congress worked, and moved and he became a leader in the effort for the contract with America, which helped us Republican control of the House and Senate.  </p><p>      But now he is the Republican leader in the house.  And he just did a very amazing thing.  It's the first step on our road back to a Republican and conservative House of Representatives, and that was to hold every single Republican to say no to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid spending...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      NORQUIST:  That was step one on the road to a majority.  Imagine the billions and tens of billions of dollars and your tax dollars that were dangled in front of people asking to please be bipartisan, set your principles aside, and give us the votes and every hour under Congressman Boehner's leadership said no.  </p><p>      Please write down and remember a couple of numbers.  We need, in 2010 to win 40 House seats, presently held by Democrats.  Some masquerading as conservatives, but everyone of them -- Nancy Pelosi, liberal in their voting and that are fact.  </p><p>      We need to pick up 40 seats after the March 31, election in New York.  20, we will need to 39 seats.  So as Alfred Hitchcock would say, there are 39 steps to a Republican majority.  </p><p>      One other number, there are 46 Democrat members in Congress today, sitting in seats that voted in '84 and '88 for Bush and McCain at the presidential levels.        Those were not exactly our strongest presidential years, but 46 Ds sitting seats that actually want to elect Republicans.  It is my honor to introduce to you leader Boehner, the next speaker of the House of Representatives.  </p><p>      BOEHNER:  Good morning to all of you.  On the way here this morning, I remember that my first visit to CPAC occurred 24 years ago in 1985, when I was brand new state representative.  </p><p>      Some of my friends from my state rep district suggested I come to this gathering.  And I came here in 1985, 1986, and really, I came here to learn more about our movement.  </p><p>      And is see some of my friends here KD (ph) and Dave Kern, couple of constituents, who have taken upon themselves back in the late 80s and early 90s to make sure that I never wavered from the truth.  Dave, KD (ph), thank you very much for your help.  </p><p>      Not many of you know a whole lot about me, but I come from Cincinnati.  I grew up there.  I have 11 brothers and sisters, and my dad owned a bar, all right.  </p><p>      Now, there is a lot that I can say about that, the skills I learned growing up or the skills I need to my job today.  Growing up in a big family, you have to learn get along with each other, get things done together, gets thing done as a family.  </p><p>      I grew up work at a bar, mopping the floors, waiting tables, attending bar and there you learned to deal with every character that walks in the door.  Trust me.  I need all of these skills to do my job today.  </p><p>      But I was lucky enough to have parents who cared.  And parents who insisted that we get a decent education.  I was lucky enough to begin my own business, and to grow my business.  And along the way, I got involved in my neighborhood homeowners associations and ended up in the United States Congress.  </p><p>      This too could happen to you.  But I got involved in this for one big reason that the opportunities that were available to me and the opportunities that were available to all of you, I thought were slowly disappearing and I thought someone from the real world would (ph) take more active role in their government.  </p><p>      Now that's what got me involved and that that's what keeps me involved.  </p><p>      I didn't come into Congress because I wanted to be a congressman. I came here to do something to preserve the opportunities that were available to us so that were available to our kids and theirs.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      BOEHNER:  But that's freedom that we enjoyed, economic freedom is really under assault today.        And I think the stimulus was the opening of salvo.  It was supposed to be focused on jobs, jobs, jobs and it turned into nothing more than spending, spending, and more spending.  </p><p>      But when you put this in the hands of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reed, it obviously became a gravy train for leftwing pork, and I knew something was wrong when I read the first version of the bill, and it had the word contraceptives in it, $230 million.  </p><p>      And I brought up to everyone's attention and guess what they have finally decided to take it out, but...  </p><p>      Sitting in my desk right when this outline came out before -- long before they have resolved the bill, and I was looking at this outline eating my lunch, getting ready up to the press gallery and talk a little bit about it, and all I could think of was, \"oh my god.\" </p><p>      When you look at all of the spending that was in there, for every leftwing idea there whatever it was, you began to realize that we were on the wrong path.  </p><p>      And while they got the contraceptive language out there, it's still has money in there for (inaudible) just watch, because as this bill starts to get implemented, I will assure you that you will know how every dime of this bill is going to be spent.  </p><p>      And now this bill set the stage for government controlled healthcare, began to dismantle the welfare reforms for 1997 by relaxing the work requirements.  </p><p>      And most of the tax relief was really welfare, tax relief to people who don't pay income taxes.  </p><p>      And how do you make the economy better by encouraging people to work less and making them more dependant on our government?  </p><p>      There was one Congressman though -- one Congressman who vote to president and they asked him, well, why did you vote president.  </p><p>      And he said, \"Well, because that's how President Obama used to vote when he had the vote on lousy bills.\"  </p><p>      Well, let me tell you that, there wasn't one Republican who voted to president, there wasn't one Republican who voted yes, we all voted no.  </p><p>      The liberals and the mainstream media, they just didn't know how to deal with it.  </p><p>      First they said, we (inaudible) no, and then when I pointed out, well no, they have an alternative, an alternative that would have cost half as much as the Democrats and would have created twice as many jobs in America.  </p><p>      Then they said, well, they are committing political suicide.        But Nelson and I (ph) pointed out that some 53 percent of Americans think the stimulus will either won't help or will hurt our economy.  </p><p>      But that wasn't the end of what's happened here in the first five weeks of the Obama administration.  </p><p>      This spending barrage was just beginning.  This week, the House passed an omnibus appropriations bill, the largest spending bill that we passed since the stimulus, $410 billion, $30 billion over budget, the largest increase in the domestic discretionary spending since (inaudible) years, and a bill that had 9,000 earmarks in it.  </p><p>      And as Webber pointed out, \"I've never asked for an earmark, I'll never ask for one.  My job wasn't to come to Washington and steal from public treasury for my districts.  It was to stand up for my district and to fight for freedom for the American people.\"  </p><p>      And while they had money in this bill for blueberry research on nature center, a whole bunch of other beautification projects, they couldn't find money to continue the D.C. scholarship program to help poor kids get out of some of the most rotten schools in America and give them a chance at a decent education.  </p><p>      One of the issues that I hope put into law of some seven or eight years ago, but they've made it clear they're going to kill this program, that's how bad this is.  </p><p>      One day after President Obama gave the speech about hope, Nancy Pelosi passed a bill that takes away hope for thousands of American kids here in D.C.  They have a chance at this decent education.  </p><p>      But that wasn't enough.  The stimulus, the omnibus, and then yesterday what happens, the budget comes out.  </p><p>      This budget is nothing more than a job killer, plain and simple.  </p><p>      It erases taxes on all Americans in the midst of a recession.  </p><p>      It relies on tax increases on small business, family firms, middle class families, retirees, charities, every American with a 401 (k) and yes, any American who dares to flip on a light switch and all. They are all going to pay higher taxes under this budget.  </p><p>      The government tried to raise taxes in a recession once before.  </p><p>      It was the Hoover administration, we all know what happened.  </p><p>      But this budget also includes the so-called cap-and-trade system for global climate change, which is a French term for pink slip or as what I'd like to call it another code word for a carbon tax in America.  </p><p>      American jobs are going to be under threat and if we do this with our industrialized countries working together with us we will ship millions of American jobs overseas.        And I can say that I my demo -- Republican colleagues and all democrat members of the Congress are never going to stand to see taxes raised on Americans to the tune of $1.3 trillion and they ship millions of American jobs overseas, it's just not going to happen.  </p><p>      Well, the stimulus, the omnibus, the budget, it's all one big down payment on a new American socialist experiment.  </p><p>      They're laying the groundwork for everything in these bills, expanded welfare, government run healthcare, green jobs, the works.  </p><p>      They even want to pay irresponsible neighbors mortgage off for them.  </p><p>      All this is being done though on the backs of our kids and our grand kids, and all of these bills seek to replace our economic freedom of what their wins and mandates of politicians and bureaucrats.  </p><p>      Listen, I took to meet from liberals for my speech on the House floor opposing the stimulus.  </p><p>      They didn't like it when I pointed out, but no member of the Congress had read the nearly 11,000 -- 1,100 pages in this bill.  </p><p>      And they didn't really didn't like it when I toss this bill on the floor of the House.  They called it disrespectable.  </p><p>      Well, I tell you it was disrespectable, it's taken a trillion dollars from our kids and grandkids and giving it out to people like A.  Corman (ph) and other liberal groups at America.  </p><p>      Disrespectful is spending a trillion dollars of money that our kinds and grandkids going to have to pay for in the dark of night behind closed doors without even giving the Americans more -- less than a day to actually read the bill.  Don't talk to me about disrespectful.  </p><p>      And all the way the new democratic Congress handled the stimulus and handled the omnibus tends to reminds me of what happened in the early 90s.  </p><p>      This was common practice.  We changed that.  Newt Gingrich, Vin Weber, Bob Walker, Dick Armey, we stood up against the democrat majority and we changed it.  We won.  </p><p>      We've got a new generation of leaders now in the same fight. People like Eric Cantor, Mike Finn, Mitch McConnell (ph), Paul Ryan.  </p><p>      We all know these names; you ought to get to know them.  Because they and other GOP performers are working with me to rebuild our party, rebuild our party on sound principles.  </p><p>      The principles that we believe of a smaller less costly and more accountable government.        Ronald Regan, when he as governor of California near the end of his term, wrote a letter to his friend who was a banker in Houston, Texas.  </p><p>      And I'm going to just read one paragraph of this letter to you, where he says, \"I agree with you about the two parties.  If the Republican Party is to look at all, it must know the side what it believes and stand on that and raise a banner to which all who believe can rally.  Failing this, I see no future for the party, if it listens to those who say we must become even more like our opponents in order to win elections.\"  </p><p>      I believe the people are telling that this won't work.  Let me tell you what I couldn't agree with Ronald Regan more.  </p><p>      I didn't come here.  I didn't come here to be a little less like my colleagues across the aisle.  </p><p>      I came here to promote economic freedom.  I came here to make sure that the opportunities that were available to all of us will in fact be available to our kids and grandkids.  </p><p>      And so to win in 2010, we've got to be the party of new solutions.  There are issues that Americans care about, but we have to build solutions on the principles in which we believe in.  </p><p>      We need to explore new ways of connecting with the grassroots and our potential supporters, and we must be prepared to compete everywhere in America.  </p><p>      And how would we do all of this?  As I said, we are not just going to be the party of no.  We're just not going to be the party of opposition.  </p><p>      We really are going to be the party of better solutions.  We are for better solutions rooted in the enduring conservative principles of freedom and security that have been associated with our parties since Lincoln.  </p><p>      New solutions doesn't mean new big government programs.  It means unleashing the power of freedom around our country in the lives of every single Americans.  </p><p>      And there is another issue where a better solution was already known, and that's the issue that we've known about for thousands of years and it's the issue of life.  </p><p>      Republicans have been known as the pro-life party, and I'm going to tell you the truth is the American people been on our side throughout this life and you will see Republicans as we get in to these appropriation bills, and if we see the freedom of choice act, I stand up and defend the sanctity of life.  </p><p>      My mother had us 12 of us one at a time, and I'm sure wasn't convenient for her to have us -- to have 12 of us, but I'm sure glad that she did.        And if we were to grow our movement, we have to learn how to use the new media, how to connect with more people around our -- the country.  And whether it's all of the events that the RNC is putting put together -- they have got a big tech summit coming.  All of the new tools available to -- for us to reach people in ways that we have never been able to reach them before.  </p><p>      Today, in booth 610, you stop by the Freedom Project.  My Political Action Committee that helps candidates all around the country who believe in what we need to believe in.  </p><p>      As I said, we also need to compete everywhere.  And when I say compete everywhere, New York 20 is probably the best example.  This is where Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed to the Senate.  It's an open race.  Jim Tedisco is the minority leader in the New York assembly. He is our candidate.  </p><p>      This election is on March 31st, and it is a giant opportunity for us to let America know that America is on our side.  And so, if you're looking for ways to get plugged in, go get plugged in.  </p><p>      So if you really want to know what we think and you want to help us understand what you think, stop by the Freedom Project booth today. </p><p>      freedomproject.org, you can go to our Web site.  We can tell you about the races that are coming up.  And you can find out over there what's going on in the House of Representatives and how Republicans are standing up and defending the values that we all believe in.  </p><p>      You know, I am really proud to be here.  I am doing something I never thought in my wildest dreams I'd ever have a chance to do.  But I had an opportunity growing up to play football in high school for a guy named Gerry Faust.  He went on to coach at Notre Dame, but I played at Moeller High School.  They won a lot of state football championships after I left, all right.  </p><p>      But I and my eight brothers went to Moeller, and I played for Coach Faust.  So we won a lot of games.  We won a lot of games not because we were bigger, not because we were stronger, not because we had more ability.  We won because we believed we were going to win. We won because we believed in ourselves.  </p><p>      And one of the things that I have been trying to drive into our colleagues and demonstrated by the stimulus bill is that when we stand on principle and we do what's right for America, the right things will happen.  And our members are getting their footing.  They do believe in themselves.  </p><p>      When I got into high school, I began to think more about what I learned from Coach Faust.  And it was really this.  There is nothing in this world that you can't accomplish, nothing that you can't succeed at, if you are willing to work hard enough and if you are willing to make the sacrifices that are necessary.  </p><p>      And I look back over my life and my career, that formula has worked pretty well.  And I think if you look back over your own life and your own career, you realize that that formula has worked for you as well.  </p><p>      I am a big believer in America that our best days are ahead, that our responsibility whether that's those of us elected or those of us that are here, our responsibility is to make sure that the opportunities that were available to us or available to our kids and our grandkids, and a lot of Americans don't believe that that is the case today.  Why do?  </p><p>      But we've got to make the decisions about the future for them. We've got to make tough decisions today that will ensure that they have a brighter future.  And I also want to say to all of you, \"This is a fight that we need to fight.  This is a fight that we need to win.  Please come and join the fight.\"  Thank you very much.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Man, if that didn't get you fired up, you're not waking.  You need some more coffee.  And I ought to get it done.  </p><p>      Matt Schlapp will introduce Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.  He has previously served as deputy assistant to the president and director of political affairs in the White House.  Prior to his appointment, Schlapp worked in the Bush-Cheney 2000 campaign where he served as regional political director; and in 1994, helped to led Kansas representative, Todd Tiahrt, from Kansas to the U.S. House of Representatives; one of the continuing rising bright stars in Kansas and in the Congress.  </p><p>      And he served as his Chief of Staff.  Schlapp is a member of the American Conservative Union board of directors.  Give him a big round of applause.  </p><p>      SCHLAPP:  Good morning, everyone.  I hope you've recovered from last night festivities, I feel pretty excited about where everything is.  And I am really honored to be standing with you here today to have the privilege to introduce our leader, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell.  </p><p>      We know what's at stake and we know now is the time when we really need experienced leadership.  We need to have a clear understanding of what we believe in, and we need to know how to make it happen.  Let's face it.  We need our Republican leaders to be tenacious and to be clever and to know what we have to get done.  </p><p>      When I think of Mitch McConnell taking the lead in the Senate, I feel a lot better, especially when I pose a few questions, a few questions about what's at stake.  And you've heard about these things from your speakers throughout the conference.  </p><p>      But are you ready to stop the largest tax increase in the history of the globe?  Are you ready to stand up and say that when they talk about capping carbon, whenever that is, and talk about cap-and-trade, which is a large tax increase, that we're going to stand up and say, \"This is not the right time.  This is never the right time.\"  </p><p>      Are you ready to stop the government from stepping in and mandating the wages of factories and mills and businesses all over the country, the government making those decisions in the form of what they call card check?  We need to stand up and say, \"This is never going to be the right time for that in America.\"  </p><p>      And if you are ready to put away America's credit card, if you're ready to put the checkbook up and away for a while, you need some adult supervision.  If you are ready to say no to the bailouts and the giveaways and rewarding and insuring failure, then I think you'll join with me in welcoming our next speaker who is not only the leader of our Republicans in the Senate, but he is our leader.  </p><p>      And without further ado, I want to give you a wonderful public servant, someone who is the longest-serving Senator in Kentucky history, someone who knows what we have to do.  He is the right man for the right time, Mitch McConnell.  </p><p>      MCCONNELL:  Thank you very much, Matt, and good morning, everyone.  It's good to be here.  </p><p>      I've been to a number of these CPAC conferences over the years, and this room is packed, and I can't tell you how excited I am to see all of you this morning.  </p><p>      We've had a great line up of speakers.  I just saw my friend, John Boehner, on the way out.  He is a great teammate here in Congress; John Cornyn, doing a wonderful job to the people of Texas. He is head of our National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is our campaign arm; Jim DeMint, one of the strongest advocates of conservative principles we have.  And I know that you're all as impressed as I am with the leadership of Dr. Tom Coburn.  </p><p>      And I want to thank David Keene for inviting me.  David has been one of the great thinkers and foot soldiers in the battle of ideas over the years.  He has been organizing this conference longer than most of you been alive.  And they get better every year.  </p><p>      In fact, some people call CPAC the conservative spring break. And David is, of course, the driving force.  He can be proud of that. And I know he is proud to be the father of a brave young soldier serving our nation on a second tour of duty in Iraq.  </p><p>      You know, the organizers of CPAC probably thought they had done a pretty good job when about 200 people showed up to hear a speech by a Republican governor from California named Ronald Reagan.  </p><p>      At that time, if you could have guessed that the man they have come to hear would do so very much to revive our nation's fortunes and to help secure the freedom of so many millions overseas and if you could have known how important CPAC would prove to be during that period and still is today.  </p><p>      CPAC has been the host of presidents, lawmakers and some of the nation's top opinion leaders.  And most importantly, it's been a training ground for young minds.  </p><p>      Of the record 8,500 registrants this year, 8500 registrants this year, more than half are college students, including I'm told a good number from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.        Compare that to the left's annual attempt to imitate CPAC, the so called kick Take Back America conference, which last year drew about a third as many people at CPAC.  What this proves, of course, is that conservatives are more fun and interesting than liberals.  </p><p>      I mean let's be honest.  Who wants to hang out with guys like Paul Krugman and Robert Wright when you can be with Roger Hollander (ph).  </p><p>      There are some in the media I'd like to thank that the conservative movement is on the way out, that it's devoid of energy and enthusiasm.  Well, they should come to CPAC.  I know it might be a disappointment to many of them, but they'd see what I see.  The conservative movement is alive and well.  </p><p>      But even if we put on a better confidence than our friends on the other side, they've got quite a bit more influence regretfully at the moment.  And they have big plans for the country.  </p><p>      And since all of you are on the frontlines, the volunteers, the organizers, the future opinion leaders who are carrying and will carry our message to a new generation.  </p><p>      This morning, I thought I would discuss some of things that I think we all need to do if you are going to stage a comeback and we must stage a comeback.  </p><p>      Now, the first step in my view is to remind ourselves where we are.  The political landscape is a lot different today than it was Kentuckians first send me to Washington.  </p><p> Imagine this, back then, the Republican governor of New Jersey had just been reelected with 70 percent of the vote.  Republicans had just taken over both legislative chambers in Connecticut.  And Republican candidate for president had just 49 of 50 states.  </p><p>      For republicans, 1984, the political compass didn't point in one direction.  Our principles, as we know, are universal, but back then it really showed, not so today.  </p><p>      As we look over the political landscape in 2009, we see that every single one of New England's 21 House members is a Democrat, that there isn't a single Republican senator representing tens of millions of American on the West Coast.  </p><p>      And that you can walk from Canada to Mexico, and from Montano to Maine, without ever leaving a state in this country that has a Democratic governor.  </p><p>      We are fast becoming a regional party, instead of national one, and there is name for regional party, it's called the minority party. Being in a minority party might be OK, if you are a college debating society.  On today's campuses it might even be fun in a counter- cultural sort of way, but I assure you it's not good for America when we are in the minority and none of us should be content to stay there.       I should note that looking at the list of events this weekend, it appears that no one at CPAC seems to least bit content about our current political standing or at least with relying on old methods for building the party and communicating our message to the broader public.  </p><p>      One of the reasons, so many of you are here is that somebody else told you, through base book or tweeter, that they were going.  </p><p>      And before you leave many will have heard about the best and latest strategies for raising funds, recruiting candidates or building coalitions for conservative causes among minority groups.  All of these things must be at the heart of our renewal.  </p><p>      But the instrument is only as good as the strategy.  And the strategy has to improve.  First and foremost, we need to search out those who have left our party, wherever they are, and give them a good reason to take a second look.  </p><p>      These people were Republican for a reason.  We need to remind them why.  As we do this we shouldn't fall for the false temptation of diluting our principles.  You don't expand your appeal by turning away from those who are the most loyal.  </p><p>      Instead you work harder to appeal to everybody else.  But this much is clear, our message isn't getting out to as many people as it should and that needs to change.  </p><p>      Second, we need to be concerned that the very wealthy and the very poor, the most and least educated, and a majority of minority voters have stopped paying attention to us.  </p><p>      We've made the case to Hispanic and African American voters that our policies are best suited to the aspirations of these communities, yet in the last election, Hispanic voters turned out in far greater numbers for the Democratic candidates.  And sadly, the party that was founded on the principle of racial equality attracted just 4 percent of the African-American vote in the last presidential election.  </p><p>      These are not reasons to abandon the effort.  They're reasons to work twice as hard.  And in this regard it's encouraging to say that CPAC is hosting a panel this year on the building of Hispanic coalitions.  This is a necessary work and it shouldn't be an uphill battle.  </p><p>      Ronald Reagan once said, Hispanic voters are Republicans, they just don't know it yet.  It's up to all of you to show Hispanics, in the search for the American dream, that the Republican Party is their home.  </p><p>      As we seek to reach...</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      MCCONNELL:  As we seek to reach old friends and find new ones, we need to expand our principles.  As conservative, we believe a big and encroaching government is a threat to liberty.  </p><p>      That greater liberty and freedom lead to greater prosperity, stronger families and communities; that workers should be allowed to keep more of what they earn; the judges should follow what the constitution says, not what they wanted to; and that human life is sacred.  </p><p>      I was disappointed that one of the first things the new administration did was to reverse the Mexico City Policy.  Americans do not want their tax dollars to be used promoting abortion either here or abroad.  </p><p>      Conservatives also believe that the government has no more solemn duty than to protect the people who established it.  And on this last point, let's be very clear about something else.  </p><p>      When it comes to Guantanamo, the new administration needs to show us more concerned with safety than with symbolism.  Many of those still detained are serious threats to the safety of our citizens, serious threats.  In fact, several of these terrorists still proudly proclaim their desire to kill more Americans.  </p><p>      Now the new attorney general visited Guantanamo earlier this week and returned with a glowing report.  He said; it was well run, that he is impressed with the people in charge and that every single person there has to be moved out of Guantanamo and it has to be shut down in less than a year.  </p><p>The Obama administration needs to answer a very simple question, where exactly do you expect to send these guys?  </p><p>      Well, they don't have an answer to that question.  they don't have an answer to that question, but I do...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      Those are all very good suggestions.  Well, let me tell you where they are to be.  They are to be right there in the jail in Guantanamo. </p><p>      You guys get it.  You don't take much prompting at all.  I mean, obviously, that's where they belong.  </p><p> Over the past few months, we've seen a big government mentality creep back into (inaudible) Capitol Hill.  It seems that failed big government solutions of the Carter era are back -- making a come back. </p><p>      And I assure you Republicans are going to do everything we can to make sure that the failed policies of the past stay where they belong. </p><p>      And let me tell you where they belong.  They belong right next to the bell bottoms and the leisure suits.  And no one doubts that government should have a role.  Indeed some challenges are so great or so urgent that they do require government to act.  </p><p>      Government can also play an important role in helping Americans meet 20 percent through challenges, through things like education reform, making healthcare more efficient and more affordable for everyone, and increasing energy exploration.  </p><p>      But in the face of new challenges, Democrats seem to be reverting to the old play book of blotted government, out of control spending, and higher and higher taxes to pay for all of it.  </p><p>      During the last administration they never passed up an opportunity to wring their hands about the spending that both parties approved to recover from a horrific terrorist attack, to fight two wars, and to rebuild after the single worse disaster in U.S. history.  </p><p>      But now the shoe is on the other foot.  And what have we seen? Well in just one month -- just one month, the Democrats have spent more than President Bush spent in seven years on the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina combined -- in one month.  </p><p>      If the overall spending has been jaw dropping, then the individual proposals have been even more troubling.  Everyone is familiar with the $1 trillion stimulus bill.  A bill that was supposed to be timely, temporary and targeted turned out to be none of the above.  </p><p>      Much of the spending won't go into affect for literally years, much of it is directed in wasteful projects, like government golf carts.  </p><p>      And much of the new government spending will be virtually impossible to cut off once the economy recovers.  Next week, we'll be voting on another spending bill, the Annual Appropriation Bill that covers spending through October.  </p><p>      We had a couple of days to look at what the Democrats are proposing and it looks a lot like the stimulus bill.  And that may be the stimulus bill wasn't just enough, because as it turns out the Appropriation Bill double dips by including money for 122 programs that were in the stimulus bill.  </p><p>      We hear a lot from Democrats these days about the needs for Americans to sacrifice for the good of the whole.  Yet, at a time when Americans are tightening their belts, Democrats in Washington were letting there's out a notch or two.  </p><p>      And they're not pushing back from the table yet.  When it comes to fiscal responsibility, Democrats are clearly telling Americans to do as they say, not as they do.  </p><p>      What does all this mean?  Well, one way to look at it is that for more than two centuries, Americans have embraced a simple principle that's at the heart of who we are as Americans.  </p><p>      The principle said that we work hard so our kids can have a better life and more opportunities than we had.  </p><p>      Well, it seems that this Congress wants to reverse the order.  It seems they want our children to work hard to pay the debt that we ran up, because we don't have the will to make the hard choices now.  </p><p>      The government first approach isn't unlimited to spending tax dollars.  It also extends to the Democrats approach to free speech.  </p><p>      On this issue, the constitution could not be clear.  The founders felt so strongly about government limitations on speech that they prohibited it in the very first amendment.  </p><p>      Yet today, some on the other side want to shut you up by enforcing limits on what's said on the airways.  They called it the fairness doctrine.  </p><p>      What they should call it is the, we can't compete with conservative talk radioactive 2009.  </p><p>      And let me tell you this, let me tell you this.  It will be an honor for Republicans to make sure that this unconstitutional proposal never becomes law.  </p><p>      Now that the government first approach is evident in Washington, it's effort to stifle the freedom of workers in this country to decide without coercion or intimidation whether they want to belong to a union.  </p><p>      Workers should be free to vote the way they want without a union boss or a company manager looking over their shoulder.  </p><p>      And Republicans will make sure that this union power grab never becomes law.  </p><p>      Look, pushing back these efforts to basically European as a mirror will not be easy.  </p><p>      It will require a committed effort on the part of everyone in this room.  It will require carrying our message to those who have left our party and to many more who are receptive to our message.  </p><p>      Meanwhile, Republicans and Congress will be vigilant about promoting their ideals, the ideals that made our nation great, and we will be relentless in proposing new solutions for the 21st century challenges we face.  </p><p>      Some people look at Republican losses and places like the north east and the west coast and say it's over in these places that we need to focus on our strongholds.  </p><p>      If that's not the kind of -- but that's not the kind of party I've signed up for and I bet you didn't either.  </p><p>      Looks, if conservative principles were right then they were right for everyone and for all times and in every state in America.  </p><p>      I know we can compete in those places without diluting our message, because I've seen it done.  </p><p>      I described earlier what most of the country look like in 1984. I didn't see what Kentucky look like in 1984.  Well, it didn't look like it does today and there's an important lesson here.  </p><p>      The year I was elected to the Senate, both senators in my state were Democrat the year I ran.  </p><p>      Of the seven congressional districts in our state, Republicans held only two.  </p><p>      Six years later, I was reelected and set in plan a motion -- a plan in place.  I knew that Kentuckians like most Americans were common sense conservatives.  </p><p>      Many of them had been registered Democrats still are, but on almost all the issues, they actually agreed with us.  </p><p>      My strategy was simple; first, find good candidates.  If they could win on their own, let them.  If they couldn't, surround them with people who could push them over the line.  It was hard work, but it paid off.  </p><p>      Just nine years after that, both U.S. Senators in Kentucky were Republicans.  Five of our six congressional seats were Republican and in the final count of state Senate flipped to a Republican control when a long time Democrat agreed to switch parties in my living room.  </p><p>      So, don't tell me we can't do this working together, we can. Over the years Kentuckians got comfortable -- not a bad slogan, it works better for us.  </p><p>      What happened to my state is over the years Kentuckians got comfortable with Republicans, and they are comfortable sending other Republicans to the state capital, to the nation's capital.  </p><p>      Believe me, it's amazing how much people will start to trust somebody with an R after their name, once he's been around for a little while, shown them what a good conservative government can be like and the difference it can make in their lives.  </p><p>      It happened in their commonwealth of Kentucky, and it happened last fall in New Orleans; it sent a Republican to Congress for the first time since 1891, a Republican who also happens to be the first Vietnamese American member of Congress in our history.  </p><p>      And with your hard work and creativity, it will happen in every other state and city in American in the months and years ahead.  </p><p>      So, my message to you is this.  Be proud of your principles.  Be daring in recruiting new candidates and never ever tire of fighting for the ideas that will ensure the safety and prosperity of this great country.  </p><p>      You are the soldiers.  You will do all these things.  You will get others to do them too, and before you know it, we'll have made our comeback.  </p><p>      Thank you very much.  God bless you all.  Good luck.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Are we all socialists now?  Let's talk a little bit about that.  </p><p>      Newsweek has declared it so, but who cares what they have to say. With this Congressmen Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Congressman Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and to moderate this panel, Matt Kibbe of FreedomWorks.  </p><p>      If you all will join us; Matt Kibbe, who he will be moderating this panel is the President, CEO of FreedomWorks, this position he has held for the last four years.  Previously, he was FreedomWorks executive vice president.  </p><p>      He manages Freedom Works overall operations and strategy including public policy development, grassroots operations and state and federal issue campaigns of the organization.  </p><p>      Prior to joining FreedomWorks, Matt served as chief of staff in House budget committee associate for U.S. Representative Dan Miller of Florida from 1993 to 1996.  </p><p>      He also has served as director of Federal Budget Policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  </p><p>      He has has written extensively on economics, public policy and politics.  His writings have appeared in outlets such as USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, Reason market process, and the journal of regulation and social cause.  </p><p>      Please give a big resounding welcome to our panel to talk about socialism.  </p><p>      KIBBE:  Fun fact of the day.  In 2008, General Motors lost $84 million a day, that's the bad news.  </p><p>      The good news is Congressman Barney Frank thinks he knows how to run a car company and no matter how many billions of dollars we pout into this failing businesses, he has got a better ideas.  So, it's all good.  </p><p>      This didn't have to be this way.  You'll recall that the troubled asset relief funds was used late last year to bailout GM and Chrysler for a purpose that no one intended it to be for.  </p><p>      We had an opportunity last year to kill that bill and to stop this lush fund that the Obama administration is now using, and I'm happy to say that our two elected officials that were sitting in the House of Representatives last fall during this note voted no not once, but twice against that bailout.  </p><p>      I'm going to go straight into the panelists.  Our first panelist is Representative Todd Tiahrt, who began serving the 4th District of Kansas in Congress in 1995.  </p><p>      He was appointed to the House for operations committee in 1997, and currently serves as Senior Republican on the appropriation sub committee on labor health, human services and education.        Congressman Tiahrt.  </p><p>      TIAHRT:  Thank you.  Good morning.  It's great to see you all here and I'm really pleased that you are so involved that you want to come here and find out what you can do to change America.  </p><p>      Last fall, we heard a lot about promises and we heard a lot about hope, because promises do build hope, but keeping promises build trust.  </p><p>      But do you trust this administration to do the right thing for your future?  You don't?  I don't either.  </p><p>      This week we passed $410 billion spending package that was about a 9 percent increase over the last year.  </p><p>      Last week, we passed $1.2 trillion in this stimulus bill.  Will you saw the president's budget was on your chair $7.37 trillion, how much is this, how much is a trillion dollars?  Has anybody written a check for a trillion dollars?  </p><p>      If you had started the business the day after Christ rose from the dead and made a million dollars that day and everyday until today, in other words a million dollars for 2,000 years, you would not yet have made a trillion dollars.  You'd only be about three-fourths the way there.  Think about that, million dollars a day for 2,000 years is a not a trillion dollars.  </p><p>      7.37 trillion, it's a lot of money.  And it's money that we don't have.  The government doesn't have it.  It's your money, and you don't have it either.  So, where is it going to come from?  </p><p>      Well, I am tired of the bailouts.  In fact, I filed legislation this week that says \"no more bailouts.\"  Last year should be known as the year of the bailout.  We bailed out Fannie Mae.  We bailed out Freddie Mac.  We bailed out Wall Street.  We bailed out the car dealers, although they call it bridge loans.  </p><p>      We had TARP 1, Troubled Asset Relief Program, the first round. We have another round glooming right now.  But the entities that received that $350 billion on September 2nd were worth $319 billion. Today, they are worth $86 billion, one-fourth their value after receiving $350 billion of money that we don't have.  We're going to have to go and borrow and get it and pay it back.  </p><p>      I mean can you imagine?  We're not here to a Coke machine and pulling out a dollar and sticking it in that Coke machine and pressing the button, and nothing comes out.  And so, you go back to your wallet and you start fishing around and you find another dollar.  And you stick it in there and you press the button and no more -- and another Coke doesn't come out.  How long would you repeat that process?  </p><p>      Well, in the 1930s, we borrowed money for government programs, and it did not work.  In the 1970s, we borrowed money for government programs to overcome our recession then, and it did not work.        In the 1990s, Japan tried it.  They borrowed money, started government programs to overcome their recession.  They call it the lost decade.  And their average per capita income went from second in the world to 10th in the world.  It did not work.  </p><p>      And now, we're doing it again.  We are sticking another dollar in the Coke machine and we expect a different result.  </p><p>      In July, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 11,378.  Today, it's 7,182.  It doesn't work.  </p><p>      So, what should we tell Congress?  What should we tell the elected members in your district?  No more bailouts.  Can I hear it? No more bailouts.  No more bailouts.  I am tired of it.  It doesn't work.  Let's not stick another dollar into the machine.  </p><p>      You know, what we ought to be doing is strengthening our economy. If you want to help the auto dealers, why don't we give each one of us a $20,000 tax cut to go buy an American made automobile?  You've got to buy a car, wouldn't you?  I would.  </p><p>      We have to stabilize the dollar, revise regulations so that it helps workers in businesses, reform mark-to-market rules because it's crushing our trust in our financial institutions, reduce our taxes and renew our access to capital.  </p><p>      I am going to end up, so we get time for some questions, by telling you, I want you to be determined to get this done.  </p><p>      There was a farmer back in the Midwest during the 30s named JW. And he wasn't a very big man.  Even though he was less than six foot tall, he probably weighed 135 pounds.  And he typically wore a hat, plaid shirt, bibblerolls (ph), boots and long-handle underwear.  </p><p>      He brought a brand new threshing machine.  And he went on to run it.  First time, he ran it, it got clogged up.  He went around the back and tried to pull out the chaff so that he could get the weed through the machine.  You know, being from Kansas, we are concerned about that.  </p><p>      And it got a hold of his -- one of those cogs got a hold of his shirt's sleeve and started pulling him in that machine.  And he held it back with his hand.  And pretty soon, it pulled him till there was nothing but his elbow holding him from getting wrapped up in that machine.  And then it was his back, and then all a sudden, he was free of that machine.  And he was standing there with nothing but his boots and his bibblerolls (ph) on.  </p><p>      And around the cog on that chain was going his plaid shirt and his long-handle underwear.  He was determined not to let that machine get in.  And I am glad he did, because JW was my grandfather.  And I wouldn't be here today if he hadn't done that.  </p><p>      That's how determined I am to stop the bailout and securing this economy around.  I want you to be just as determined.  Come to Kansas. Help me get elected to the Senate.  And we will stop the bailouts and secure this economy, secure your future.  </p><p>      CHAFFETZ:  I am Jason Chaffetz, and I got to tell you I am fired up, because I got to tell you a little bit about how I got here, because I am so concerned that this country is turning towards socialism.  </p><p>      I ran my campaign and ran against the 12-year incumbent.  I ran (ph) one of our own.  I ran against Mr. Cannon who is a nice gentleman.  But you know what he told me?  He was Mr. Conservative.  </p><p>      And I said, \"You know, what?  When you took office, the budget was 1.5 trillion.  Now it's $3.1 trillion.  There doesn't seem to be too much conservative about that now that we're $10 trillion in debt.\" </p><p>      So I wanted to do something about it.  I want to be a part of the solution, not just part of the problem.  I had no campaign staff.  I had no campaign office.  I refused to buy somebody a free meal.  </p><p>      I told the voters, if you want to participate with me, I am sorry, no free meals as far as I am concerned.  I refused to go into debt.  I argue that how you run campaign is very indicative of how you are going to be in office.  And I refused to go in debt.  </p><p>      Yes, I was outspent by $600,000, and I won by 20 points.  The point is the thing that I said at the very beginning of the campaign is that this is a campaign about who can do more with less.  </p><p>      I think how you run this country is an issue about who can do more with less.  As we go into 2010 and 2012, this is the argument that we need to make to the American people that the Republicans and their conservative values are the way to go forward in this country. It's about empowering people, not towards socialism.  </p><p>      When our president says only government can solve these problems, that scares the living daylights out of me.  It's empowering entrepreneurs.  It's empowering the American work force.  It's about empowering the individual to be the best that they can be.  </p><p>      The only way, the best way to solve our problem is not just spending more money.  We can no longer run this country on a credit card.  And that's where we are going.  </p><p>      Our President Obama said he wanted maximum openness and transparency.  He promised this that we would have five days to see a bill on the Internet before it was voted on.  The United States Congress unanimously, unanimously passed the resolution that said we'd have 48 hours to review a bill before we voted on it.  And yet, the single largest spending bill in the history of the United States, a $1 trillion-plus expenditure, had the light of day for just about 13 hours.  </p><p>      There is not one member of Congress that actually read that bill. And it passed.  13 hours, and nobody read it.  It had so many pages, 1,400 something pages.  They didn't even have time to put pages numbers on it.        Our president is the one that said that he wanted -- this is going to be jobs bill.  Nancy Pelosi said it was a jobs bill.  And yet, less than 1 percent are tax cuts for businesses.  And yet, we know 70 percent of our job  </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)  </p><p>      CHAFFETZ:  ... go to Facebook, go to Twitter on \"Jason in the House,\" find me.  I'd like to love to communicate with you.  And thank you.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  By the way, Congressman Chaffetz, one of the issues you ran on was against the bailout.  </p><p>      CHAFFETZ:  Yes.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  And it was unconventional, but not only good policy, but good politics.  </p><p>      CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.  Thank you.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Next, Congressman Scott Garrett, one of the good guys, as I like to say, who is recently sworn in to his fourth term in United States House of Representatives, representing New Jersey's Fifth Congressional District.  </p><p>      GARRETT:  Thank you.  Thank you, and good morning, everyone.  It is indeed a pleasure to be here with all of you, my colleagues here on the desk, good conservatives all.  It's good to be in the room with fellow likeminded conservative thinkers that we are right here in this room.  </p><p>      I think unfortunately, we're probably a minority in the city, as being if that's the case (ph).  But we are -- so we are not a minority nationally, because I honestly I do believe that this country is a right of center country and that we are the party and the people of the right ideas and the American people are behind us in that.  </p><p>      This panel right here, very briefly, has been talking about bailing out big business and ROE and all socialists now, and I heard you say before, no, no.  </p><p>      But we've certainly seen an unprecedented leap towards that over the last several years and of course with this new administration. And now with this budget that came out, it's a 10-year plan, I guess this is variation of the old Soviet five-year plan twice over.  </p><p>      And so, well, it's certainly going down that path.  And I would just give you two reasons why I think this is happening at the heart of this move towards socialism.  </p><p>      First is, that there isn't a -- Washington has adopted this mantra of trying to delay pain or prevent pain, whether it's a pain on Wall Street or pain for the people who made bad decisions in their housing market or pain to other people who made other bad decision. Government thinks that somehow or other they can intervene and actually prevent thing.  And obviously, you can't.  </p><p>      The second thing, what brings us to where we are right now, is the belief by some here in Washington that there is a small group of elites that here in the nation's capital knows better than the collective wisdom of the American public.  And we know that is not true.  </p><p>      Consider for a moment what this administration has either considered or already done or talks about dealing.  They've considered appointing a health czar and energy czar, a chief deployment czar, a climate change czar, a technology czar, a drug czar and an urban affairs czar.  </p><p>      So, it's not maybe that we are moving towards socialism.  Maybe we are all Bolsheviks now.  </p><p>      Now, before assessing upon, and Todd just talked about this before, looking forward for a second, let's see where we've been.  I am on financial services side.  I deal a lot with those issues over there.  </p><p>      We spent about $29 billion to bail out Bear Sterns; $400 billion, 200 and 200 to bail out the GSE's Fannie and Freddie; $153 billion for AIG, more to come; $308 billion to bail out Citigroup, more to come; $39 billion to bail out the auto manufacturers, more to come; and of course, $800 billion to bail out just about everybody else including the bad state governments.  </p><p>      Now, these numbers by the way don't include something else, its not talk about very much, and that's the Federal Reserve, who was an agency that needs to be certainly reigned in.  </p><p>      The Federal Reserve has increased its balance sheet from around $800 billion to $2.3 trillion.  And so, when you sit back for one second it's almost a mind numbing aspect when you consider these dollars -- unbelievable numbers.  </p><p>      And that's actually part of the game plan I think on the other sides, because they could say that -- numbers are so mind numbing that they can say while we spent $700 billion to bailout Wall Street, can we spent $600 billion to give Universal Healthcare or other such things.  So that's a direction that we're going.  </p><p>      And it's going to get worse, as Todd indicated, we have tax increases of $1.4 trillion, entitlement up by a $1 trillion, non defense by $9.3 billion.  At the end of day, I'll conclude on this.  </p><p>      It's really very thin, if you're a conservative politician in this town, somebody who believes in capitalism in the free markets and the fact that we have seen much lack of accountability at various levels, government, corporate and otherwise.  What's happening now is that there is a game in Washington of one -- every politician trying to updo or outdo the other politician.  </p><p>      To be able to say that Washington is able to once do -- pick through the winners will be through all these bailouts options (inaudible).  </p><p>      I'm not sure, at the end of the day, who the bailouts will benefit and who the winners will be.  I can just close on this and say I know who the losers are going to be and that's the tax payer and that's everyone who believes in liberty and freedom in this country.  </p><p>      So I just ask you to consider this, Barney Frank and who was the one of my...  </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)  </p><p>      ...Barney Frank and others have led the charge on the other side of the isle to say, what brought us to this point is deregulation and a lack of government spending and a lack government involvement.  </p><p>      What we must be all charged with doing is to tell the true story that we are here in this fiscal situation that we are in now because of too much government involvement, too much government interference, and the answer is to unleash the potential of private capital and simply getting the government out of the way.  </p><p>      God bless you for...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      UNKNOWN:  We are down -- we are down, there are last five minutes and I have the honor of introducing Fred Smith, who is a force of nature, one of the smartest guys I know and the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.  </p><p>      SMITH:  Like Hubert Humphrey, I talk very fast and I can hit gust of 250 words a minute, watch out OK.  </p><p>      No we're not all socialist, yet capitalism is really in crisis, I think we should all recognize that, in the bumper sticker story, as the congressmen just mentioned is easy.  </p><p>      Greedy capitalist operating in a Republican deregulated world ran amuck taking money and candy from babies and orphans.  </p><p>      Markets have failed, governments must succeed and certainly there were a lot of fools and frauds operating in the housing markets.  But why?  Why were there so many and why housing particularly?  </p><p>      Well there are many factors, but the major element is, as the congressmen just alluded to, is that we have moved in a way from the honest socialism of the past, where government actually owned things and was held responsible when they failed to the mixed economy dishonest socialism of today.  </p><p>      The left -- old left used to say when the new problem came up, new government agency is run by ourselves and we will spend money wisely.  </p><p>      Well they're not so sure about that.  First, social expenses are on one budget, secondly they are held accountable when they fail, and thirdly, they basically have to get appropriations each year, much better to leave in place a nominal private sector or create nominal private entities and then assign to them the responsibility of carrying out the political mandate you want to see.  </p><p>      In the housing area, we created Fannie and Freddie.  Now that requires at least a bill in this audience.  And we and others try to explain to people, what it meant to create an organization that had profit side -- of course, you can pay Franklin Raines any figure you wanted to do  </p><p>      They can operate like a cowboy in an open plain.  But if anything went wrong you and I were on the hook.  It had the moral hazard problem associated with government guarantees for whatever it did wrong.  </p><p>      We testified.  We were criticized.  We were doomers and gloomers. We were too negative.  They had a high yield  </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Bridgett Wagner of The Heritage Foundation.  </p><p>      WAGNER:  Thank you all.  It's great to be back at CPAC this year. The Heritage Foundation is the proud co-sponsor again now for many, many years of CPAC, we look forward to coming.  Now you guys have been here a day and I am sure you have all heard the news that the era of big government is back.  </p><p>The Obama administration's new 3.7 trillion, yes trillion with a \"T\" budget, includes vast new spending program on healthcare, climate change and welfare programs, financed by new taxes and cuts in our military spending.  </p><p>      It increases spending to the highest levels since the Second World War and explodes the deficit in to new uncharted territory, but that's all OK, because they have a plan to cut the deficit, with more taxes.  </p><p>      Even the Democrats in this morning's paper are saying it will be tough to find the votes for this budget.  We hope so.  </p><p>      And as if we didn't already know this mornings' Washington Post, helpfully reminded us that President Obama's agenda seeks to \"faster redistribution of wealth.\"  And it is likely to spark fierce political battles on an array of fronts from social spending, to energy spending, to healthcare and taxes.  </p><p>      Well, as one famous governor I am sure you all know my face, fierce political battles, you bet it.  </p><p>      Our next speaker is someone we can count on to be on the frontlines of those fights in Congress.  Tom Coburn is a real citizen legislator.  </p><p>      He's taken the term limit pledge and honored it by serving three terms in the House and returning to Oklahoma and running for the Senate.  </p><p>      And because he's pledged to serve only two terms there, he's a man on a mission.  He believes in reforming government programs and cutting waste, fraud and abuse in the central budget.  </p><p>      He also believes in expanding access and affordability to healthcare by putting the patients, not the government in charge.  And by as a practicing OBGYN, who's delivered more than 4,000 babies, his commitment to the sanctity of life is a commitment lived not just spoken.  </p><p>      Dr. Coburn is one of those rare politicians who's actually run a business and created jobs himself.  In the House, he has played an influential role in reforming welfare and other entitlement programs and trimming the budget, and in the Senate, he has championed transparency and accountability and that will pork in all its forms and flavors, both Democrats and Republicans.  </p><p>      His fight over the bridge to where there is (ph) more to educate the public on the spending practices of our elected officials, he has been a library of think-tank papers, or a lifetime of conferences and panel discussions, and that's coming from a think-tank worker myself.  </p><p>      His port busting activity is legendary and I should say not necessarily appreciated on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>      His office Web site, if you go to it, has a link for the Washington Waste of the Week.  But I checked it this morning and when you click through the site, it actually gives you a daily update on the Waste of the Day.  That's how bad it is.  </p><p>      And if you are a real port-buster, you can follow Tom Coburn and tweeter, and get a running commentary on the current legislation and debates in the Congress.  </p><p>      Dr. Coburn wrote an op-ed last year before the election, and said, \"For Republicans to regain their brand as the party of fiscal discipline, they would have to rejoin Americans in the real world of budget choices and priorities, and leave behind the fantasyland of borrowing without limits.\"  </p><p>      And he said, \"They must start the -- restart the permanent campaign against the government.  They should tear up the emergency credit card, the emergency spending credit card and refuse to accept any new spending, whatsoever, until Congress does its job of eliminating wasteful spending.\"  Something we haven't heard this new administration speak of at all.  </p><p>      Regaining their brand Senator Coburn said it was not about messaging, it was about action and courage and setting priorities.  </p><p>      And most of all he said that's about being willing to give up their political careers, so our grandkids don't have to grow up in a debtor's prison, or a world in which other nations can tell a weakened and bankrupt America where we can and can't defend liberty, pursue terrorists, or show compassion.        Ladies and gentlemen that sounds like change we can believe and help me welcome Tom Coburn of the great State of Oklahoma.  </p><p>      COBURN:  Good morning.  Thank you.  Have your seat.  Let me just give you a little upfront notice, I'm only going to speak about two or three minutes.  </p><p>      One of the things that don't happen in meetings like this is you don't get to ask enough questions.  </p><p>      So, if you're going to want to ask question to me, please line up the microphones now so that we don't hustle forward.  </p><p>      Look, we are in (inaudible) as we say in Oklahoma, but we're not in such (inaudible) that we can't get our way out of it.  </p><p>      And the way we get out of it is go back and understand what made this country great, and it's three basic principles.  Personal accountability, individual responsibility, and freedom that's greater than anywhere else in the world.  That's what we need, that's what we need to be about.  </p><p>      Our country was built on a heritage of sacrifice and what we have today and what we've had in recent years is a reversal of that trend.  </p><p>      What used to happen is one generation would sacrifice for the generation following us so that opportunity and advancement would take place.  We're operating just in the reverse of that now.  </p><p>      We are stealing from the next two -- I use to say the next generation, it's not true anymore.  </p><p>      We're now stealing from the next two generations and what we're stealing is a standard of living that has been 30 percent greater than anywhere else in the rest of the world, and we're about to steal that from the next two generations.  </p><p>      It does not have to be that way.  So, what has to change is the willingness to fight even when you know you are going to lose so you can make sure that the story is out there and the comparative choice that the American people can see.  </p><p>The Obama administration and Barack Obama will have a different philosophy.  And there is nothing wrong with them having that philosophy, but there is plenty wrong when we don't challenge it intellectually and we don't put forward the competing view that is based on what has made this country great and has made it greater than any civilized society in the history of the world.  </p><p>      So, courage is the number one character quality that we should be looking for in the leadership among the conservatives in this country. </p><p>      If you're not willing to fight even if you lose but still fight then you don't belong in this movement.  </p><p>      We need people of strong character with the courage to fight even if we loose.  </p><p>      And the reason is as we lose, we educate the American people between the choices and that's what has not happened in the last six to eight years in Congress.  </p><p>      So, if you want to ask questions, what I'd like you to do is -- I guess they are lined up, I can't see you for the lights.  So, we're going to go with that.  I want to leave you with one last little tidbit.  </p><p>      When I decided to run for the Senate, the first thousand dollar check I got was from a guy from San Francisco by the name of Milton Friedman.  </p><p>      And he said me one of his quotes, and he said, \"We don't do these things and say these things because we think we can ultimately persuade the other side in a debate.  What we say these things and do these things because when their ideas fail, we will be there at the ready at the willing with ideas that work,\" and he was right.  </p><p>      So, who goes first?  Where are we, right here.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  Senator, thank you for your leadership.  If we only had 51 senators like you, I wouldn't have to ask.  </p><p>      COBURN:  Well, we actually need 60.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  So, I'm a Goldwater Republican for 40 years.  I dreamed, dreamed of a conservative majority in Congress who would limit the growth of government.  </p><p>      Unfortunately, we tried that and so far, it hasn't worked.  And so, my question to you is, is it time for grassroots conservatives to start thinking about constitutional limits to the spending and borrowing and growth of government and those constitutional limits would have to be initiated from the states, since Congress will never do it themselves.  What do think of that strategy?  </p><p>      COBURN:  Well, first of all let me say that we haven't had a conservative majority in the U.S. Senate in sometime, and that's evident by what's passed in the Congress.  </p><p>      We're never going to do it on our own.  The grassroots affects though is to challenge.  Look, we let career (ph) politicians off easy.  </p><p>      When they are in their state, we need you there asking the hard questions and making them explain their positions of how they rationalize their position for the next election instead of rationalize a position against the constitution of the United States, and against the numerated power that it lies within it.  </p><p>      So, I think anything you want to do.  I think most important, that is the big hill to climb will be very, very difficult that I'm not sure we are climb.        Most important is to organize so that you are in front of those politicians when they are in front of the public where they get question and hit for the things that do not line up with a limited government, a pre-society, and a infringement on your right.  </p><p>      You know as the government grows your freedom declines and that's what the Obama budget is all about.  It's about taken your freedom away.  </p><p>      It's not about just growing the government because every time the government grows by 1/10th of 1 percent, you have less freedom.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  Dr. Coburn.  Actually...  </p><p>      COBURN:  Where are you?  </p><p>      QUESTION:  I am right here.  </p><p>      COBURN:  OK.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  I am waving my arms frantically.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I am sorry about that.  Go ahead.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  First of all, thank you very much for your service for smaller government conservatives like me.  There's not lot of us out there anymore, you give me hope and you've been my favorite senator for years.  That's great.  And I actually follow you Twitter.  You're awesome.  </p><p>      I was wondering, in prior years of Congress in the Senate, if you had just one particular favorite, or I guess at least favorite bit of report that, like our past and it's just sounded to you that even somebody would even try to get federal money for this.  </p><p>      If you just could share with us your, I guess favorite?  </p><p>      COBURN:  Oh! Gosh, I'm picking from millions.  Look, the bridge to nowhere was perfect.  </p><p>      We did that on purpose, because people could relate to that.  But what we should be is astounded and the all others that are there.  </p><p>      In this bill, we have a $2 million in this $410 billion bill is going to be in the Senate.  We got $2 million for pork odor next week, $2 million to study pork smell.</p><p>      You know, you might want to study why pigs smell bad, I would tell you why.  Look, where they live.  </p><p>      But the point is, is that a priority?  Think of -- the thing we need to relate to is look into the eyes of your children and your grand children and what do you see.  </p><p>      In this country you see hope.  You see expectation.  You see -- a look at the brighter future.  </p><p>      And as we continue to do what Congress is doing, we're dimming the glimmer in that eye of our children.  It's got to stop.  </p><p>      This grand experiment that has grown a society and a material increase in standard of living at 50 percent greater than every other society in the world for years, especially since post World War II.  </p><p>      When we have earmarks that are not priority for the country, I held assemble (ph) two week ago in Congress.  I borrowed it from a lady downstairs in the actual Senate chamber.  </p><p>      That's about how much common sense is there.  And no, I am not kidding.  And I want you to think about it.  </p><p>      Politicians are wonderful people, they care about this country whether they are Democrats or Republicans, but they lack a frame of reference to the real world.  They haven't signed at both sides of the paycheck.  </p><p>      They haven't tried to negotiate a contract with the union, they haven't try to pay the bills when their incoming money slowing down.  </p><p>      They haven't stayed up all night worried and how they are going to take care of their employees.  </p><p>      What they have is the easiest of all joys -- jobs, and that is the wonderful pleasure of spending somebody else's money.  </p><p>      And when you do that without any perspective, what you're going to do spend it wrongly.  </p><p>      Next question, last one I am told.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  Senator.  </p><p>      COBURN:  Yes sir.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  You are looking my way, thank you.  I think it's important we emphasize that the freedom that our all speakers are talking about is the freedom from our own government.  </p><p>      I don't think that message has been made clear.  Secondly...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I agree.  </p><p>      QUESTION:  ...all our speakers have said that we got to get the word out.  How do we do it in a nation that is plagued and even dated by a press with whom I have had experiences since 1964 when I got Barry Goldwater elected in my pressings.  </p><p>      But the press is biased, prejudiced, not very intelligent, and will not report our message.  </p><p>      How do we get around the press with its love affair with the present administration?        COBURN:  Well, I think you are starting to see that.  I mean that's one of the reasons that the fairness doctrine needs to be opposed.  Not only directly but indirectly as they are going to come through with licensing renewals and try to do it.  </p><p>      But you are starting to see it.  In the wonderful age of the Internet, it's going to make a big difference.  </p><p>      The daily newspaper is going to die, and the competitive channels on cable were starting to see some reflection at least there is two view points in this country today where there used to be only one.  </p><p>      You are also seeing the innovation with twitter and the e-mail messages, and text messages, and connections through that and YouTube and all these other things.  </p><p>      The Senate has this new YouTube Senate.hub where many of the senators are on there explaining the positions.  </p><p>      So, I think technology as usual is going to come back and benefit freedom from oppression of the government.  </p><p>      Let me just follow-up on your point.  I was this week I talked with some people in the natural gas industry and I ask them, are we ever going to see -- our fertilizer sources are made from natural gas and we've lost 85 percent of that industry offshore.  </p><p>      And I asked -- with process low, are we going to see the fertilizer industry to will come back.  They said, \"Absolutely not.\" And I said, well, why not.  </p><p>      They said because of the cost of regulation from the government is so onerous that no one would ever build a new fertilizer factory and hydrous ammonia or ammonium nitrate factory in this country of which if you think about, think about risk for us.  </p><p>      One of our greatest assets is our ability to produce agricultural products efficiently and massively, but we can't do that without fertilizer.  </p><p>      Now, we've -- through government regulation, we have setup a limitation on our ability to do that if in fact we ever gotten a pinch.  </p><p>      So, your concept, our founders believed, our freedom was inherent in us, not inherent in the government and the government should be the least to impose against that freedom.  </p><p>      Final point:  We only change America if all of us work to change it, and you can have great members of Congress, but if we are in the minority, we are not going to get it done.  </p><p>      We can be abolished for what you feel and know to be true about the foundational principles of this country.  </p><p>      And I know you -- I'm talking to the working crowd here.  But the way we change it is each year one of you get a 100, and if each one of those 100 get a 100, and each one of those 100 get a 100 and we win our country back again.  </p><p>      We take it back.  Thank you.  God bless you.  </p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-467150454</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KRW-K0K1-DY0W-42P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"19442\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2009 CQ Transcriptions, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>February 27, 2009 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Undefined</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National Republican Senatorial Committee</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CPAC Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>House of Representatives</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>CPAK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 333315</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 333319</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0JCMDA3OEMzRjM2NDJGRkIwQUFCNEFCMEM2QzFCRDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzIzQjhEQkQ0QkYxNDkzMEEyMjhGMEFBNUUxNTNERDk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

I am the executive director of Eagle Forum here in Washington, D.C., and it is a great honor this morning to introduce our speaker.    </p><p>      As any gentleman will tell, it takes a real patriot and a truly dedicated public servant to leave the great state of Texas to come to Washington, D.C.  Well, we've got some Texans in the House this morning.    </p><p>      That's especially true when you have a career that's as distinguished as Senator John Cornyn.  Before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002, he served as Texas District Court judge, a member of the Texas Supreme Court and Texas attorney general.    </p><p>      Senator Cornyn's colleagues have joked that he is the only person in the Senate to have practiced real law and that grounding in real life is more important than ever in these times where we're hearing about so many different brands and justice, social justice, economic justice, even environmental justice.    </p><p>      But as a seasoned jurist, Senator Cornyn knows that true justice does not have a political agenda.  And for that reason, he has taken unwavering stance, calling for strict constructionists' jurisprudence, and he strongly condemned the practice of judges legislating from the bench.    </p><p>      Throughout his career, Senator Cornyn has tirelessly advocated for open government and accountable government.  Or as he would put it, he started to bring some Texas sunshine to Washington and, boy, do we need that?    </p><p>      Part of these efforts include his instrumental role in passing the 2007 OPEN Government Act, which extensively reformed the Freedom of Information Act.    </p><p>      Senator Cornyn currently sits on the Senate finance judiciary and budget committees and serves as a top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's Immigration, Refugees and Border Security Subcommittee.    </p><p>      He also serves as the deputy -- on the Deputy Whip team after just one year in office and has been a member of the Republican Senate Leadership since 2006.  He has served as the vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.    </p><p>      And in November of 2008, his colleagues chose him to lead their National Republican Senatorial Committee where he continues to advocate for strong conservative principles of bolstering our national defense, repairing our broken immigration system and securing our borders and strengthening the economy by expanding job opportunities, keeping taxes low and reducing spending.    </p><p>      Senator Cornyn is a graduate of Trinity University and St.  Mary School of Law, both in Texas, and he earned the masters of law from the University of Virginia Law School.  I hope the Texas will forgive him that.   </p><p>      And as further evidence of his excellent judgment and something that we at Eagle Forum certainly appreciate, I understand that Senator Cornyn has a unique appreciation and often expresses his appreciation for conservative women.  He married one and raised two.    </p><p>      He has been married to his wife, Sandy, who is with him today for 29 years.  Please welcome Senator John Cornyn.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORNYN</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.  Ms. Colleen, thank you for that very nice introduction, and it's great to be with all of you here at CPAC.    </p><p>      I appreciate all of the conservatives coming from around the country to here to Washington, D.C., because the fact is, as you have heard learned that change has indeed come to Washington.  You can see it as you ride around the public transportation system where it's now more crowded under the bus than it is on the bus.    </p><p>      And you can see this as you stroll by the office of the IRS, where it's now, of course, patriotic to pay your taxes unless, of course, you are a member of Obama's cabinet.    </p><p>      And just this week, the Democrats have tried change the District of Columbia to the State of Columbia with its own representative in Congress and perhaps some day to senators too.    </p><p>      But one thing will never change.  The elites in Washington and the media will continue to betray conservatives as out of touch, out of fashion and out of luck.  But one thing hasn't changed:  they are wrong.    </p><p>      Following the thumping we got in the last election, the conservative movement is regrouping, reorganizing and renewing itself. And we're bringing forward new leaders to restore America's strength and prosperity and to defend our enduring values.    </p><p>      Conservatives have been in the wilderness before.  And as before, we can begin the work of picking ourself up and dusting ourself off right here at CPAC.    </p><p>      Back in 1977, after Democrats had taken control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Ron Reagan came to CPAC and reminded us that America's values had not changed.    </p><p>      He said, \"We who are proud to call ourselves conservative are not a minority of a minority party.  We are part of the great majority of Americans of both parties and of most independence as well.\"    </p><p>      Of course, four years later, Ronald Reagan returned to CPAC as president of the United States.  And soon after that, America began one of its longest periods of economic expansion.  And the Soviet Union was on its way to the ash heap of history.    </p><p>      As President Reagan was beginning his second term, I first ran for public office.  Back then, Texas was a one-party state, Democratic, and they held the stranglehold on virtually every office from the local level to the state level.  And perhaps unsurprisingly, corruption was a serious problem.    </p><p>      Well, despite the odds and a few of us decided to buck the system and run.  We ran as Republicans.  More importantly perhaps, we ran as reformers.  And we won.    </p><p>      Since then, I have had the honor to serve in all three branches of government, the judicial, the executive and now on the legislative branch as United States senator, representing my beloved Texas.  Make sure you give the Texans time to applause there.    </p><p>      As a conservative, I can't tell you that I won every battle I have engaged in.  As a conservative, I had to keep learning about how to apply our principles to new challenges.    </p><p>      But as a conservative, I found that when you stand on principle consistently, you can earn the public trust and even the respect of your adversaries and good things can happen.    </p><p>      I still believe good things can happen.  Following his primary defeat in 1976, Ronald Reagan was quoted in old Irish ballad, and said, \"I will lay me down and bleed a while.  Though I am wounded, I am not slain.  I will rise and fight again.\"    </p><p>      I believe as conservatives, we spend enough time bleeding.  And now, it's the time to get back in the battle and fight.  I do believe that we need to choose our battles wisely.    </p><p>      With a new president, with the kind of popularity new presidents tend to have, we need to pick those battles, but make no -- have no doubt about it.  It is a time to fight back.  And that's why I agree to take on a new job in addition to new six-year term as United States senator from Texas, as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.    </p><p>      In case you haven't noticed, the Republican caucus in the Senate is a lot smaller than it was just a few years ago.    </p><p>      In fact, in 2002, when I came to Washington representing Texas, we had 55 Republican senators.  And now, they are 41.  I think it's just obvious that if we don't turn this around, then soon we will be able to run out the Republican cloakroom and just meet on the elevator.    </p><p>      But you all understand what having 41 senators means.  It means we barely have enough votes to deny cloture in the Senate, and that is if all Republicans stick together.  No easy task depending on the issue.    </p><p>      Having 41 means that we have leverage to block bad legislation or perhaps more importantly to shape it, and to bring Democrats to the negotiating table, so we can actually improve it and send a bill to the president that he will and should sign.    </p><p>      Having 41 Republicans means that Harry Reid is only one vote away on each and every piece of legislation from having filibuster-proof majority, and having in effect what Nancy Pelosi has in the House.   </p><p>      So I think it's just obvious as a nose on our face, our mission is clear, we must win more Republican seats.  We must build a new majority.    </p><p>      And this is just as important.  In the process we must regain the trust and confidence of the American people.  Our first task is to support a good man, Norm Coleman in Minnesota,    </p><p>      Norm is a fantastic human being and he is a great leader that Minnesotans can be proud of.  The Democrats, of course, are up to their old tricks, up there in the land of 10,000 lakes, which has now become the land of 10,000 lawyers, as Al Franken continues to try to steal this election,    </p><p>      Now, I believe that Norm has a real shot at pulling this out in the recount litigation that's occurring right now.  I am still calling him \"old number 42.\"  We'll continue to support Norm, and I encourage you to do so as well, because we need him back,    </p><p>      Our second task is to be honest with ourselves about why we lost so many seats over these last two cycles.  And I believe it boils down to this.    </p><p>      We lost the trust of the American people.  A post-election survey sums it up.  When asked which party sticks to their principles more often, only 37 percent said Republicans, while 44 percent said the Democratic Party -- shocking to me,    </p><p>      The good news is our conservative principles weren't the problem. According to the same survey, 69 percent of the American people describe themselves as fiscal conservatives, while only 27 percent said they were liberals on issues like taxes and spending, and 53 percent describe themselves as social conservatives, Compared to 40 percent, who say they are liberals on issues like abortion or same sex marriage.    </p><p>      Democrats understand these numbers too, that's why they recruited a junior senator from Pennsylvania who is pro-life and a junior senator from New York who sleeps with guns under her bed,    </p><p>      And that's why Obama, quite skillfully, but deceptively promised tax cuts to 95 percent of the American people, and promised it so often that by the end of the presidential campaign, as amazing as it may sound, more voters thought he would be better bet on taxes than John McCain,    </p><p>      So the message to the voters seems pretty clear to me.  The American people will support us if we stick to our principles and they will abandon us if we don't.    </p><p>      Now to reclaim our party's identity, we must demonstrate our principles in respectful opposition.  Principle opposition means supporting the idea of the stimulus bill, if it's timely targeted and temporary, and opposing when it's not.    </p><p>      Principle opposition means supporting the administration, when it calls for greater transparency and accountability in government, and exposing their hypocrisy when their rhetoric doesn't match reality.    </p><p>      And principle opposition means reading the fine print on what the Democrats are actually doing and explaining the American people what they're trying to get away with.    </p><p>      One example of reading the fine print is drawing attention to what I call, \"Bailouts for Trial Lawyers,\" the Democrats moved through Congress recently.    </p><p>      Now, trial lawyers have give a big money to the Democrats and they seem to be getting their money's worth for their investment.    </p><p>      In the stimulus bill, in the so called Lilly Ledbetter Act, and another legislation moving through Congress, the Democrats are encouraging more litigation and creating more uncertainty in the workplace.    </p><p>      Now I think the last thing in our businesses and our job creators need is to worry about the threat of more litigation, but that's exactly what the democrats are trying to do.    </p><p>      We must read the fine print and help the American people understand what it means.  The simple truth is for millions of voters who voted for this president, they didn't think they were voting for bailouts for trial lawyers, but that's what they got.    </p><p>      Our task is to show them what's really going on here in Washington.  So that the furlong (ph) they are saying that's simply is not what we bargained for in this last election.    </p><p>      The fourth thing we need to do is to recruit good candidates to run as Republicans in 2010.  Right now, I see the landscape is pretty promising.  There are some incumbent seats in the U.S. Senate that we've got to defend, and open seats we must hold, like Ohio, Missouri and Florida.    </p><p>      And we may even have some unexpected opportunities in places like New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Arkansas, Colorado, Nevada, and yes, even California.    </p><p>      As somebody who has run in 14 contested elections, I'm a strong believer that getting the right candidate is 90 percent of the game, getting candidates who can communicate our principles, who will work hard, and will connect with the voters in their states.    </p><p>      And the National Republican Senatorial Committee, working with Michael Steele at the RNC, and my friend Pete Sessions over at the Congressional Committee -- we can offer good candidates the tools they need in order to win.    </p><p>      Now, not all of these candidates are going to be as conservative as I am on each and every issue, it's critical that we get candidates that will fit their states and who can get elected.    </p><p>      But I don't think there's any contradiction between being principled and pragmatic.  As I said, I'm one of -- I'm proud to be the fourth most conservative Republican in the United States Senate. Back in Texas, we call that mainstream.    </p><p>      But I have to tell you, I would rather have a Republican who votes with me 80 percent of the time than a liberal Democrat who will vote with me zero percent of the time.  You can sign me up on each and every occasion to support that Republican for election and to oppose that Democrat.    </p><p>      Now I understand that, occasionally, we get frustrated by the way some of my colleagues vote -- I do to.  But a circular firing squad is no solution to the problems our party finds itself to in right now.    </p><p>      Remember that Ronald Reagan was able to accomplish quite a lot with Republican caucus that was not as conservative as our caucus is even today, because, and this is important, because he had a Republican majority in United States Senate.    </p><p>      When today's Republican recapture the majority, we will be able to control the agenda.  As you know, the chairman of a committee determines what bills are called up in the committee.  The majority leader, when Mitch McConnell is majority leader then he will be able to determine which bills actually come to the floor of the Senate.    </p><p>      And we will be able to keep the worse liberal ideas off the floor entirely, and.  of course in doing so, to limit the chances of division among our rights.    </p><p>      So to be a national party we have to put blue and purple states into play.  We must be a national party and we must run candidates that can win in every region of the country.    </p><p>      Now this brings me to my final point.  I believe it's very important that we broaden our party and we increase our appeal among groups that share our values, conservative values, but they don't necessarily identify themselves as Republicans or maybe even identify themselves as conservatives.    </p><p>      Some of these people I'm talking about are independents.  Some are young people, who are just forming their own thoughts about how government should work.  Many are Hispanics, African-Americans or members of other ethnic and religious communities.    </p><p>      Reaching to these people doesn't mean apologizing for our principles or watering them down, it doesn't mean saying, yes, but less to every liberal initiative.    </p><p>      Above all it doesn't mean playing the game of identity politics that the Democrats seem to play so well.  Conservatives must resist the poisonous liberal notion that political convictions come from your race, or your class, rather than your head and your heart.    </p><p>      Reaching out does mean getting out there and leaving with these folks, and welcome them, and explaining to them, who we are and inviting them to join us.    </p><p>      But I believe the sage philosopher Woody Allen it about right. When he said that 80 percent of success in life is showing up then we need show up.  We need to show up not just at election time, but all the time.    </p><p>      Now, some of the way we can show up, but we can't do so when person is by embracing new technology.  And we have learnt from Obama how devastating that new technology can be when used against us.  But we've got to embrace it and used it ourselves.  And we have to use new networking compatibilities in order to reach out.    </p><p>      But some times -- and I think most of the time -- the best way to show up is just to sit down with people face to face, and treat them with the dignity that they deserve, and explain to them why we are conservatives, and why we believe conservative principles affirm that human dignity, and are the best way for us to exercise our freedoms here in America.    </p><p>      Let me give you just one example.  Last November, I won 36 percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas.  Now I wish that number were higher, I won't lie to you, but I'm proud that I got so high in a pretty tough election.    </p><p>      36 percent of the vote was actually 5 points higher than Senator McCain got nation wide among Hispanics and I had a Hispanic opponent.    </p><p>      Despite...    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORNYN</emphasis>:  Now, despite broad Hispanic support for the McCain- Kennedy immigration bill, as you know, I had major reservations about it and I ended up voting no.    </p><p>      But nevertheless, many Hispanics...    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORNYN</emphasis>:  Many Hispanics, Republicans, independents and Democrats ended up supporting me for one simple reason.    </p><p>      We took the time and effort to build relationships within the Hispanic community.    </p><p>      We demonstrated our respect by showing up and telling them both what we were doing and listening to their concerns in responding.    </p><p>      As we build these relationships, we discovered that something I think that is very important for all of us here at CPAC to understand, Hispanics are among the most conservative voters in the nation when it comes to their basic core values.    </p><p>      Hispanics own small businesses, so they respond to our economic message of lower taxes and sensible regulation.    </p><p>      Hispanics are social conservatives and believe in traditional marriage and the sanctity of human life.    </p><p>      And many Hispanics appreciate the facts that Republicans are the ones that stand up when it comes to trade and foreign policy.   </p><p>      We reject demigods like Hugo Chavez; we support reformers like President Calderon in Mexico, and President Reuben in Columbia.    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CORNYN</emphasis>:  And we work to expand trade throughout our hemisphere and around the globe, because we believe that creates jobs and opportunity right here at home.    </p><p>      The false liberal narrative that conservatives want to push people out of the movement is just that.  It's false.    </p><p>      The truth is our principles when correctly explained can draw people in.    </p><p>      Well, it's been a tough year for conservatives, there's no question about it.    </p><p>      As many people predicted here at CPAC, just a year ago, as our dear departed friend Tony Snow reminded us then when one act of the drama ends, another is sure to begin.    </p><p>      This is our moment Tony said, \"This is the time to do what we do best, turn adversity into strength.\"    </p><p>      We're not about to walk back from the high ideals and grand accomplishments that we've achieved over the last generation.    </p><p>      Ronald Reagan, Tony Snow, and so many others who have inspired us are gone, but their principles, the principles that inspired them are still with us because they lived for lives on.    </p><p>      We who gathered here at CPAC are some of those who will carry that conservative banner forward.    </p><p>      Others will join us from every state across the land, and together we can earn the support of the American people and create a new era of opportunity.    </p><p>      Thank you, very much and God bless you all.    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  Anybody have any doubt?  Right, Texans are awfully proud of Senator John Cornyn...    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  Every right today.  Introducing our next guest is Larry Hart.    </p><p>      He is the director of government relations for the American Conservative Union and brings 13 years of experience in the legislative and executive branches of the government.    </p><p>      In 1999, he formed Hartco Strategies, a media relations and political consulting firm whose clients ranged from members of Congress to non-profits, and he's been involved in politics at every level throughout his career.    </p><p>      He also served as the professional staff of the House science committee, on subcommittee on energy and environment for four years after a three-year stint at the Department of Energy, issues that are increasingly important to all of us.    </p><p>      Earlier, he was communications director for Congressman Dana Rohrabacher of California and, before that, the late Herb Bateman of Virginia.    </p><p>      He's also been active in efforts to rebuild Afghanistan, serving as pro-bono executive director of the Afghanistan-America Foundation, and in 2002, produced \"Life After War,\" a documentary focusing on NPR with war correspondent Sarah Chayes who left media to help rebuild a village near Kandahar.    </p><p>      He's also, for those who may stay up late and watch late night, was a child actor and for the all-night cable enthusiast you may see him occasionally on the \"The Real McCoys\" and \"The Donna Reed Show,\" making a rare, early morning appearance, Larry Hart.    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HART</emphasis>:  Good morning.  Good looking morning, crowd.  You know one of the hardest things in politics is to give up a safe seat in Congress to run for higher office.  Particularly, when it means taking on your parties establishment in a primary.    </p><p>      Many consider it, few do it.  But that's exactly what our next speaker did in 2004, when he gave up his House seat to run for the Senate.    </p><p>      Jim DeMint took on former South Carolina Governor David Beasley and a wealthy developer and finished second, well behind Beasley in the first round of the primary.    </p><p>      Undaunted, he persuade and won the run off easily, then went on to defeat the well known state education superintendent in the general election.    </p><p>      Well, taking on tough challenges as characterized Jim DeMint's Senate career as he is the leading opponent of the Senate, of the ultimate bipartisan sacred cow, the earmark.    </p><p>      For this...    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HART</emphasis>:  ...For this Bob Novak has called him a hero, and the Wall Street Journal Steve Moore, the taxpayers greatest allay for saving the taxpayers some $17 billion by his actions.    </p><p>      Now among some of his colleagues, there are few less laudatory labels.   </p><p>      But at the American Conservative Union, we call him a defender of liberty, for being the only senator to score 100 on our ratings for 2008.    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HART</emphasis>:  A year that's all Republicans barely divided on the best course of action.  Well for Jim DeMint, the course of action was clear.    </p><p>      Apply conservative principals to every vote you cast.    </p><p>      He defines it this way.  \"The greatness of a country is found in its people and its values, not in its governments.\"    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HART</emphasis>:  Jim DeMint is applying those principles to the chairmanship of the Senate's steering committee, which includes a majority of the Republican conference and works to advance conservative causes in the Senate.    </p><p>      Just yesterday, he forced the Senate to vote on his amendment to repudiate efforts to restore the so-called \"Fairness Doctrine.\"    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HART</emphasis>:  It carried overwhelmingly.    </p><p>      Pleasure to introduce Senator Jim DeMint.    </p><p>      (APPLUASE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEMINT</emphasis>:  I need you folks to get me out of bed every morning.  I think, I am ready to go fly.    </p><p>      I can't thank you enough.  You don't know how encouraging it is to those who of us who are in the fight for 9000 of you to come from all over the country to encourage us, and to create that critical mass that keeps us moving forward.    </p><p>      So, thank you for being here and thanks for getting up so early this morning to listen to us.    </p><p>      I am just back from the frontlines and we do have a few things to celebrate from yesterday.    </p><p>      And we are seeing with examples like this fairness doctrine that with the support of the American people through bloggers and radio talk shows, we can get people to speak out and to stand up and to call-in and e-mail, and we can change the minds of so many senators if we have people who are willing to stand up and fight.    </p><p>      Yesterday we did, force a vote.  They wouldn't allow this vote in the House, but I worked with members of the House.   </p><p>      We worked together to work the media, to get the message and the truth to the people that this potential of the fairness doctrine coming back was a real threat.    </p><p>      And they couldn't get a vote in the House for because the rules in the Senate, we could add it as an amendment to something else, and we forced the Democrats out of their closets and we got 87 votes to kill the fairness doctrine.    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEMINT</emphasis>:  And we need to take that same idea, that same process of engaging the American people to take back our government and to take back our country and I believe that we can and I believe in some ways it's starting right here this week with you folks converging on Washington to tell us that you are behind us.    </p><p>      Well, I am excited about yesterday, but I am actually more excited about something else.    </p><p>      My wife and I are on baby watch, grand baby watch actually.    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEMINT</emphasis>:  Now, we're expecting our second grandson tomorrow actually.    </p><p>      So, if you see me run off the stage, you see I got a better offer than you have here this morning.    </p><p>      When our first grandson, he's two-and-a-half years, his name is Jimbo (ph).  That's a good New England name, right?    </p><p>      You could tell on from south of the Mason-Dixon Line.    </p><p>      But I tell you this, and I could see some of you in the audience who are probably grandparents too and you know it's true when I say it that the only thing in life, it's not overrated, is being a grandparent.    </p><p>      But it does -- it gives you new perspective of what we are working for here, and it is about our children and grand children, and the future of the country, carrying on with so many who fought and died for.    </p><p>      It's a very real cause that we are here fighting for.    </p><p>      I really appreciate my good friend, John Cornyn.    </p><p>      He's not only part of our elected leadership and responsible for getting a Republicans elected to the Senate, but he is one of the conservative leaders that sits around a small table with me on the steering committee to help move our Republican conferences back towards conservative principles.    </p><p>      He's got a tough job.  He has got a tough job, and he is right.   </p><p>      We have to find ways to appeal to a larger number of American voters.  And I believe we can, but not by saying one thing and doing another, not by talking about limited government, while increasing the number of earmarks, expanding government, spending in debt to historic levels.    </p><p>      Before we earn the votes of Americans, we must re-earn the trust of the American people.    </p><p>      The current majority and the new administration has plans to expand the reach of government beyond anything that we've ever imagined.  Now is the time for conservatives to champion the ideas that have worked and will work for America.  Now is the time to show America the real differences between the parties.    </p><p>      The party politics and political labels will not win elections. We must stand for the principles that work, the principles that made America great and will make America great in the future.  I believe we can win the hearts and minds of many more Americans, but not by changing what we believe, not by abandoning our principles.    </p><p>      We can do it by convincing Hispanics, Sacraments (ph), blacks, white, poor, rich, by convincing all Americans that we are better off when we're free, that we will be more prosperous and more secure when we can make our own choices from many alternatives in all areas of our lives based on the things that we value as individuals and as families.    </p><p>      We will win the hearts and the votes of the American people when we convince them that freedom will work for them, their families and for every American.    </p><p>      When we stand together for Americans to make their own choices about where their children go to school and their way to choose their own doctors and to own a health plan, a health plan that they can afford and keep from job to job; when we fight for them to have a choice to own their own social security account and to keep a larger share of what they earn in their paychecks; when American see us fighting, not just talking, but fighting for their rights and freedom, then we will earn their trust and their votes.    </p><p>      Most Americans don't expect the government to give them the American dream.  But they do expect their elected officials to make sure that they have the opportunity to work for it and to earn it. That dream begins with individuals, not the government.    </p><p>      The American dream will be within reach for all our citizens, when our families, schools, churches, businesses and community organizations, all of our institutions work together to equip our citizens with the character, the skills and the capabilities to succeed in a free society.    </p><p>      When the majority of Americans are responsible for themselves and accountable for their own decisions, then we will have an America where freedom works.  When we can convince Americans that this freedom will work for them, that this freedom will give them and their children a better life, more prosperity and security, then we'll win the votes of the American people and then we will deserve the votes of the American people.  Thank you.    </p><p>      For years, I have been burdened by a growing concern that Americans have lost the knowledge and the understanding of what freedom is and how it works.  We still hear freedom mentioned in political speeches, but politicians of all stripes like pied pipers leading children to their demise have been successful in lowering Americans into more and more dependence on government.    </p><p>      We really shouldn't be surprised.  A nation that raises its children in government schools cannot expect its people to stand for the principles of freedom.    </p><p>      You know, I have spilled these burdens along with my heart and soul along to the pages of our new book that I have titled \"Saving Freedom\".  The subtitle is we can stop America slide into socialism. The publisher is V&amp;H International (ph).  The book will be introduced on July 4th under their new Fidelis (ph) imprint.    </p><p>      My goal with this book is to remind Americans of how important freedom has been to the success of our country and how important it is to our future, to explain how freedom works and how we can preserve and protect it.    </p><p>      I am convinced that neither Congress nor the president will save freedom.  In fact, unless Americans fight back, the federal government will continue to erode freedom in every area of our lives.  Only the American people, informed, engaged, activated and enraged can save our country now.    </p><p>      I believe Americans are sick of politics, as they should be.  I think they're thirsty for common sense solutions and the truth.  I am convinced that if we show them the right target, if we tell them how they can help save freedom, they will shoot.    </p><p>      Unfortunately, over 10 years, neither Republicans nor Democrats have offered very good choices.  It's time for that to change.    </p><p>      Earlier this week, we heard the world's best salesman of socialism address the nation.  I was right there right on the second row, and it sounded so good.  But like so much political doublespeak, President Obama's speech was designed to mislead the American people.    </p><p>      He is not confident in our people or in our free markets or our free institutions.  He believes in government, and most of his solutions are more government spending and new government programs. He spoke of lofty goals and how government was going to fix everything that is wrong with America.    </p><p>      I agree with many of his goals.  We need to fix our financial system, fix our schools and reform healthcare.  We need to make America more energy independent and cut wasteful programs and improve our nation's infrastructure.  We all agree on those things, but we can't accomplish these goals with more government programs and spending.   </p><p>      Think about it.  We just need America to think about it.  The president lambasted the greed and waste of banks and Wall Street, but what bank would make a loan to someone they knew couldn't pay it back unless the government was there to buy that loan.    </p><p>      You know, and what securities firm or asset managers on Wall Street would buy a bundle of these loans unless it came with a government guarantee.  It wouldn't happen.    </p><p>      Hey -- and why not buy these securities with borrowed money when the Federal Reserve offers an interest rates that's lower than the guaranteed return rate on the securities they guarantee.  Folks, this is just human nature of good common sense.  The free markets and deregulation did not wreck our credit markets in our economy; the government and political greed.    </p><p>      It is government and political greed or on the bulls eye of the target of what's wrong with our economy.  Stupid government policies have destroyed the accountability of the free markets.    </p><p>      The president presented some devastating statistics about education in America.  But who has been running our schools for the last 40 years?  It's really the federal government and our courts.  We spend more on education as a nation than any other government program, more per child than any other nation in the world.    </p><p>      Obama believes that more federal control and more spending is the answer.  But that is completely irrational.  In America, we'll know it if we tell them the truth.  I'll make my own guarantee.  If we let the $10,000 plus a year that we are now spending on every student in America, if we let that money follow the student to the school of their parents' choice, public or private, secular or religious, I will guarantee that within five years America will have the best schools in the world.    </p><p>      I worked all my life in the free markets, and I'll tell you what would happen.  The America -- America's investment in education would likely double with no additional government spending, as the private sector employed its best minds and technologies to produce a wide variety of learning environments designed to win market share by meeting the needs of a wide variety of students.    </p><p>      Teachers would have many different choices of jobs, and teaching would become a sought-after, well-paid profession.  Freedom will work in education if we will just let it.    </p><p>      The president also said that education begins at home.  But who has messed up the family structure in America?  The government welfare policies increased unwed mothers (ph) from 8 percent to 35 percent and climbing.  Government policies have severely damaged the family structure in America.  And now, the government wonders why children can't read when they get to school.    </p><p>      The president said we need to reform healthcare because it's too expensive and too many people are uninsured.  But is more government the answer?  I don't think so.  Once again, government has caused the problem.  We can't allow our government to control over half of the insurance market and still expect the private markets to work.    </p><p>      We can't help employers by health insurance, but then make it impossible, almost impossible, for individuals to find affordable policies for themselves.  And then we act surprised that millions of Americans don't have insurance.    </p><p>      We can't limit competition between health insurance companies by restricting Americans to only those policies they can get in their state, and still expect health insurance to be competitively priced.    </p><p>      I mean this is not rocket science.  Why not let freedom work in healthcare.  Every American could have a health insurance plan that they could afford, own and keep, without the government spending, one additional value (ph).    </p><p>      This could go on and on.  President Obama complained that America is dependent on foreign countries for 70 percent of our oil, but who has been restricting the drilling of oil?    </p><p>      Who has been restricting the development of clean burning, domestically produced, natural gas?  Who has stopped the development of no emission, nuclear energy?  Its been our government.  Government is the problem.    </p><p>      You know Democrats complained about American manufacturing jobs going overseas, but who loads the highest corporate tax rates onto the backs of American businesses?  And who holds businesses hostage with the threat of more lawsuits than any other country in the world?  And who strangles American business with regulations?  Folks, we're not letting freedom work, but we are blaming freedom for the problems.    </p><p>      President and the Democratic Congress are blaming America's problems on free markets and free people, but the truth is beginning to hit the American people, right in the face.    </p><p>      The government is not the answer to our problems, the government is the problem.  Freedom is a powerful, but delicate and endangered thing.    </p><p>      When Ronald Reagan said freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp, when he said that the entire federal budget was one-tenth the size of the stimulus package that we passed two weeks ago.    </p><p>      We need to think about where we're going.  Government is out of control, and freedom is the only solution.  In American freedom is built on the principles and values that are derived from Judeo- Christian religious convictions.    </p><p>      If we allow this government to continue to purge religion and faith, religious values and the principles that are derived from our culture, we will loose our freedom.    </p><p>      Freedom sits on the foundations of the values and principles that are derived from faith.  But it's built with the support beams of constitutionally limited government in the rule of law.   </p><p>      If we allow Congress and the president to continue to ignore the constitution, and compromise the rule of law, we will loose our freedom.    </p><p>      Freedom solutions will work in education, healthcare, energy, housing and all areas of our economy and culture.  Government has never or will it ever, solve our problems.    </p><p>      The good news is that Americans have gotten a glimpse of the big government plans of Obama and the Democrats and millions are ready to stand up, speak out, and yes, even take to the streets to stop America's slide into socialism.    </p><p>      Now, we're looking for leaders, and everyone seems to be asking, who will be the new leaders of the Republican Party in the conservative movement.    </p><p>      First, I hope these two groups will be one and the same in the future.    </p><p>      Let's not rush to pick leaders based on, who is the best speaker, the best personality, the best politician, or the best looking.  That would eliminate me right away.    </p><p>      But just give me a teleprompter.  I don't know these were here this morning.  If you could just see me with a teleprompter you would (inaudible).    </p><p>      We need to look for those men and women, who are willing to stand and fight for the principles of freedom.  We will know that we have found our new leaders, when we see people with character and conviction, stand with courage for the principles of freedom.    </p><p>      When we see American's, black and white, men and women, immigrants, poor, old, young, Republicans, independents, even some democrats, when we see these American's inspired and responding to those among us, who are standing for freedom, we will know that we have found our leaders.    </p><p>      Thank you, for standing for freedom, with courage and conviction for the cause of freedom.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  Thank you, senator.  Isn't it clear that those on the left, you say Republicans are just obstructionist, the conservatives are offering no alternatives, clearly, they are just not listening. And maybe they need to listen lot more carefully.    </p><p>      Grover Norquist is our next introducer.  He is the president of Americans for Tax Reform, a grass roots tax payer group, founded at the request of President Reagan in 1986.  I just refer to him as The President and still do.    </p><p>ATR asked our candidates to sign the tax payer protection pledge, committing themselves in writing, not just in words, to oppose all tax increases.   </p><p>      He serves on boards of National Rifle Association.  The American Conservative Union and serves as president of the American Society of Competitiveness.    </p><p>      He also rocked the house, the story of 1994 Republican sweep of Congress and most recently has written Leave Us Alone:  Getting the Government's Hands Off Our Money, Our Guns, Our Lives.    </p><p>      He also chairs the Wednesday meeting in Washington DC, were over 120, to 150 activists gather each week to promote conservative ideas and a pro-freedom coalition.    </p><p>      Please welcome Grover Norquist.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NORQUIST</emphasis>:  Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to introduce John Boehner.  Who is the gentleman, who when he came to Congress from Ohio, told his constituents, if you want somebody to go to Washington and steel money and bring it back to the district, what they call earmarks, you want to vote for somebody else.    </p><p>      And in his time in Washington, he has kept that commitment, and then a leader to keep spending down, not one of the shoplifters that thought their job was to bring goodies back to their friends.    </p><p>      He is one of the gang of seven.  The original effort by Republicans to reform the way Congress worked, and moved and he became a leader in the effort for the contract with America, which helped us Republican control of the House and Senate.    </p><p>      But now he is the Republican leader in the house.  And he just did a very amazing thing.  It's the first step on our road back to a Republican and conservative House of Representatives, and that was to hold every single Republican to say no to Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid spending...    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NORQUIST</emphasis>:  That was step one on the road to a majority.  Imagine the billions and tens of billions of dollars and your tax dollars that were dangled in front of people asking to please be bipartisan, set your principles aside, and give us the votes and every hour under Congressman Boehner's leadership said no.    </p><p>      Please write down and remember a couple of numbers.  We need, in 2010 to win 40 House seats, presently held by Democrats.  Some masquerading as conservatives, but everyone of them -- Nancy Pelosi, liberal in their voting and that are fact.    </p><p>      We need to pick up 40 seats after the March 31, election in New York.  20, we will need to 39 seats.  So as Alfred Hitchcock would say, there are 39 steps to a Republican majority.    </p><p>      One other number, there are 46 Democrat members in Congress today, sitting in seats that voted in '84 and '88 for Bush and McCain at the presidential levels.   </p><p>      Those were not exactly our strongest presidential years, but 46 Ds sitting seats that actually want to elect Republicans.  It is my honor to introduce to you leader Boehner, the next speaker of the House of Representatives.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOEHNER</emphasis>:  Good morning to all of you.  On the way here this morning, I remember that my first visit to CPAC occurred 24 years ago in 1985, when I was brand new state representative.    </p><p>      Some of my friends from my state rep district suggested I come to this gathering.  And I came here in 1985, 1986, and really, I came here to learn more about our movement.    </p><p>      And is see some of my friends here KD (ph) and Dave Kern, couple of constituents, who have taken upon themselves back in the late 80s and early 90s to make sure that I never wavered from the truth.  Dave, KD (ph), thank you very much for your help.    </p><p>      Not many of you know a whole lot about me, but I come from Cincinnati.  I grew up there.  I have 11 brothers and sisters, and my dad owned a bar, all right.    </p><p>      Now, there is a lot that I can say about that, the skills I learned growing up or the skills I need to my job today.  Growing up in a big family, you have to learn get along with each other, get things done together, gets thing done as a family.    </p><p>      I grew up work at a bar, mopping the floors, waiting tables, attending bar and there you learned to deal with every character that walks in the door.  Trust me.  I need all of these skills to do my job today.    </p><p>      But I was lucky enough to have parents who cared.  And parents who insisted that we get a decent education.  I was lucky enough to begin my own business, and to grow my business.  And along the way, I got involved in my neighborhood homeowners associations and ended up in the United States Congress.    </p><p>      This too could happen to you.  But I got involved in this for one big reason that the opportunities that were available to me and the opportunities that were available to all of you, I thought were slowly disappearing and I thought someone from the real world would (ph) take more active role in their government.    </p><p>      Now that's what got me involved and that that's what keeps me involved.    </p><p>      I didn't come into Congress because I wanted to be a congressman. I came here to do something to preserve the opportunities that were available to us so that were available to our kids and theirs.    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOEHNER</emphasis>:  But that's freedom that we enjoyed, economic freedom is really under assault today.   </p><p>      And I think the stimulus was the opening of salvo.  It was supposed to be focused on jobs, jobs, jobs and it turned into nothing more than spending, spending, and more spending.    </p><p>      But when you put this in the hands of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reed, it obviously became a gravy train for leftwing pork, and I knew something was wrong when I read the first version of the bill, and it had the word contraceptives in it, $230 million.    </p><p>      And I brought up to everyone's attention and guess what they have finally decided to take it out, but...    </p><p>      Sitting in my desk right when this outline came out before -- long before they have resolved the bill, and I was looking at this outline eating my lunch, getting ready up to the press gallery and talk a little bit about it, and all I could think of was, \"oh my god.\"   </p><p>      When you look at all of the spending that was in there, for every leftwing idea there whatever it was, you began to realize that we were on the wrong path.    </p><p>      And while they got the contraceptive language out there, it's still has money in there for (inaudible) just watch, because as this bill starts to get implemented, I will assure you that you will know how every dime of this bill is going to be spent.    </p><p>      And now this bill set the stage for government controlled healthcare, began to dismantle the welfare reforms for 1997 by relaxing the work requirements.    </p><p>      And most of the tax relief was really welfare, tax relief to people who don't pay income taxes.    </p><p>      And how do you make the economy better by encouraging people to work less and making them more dependant on our government?    </p><p>      There was one Congressman though -- one Congressman who vote to president and they asked him, well, why did you vote president.    </p><p>      And he said, \"Well, because that's how President Obama used to vote when he had the vote on lousy bills.\"    </p><p>      Well, let me tell you that, there wasn't one Republican who voted to president, there wasn't one Republican who voted yes, we all voted no.    </p><p>      The liberals and the mainstream media, they just didn't know how to deal with it.    </p><p>      First they said, we (inaudible) no, and then when I pointed out, well no, they have an alternative, an alternative that would have cost half as much as the Democrats and would have created twice as many jobs in America.    </p><p>      Then they said, well, they are committing political suicide.   </p><p>      But Nelson and I (ph) pointed out that some 53 percent of Americans think the stimulus will either won't help or will hurt our economy.    </p><p>      But that wasn't the end of what's happened here in the first five weeks of the Obama administration.    </p><p>      This spending barrage was just beginning.  This week, the House passed an omnibus appropriations bill, the largest spending bill that we passed since the stimulus, $410 billion, $30 billion over budget, the largest increase in the domestic discretionary spending since (inaudible) years, and a bill that had 9,000 earmarks in it.    </p><p>      And as Webber pointed out, \"I've never asked for an earmark, I'll never ask for one.  My job wasn't to come to Washington and steal from public treasury for my districts.  It was to stand up for my district and to fight for freedom for the American people.\"    </p><p>      And while they had money in this bill for blueberry research on nature center, a whole bunch of other beautification projects, they couldn't find money to continue the D.C. scholarship program to help poor kids get out of some of the most rotten schools in America and give them a chance at a decent education.    </p><p>      One of the issues that I hope put into law of some seven or eight years ago, but they've made it clear they're going to kill this program, that's how bad this is.    </p><p>      One day after President Obama gave the speech about hope, Nancy Pelosi passed a bill that takes away hope for thousands of American kids here in D.C.  They have a chance at this decent education.    </p><p>      But that wasn't enough.  The stimulus, the omnibus, and then yesterday what happens, the budget comes out.    </p><p>      This budget is nothing more than a job killer, plain and simple.    </p><p>      It erases taxes on all Americans in the midst of a recession.    </p><p>      It relies on tax increases on small business, family firms, middle class families, retirees, charities, every American with a 401 (k) and yes, any American who dares to flip on a light switch and all. They are all going to pay higher taxes under this budget.    </p><p>      The government tried to raise taxes in a recession once before.    </p><p>      It was the Hoover administration, we all know what happened.    </p><p>      But this budget also includes the so-called cap-and-trade system for global climate change, which is a French term for pink slip or as what I'd like to call it another code word for a carbon tax in America.    </p><p>      American jobs are going to be under threat and if we do this with our industrialized countries working together with us we will ship millions of American jobs overseas.   </p><p>      And I can say that I my demo -- Republican colleagues and all democrat members of the Congress are never going to stand to see taxes raised on Americans to the tune of $1.3 trillion and they ship millions of American jobs overseas, it's just not going to happen.    </p><p>      Well, the stimulus, the omnibus, the budget, it's all one big down payment on a new American socialist experiment.    </p><p>      They're laying the groundwork for everything in these bills, expanded welfare, government run healthcare, green jobs, the works.    </p><p>      They even want to pay irresponsible neighbors mortgage off for them.    </p><p>      All this is being done though on the backs of our kids and our grand kids, and all of these bills seek to replace our economic freedom of what their wins and mandates of politicians and bureaucrats.    </p><p>      Listen, I took to meet from liberals for my speech on the House floor opposing the stimulus.    </p><p>      They didn't like it when I pointed out, but no member of the Congress had read the nearly 11,000 -- 1,100 pages in this bill.    </p><p>      And they didn't really didn't like it when I toss this bill on the floor of the House.  They called it disrespectable.    </p><p>      Well, I tell you it was disrespectable, it's taken a trillion dollars from our kids and grandkids and giving it out to people like A.  Corman (ph) and other liberal groups at America.    </p><p>      Disrespectful is spending a trillion dollars of money that our kinds and grandkids going to have to pay for in the dark of night behind closed doors without even giving the Americans more -- less than a day to actually read the bill.  Don't talk to me about disrespectful.    </p><p>      And all the way the new democratic Congress handled the stimulus and handled the omnibus tends to reminds me of what happened in the early 90s.    </p><p>      This was common practice.  We changed that.  Newt Gingrich, Vin Weber, Bob Walker, Dick Armey, we stood up against the democrat majority and we changed it.  We won.    </p><p>      We've got a new generation of leaders now in the same fight. People like Eric Cantor, Mike Finn, Mitch McConnell (ph), Paul Ryan.    </p><p>      We all know these names; you ought to get to know them.  Because they and other GOP performers are working with me to rebuild our party, rebuild our party on sound principles.    </p><p>      The principles that we believe of a smaller less costly and more accountable government.   </p><p>      Ronald Regan, when he as governor of California near the end of his term, wrote a letter to his friend who was a banker in Houston, Texas.    </p><p>      And I'm going to just read one paragraph of this letter to you, where he says, \"I agree with you about the two parties.  If the Republican Party is to look at all, it must know the side what it believes and stand on that and raise a banner to which all who believe can rally.  Failing this, I see no future for the party, if it listens to those who say we must become even more like our opponents in order to win elections.\"    </p><p>      I believe the people are telling that this won't work.  Let me tell you what I couldn't agree with Ronald Regan more.    </p><p>      I didn't come here.  I didn't come here to be a little less like my colleagues across the aisle.    </p><p>      I came here to promote economic freedom.  I came here to make sure that the opportunities that were available to all of us will in fact be available to our kids and grandkids.    </p><p>      And so to win in 2010, we've got to be the party of new solutions.  There are issues that Americans care about, but we have to build solutions on the principles in which we believe in.    </p><p>      We need to explore new ways of connecting with the grassroots and our potential supporters, and we must be prepared to compete everywhere in America.    </p><p>      And how would we do all of this?  As I said, we are not just going to be the party of no.  We're just not going to be the party of opposition.    </p><p>      We really are going to be the party of better solutions.  We are for better solutions rooted in the enduring conservative principles of freedom and security that have been associated with our parties since Lincoln.    </p><p>      New solutions doesn't mean new big government programs.  It means unleashing the power of freedom around our country in the lives of every single Americans.    </p><p>      And there is another issue where a better solution was already known, and that's the issue that we've known about for thousands of years and it's the issue of life.    </p><p>      Republicans have been known as the pro-life party, and I'm going to tell you the truth is the American people been on our side throughout this life and you will see Republicans as we get in to these appropriation bills, and if we see the freedom of choice act, I stand up and defend the sanctity of life.    </p><p>      My mother had us 12 of us one at a time, and I'm sure wasn't convenient for her to have us -- to have 12 of us, but I'm sure glad that she did.   </p><p>      And if we were to grow our movement, we have to learn how to use the new media, how to connect with more people around our -- the country.  And whether it's all of the events that the RNC is putting put together -- they have got a big tech summit coming.  All of the new tools available to -- for us to reach people in ways that we have never been able to reach them before.    </p><p>      Today, in booth 610, you stop by the Freedom Project.  My Political Action Committee that helps candidates all around the country who believe in what we need to believe in.    </p><p>      As I said, we also need to compete everywhere.  And when I say compete everywhere, New York 20 is probably the best example.  This is where Kirsten Gillibrand was appointed to the Senate.  It's an open race.  Jim Tedisco is the minority leader in the New Yorkassembly. He is our candidate.    </p><p>      This election is on March 31st, and it is a giant opportunity for us to let America know that America is on our side.  And so, if you're looking for ways to get plugged in, go get plugged in.    </p><p>      So if you really want to know what we think and you want to help us understand what you think, stop by the Freedom Project booth today.   </p><p>      freedomproject.org, you can go to our Web site.  We can tell you about the races that are coming up.  And you can find out over there what's going on in the House of Representatives and how Republicans are standing up and defending the values that we all believe in.    </p><p>      You know, I am really proud to be here.  I am doing something I never thought in my wildest dreams I'd ever have a chance to do.  But I had an opportunity growing up to play football in high school for a guy named Gerry Faust.  He went on to coach at Notre Dame, but I played at Moeller High School.  They won a lot of state football championships after I left, all right.    </p><p>      But I and my eight brothers went to Moeller, and I played for Coach Faust.  So we won a lot of games.  We won a lot of games not because we were bigger, not because we were stronger, not because we had more ability.  We won because we believed we were going to win. We won because we believed in ourselves.    </p><p>      And one of the things that I have been trying to drive into our colleagues and demonstrated by the stimulus bill is that when we stand on principle and we do what's right for America, the right things will happen.  And our members are getting their footing.  They do believe in themselves.    </p><p>      When I got into high school, I began to think more about what I learned from Coach Faust.  And it was really this.  There is nothing in this world that you can't accomplish, nothing that you can't succeed at, if you are willing to work hard enough and if you are willing to make the sacrifices that are necessary.    </p><p>      And I look back over my life and my career, that formula has worked pretty well.  And I think if you look back over your own life and your own career, you realize that that formula has worked for you as well.    </p><p>      I am a big believer in America that our best days are ahead, that our responsibility whether that's those of us elected or those of us that are here, our responsibility is to make sure that the opportunities that were available to us or available to our kids and our grandkids, and a lot of Americans don't believe that that is the case today.  Why do?    </p><p>      But we've got to make the decisions about the future for them. We've got to make tough decisions today that will ensure that they have a brighter future.  And I also want to say to all of you, \"This is a fight that we need to fight.  This is a fight that we need to win.  Please come and join the fight.\"  Thank you very much.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  Man, if that didn't get you fired up, you're not waking.  You need some more coffee.  And I ought to get it done.    </p><p>      Matt Schlapp will introduce Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.  He has previously served as deputy assistant to the president and director of political affairs in the White House.  Prior to his appointment, Schlapp worked in the Bush-Cheney 2000 campaign where he served as regional political director; and in 1994, helped to led Kansas representative, Todd Tiahrt, from Kansas to the U.S. House of Representatives; one of the continuing rising bright stars in Kansas and in the Congress.    </p><p>      And he served as his Chief of Staff.  Schlapp is a member of the American Conservative Union board of directors.  Give him a big round of applause.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHLAPP</emphasis>:  Good morning, everyone.  I hope you've recovered from last night festivities, I feel pretty excited about where everything is.  And I am really honored to be standing with you here today to have the privilege to introduce our leader, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell.    </p><p>      We know what's at stake and we know now is the time when we really need experienced leadership.  We need to have a clear understanding of what we believe in, and we need to know how to make it happen.  Let's face it.  We need our Republican leaders to be tenacious and to be clever and to know what we have to get done.    </p><p>      When I think of Mitch McConnell taking the lead in the Senate, I feel a lot better, especially when I pose a few questions, a few questions about what's at stake.  And you've heard about these things from your speakers throughout the conference.    </p><p>      But are you ready to stop the largest tax increase in the history of the globe?  Are you ready to stand up and say that when they talk about capping carbon, whenever that is, and talk about cap-and-trade, which is a large tax increase, that we're going to stand up and say, \"This is not the right time.  This is never the right time.\"    </p><p>      Are you ready to stop the government from stepping in and mandating the wages of factories and mills and businesses all over the country, the government making those decisions in the form of what they call card check?  We need to stand up and say, \"This is never going to be the right time for that in America.\"    </p><p>      And if you are ready to put away America's credit card, if you're ready to put the checkbook up and away for a while, you need some adult supervision.  If you are ready to say no to the bailouts and the giveaways and rewarding and insuring failure, then I think you'll join with me in welcoming our next speaker who is not only the leader of our Republicans in the Senate, but he is our leader.    </p><p>      And without further ado, I want to give you a wonderful public servant, someone who is the longest-serving Senator in Kentucky history, someone who knows what we have to do.  He is the right man for the right time, Mitch McConnell.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCONNELL</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Matt, and good morning, everyone.  It's good to be here.    </p><p>      I've been to a number of these CPAC conferences over the years, and this room is packed, and I can't tell you how excited I am to see all of you this morning.    </p><p>      We've had a great line up of speakers.  I just saw my friend, John Boehner, on the way out.  He is a great teammate here in Congress; John Cornyn, doing a wonderful job to the people of Texas. He is head of our National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is our campaign arm; Jim DeMint, one of the strongest advocates of conservative principles we have.  And I know that you're all as impressed as I am with the leadership of Dr. Tom Coburn.    </p><p>      And I want to thank David Keene for inviting me.  David has been one of the great thinkers and foot soldiers in the battle of ideas over the years.  He has been organizing this conference longer than most of you been alive.  And they get better every year.    </p><p>      In fact, some people call CPAC the conservative spring break. And David is, of course, the driving force.  He can be proud of that. And I know he is proud to be the father of a brave young soldier serving our nation on a second tour of duty in Iraq.    </p><p>      You know, the organizers of CPAC probably thought they had done a pretty good job when about 200 people showed up to hear a speech by a Republican governor from California named Ronald Reagan.    </p><p>      At that time, if you could have guessed that the man they have come to hear would do so very much to revive our nation's fortunes and to help secure the freedom of so many millions overseas and if you could have known how important CPAC would prove to be during that period and still is today.    </p><p>      CPAC has been the host of presidents, lawmakers and some of the nation's top opinion leaders.  And most importantly, it's been a training ground for young minds.    </p><p>      Of the record 8,500 registrants this year, 8500 registrants this year, more than half are college students, including I'm told a good number from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.   </p><p>      Compare that to the left's annual attempt to imitate CPAC, the so called kick Take Back America conference, which last year drew about a third as many people at CPAC.  What this proves, of course, is that conservatives are more fun and interesting than liberals.    </p><p>      I mean let's be honest.  Who wants to hang out with guys like Paul Krugman and Robert Wright when you can be with Roger Hollander (ph).    </p><p>      There are some in the media I'd like to thank that the conservative movement is on the way out, that it's devoid of energy and enthusiasm.  Well, they should come to CPAC.  I know it might be a disappointment to many of them, but they'd see what I see.  The conservative movement is alive and well.    </p><p>      But even if we put on a better confidence than our friends on the other side, they've got quite a bit more influence regretfully at the moment.  And they have big plans for the country.    </p><p>      And since all of you are on the frontlines, the volunteers, the organizers, the future opinion leaders who are carrying and will carry our message to a new generation.    </p><p>      This morning, I thought I would discuss some of things that I think we all need to do if you are going to stage a comeback and we must stage a comeback.    </p><p>      Now, the first step in my view is to remind ourselves where we are.  The political landscape is a lot different today than it was Kentuckians first send me to Washington.    </p><p>      Imagine this, back then, the Republican governor of New Jersey had just been reelected with 70 percent of the vote.  Republicans had just taken over both legislative chambers in Connecticut.  And Republican candidate for president had just 49 of 50 states.    </p><p>      For republicans, 1984, the political compass didn't point in one direction.  Our principles, as we know, are universal, but back then it really showed, not so today.    </p><p>      As we look over the political landscape in 2009, we see that every single one of New England's 21 House members is a Democrat, that there isn't a single Republican senator representing tens of millions of American on the West Coast.    </p><p>      And that you can walk from Canada to Mexico, and from Montano to Maine, without ever leaving a state in this country that has a Democratic governor.    </p><p>      We are fast becoming a regional party, instead of national one, and there is name for regional party, it's called the minority party. Being in a minority party might be OK, if you are a college debating society.  On today's campuses it might even be fun in a counter- cultural sort of way, but I assure you it's not good for America when we are in the minority and none of us should be content to stay there.  </p><p>      I should note that looking at the list of events this weekend, it appears that no one at CPAC seems to least bit content about our current political standing or at least with relying on old methods for building the party and communicating our message to the broader public.    </p><p>      One of the reasons, so many of you are here is that somebody else told you, through base book or tweeter, that they were going.    </p><p>      And before you leave many will have heard about the best and latest strategies for raising funds, recruiting candidates or building coalitions for conservative causes among minority groups.  All of these things must be at the heart of our renewal.    </p><p>      But the instrument is only as good as the strategy.  And the strategy has to improve.  First and foremost, we need to search out those who have left our party, wherever they are, and give them a good reason to take a second look.    </p><p>      These people were Republican for a reason.  We need to remind them why.  As we do this we shouldn't fall for the false temptation of diluting our principles.  You don't expand your appeal by turning away from those who are the most loyal.    </p><p>      Instead you work harder to appeal to everybody else.  But this much is clear, our message isn't getting out to as many people as it should and that needs to change.    </p><p>      Second, we need to be concerned that the very wealthy and the very poor, the most and least educated, and a majority of minority voters have stopped paying attention to us.    </p><p>      We've made the case to Hispanic and African American voters that our policies are best suited to the aspirations of these communities, yet in the last election, Hispanic voters turned out in far greater numbers for the Democratic candidates.  And sadly, the party that was founded on the principle of racial equality attracted just 4 percent of the African-American vote in the last presidential election.    </p><p>      These are not reasons to abandon the effort.  They're reasons to work twice as hard.  And in this regard it's encouraging to say that CPAC is hosting a panel this year on the building of Hispanic coalitions.  This is a necessary work and it shouldn't be an uphill battle.    </p><p>      Ronald Reagan once said, Hispanic voters are Republicans, they just don't know it yet.  It's up to all of you to show Hispanics, in the search for the American dream, that the Republican Party is their home.    </p><p>      As we seek to reach...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCONNELL</emphasis>:  As we seek to reach old friends and find new ones, we need to expand our principles.  As conservative, we believe a big and encroaching government is a threat to liberty.    </p><p>      That greater liberty and freedom lead to greater prosperity, stronger families and communities; that workers should be allowed to keep more of what they earn; the judges should follow what the constitution says, not what they wanted to; and that human life is sacred.    </p><p>      I was disappointed that one of the first things the new administration did was to reverse the Mexico City Policy.  Americans do not want their tax dollars to be used promoting abortion either here or abroad.    </p><p>      Conservatives also believe that the government has no more solemn duty than to protect the people who established it.  And on this last point, let's be very clear about something else.    </p><p>      When it comes to Guantanamo, the new administration needs to show us more concerned with safety than with symbolism.  Many of those still detained are serious threats to the safety of our citizens, serious threats.  In fact, several of these terrorists still proudly proclaim their desire to kill more Americans.    </p><p>      Now the new attorney general visited Guantanamo earlier this week and returned with a glowing report.  He said; it was well run, that he is impressed with the people in charge and that every single person there has to be moved out of Guantanamo and it has to be shut down in less than a year.    </p><p>      The Obama administration needs to answer a very simple question, where exactly do you expect to send these guys?    </p><p>      Well, they don't have an answer to that question.  they don't have an answer to that question, but I do...    </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)    </p><p>      Those are all very good suggestions.  Well, let me tell you where they are to be.  They are to be right there in the jail in Guantanamo.   </p><p>      You guys get it.  You don't take much prompting at all.  I mean, obviously, that's where they belong.    </p><p>      Over the past few months, we've seen a big government mentality creep back into (inaudible) Capitol Hill.  It seems that failed big government solutions of the Carter era are back -- making a come back.   </p><p>      And I assure you Republicans are going to do everything we can to make sure that the failed policies of the past stay where they belong.   </p><p>      And let me tell you where they belong.  They belong right next to the bell bottoms and the leisure suits.  And no one doubts that government should have a role.  Indeed some challenges are so great or so urgent that they do require government to act.    </p><p>      Government can also play an important role in helping Americans meet 20 percent through challenges, through things like education reform, making healthcare more efficient and more affordable for everyone, and increasing energy exploration.    </p><p>      But in the face of new challenges, Democrats seem to be reverting to the old play book of blotted government, out of control spending, and higher and higher taxes to pay for all of it.    </p><p>      During the last administration they never passed up an opportunity to wring their hands about the spending that both parties approved to recover from a horrific terrorist attack, to fight two wars, and to rebuild after the single worse disaster in U.S. history.    </p><p>      But now the shoe is on the other foot.  And what have we seen? Well in just one month -- just one month, the Democrats have spent more than President Bush spent in seven years on the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina combined -- in one month.    </p><p>      If the overall spending has been jaw dropping, then the individual proposals have been even more troubling.  Everyone is familiar with the $1 trillion stimulus bill.  A bill that was supposed to be timely, temporary and targeted turned out to be none of the above.    </p><p>      Much of the spending won't go into affect for literally years, much of it is directed in wasteful projects, like government golf carts.    </p><p>      And much of the new government spending will be virtually impossible to cut off once the economy recovers.  Next week, we'll be voting on another spending bill, the Annual Appropriation Bill that covers spending through October.    </p><p>      We had a couple of days to look at what the Democrats are proposing and it looks a lot like the stimulus bill.  And that may be the stimulus bill wasn't just enough, because as it turns out the Appropriation Bill double dips by including money for 122 programs that were in the stimulus bill.    </p><p>      We hear a lot from Democrats these days about the needs for Americans to sacrifice for the good of the whole.  Yet, at a time when Americans are tightening their belts, Democrats in Washington were letting there's out a notch or two.    </p><p>      And they're not pushing back from the table yet.  When it comes to fiscal responsibility, Democrats are clearly telling Americans to do as they say, not as they do.    </p><p>      What does all this mean?  Well, one way to look at it is that for more than two centuries, Americans have embraced a simple principle that's at the heart of who we are as Americans.    </p><p>      The principle said that we work hard so our kids can have a better life and more opportunities than we had.    </p><p>      Well, it seems that this Congress wants to reverse the order.  It seems they want our children to work hard to pay the debt that we ran up, because we don't have the will to make the hard choices now.    </p><p>      The government first approach isn't unlimited to spending tax dollars.  It also extends to the Democrats approach to free speech.    </p><p>      On this issue, the constitution could not be clear.  The founders felt so strongly about government limitations on speech that they prohibited it in the very first amendment.    </p><p>      Yet today, some on the other side want to shut you up by enforcing limits on what's said on the airways.  They called it the fairness doctrine.    </p><p>      What they should call it is the, we can't compete with conservative talk radioactive 2009.    </p><p>      And let me tell you this, let me tell you this.  It will be an honor for Republicans to make sure that this unconstitutional proposal never becomes law.    </p><p>      Now that the government first approach is evident in Washington, it's effort to stifle the freedom of workers in this country to decide without coercion or intimidation whether they want to belong to a union.    </p><p>      Workers should be free to vote the way they want without a union boss or a company manager looking over their shoulder.    </p><p>      And Republicans will make sure that this union power grab never becomes law.    </p><p>      Look, pushing back these efforts to basically European as a mirror will not be easy.    </p><p>      It will require a committed effort on the part of everyone in this room.  It will require carrying our message to those who have left our party and to many more who are receptive to our message.    </p><p>      Meanwhile, Republicans and Congress will be vigilant about promoting their ideals, the ideals that made our nation great, and we will be relentless in proposing new solutions for the 21st century challenges we face.    </p><p>      Some people look at Republican losses and places like the north east and the west coast and say it's over in these places that we need to focus on our strongholds.    </p><p>      If that's not the kind of -- but that's not the kind of party I've signed up for and I bet you didn't either.    </p><p>      Looks, if conservative principles were right then they were right for everyone and for all times and in every state in America.    </p><p>      I know we can compete in those places without diluting our message, because I've seen it done.    </p><p>      I described earlier what most of the country look like in 1984. I didn't see what Kentucky look like in 1984.  Well, it didn't look like it does today and there's an important lesson here.    </p><p>      The year I was elected to the Senate, both senators in my state were Democrat the year I ran.    </p><p>      Of the seven congressional districts in our state, Republicans held only two.    </p><p>      Six years later, I was reelected and set in plan a motion -- a plan in place.  I knew that Kentuckians like most Americans were common sense conservatives.    </p><p>      Many of them had been registered Democrats still are, but on almost all the issues, they actually agreed with us.    </p><p>      My strategy was simple; first, find good candidates.  If they could win on their own, let them.  If they couldn't, surround them with people who could push them over the line.  It was hard work, but it paid off.    </p><p>      Just nine years after that, both U.S. Senators in Kentucky were Republicans.  Five of our six congressional seats were Republican and in the final count of state Senate flipped to a Republican control when a long time Democrat agreed to switch parties in my living room.    </p><p>      So, don't tell me we can't do this working together, we can. Over the years Kentuckians got comfortable -- not a bad slogan, it works better for us.    </p><p>      What happened to my state is over the years Kentuckians got comfortable with Republicans, and they are comfortable sending other Republicans to the state capital, to the nation's capital.    </p><p>      Believe me, it's amazing how much people will start to trust somebody with an R after their name, once he's been around for a little while, shown them what a good conservative government can be like and the difference it can make in their lives.    </p><p>      It happened in their commonwealth of Kentucky, and it happened last fall in New Orleans; it sent a Republican to Congress for the first time since 1891, a Republican who also happens to be the first Vietnamese American member of Congress in our history.    </p><p>      And with your hard work and creativity, it will happen in every other state and city in American in the months and years ahead.    </p><p>      So, my message to you is this.  Be proud of your principles.  Be daring in recruiting new candidates and never ever tire of fighting for the ideas that will ensure the safety and prosperity of this great country.    </p><p>      You are the soldiers.  You will do all these things.  You will get others to do them too, and before you know it, we'll have made our comeback.    </p><p>      Thank you very much.  God bless you all.  Good luck.    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  Are we all socialists now?  Let's talk a little bit about that.    </p><p>      Newsweek has declared it so, but who cares what they have to say. With this Congressmen Todd Tiahrt of Kansas, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Congressman Scott Garrett of New Jersey, Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and to moderate this panel, Matt Kibbe of FreedomWorks.    </p><p>      If you all will join us; Matt Kibbe, who he will be moderating this panel is the President, CEO of FreedomWorks, this position he has held for the last four years.  Previously, he was FreedomWorks executive vice president.    </p><p>      He manages Freedom Works overall operations and strategy including public policy development, grassroots operations and state and federal issue campaigns of the organization.    </p><p>      Prior to joining FreedomWorks, Matt served as chief of staff in House budget committee associate for U.S. Representative Dan Miller of Florida from 1993 to 1996.    </p><p>      He also has served as director of Federal Budget Policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.    </p><p>      He has has written extensively on economics, public policy and politics.  His writings have appeared in outlets such as USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, Reason market process, and the journal of regulation and social cause.    </p><p>      Please give a big resounding welcome to our panel to talk about socialism.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KIBBE</emphasis>:  Fun fact of the day.  In 2008, General Motors lost $84 million a day, that's the bad news.    </p><p>      The good news is Congressman Barney Frank thinks he knows how to run a car company and no matter how many billions of dollars we pout into this failing businesses, he has got a better ideas.  So, it's all good.    </p><p>      This didn't have to be this way.  You'll recall that the troubled asset relief funds was used late last year to bailout GM and Chrysler for a purpose that no one intended it to be for.    </p><p>      We had an opportunity last year to kill that bill and to stop this lush fund that the Obama administration is now using, and I'm happy to say that our two elected officials that were sitting in the House of Representatives last fall during this note voted no not once, but twice against that bailout.    </p><p>      I'm going to go straight into the panelists.  Our first panelist is Representative Todd Tiahrt, who began serving the 4th District of Kansas in Congress in 1995.    </p><p>      He was appointed to the House for operations committee in 1997, and currently serves as Senior Republican on the appropriation sub committee on labor health, human services and education.   </p><p>      Congressman Tiahrt.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TIAHRT</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Good morning.  It's great to see you all here and I'm really pleased that you are so involved that you want to come here and find out what you can do to change America.    </p><p>      Last fall, we heard a lot about promises and we heard a lot about hope, because promises do build hope, but keeping promises build trust.    </p><p>      But do you trust this administration to do the right thing for your future?  You don't?  I don't either.    </p><p>      This week we passed $410 billion spending package that was about a 9 percent increase over the last year.    </p><p>      Last week, we passed $1.2 trillion in this stimulus bill.  Will you saw the president's budget was on your chair $7.37 trillion, how much is this, how much is a trillion dollars?  Has anybody written a check for a trillion dollars?    </p><p>      If you had started the business the day after Christ rose from the dead and made a million dollars that day and everyday until today, in other words a million dollars for 2,000 years, you would not yet have made a trillion dollars.  You'd only be about three-fourths the way there.  Think about that, million dollars a day for 2,000 years is a not a trillion dollars.    </p><p>      7.37 trillion, it's a lot of money.  And it's money that we don't have.  The government doesn't have it.  It's your money, and you don't have it either.  So, where is it going to come from?    </p><p>      Well, I am tired of the bailouts.  In fact, I filed legislation this week that says \"no more bailouts.\"  Last year should be known as the year of the bailout.  We bailed out Fannie Mae.  We bailed out Freddie Mac.  We bailed out Wall Street.  We bailed out the car dealers, although they call it bridge loans.    </p><p>      We had TARP 1, Troubled Asset Relief Program, the first round. We have another round glooming right now.  But the entities that received that $350 billion on September 2nd were worth $319 billion. Today, they are worth $86 billion, one-fourth their value after receiving $350 billion of money that we don't have.  We're going to have to go and borrow and get it and pay it back.    </p><p>      I mean can you imagine?  We're not here to a Coke machine and pulling out a dollar and sticking it in that Coke machine and pressing the button, and nothing comes out.  And so, you go back to your wallet and you start fishing around and you find another dollar.  And you stick it in there and you press the button and no more -- and another Coke doesn't come out.  How long would you repeat that process?    </p><p>      Well, in the 1930s, we borrowed money for government programs, and it did not work.  In the 1970s, we borrowed money for government programs to overcome our recession then, and it did not work.   </p><p>      In the 1990s, Japan tried it.  They borrowed money, started government programs to overcome their recession.  They call it the lost decade.  And their average per capita income went from second in the world to 10th in the world.  It did not work.    </p><p>      And now, we're doing it again.  We are sticking another dollar in the Coke machine and we expect a different result.    </p><p>      In July, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 11,378.  Today, it's 7,182.  It doesn't work.    </p><p>      So, what should we tell Congress?  What should we tell the elected members in your district?  No more bailouts.  Can I hear it? No more bailouts.  No more bailouts.  I am tired of it.  It doesn't work.  Let's not stick another dollar into the machine.    </p><p>      You know, what we ought to be doing is strengthening our economy. If you want to help the auto dealers, why don't we give each one of us a $20,000 tax cut to go buy an American made automobile?  You've got to buy a car, wouldn't you?  I would.    </p><p>      We have to stabilize the dollar, revise regulations so that it helps workers in businesses, reform mark-to-market rules because it's crushing our trust in our financial institutions, reduce our taxes and renew our access to capital.    </p><p>      I am going to end up, so we get time for some questions, by telling you, I want you to be determined to get this done.    </p><p>      There was a farmer back in the Midwest during the 30s named JW. And he wasn't a very big man.  Even though he was less than six foot tall, he probably weighed 135 pounds.  And he typically wore a hat, plaid shirt, bibblerolls (ph), boots and long-handle underwear.    </p><p>      He brought a brand new threshing machine.  And he went on to run it.  First time, he ran it, it got clogged up.  He went around the back and tried to pull out the chaff so that he could get the weed through the machine.  You know, being from Kansas, we are concerned about that.    </p><p>      And it got a hold of his -- one of those cogs got a hold of his shirt's sleeve and started pulling him in that machine.  And he held it back with his hand.  And pretty soon, it pulled him till there was nothing but his elbow holding him from getting wrapped up in that machine.  And then it was his back, and then all a sudden, he was free of that machine.  And he was standing there with nothing but his boots and his bibblerolls (ph) on.    </p><p>      And around the cog on that chain was going his plaid shirt and his long-handle underwear.  He was determined not to let that machine get in.  And I am glad he did, because JW was my grandfather.  And I wouldn't be here today if he hadn't done that.    </p><p>      That's how determined I am to stop the bailout and securing this economy around.  I want you to be just as determined.  Come to Kansas. Help me get elected to the Senate.  And we will stop the bailouts and secure this economy, secure your future.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHAFFETZ</emphasis>:  I am Jason Chaffetz, and I got to tell you I am fired up, because I got to tell you a little bit about how I got here, because I am so concerned that this country is turning towards socialism.    </p><p>      I ran my campaign and ran against the 12-year incumbent.  I ran (ph) one of our own.  I ran against Mr. Cannon who is a nice gentleman.  But you know what he told me?  He was Mr. Conservative.    </p><p>      And I said, \"You know, what?  When you took office, the budget was 1.5 trillion.  Now it's $3.1 trillion.  There doesn't seem to be too much conservative about that now that we're $10 trillion in debt.\"   </p><p>      So I wanted to do something about it.  I want to be a part of the solution, not just part of the problem.  I had no campaign staff.  I had no campaign office.  I refused to buy somebody a free meal.    </p><p>      I told the voters, if you want to participate with me, I am sorry, no free meals as far as I am concerned.  I refused to go into debt.  I argue that how you run campaign is very indicative of how you are going to be in office.  And I refused to go in debt.    </p><p>      Yes, I was outspent by $600,000, and I won by 20 points.  The point is the thing that I said at the very beginning of the campaign is that this is a campaign about who can do more with less.    </p><p>      I think how you run this country is an issue about who can do more with less.  As we go into 2010 and 2012, this is the argument that we need to make to the American people that the Republicans and their conservative values are the way to go forward in this country. It's about empowering people, not towards socialism.    </p><p>      When our president says only government can solve these problems, that scares the living daylights out of me.  It's empowering entrepreneurs.  It's empowering the American work force.  It's about empowering the individual to be the best that they can be.    </p><p>      The only way, the best way to solve our problem is not just spending more money.  We can no longer run this country on a credit card.  And that's where we are going.    </p><p>      Our President Obama said he wanted maximum openness and transparency.  He promised this that we would have five days to see a bill on the Internet before it was voted on.  The United States Congress unanimously, unanimously passed the resolution that said we'd have 48 hours to review a bill before we voted on it.  And yet, the single largest spending bill in the history of the United States, a $1 trillion-plus expenditure, had the light of day for just about 13 hours.    </p><p>      There is not one member of Congress that actually read that bill. And it passed.  13 hours, and nobody read it.  It had so many pages, 1,400 something pages.  They didn't even have time to put pages numbers on it.   </p><p>      Our president is the one that said that he wanted -- this is going to be jobs bill.  Nancy Pelosi said it was a jobs bill.  And yet, less than 1 percent are tax cuts for businesses.  And yet, we know 70 percent of our job    </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHAFFETZ</emphasis>:  ... go to Facebook, go to Twitter on \"Jason in the House,\" find me.  I'd like to love to communicate with you.  And thank you.  I appreciate it.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  By the way, Congressman Chaffetz, one of the issues you ran on was against the bailout.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHAFFETZ</emphasis>:  Yes.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  And it was unconventional, but not only good policy, but good politics.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHAFFETZ</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Thank you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  Next, Congressman Scott Garrett, one of the good guys, as I like to say, who is recently sworn in to his fourth term in United States House of Representatives, representing New Jersey's Fifth Congressional District.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GARRETT</emphasis>:  Thank you.  Thank you, and good morning, everyone.  It is indeed a pleasure to be here with all of you, my colleagues here on the desk, good conservatives all.  It's good to be in the room with fellow likeminded conservative thinkers that we are right here in this room.    </p><p>      I think unfortunately, we're probably a minority in the city, as being if that's the case (ph).  But we are -- so we are not a minority nationally, because I honestly I do believe that this country is a right of center country and that we are the party and the people of the right ideas and the American people are behind us in that.    </p><p>      This panel right here, very briefly, has been talking about bailing out big business and ROE and all socialists now, and I heard you say before, no, no.    </p><p>      But we've certainly seen an unprecedented leap towards that over the last several years and of course with this new administration. And now with this budget that came out, it's a 10-year plan, I guess this is variation of the old Soviet five-year plan twice over.    </p><p>      And so, well, it's certainly going down that path.  And I would just give you two reasons why I think this is happening at the heart of this move towards socialism.    </p><p>      First is, that there isn't a -- Washington has adopted this mantra of trying to delay pain or prevent pain, whether it's a pain on Wall Street or pain for the people who made bad decisions in their housing market or pain to other people who made other bad decision. Government thinks that somehow or other they can intervene and actually prevent thing.  And obviously, you can't.    </p><p>      The second thing, what brings us to where we are right now, is the belief by some here in Washington that there is a small group of elites that here in the nation's capital knows better than the collective wisdom of the American public.  And we know that is not true.    </p><p>      Consider for a moment what this administration has either considered or already done or talks about dealing.  They've considered appointing a health czar and energy czar, a chief deployment czar, a climate change czar, a technology czar, a drug czar and an urban affairs czar.    </p><p>      So, it's not maybe that we are moving towards socialism.  Maybe we are all Bolsheviks now.    </p><p>      Now, before assessing upon, and Todd just talked about this before, looking forward for a second, let's see where we've been.  I am on financial services side.  I deal a lot with those issues over there.    </p><p>      We spent about $29 billion to bail out Bear Sterns; $400 billion, 200 and 200 to bail out the GSE's Fannie and Freddie; $153 billion for AIG, more to come; $308 billion to bail out Citigroup, more to come; $39 billion to bail out the auto manufacturers, more to come; and of course, $800 billion to bail out just about everybody else including the bad state governments.    </p><p>      Now, these numbers by the way don't include something else, its not talk about very much, and that's the Federal Reserve, who was an agency that needs to be certainly reigned in.    </p><p>      The Federal Reserve has increased its balance sheet from around $800 billion to $2.3 trillion.  And so, when you sit back for one second it's almost a mind numbing aspect when you consider these dollars -- unbelievable numbers.    </p><p>      And that's actually part of the game plan I think on the other sides, because they could say that -- numbers are so mind numbing that they can say while we spent $700 billion to bailout Wall Street, can we spent $600 billion to give Universal Healthcare or other such things.  So that's a direction that we're going.    </p><p>      And it's going to get worse, as Todd indicated, we have tax increases of $1.4 trillion, entitlement up by a $1 trillion, non defense by $9.3 billion.  At the end of day, I'll conclude on this.    </p><p>      It's really very thin, if you're a conservative politician in this town, somebody who believes in capitalism in the free markets and the fact that we have seen much lack of accountability at various levels, government, corporate and otherwise.  What's happening now is that there is a game in Washington of one -- every politician trying to updo or outdo the other politician.    </p><p>      To be able to say that Washington is able to once do -- pick through the winners will be through all these bailouts options (inaudible).    </p><p>      I'm not sure, at the end of the day, who the bailouts will benefit and who the winners will be.  I can just close on this and say I know who the losers are going to be and that's the tax payer and that's everyone who believes in liberty and freedom in this country.    </p><p>      So I just ask you to consider this, Barney Frank and who was the one of my...    </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)    </p><p>      ...Barney Frank and others have led the charge on the other side of the isle to say, what brought us to this point is deregulation and a lack of government spending and a lack government involvement.    </p><p>      What we must be all charged with doing is to tell the true story that we are here in this fiscal situation that we are in now because of too much government involvement, too much government interference, and the answer is to unleash the potential of private capital and simply getting the government out of the way.    </p><p>      God bless you for...    </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNKNOWN</emphasis>:  We are down -- we are down, there are last five minutes and I have the honor of introducing Fred Smith, who is a force of nature, one of the smartest guys I know and the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SMITH</emphasis>:  Like Hubert Humphrey, I talk very fast and I can hit gust of 250 words a minute, watch out OK.    </p><p>      No we're not all socialist, yet capitalism is really in crisis, I think we should all recognize that, in the bumper sticker story, as the congressmen just mentioned is easy.    </p><p>      Greedy capitalist operating in a Republican deregulated world ran amuck taking money and candy from babies and orphans.    </p><p>      Markets have failed, governments must succeed and certainly there were a lot of fools and frauds operating in the housing markets.  But why?  Why were there so many and why housing particularly?    </p><p>      Well there are many factors, but the major element is, as the congressmen just alluded to, is that we have moved in a way from the honest socialism of the past, where government actually owned things and was held responsible when they failed to the mixed economy dishonest socialism of today.    </p><p>      The left -- old left used to say when the new problem came up, new government agency is run by ourselves and we will spend money wisely.    </p><p>      Well they're not so sure about that.  First, social expenses are on one budget, secondly they are held accountable when they fail, and thirdly, they basically have to get appropriations each year, much better to leave in place a nominal private sector or create nominal private entities and then assign to them the responsibility of carrying out the political mandate you want to see.    </p><p>      In the housing area, we created Fannie and Freddie.  Now that requires at least a bill in this audience.  And we and others try to explain to people, what it meant to create an organization that had profit side -- of course, you can pay Franklin Raines any figure you wanted to do    </p><p>      They can operate like a cowboy in an open plain.  But if anything went wrong you and I were on the hook.  It had the moral hazard problem associated with government guarantees for whatever it did wrong.    </p><p>      We testified.  We were criticized.  We were doomers and gloomers. We were too negative.  They had a high yield    </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Bridgett Wagner of The Heritage Foundation.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WAGNER</emphasis>:  Thank you all.

Now you guys have been here a day and I am sure you have all heard the news that the era of big government is back.    </p><p>      The Obama administration's new 3.7 trillion, yes trillion with a \"T\" budget, includes vast new spending program on healthcare, climate change and welfare programs, financed by new taxes and cuts in our military spending.    </p><p>      It increases spending to the highest levels since the Second World War and explodes the deficit in to new uncharted territory, but that's all OK, because they have a plan to cut the deficit, with more taxes.    </p><p>      Even the Democrats in this morning's paper are saying it will be tough to find the votes for this budget.  We hope so.    </p><p>      And as if we didn't already know this mornings' Washington Post, helpfully reminded us that President Obama's agenda seeks to \"faster redistribution of wealth.\"  And it is likely to spark fierce political battles on an array of fronts from social spending, to energy spending, to healthcare and taxes.    </p><p>      Well, as one famous governor I am sure you all know my face, fierce political battles, you bet it.    </p><p>      Our next speaker is someone we can count on to be on the frontlines of those fights in Congress.  Tom Coburn is a real citizen legislator.    </p><p>      He's taken the term limit pledge and honored it by serving three terms in the House and returning to Oklahoma and running for the Senate.    </p><p>      And because he's pledged to serve only two terms there, he's a man on a mission.  He believes in reforming government programs and cutting waste, fraud and abuse in the central budget.    </p><p>      He also believes in expanding access and affordability to healthcare by putting the patients, not the government in charge.  And by as a practicing OBGYN, who's delivered more than 4,000 babies, his commitment to the sanctity of life is a commitment lived not just spoken.    </p><p>      Dr. Coburn is one of those rare politicians who's actually run a business and created jobs himself.  In the House, he has played an influential role in reforming welfare and other entitlement programs and trimming the budget, and in the Senate, he has championed transparency and accountability and that will pork in all its forms and flavors, both Democrats and Republicans.    </p><p>      His fight over the bridge to where there is (ph) more to educate the public on the spending practices of our elected officials, he has been a library of think-tank papers, or a lifetime of conferences and panel discussions, and that's coming from a think-tank worker myself.    </p><p>      His port busting activity is legendary and I should say not necessarily appreciated on Capitol Hill.    </p><p>      His office Web site, if you go to it, has a link for the Washington Waste of the Week.  But I checked it this morning and when you click through the site, it actually gives you a daily update on the Waste of the Day.  That's how bad it is.    </p><p>      And if you are a real port-buster, you can follow Tom Coburn and tweeter, and get a running commentary on the current legislation and debates in the Congress.    </p><p>      Dr. Coburn wrote an op-ed last year before the election, and said, \"For Republicans to regain their brand as the party of fiscal discipline, they would have to rejoin Americans in the real world of budget choices and priorities, and leave behind the fantasyland of borrowing without limits.\"    </p><p>      And he said, \"They must start the -- restart the permanent campaign against the government.  They should tear up the emergency credit card, the emergency spending credit card and refuse to accept any new spending, whatsoever, until Congress does its job of eliminating wasteful spending.\"  Something we haven't heard this new administration speak of at all.    </p><p>      Regaining their brand Senator Coburn said it was not about messaging, it was about action and courage and setting priorities.    </p><p>      And most of all he said that's about being willing to give up their political careers, so our grandkids don't have to grow up in a debtor's prison, or a world in which other nations can tell a weakened and bankrupt America where we can and can't defend liberty, pursue terrorists, or show compassion.   </p><p>      Ladies and gentlemen that sounds like change we can believe and help me welcome Tom Coburn of the great State of Oklahoma.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBURN</emphasis>:  Good morning.  Thank you.  Have your seat.  Let me just give you a little upfront notice, I'm only going to speak about two or three minutes.    </p><p>      One of the things that don't happen in meetings like this is you don't get to ask enough questions.    </p><p>      So, if you're going to want to ask question to me, please line up the microphones now so that we don't hustle forward.    </p><p>      Look, we are in (inaudible) as we say in Oklahoma, but we're not in such (inaudible) that we can't get our way out of it.    </p><p>      And the way we get out of it is go back and understand what made this country great, and it's three basic principles.  Personal accountability, individual responsibility, and freedom that's greater than anywhere else in the world.  That's what we need, that's what we need to be about.    </p><p>      Our country was built on a heritage of sacrifice and what we have today and what we've had in recent years is a reversal of that trend.    </p><p>      What used to happen is one generation would sacrifice for the generation following us so that opportunity and advancement would take place.  We're operating just in the reverse of that now.    </p><p>      We are stealing from the next two -- I use to say the next generation, it's not true anymore.    </p><p>      We're now stealing from the next two generations and what we're stealing is a standard of living that has been 30 percent greater than anywhere else in the rest of the world, and we're about to steal that from the next two generations.    </p><p>      It does not have to be that way.  So, what has to change is the willingness to fight even when you know you are going to lose so you can make sure that the story is out there and the comparative choice that the American people can see.    </p><p>      The Obama administration and Barack Obama will have a different philosophy.  And there is nothing wrong with them having that philosophy, but there is plenty wrong when we don't challenge it intellectually and we don't put forward the competing view that is based on what has made this country great and has made it greater than any civilized society in the history of the world.    </p><p>      So, courage is the number one character quality that we should be looking for in the leadership among the conservatives in this country.   </p><p>      If you're not willing to fight even if you lose but still fight then you don't belong in this movement.    </p><p>      We need people of strong character with the courage to fight even if we loose.    </p><p>      And the reason is as we lose, we educate the American people between the choices and that's what has not happened in the last six to eight years in Congress.    </p><p>      So, if you want to ask questions, what I'd like you to do is -- I guess they are lined up, I can't see you for the lights.  So, we're going to go with that.  I want to leave you with one last little tidbit.    </p><p>      When I decided to run for the Senate, the first thousand dollar check I got was from a guy from San Francisco by the name of Milton Friedman.    </p><p>      And he said me one of his quotes, and he said, \"We don't do these things and say these things because we think we can ultimately persuade the other side in a debate.  What we say these things and do these things because when their ideas fail, we will be there at the ready at the willing with ideas that work,\" and he was right.    </p><p>      So, who goes first?  Where are we, right here.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you for your leadership.  If we only had 51 senators like you, I wouldn't have to ask.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBURN</emphasis>:  Well, we actually need 60.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  So, I'm a Goldwater Republican for 40 years.  I dreamed, dreamed of a conservative majority in Congress who would limit the growth of government.    </p><p>      Unfortunately, we tried that and so far, it hasn't worked.  And so, my question to you is, is it time for grassroots conservatives to start thinking about constitutional limits to the spending and borrowing and growth of government and those constitutional limits would have to be initiated from the states, since Congress will never do it themselves.  What do think of that strategy?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBURN</emphasis>:  Well, first of all let me say that we haven't had a conservative majority in the U.S. Senate in sometime, and that's evident by what's passed in the Congress.    </p><p>      We're never going to do it on our own.  The grassroots affects though is to challenge.  Look, we let career (ph) politicians off easy.    </p><p>      When they are in their state, we need you there asking the hard questions and making them explain their positions of how they rationalize their position for the next election instead of rationalize a position against the constitution of the United States, and against the numerated power that it lies within it.    </p><p>      So, I think anything you want to do.  I think most important, that is the big hill to climb will be very, very difficult that I'm not sure we are climb.   </p><p>      Most important is to organize so that you are in front of those politicians when they are in front of the public where they get question and hit for the things that do not line up with a limited government, a pre-society, and a infringement on your right.    </p><p>      You know as the government grows your freedom declines and that's what the Obama budget is all about.  It's about taken your freedom away.    </p><p>      It's not about just growing the government because every time the government grows by 1/10th of 1 percent, you have less freedom.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Dr. Coburn.  Actually...    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBURN</emphasis>:  Where are you?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I am right here.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBURN</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I am waving my arms frantically.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  I am sorry about that.  Go ahead.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  First of all, thank you very much for your service for smaller government conservatives like me.  There's not lot of us out there anymore, you give me hope and you've been my favorite senator for years.  That's great.  And I actually follow you Twitter.  You're awesome.    </p><p>      I was wondering, in prior years of Congress in the Senate, if you had just one particular favorite, or I guess at least favorite bit of report that, like our past and it's just sounded to you that even somebody would even try to get federal money for this.    </p><p>      If you just could share with us your, I guess favorite?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBURN</emphasis>:  Oh! Gosh, I'm picking from millions.  Look, the bridge to nowhere was perfect.    </p><p>      We did that on purpose, because people could relate to that.  But what we should be is astounded and the all others that are there.    </p><p>      In this bill, we have a $2 million in this $410 billion bill is going to be in the Senate.  We got $2 million for pork odor next week, $2 million to study pork smell.  </p><p>      You know, you might want to study why pigs smell bad, I would tell you why.  Look, where they live.    </p><p>      But the point is, is that a priority?  Think of -- the thing we need to relate to is look into the eyes of your children and your grand children and what do you see.    </p><p>      In this country you see hope.  You see expectation.  You see -- a look at the brighter future.    </p><p>      And as we continue to do what Congress is doing, we're dimming the glimmer in that eye of our children.  It's got to stop.    </p><p>      This grand experiment that has grown a society and a material increase in standard of living at 50 percent greater than every other society in the world for years, especially since post World War II.    </p><p>      When we have earmarks that are not priority for the country, I held assemble (ph) two week ago in Congress.  I borrowed it from a lady downstairs in the actual Senate chamber.    </p><p>      That's about how much common sense is there.  And no, I am not kidding.  And I want you to think about it.    </p><p>      Politicians are wonderful people, they care about this country whether they are Democrats or Republicans, but they lack a frame of reference to the real world.  They haven't signed at both sides of the paycheck.    </p><p>      They haven't tried to negotiate a contract with the union, they haven't try to pay the bills when their incoming money slowing down.    </p><p>      They haven't stayed up all night worried and how they are going to take care of their employees.    </p><p>      What they have is the easiest of all joys -- jobs, and that is the wonderful pleasure of spending somebody else's money.    </p><p>      And when you do that without any perspective, what you're going to do spend it wrongly.    </p><p>      Next question, last one I am told.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Senator.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBURN</emphasis>:  Yes sir.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  You are looking my way, thank you.  I think it's important we emphasize that the freedom that our all speakers are talking about is the freedom from our own government.    </p><p>      I don't think that message has been made clear.  Secondly...    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(UNKNOWN)</emphasis>:  I agree.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  ...all our speakers have said that we got to get the word out.  How do we do it in a nation that is plagued and even dated by a press with whom I have had experiences since 1964 when I got Barry Goldwater elected in my pressings.    </p><p>      But the press is biased, prejudiced, not very intelligent, and will not report our message.    </p><p>      How do we get around the press with its love affair with the present administration?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COBURN</emphasis>:  Well, I think you are starting to see that.  I mean that's one of the reasons that the fairness doctrine needs to be opposed.  Not only directly but indirectly as they are going to come through with licensing renewals and try to do it.    </p><p>      But you are starting to see it.  In the wonderful age of the Internet, it's going to make a big difference.    </p><p>      The daily newspaper is going to die, and the competitive channels on cable were starting to see some reflection at least there is two view points in this country today where there used to be only one.    </p><p>      You are also seeing the innovation with twitter and the e-mail messages, and text messages, and connections through that and YouTube and all these other things.    </p><p>      The Senate has this new YouTube Senate.hub where many of the senators are on there explaining the positions.    </p><p>      So, I think technology as usual is going to come back and benefit freedom from oppression of the government.    </p><p>      Let me just follow-up on your point.  I was this week I talked with some people in the natural gas industry and I ask them, are we ever going to see -- our fertilizer sources are made from natural gas and we've lost 85 percent of that industry offshore.    </p><p>      And I asked -- with process low, are we going to see the fertilizer industry to will come back.  They said, \"Absolutely not.\" And I said, well, why not.    </p><p>      They said because of the cost of regulation from the government is so onerous that no one would ever build a new fertilizer factory and hydrous ammonia or ammonium nitrate factory in this country of which if you think about, think about risk for us.    </p><p>      One of our greatest assets is our ability to produce agricultural products efficiently and massively, but we can't do that without fertilizer.    </p><p>      Now, we've -- through government regulation, we have setup a limitation on our ability to do that if in fact we ever gotten a pinch.    </p><p>      So, your concept, our founders believed, our freedom was inherent in us, not inherent in the government and the government should be the least to impose against that freedom.    </p><p>      Final point:  We only change America if all of us work to change it, and you can have great members of Congress, but if we are in the minority, we are not going to get it done.    </p><p>      We can be abolished for what you feel and know to be true about the foundational principles of this country.    </p><p>      And I know you -- I'm talking to the working crowd here.  But the way we change it is each year one of you get a 100, and if each one of those 100 get a 100, and each one of those 100 get a 100 and we win our country back again.    </p><p>      We take it back.  Thank you.  God bless you.    </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VRK-72W0-YC24-C3W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulation Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO; BRET BAIER, FNC</nameText></person></p></bodyText></section><section sectionType=\"body\"><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR</emphasis>:  I want to talk to you about what's happening with big tech and your thoughts, first of all, in the big picture, how you view it, how you look at its, what are the concerns.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, (R-MO)</emphasis>:  First of all, they developed a business model that is premised on taking stuff from us, in this case, our information, and our private data, without telling us, then selling it without our permission. And then trying to get us addicted to their platforms so they can direct more ads to us and also extract more information from us, all of that without our consent. As a conservative, I believe in property rights. I think that consumers actually, their information is their information. They ought to be able to control it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  Where does the regulation fall, though? You have got a number of different things happening. The FTC is looking at it, the DOJ is looking at it. Congress is looking at it. How do you put all that together for somebody saying what's going to happen to this industry.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  You have got the FTC and DOJ looking at antitrust aspect of it. So are these companies, and we're really talking here, Bret, about the biggest companies, Google, Facebook, Twitter, are they trying to stifle competition, are they stifling innovation? I'm worried that they are, and we need a DOJ, Department of Justice, inquiry into that. I'm glad that that is what the administration is doing. I think that's the right course.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  As a conservative, are you in favor of breaking them up almost like a utility?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  If they violated the law. So if they have in fact violated the antitrust laws by suppressing competition, if they have gone out there and run competitors out of business in violation of our antitrust laws, then yes, I think breaking up has got to be an option that's on the table.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  So let me just take the other side, and that is these companies are some of our most successful companies in the country. And if you do that, if you find that point and you break them up, then you are putting the U.S. at a disadvantage against somebody like China who will take over that big behemoth kind of company.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  I'm not sure these companies really are our most successful or really represent the best of America in the way they say they do. Google and Facebook, they say that, but you think about it, Bret, what is it exactly that have given the country in the last 10 or 15 years? They have been willing to partner with the repressive Chinese government to make a buck whenever it suits them. They have advanced a leftwing agenda whenever they can. Are they creating jobs in the middle of our economy, are they creating jobs in the middle of the country? No to all of those things.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook was up on Capitol Hill, was asked about competition. And here's what he said.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO</emphasis>:  The average American uses about eight different apps to communicate and stay connected to people. So there's a lot of competition that we feel every day. That's an important force that we definitely feel in running the company.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Look at the market concentration Facebook enjoys, the social media space, it's enormous. And I think he is worried about competition. We know he's so worried that he's tried to buy out companies who he thinks will compete with him. He has tried to absorb them and roll them into Facebook. That's an anti-competitive strategy. And that's why President Trump's Justice Department is looking at this, they should be looking at it.   </p><p>      But, Bret, I will also say that Congress needs to take action. Whatever happens on antitrust, Congress needs to take action to protect people's data, to protect kids online, and also to make sure these companies aren't censoring conservative speech.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  There's some stats that talk about addiction to social media, which are pretty staggering.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  And 72 percent of the American public uses some type of social media, and when you go to 18 to 29 that number climbs to 90 percent. And it's kids who really are getting absorbed into this culture.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Yes. And let me give you some statistics that I think are really alarming. That is the correlation that we're seeing in studies between social media usage among young people, especially teenagers, and depression. The correlation between social media use and suicide, between social media use and the inability to form useful relationships.   </p><p>      Look, this data is early, we need more of it, but the early returns are alarming. And I talk to parents all over my state who say I don't want big tech raising my kids. I want to raise my kids. I want to have the ability to say no to big tech. I don't want them tracking my kids, I don't want them exploiting my kids, I don't want them taking my kids' information and selling it. I think we need to give parents that power.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  There's some who cast doubt on this whole legitimacy of social media addiction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  I would just say, I think we should listen to parents and I think we should always be willing to allow parents to raise their own children and to give them the tools to do that. And as a father myself, I've got two little boys at home, this is something that my wife and I think about literally every day.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  So look into your crystal ball, let's just say the FTC and the DOJ continue their investigations. What happens regulation-wise from Capitol Hill?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  I hope that we'll be able to begin where we ought to be able to all agree, and that is let's protect kids, number one. So let's stop the tech companies from tracking kids online. Number two, let's give every adult the right to opt out of being tracked. And then we ought to give every American the right the know, how much is my personal data worth to Google? I'd like to know what Google values it at, and I'd like to get it back. If Google has it, I don't want them to have it, they should delete it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  A couple more issues. One is the deficit and debt. Just passed spending caps and debt ceiling increase. On the campaign trail in Missouri you talked about concern about the deficit and dealt. Is this dealing with that concern?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Well, I voted no on that increase on the deal that would allow the debt and the deficit to rise. Look, Bret, I think that we need to rebuild our military. That's something that has been decimated by years of feckless leadership of President Obama and Democrats. But over and above that, my problem with the current proposals that have come out of Congress is that it increases spending way, way, way beyond what is required to rebuild the military on the nondefense side. It's massive increases to no clear purpose. I think we have got to stand up and say it's the American taxpayer who's on the line for this, and we can't just do this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  But if you don't have a president in your party who is saying that, how do you fight that battle up on Capitol Hill?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  I think the president has been strong on this. I think the president negotiated, it was important to him to get the defense increases and to protect defense, and that was the right thing on do.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  I followed you around Missouri campaigning. It was a big win against Claire McCaskill. Seven months in, your biggest takeaway is that this place is broken?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  It's broken, it really is. And there's no reason to just keep doing things the same old way. I think if the people of my state send any message in 2016 and 2018, it's that they're tired of the old ways of doing things and they're tired of the political establishment in both parties.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  So you don't think they hear the noise that we hear in Washington?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  I don't think that they are focused on the noise. Washington focuses and creates noise day in and day out. The people at home are thinking about, how can I raise my kids, how can I get a raise in my job, how can I pay for my healthcare, and how can I hold my family and my community together? This town is focused on elites for too long. Our politics need to focus on the American middle, the people who are in the middle of our society who sustain this country. That's what we ought to be about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BAIER</emphasis>:  Senator, we appreciate the time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSR-J6K1-JDPT-T511-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO, INTERVIEWED ON FNC \"SPECIAL REPORT\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AUGUST 9, 2019</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS:      SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, R-MO</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRET BAIER, FNC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I want to talk to you about what's happening with big tech and your thoughts, first of all, in the big picture, how you view it, how you look at its, what are the concerns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, (R-MO):  First of all, they developed a business model that is premised on taking stuff from us, in this case, our information, and our private data, without telling us, then selling it without our permission. And then trying to get us addicted to their platforms so they can direct more ads to us and also extract more information from us, all of that without our consent. As a conservative, I believe in property rights. I think that consumers actually, their information is their information. They ought to be able to control it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BAIER:  Where does the regulation fall, though? You have got a number of different things happening. The FTC is looking at it, the DOJ is looking at it. Congress is looking at it. How do you put all that together for somebody saying what's going to happen to this industry.</p><p>HAWLEY:  You have got the FTC and DOJ looking at antitrust aspect of it. So are these companies, and we're really talking here, Bret, about the biggest companies, Google, Facebook, Twitter, are they trying to stifle competition, are they stifling innovation? I'm worried that they are, and we need a DOJ, Department of Justice, inquiry into that. I'm glad that that is what the administration is doing. I think that's the right course.</p><p>BAIER:  As a conservative, are you in favor of breaking them up almost like a utility?</p><p>HAWLEY:  If they violated the law. So if they have in fact violated the antitrust laws by suppressing competition, if they have gone out there and run competitors out of business in violation of our antitrust laws, then yes, I think breaking up has got to be an option that's on the table.</p><p>BAIER:  So let me just take the other side, and that is these companies are some of our most successful companies in the country. And if you do that, if you find that point and you break them up, then you are putting the U.S. at a disadvantage against somebody like China who will take over that big behemoth kind of company.</p><p>HAWLEY:  I'm not sure these companies really are our most successful or really represent the best of America in the way they say they do. Google and Facebook, they say that, but you think about it, Bret, what is it exactly that have given the country in the last 10 or 15 years? They have been willing to partner with the repressive Chinese government to make a buck whenever it suits them. They have advanced a leftwing agenda whenever they can. Are they creating jobs in the middle of our economy, are they creating jobs in the middle of the country? No to all of those things.</p><p>BAIER:  Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook was up on Capitol Hill, was asked about competition. And here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO:  The average American uses about eight different apps to communicate and stay connected to people. So there's a lot of competition that we feel every day. That's an important force that we definitely feel in running the company.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAWLEY:  Look at the market concentration Facebook enjoys, the social media space, it's enormous. And I think he is worried about competition. We know he's so worried that he's tried to buy out companies who he thinks will compete with him. He has tried to absorb them and roll them into Facebook. That's an anti-competitive strategy. And that's why President Trump's Justice Department is looking at this, they should be looking at it.</p><p>But, Bret, I will also say that Congress needs to take action. Whatever happens on antitrust, Congress needs to take action to protect people's data, to protect kids online, and also to make sure these companies aren't censoring conservative speech.</p><p>BAIER:  There's some stats that talk about addiction to social media, which are pretty staggering.</p><p>HAWLEY:  Yes.</p><p>BAIER:  And 72 percent of the American public uses some type of social media, and when you go to 18 to 29 that number climbs to 90 percent. And it's kids who really are getting absorbed into this culture.</p><p>HAWLEY:  Yes. And let me give you some statistics that I think are really alarming. That is the correlation that we're seeing in studies between social media usage among young people, especially teenagers, and depression. The correlation between social media use and suicide, between social media use and the inability to form useful relationships.</p><p>Look, this data is early, we need more of it, but the early returns are alarming. And I talk to parents all over my state who say I don't want big tech raising my kids. I want to raise my kids. I want to have the ability to say no to big tech. I don't want them tracking my kids, I don't want them exploiting my kids, I don't want them taking my kids' information and selling it. I think we need to give parents that power.</p><p>BAIER:  There's some who cast doubt on this whole legitimacy of social media addiction.</p><p>HAWLEY:  I would just say, I think we should listen to parents and I think we should always be willing to allow parents to raise their own children and to give them the tools to do that. And as a father myself, I've got two little boys at home, this is something that my wife and I think about literally every day.</p><p>BAIER:  So look into your crystal ball, let's just say the FTC and the DOJ continue their investigations. What happens regulation-wise from Capitol Hill?</p><p>HAWLEY:  I hope that we'll be able to begin where we ought to be able to all agree, and that is let's protect kids, number one. So let's stop the tech companies from tracking kids online. Number two, let's give every adult the right to opt out of being tracked. And then we ought to give every American the right the know, how much is my personal data worth to Google? I'd like to know what Google values it at, and I'd like to get it back. If Google has it, I don't want them to have it, they should delete it.</p><p>BAIER:  A couple more issues. One is the deficit and debt. Just passed spending caps and debt ceiling increase. On the campaign trail in Missouri you talked about concern about the deficit and dealt. Is this dealing with that concern?</p><p>HAWLEY:  Well, I voted no on that increase on the deal that would allow the debt and the deficit to rise. Look, Bret, I think that we need to rebuild our military. That's something that has been decimated by years of feckless leadership of President Obama and Democrats. But over and above that, my problem with the current proposals that have come out of Congress is that it increases spending way, way, way beyond what is required to rebuild the military on the nondefense side. It's massive increases to no clear purpose. I think we have got to stand up and say it's the American taxpayer who's on the line for this, and we can't just do this.</p><p>BAIER:  But if you don't have a president in your party who is saying that, how do you fight that battle up on Capitol Hill?</p><p>HAWLEY:  I think the president has been strong on this. I think the president negotiated, it was important to him to get the defense increases and to protect defense, and that was the right thing on do.</p><p>BAIER:  I followed you around Missouri campaigning. It was a big win against Claire McCaskill. Seven months in, your biggest takeaway is that this place is broken?</p><p>HAWLEY:  It's broken, it really is. And there's no reason to just keep doing things the same old way. I think if the people of my state send any message in 2016 and 2018, it's that they're tired of the old ways of doing things and they're tired of the political establishment in both parties.</p><p>BAIER:  So you don't think they hear the noise that we hear in Washington?</p><p>HAWLEY:  I don't think that they are focused on the noise. Washington focuses and creates noise day in and day out. The people at home are thinking about, how can I raise my kids, how can I get a raise in my job, how can I pay for my healthcare, and how can I hold my family and my community together? This town is focused on elites for too long. Our politics need to focus on the American middle, the people who are in the middle of our society who sustain this country. That's what we ought to be about.</p><p>BAIER:  Senator, we appreciate the time.</p><p>HAWLEY:  Thank you.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2270236388</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSJ-TGV1-DY0W-411S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1404\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ Roll Call Aug 10, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 10, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Meantime, we are working.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And at 19 minutes before the top of the hour, the guy that works there is -- one of them is Sen. Josh Hawley from Missouri, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and House Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. And, Senator, welcome.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO):  Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Could be some interesting thing about 3:00 -- interesting drama, I imagine, about 3:00 today. Some old friends will be reuniting -- President Trump and Gov. Cuomo. They've been going at it.</p><p>Last time they had a fight, the president basically sent his Homeland Security secretary over there saying if you're going to give illegals licenses, you can forget about global entry for New York residents -- and they're suing each other.</p><p>What do you expect to happen right now?</p><p>HAWLEY:  Well, I think New York is in a tough spot because listen, what they're doing is unprecedented, trying to deny the federal government and all law enforcement any access to their DMV. I can't tell you how routine this is for states to share information with the federal government about their state's driver's licenses as part of -- it's an important tool for law enforcement.</p><p>So I imagine Gov. Cuomo will try to offer some sort of compromise, but here's the bottom line. They have a sanctuary state law -- New York does. They are not complying with federal law when it comes to illegal immigration. They're trying to stop ICE and immigration officials from actually enforcing the law in the state of New York and that's what needs to change.</p><p>AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS HOST:  So it's basically if you have global entry, which many of us here in New York do. It's easy when you have to go through customs if you happen to go to another country and get through the checkpoints because we've already been vetted.</p><p>They're saying no more of that? The president's saying you can't because we're not -- we're letting illegals have driver's licenses in our state. No more global entry?</p><p>HAWLEY:  Yes, even more than that. What New York has said is is not only are they letting illegals have driver's licenses, but they're also saying we're not going to share any of our DMV information, any of our information on any of our citizens with the federal government. So the federal government is like, well, how can we verify then who is who?</p><p>And so, it really leaves DHS and others at the federal level in a tough spot. And, of course, immigration officials have no way to enforce the law. So, it's been --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Sure.</p><p>HAWLEY:  It's an extreme position Gov. Cuomo's adopted and I think he'll probably start to walk it back.</p><p>STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS HOST:  Yes, and we've heard that it sounds like a compromise is on the way where apparently, they would grant the feds authority to look into the DMV record of certain people, probably those who apply for global entry, but it would be on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Meanwhile, Senator, let's talk a little bit about the coronavirus. I -- you know, people have been freaking out over this because of the nature of it. And when you look at the new number of deaths --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Staggering.</p><p>DOOCY:  -- reported by China -- 254 new deaths; 15,000 new cases -- it brings into question whether or not we should trust the information that is coming to us from China.</p><p>HAWLEY:  Yes.</p><p>DOOCY:  Do you trust them?</p><p>HAWLEY:  No, I don't trust them and I think that we can't trust them.</p><p>Listen, I was briefed not once but twice yesterday about the latest on the coronavirus from our health officials and Homeland Security officials. I have to say it's really, really concerning.</p><p>I think the Chinese government has not been honest at all about this. They are completely overwhelmed at this point. They are not leveling with anybody, certainly not with us.</p><p>And the Chinese Communist Party is creating a global health --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p>HAWLEY:  -- epidemic because of what they're doing, because they have lied, because they have not addressed this head-on, and they weren't prepared.</p><p>So, we've got to -- what that means for us is we've got to take every step in this country to keep our citizens safe, to keep our travelers safe, and -- because China certainly is not going to do it.</p><p>DOOCY:  OK.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Meanwhile, there's going to be a major overhaul proposed by you and others targeting Google and Facebook when it comes to privacy and other things. You're arguing that the agency is not capable of regulating itself.</p><p>DOOCY:  Big tech issues.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Big tech issues, the FTC.</p><p>So what do you plan on doing?</p><p>HAWLEY:  Well, I think we've got, first of all, way too many bureaucracies out there that are accountable to nobody, and the FTC is a great example. They don't report to anybody.</p><p>They have gotten too cozy with big tech. You've got this big government, big tech alliance. It's time to break that up.</p><p>Make the FTC report to the Justice Department. Make them enforce the laws that we have to make sure that we're not censored. To make sure that our privacy is protected and big tech is held accountable.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Do you have bipartisan support on this?</p><p>HAWLEY:  Yes, I hope that I will. You know, I've listened to a lot of my Democrat colleagues talk about the need for tougher enforcement. I say let's get the bureaucracy --</p><p>KILMEADE:  Yes.</p><p>HAWLEY:  -- actually doing what it's supposed to do. Let's make them accountable and let's get this done.</p><p>DOOCY:  You know, for the people watching, it's the FTC that is in charge of the do not call list and I had had it up to here over the last couple of days. I keep getting these spam calls. And finally, I reached out to somebody at the FTC and I said this is easily fixable because people are spoofing numbers to make it look like my next-door neighbor is calling from card services to negotiate a new rate.</p><p>FTC wrote me back and said you know what? You need to just hang up on it.</p><p>Is that all they can do? The FTC is saying just hang up on somebody who should not be calling?</p><p>HAWLEY:  You know, unfortunately, that's the -- that's their attitude towards enforcement in a lot of areas.</p><p>The answer to your question, though, is no, they can do a lot more than that.</p><p>DOOCY:  Of course.</p><p>HAWLEY:  In fact, I just sponsored a bill that would put new penalties for these fake telemarketers into law and it got passed right before the break.</p><p>But listen, the FTC needs to get tough. They're there for a reason. They need to enforce the law. They need to be accountable to somebody for doing it, and that's what we're trying to accomplish.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOOCY:  Yes.</p><p>KILMEADE:  America will not pick up their phone.</p><p>DOOCY:  If somebody running for president promises to stop robocalling, a lot of people would vote for them based on just that.</p><p>HAWLEY:  Amen -- amen to that.</p><p>EARHARDT:  That's true. Just don't answer it if you don't recognize it. They can leave a message.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOOCY:  But it looks like my neighbor.</p><p>KILMEADE:  Good luck in your quest, senator. Everyone can relate to what you're going after because everyone, somehow, is involved in social media one way, shape or form.</p><p>Senator, have a great day.</p><p>EARHARDT:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>HAWLEY:  Thanks -- you, too.

Meantime, we are working.  </p><p>      And at 19 minutes before the top of the hour, the guy that works there is -- one of them is Sen. Josh Hawley from Missouri, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and House Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. And, Senator, welcome.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO)</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thanks for having me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMEADE</emphasis>:  Could be some interesting thing about 3:00 -- interesting drama, I imagine, about 3:00 today. Some old friends will be reuniting -- President Trump and Gov. Cuomo. They've been going at it.  </p><p>      Last time they had a fight, the president basically sent his Homeland Security secretary over there saying if you're going to give illegals licenses, you can forget about global entry for New York residents -- and they're suing each other.  </p><p>      What do you expect to happen right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Well, I think New York is in a tough spot because listen, what they're doing is unprecedented, trying to deny the federal government and all law enforcement any access to their DMV. I can't tell you how routine this is for states to share information with the federal government about their state's driver's licenses as part of -- it's an important tool for law enforcement.  </p><p>      So I imagine Gov. Cuomo will try to offer some sort of compromise, but here's the bottom line. They have a sanctuary state law -- New York does. They are not complying with federal law when it comes to illegal immigration. They're trying to stop ICE and immigration officials from actually enforcing the law in the state of New York and that's what needs to change.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS HOST</emphasis>:  So it's basically if you have global entry, which many of us here in New York do. It's easy when you have to go through customs if you happen to go to another country and get through the checkpoints because we've already been vetted.  </p><p>      They're saying no more of that? The president's saying you can't because we're not -- we're letting illegals have driver's licenses in our state. No more global entry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Yes, even more than that. What New York has said is is not only are they letting illegals have driver's licenses, but they're also saying we're not going to share any of our DMV information, any of our information on any of our citizens with the federal government. So the federal government is like, well, how can we verify then who is who?  </p><p>      And so, it really leaves DHS and others at the federal level in a tough spot. And, of course, immigration officials have no way to enforce the law. So, it's been --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMEADE</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  It's an extreme position Gov. Cuomo's adopted and I think he'll probably start to walk it back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS HOST</emphasis>:  Yes, and we've heard that it sounds like a compromise is on the way where apparently, they would grant the feds authority to look into the DMV record of certain people, probably those who apply for global entry, but it would be on a case-by-case basis.  </p><p>      Meanwhile, Senator, let's talk a little bit about the coronavirus. I -- you know, people have been freaking out over this because of the nature of it. And when you look at the new number of deaths --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMEADE</emphasis>:  Staggering.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  -- reported by China -- 254 new deaths; 15,000 new cases -- it brings into question whether or not we should trust the information that is coming to us from China.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  Do you trust them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  No, I don't trust them and I think that we can't trust them.  </p><p>      Listen, I was briefed not once but twice yesterday about the latest on the coronavirus from our health officials and Homeland Security officials. I have to say it's really, really concerning.  </p><p>      I think the Chinese government has not been honest at all about this. They are completely overwhelmed at this point. They are not leveling with anybody, certainly not with us.  </p><p>      And the Chinese Communist Party is creating a global health --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMEADE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  -- epidemic because of what they're doing, because they have lied, because they have not addressed this head-on, and they weren't prepared.  </p><p>      So, we've got to -- what that means for us is we've got to take every step in this country to keep our citizens safe, to keep our travelers safe, and -- because China certainly is not going to do it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMEADE</emphasis>:  Meanwhile, there's going to be a major overhaul proposed by you and others targeting Google and Facebook when it comes to privacy and other things. You're arguing that the agency is not capable of regulating itself.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  Big tech issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMEADE</emphasis>:  Big tech issues, the FTC.  </p><p>      So what do you plan on doing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Well, I think we've got, first of all, way too many bureaucracies out there that are accountable to nobody, and the FTC is a great example. They don't report to anybody.  </p><p>      They have gotten too cozy with big tech. You've got this big government, big tech alliance. It's time to break that up.  </p><p>      Make the FTC report to the Justice Department. Make them enforce the laws that we have to make sure that we're not censored. To make sure that our privacy is protected and big tech is held accountable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMEADE</emphasis>:  Do you have bipartisan support on this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  Yes, I hope that I will. You know, I've listened to a lot of my Democrat colleagues talk about the need for tougher enforcement. I say let's get the bureaucracy --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMEADE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWLEY</emphasis>:  -- actually doing what it's supposed to do. Let's make them accountable and let's get this done.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DOOCY</emphasis>:  You know, for the people watching, it's the FTC that is in charge of the do not call list and I had had it up to here over the last couple of days. I keep getting these spam calls. And finally, I reached out to somebody at the FTC and I said this is easily fixable because people are spoofing numbers to make it look like my next-door neighbor is calling from card services to negotiate a new rate.  </p><p>      FTC wrote me back and said you know what? You need to just hang up on it.  </p><p>      Is that all they can do?

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) thinks Silicon Valley is bad for economic and societal growth -- and he wants Congress to do something about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There is something deeply troubling -- even wrong -- about social media companies,\" he said at a tech event hosted by the Hoover Institution on May 2. \"Is Silicon Valley the best our best minds can offer?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley described how social media companies' entire business model is to get you on their platforms and keep you there -- in other words, addiction. Hawley said social media is likely a factor in the surge of teen suicides and overall rise of mental health issues like anxiety and depression.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley also accused Big Tech companies of crippling the free market in Silicon Valley. Hawley wants to ensure existing platforms don't stay entrenched and disadvantage small platforms.</p><p>\"As a free market guy, I think the steps we need to take are pro-competitive,\" he said. \"One of the things that concerns me about Silicon Valley is, I'm not sure how competitive it actually is. Let's be frank here, [Big Tech's] interest is in their bottom line.\"</p><p>Hawley and other tech experts at the event slammed Big Tech -- specifically Google -- for supporting policies to keep themselves entrenched as the dominant players in their markets. Some examples include net neutrality and Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act.</p><p>But not everyone at the Hoover Institution event agreed on the best way to address the issues. Some argued for an antitrust approach while others said the U.S. needs to brainstorm an entirely new regulatory framework to deal with tech giants.</p><p>Frank Pasquale, professor of law at the University of Maryland, started a panel discussion by describing how Google originally advocated for net neutrality because Google \"wanted assurance that internet service providers (ISPs) wouldn't block or throttle traffic\" for different websites.</p><p>Luther Lowe, senior vice president of public policy at Yelp, detailed how Google used the net neutrality crusade to cement its own dominant market position. When Google and other tech platforms -- like Yelp -- originally supported net neutrality, Lowe said everyone seemed to worry about ISPs discriminating against tech platforms.</p><p>But then, Lowe said, Google \"began to change the rules.\"</p><p>\"They began to siphon more traffic for itself,\" he told the event attendees. When you search for something on Google.com, he explained, \"you're steered into a Google house product.\"</p><p>Yelp accused Google of prioritizing traffic toward Google reviews of restaurants, retailers and other storefronts instead of Yelp reviews several times over the last decade.</p><p>Lowe said Yelp even created a Google Chrome extension to show how Google manipulates search results to direct traffic toward Google's own in-house products (like Google reviews) or websites that pay Google the most in advertising dollars, effectively proving that Google does not benefit consumers.</p><p>\"Consumers will be unwittingly mismatched to information because of the fast lanes Google gives itself,\" Lowe said.</p><p>Pasquale also pointed out that Google paid Apple $9 billion to make Chrome the default search engine on iOS, according to Goldman Sachs data, supporting Lowe's argument.</p><p>Former counsel for the House Judiciary Committee Dan Huff argued that lawmakers should be less concerned about ISPs than edge providers like Google engaging in discriminatory behavior.</p><p>\"The Democrats pushing the Save the Internet Act (which restores the Federal Communications Commission's 2015 Open Internet Order, which classifies ISPs as telecommunications providers subject to Title II regulation) don't seem to notice there are two components to the issue,\" Huff said, referring to Big Tech. \"You should be more worried about discrimination by platforms than discrimination by carriers.\"</p><p>In other words, they argued, net neutrality rules should address edge providers as well as ISPs.</p><p>The panelists also discussed Section 230 as another example of Google using public policy to entrench its market position. Section 230 grants tech platforms immunity from legal liability for what its users post or link to on the platform.</p><p>While restricting or rescinding Section 230 raises serious censorship concerns, the panelists pointed out how Google uses Section 230 protection to its advantage as a monopolistic tech payer.</p><p>\"They built a million dollar business on not being liable for copyrights,\" said Jeremy Carl, one of the panelists and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution.</p><p>His comment echoes the Oracle v. Google case, in which Oracle accuses Google of ripping off Oracle's application programming interface (API) platform, Java SE, for Android then making billions of dollars off Android.</p><p>Part of the reason Google was able to do this, explained Hoover research fellow Adam White, is because Google was so influential in the public's understanding of the internet.</p><p>White noted how Google's mission \"to organize the world's information and make it useful\" is inherently dangerous because it allows Google to define what \"information\" is and what \"useful\" means, essentially granting Google a monopoly over the very terms that define how we use the internet. It's also why Google got along so well with the Obama administration, he said.</p><p>\"I understand the impulse to go with antitrust,\" he said, referencing 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's plan and other lawmakers' comments to use antitrust law to break up Big Tech, \"but I think it's a little shortsighted. It might be a proxy for some of the problems. We need to think up an entirely new regulatory framework.\"</p><p>White warned that whatever the U.S. decides to do with Big Tech, they will be stuck with that regulatory precedent for decades, just like how the feds still use the 1934 Communications Act to regulate telecom.</p><p>\"I think we ought to think about forcing these companies to provide more disclosures and transparency [about how they operate],\" White said. \"We should start with transparency. Companies say they'll protect your data but they don't really consider it your data, they consider it their data that you've given them.\"</p><p>But Hawley and other members of Congress seem to be leaning towards the antitrust route.</p><p>At a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights hearing in March, Hawley advocated for using antitrust law against Big Tech. In November 2017, when he served as attorney general for the state of Missouri, he opened an antitrust investigation of Google on consumer protection and privacy issues, which is still ongoing.</p><p>\"You've got to have the rule of law for markets to function,\" he said at the Hoover tech event. \"This is a market so new to us that we haven't kept up. Is the market really well functioning when consumers don't know what's being taken from them (personal data) and can't meaningfully get it back?\"</p><p>As Pasquale said to end the panel discussion, \"We're sleepwalking into giving all of this power to these very large firms, and we might want to rethink that.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Mike Lee, R-Utah, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of you have asked about claims made by Tucker Carlson that Sen. Mike Lee \"has taken the side of big tech companies over your constitutional rights.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>To better understand what is really going on, please do read the following fact check of Tucker Carlson's claims below.</p><p>Tucker: \"Thanks to a special carve out Google has received from the United States Congress, something called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, Google itself is not responsible for the content on its platform because the Congress says it doesn't have to be.\"</p><p>Reality: Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was passed by Congress in 1996. Google didn't even exist until 1998. Since Section 230 was passed two years before Google even existed it is impossible for it to be a \"special carve out Google\" received from the government. Section 230 protects online platforms (like a website, app, etc.) from being liable for the content created by someone on their online platform. Under Section 230, all companies operating online platforms are responsible for their own content that they create on their platform. But they are not responsible for the content that is created by another person or company who uses their platform. The person who creates the content is responsible for the content.</p><p>Tucker: \"Immunity is a very nice thing to have if you are a big company, Fox News doesn't have it. But again, thanks to CongressGoogle does have immunity.\"</p><p>Reality: Section 230 applies to all companies equally. When Fox News operates its website, they do in fact have the exact same Section 230 protections that Google does. FoxNews.com has a comments section. And just as Google would be immune from any slanderous comments made by a commenter in a YouTube comments section, FoxNews.com is also immune from any slanderous comment made by a commenter in their comments section.</p><p>Tucker: \"We would love to ask Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) about this... Why do we ask him? Because Lee chairs the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. He is the man that could do something to protect you from Google.\"</p><p>Reality: Section 230 is telecommunications law. It has nothing to do with antitrust law. The Communications Decency Act is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee, not the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Antitrust Subcommittee. If people believe Section 230 is the key to protecting the American people from Google then they should look to amend communications law, not antitrust law.</p><p>Sen. Lee does share Tucker's concern about liberal progressive bias at Google, Facebook, Twitter, NBC News, CBS News, ABC News, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and National Public Radio.</p><p>What the NBC News' \"Verification Unit\" tried to do to The Federalist is absolutely a threat to honest and open speech in the United States. Conservatives should speak out against progressive attempts to silence conservative voices. And Sen. Lee did exactly that.</p><p>But our nation's antitrust laws, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, were not designed, nor are they equipped, to regulate political bias in technology or media companies.</p><p>If we are going to be successful in protecting Americans constitutional rights against progressive activists that want to silence Americans they disagree with, we need to be accurately informed about what the real dangers to our civil rights are. If we waste our time misunderstanding when laws were passed, why they were passed, and what they actually do, we will only make it easier for progressives to win.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7149224 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7149224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605S-2921-JC11-133C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><timeReceived>7:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 20, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Edward J. Markey, D-Massachusetts, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- New consumer rights guaranteed by strong federal compliance and consumer right to sue</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Data companies with security breaches can be fined</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and fellow senior members Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Ed Markey (D-MA) unveiled comprehensive federal online privacy legislation to establish privacy rights, outlaw harmful and deceptive practices, and improve data security safeguards for the record number of American consumers who now shop or conduct business online.</p><p>With new numbers showing that nearly sixty percent of all holiday spending will be done online--making this the largest online holiday shopping season ever --families everywhere want strong action taken to protect their online privacy and data security. Says former Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck: \"The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information.\"</p><p>The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) gives Americans control over their personal data; prohibits companies from using consumers' data to harm or deceive them; establishes strict standards for the collection, use, sharing, and protection of consumer data; protects civil rights; and penalizes companies that fail to meet data protection standards. The legislation also codifies the rights of individuals to pursue claims against entities that violate their data privacy rights</p><p>\"In the growing online world, consumers deserve two things: privacy rights and a strong law to enforce them,\" Ranking Member Cantwell said. \"They should be like your Miranda rights--clear as a bell as to what they are and what constitutes a violation.\"</p><p>\"When consumers let companies use their personal information they should be able to trust that it will be protected and won't be used to harm them,\" said Senator Schatz. \"Our bill lays out a set of strong data privacy rights for consumers, establishes robust obligations for companies, and gives prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used. Consumers have a right to know if their personal data is being sold and to easily see what data has already been distributed,\" said Senator Klobuchar. \"Our legislation establishes digital rules of the road for companies, ensures that consumers have the right to access and control how their personal data is being used, and gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable. It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>\"The demand for consumers' personal information today is at an all-time high,\" Senator Markey said. \"But while the appetite for our data has skyrocketed in recent years, Americans have not yet been given a set of strong, enforceable rights that protect us from privacy invasions. This bill gives consumers strong privacy protections, including prohibitions on harmful discriminatory uses of our data and strict data security requirements. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to enact a comprehensive federal privacy bill, which must include heightened protections for vulnerable populations, like children and teens.\"</p><p>This bill tackles teen privacy with new safeguards, recognizing the need to do more to protect children and young people's online privacy--a challenge that Senator Markey has been working hard to address and that should be included in comprehensive privacy legislation.</p><p>The full text of the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) can be found HERE (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-bill-text</url>).</p><p>A one-pager on the legislation can be found HERE (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/copra-one-pager</url>).</p><p>The just-released Commerce Committee report titled The State of Online Privacy and Data Security can be found HERE (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security\">https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/download/the-state-of-online-privacy-and-data-security</url>).</p><p>Consumer and civil rights advocates and privacy experts support the legislation:</p><p>Georgetown University Law Center Professor David Vladeck: \"This bill marks an important step forward for Congress. The bill gives consumers the right to regain control of their personal information --whether it is collected, and how it may be used. The bill not only codifies privacy as a right --a measure long overdue --but it also recognizes that 'rights' that are unenforceable are empty gestures. For that reason, the bill not only restores control of personal information to consumers, but equally important, the bill gives consumers and the Federal Trade Commission real tools to hold companies accountable when they collect information without permission, when they fail to reasonably safeguard consumers' information, or when they misuse that information. And the bill is careful to recognize that federal law can coexist with state privacy laws. Kudos to the bill's sponsors for their willingness to take on the internet giants, put the brakes on the indiscriminate and ubiquitous data collection and restore the ability of consumers to control their personal data.\" Former FTC Commissioner</p><p>Justin Brookman, Director of Privacy and Technology Policy at Consumer Reports: \"This is strong legislation that directly goes after companies that build secret profiles about what we do online and off. We appreciate the bill sponsors' leadership on data privacy, and we look forward to working with Congress to finally pass legislation to protect our personal information. This bill is an important step toward treating privacy as a fundamental right for all Americans.\"</p><p>University of Washington Law School Professor Ryan Calo: \"This legislation represents a sea change, particularly in the way federal law thinks about privacy harm. As the bill makes abundantly clear, violating the privacy rights and expectations of consumers is harmful in and of itself, a harm that must be redressed by regulators and courts. Such a statement by Congress is sorely needed and will have a big impact on consumer privacy in America.\"</p><p>Georgetown Law Center on Privacy &amp;#38; Technology Executive Director Laura Moy: \"For years, Americans have been clamoring for privacy--not just for incremental improvement, but for a transformative shift that will finally restore some sense of control to 21st century consumers. The Consumer Data Rights Act answers that call. It gives consumers meaningful rights and establishes robust enforcement mechanisms that will incentivize companies to comply. Just as important, this legislation directly addresses harmful uses of data, including discrimination. I applaud this bill and wholeheartedly hope to see it pass.\"</p><p>Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League: \"African Americans and people of color are over indexed as consumers of traditional and social media. As such, our data are uniquely vulnerable to exploitation, including civil liberties abuse, targeted disinformation campaigns designed to suppress the vote, and exclusion from employment, health, educational, and housing opportunities. I commend the bill sponsors for their leadership on the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act. This legislation is an important first step to ensure accountability from those who hold consumer data and the protection of civil rights in the 21st century. We look forward to working with House and Senate leadership on this bill as it becomes part of comprehensive privacy rights legislation.\"</p><p>The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law: \"In today's online economy, we have seen how the misuse of personal data can exacerbate discrimination in housing, employment, credit, and education. The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act prioritizes civil rights by ensuring that individuals' personal data cannot be used for discriminatory purposes and that big data algorithms are assessed for bias.\"</p><p>Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) Policy Director Caitriona Fitzgerald: \"The Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) is outstanding. The Consumer Data Rights Act gives consumers meaningful rights, holds companies accountable, and protects stronger state safeguards. EPIC reviewed the bills pending in Congress and has now given the Consumer Data Rights Act an A-. With the addition of a data protection agency, the bill would earn an A and establish a comprehensive approach for privacy protection for the U.S.\"</p><p>Federal Consumer Programs U.S. PIRG (and WashPIRG) Senior Director Edmund Mierzwinski: \"This strong privacy bill implements, among others, several principles any federal privacy bill must start with and then build onto. First, it grants consumers strong, enforceable rights against all privacy harms, explicitly including a violation of the act's provisions. Second, it preserves stronger state laws and the right of the states to innovate.\"</p><p>Mr. Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy: \"Research demonstrates that African Americans use social media at a disproportionately high rate; thus the NAACP is deeply appreciative of efforts to preserve the privacy of our data and to stop disinformation campaigns which may suppress and / or diffuse our voting power or limit our health, education, and employment opportunities to name a few. We look forward to working with the Ranking Member and the other sponsors of this important legislation whose intent is to protect our civil rights and civil liberties, and to protect our most basic personal information.\"</p><p>Ranking Member Cantwell has long been a leading advocate for online protections for American consumers. As Congress has worked to develop privacy legislation, she has repeatedly called for comprehensive privacy protections. She has led the fight to protect and restore net neutrality rules to keep a free and open internet. She has also championed the importance of investing in cybersecurity measures throughout the U.S. economy and pushed federal agencies like the FTC to take a more robust role in protecting Americans from privacy threats.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6941220 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6941220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKV-CPD1-JC11-11N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1821\"/><timeReceived>7:56 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Edward J. Markey, D-Massachusetts, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- New Senate Dem Principles - A Framework For Comprehensive Federal Privacy Legislation - Would Strengthen Consumer And Civil Rights, Invigorate Competition, Establish Privacy Safeguards And Impose Real Accountability</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Led By Senators Maria Cantwell (Commerce Committee), Dianne Feinstein (Judiciary Committee), Sherrod Brown (Banking Committee) And Patty Murray (HELP Committee), Senate Democrats Say New Principles Should Be The Baseline For Any Comprehensive Federal Privacy And Data Security Legislation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The top Democrats across four key Senate committees (Commerce, Judiciary, Banking, and HELP) today unveiled a new set of core principles they say should be the baseline for any comprehensive federal privacy and data protection legislation. Under the new framework agreed upon by Senate Committee on Commerce Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, Senate Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Ranking Member Sherrod Brown, and Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Ranking Member Patty Murray, consumers would be able to control their personal information, and corporations, non-profits, and political entities would be held to higher standards for when and how they collect, use, share and protect consumer data.</p><p>Specifically, the privacy principles strengthen individual consumer and civil rights protections, including for children and teens, invigorate competition by increasing consumer choice, establish data safeguards to ensure use abides by consumer expectations and increase accountability over data practices by those at the highest levels of organizations. The principles also put more teeth into enforcement by ensuring that both regulators and individuals have the tools they need to aggressively identify harmful or invasive privacy practices and pursue legal remedies.</p><p>The group of Senate Democratic Ranking Members first came together after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer tasked the committees of primary jurisdiction over various privacy and data protection issues, like data security and civil rights, with developing principles to fill in the serious gaps in consumer protection not currently covered by existing federal laws and provide a strong nationwide foundation for comprehensive federal legislation. Senators Ron Wyden, Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz and Ed Markey, four of the Senate's leading advocates for comprehensive privacy protections, were also consulted and support the new principles.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of laws that are designed to protect privacy, however these laws provide specific privacy protections and are limited in scope by data types such as credit information protected by the Financial Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), protected health information created and maintained by payers and providers of healthcare, as is governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or safeguards afforded to children's data by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The newly unveiled principles should not be interpreted to change or displace existing privacy laws, or privacy laws scheduled to go into effect.</p><p>The Senate Democrats' privacy principles can be found here.</p><p>\"In an ever-evolving information age, consumers deserve to have protections from websites and online services harvesting their personal data. They deserve to have privacy rights and have those rights protected,\" said Senator Cantwell.</p><p>\"Individuals should have the ability to control their personal data, period. To prevent companies from abusing our personal data, we need to create more transparency and accountability and allow individuals to determine how their data is used. That is what we hope to accomplish with this framework,\" said Senator Feinstein.</p><p>\"Too many corporations require Americans to sacrifice their privacy and share the most intimate details of their lives just to visit a website or to receive and use services,\" said Senator Brown. \"We must establish rules that take the power away from companies like Facebook, Equifax, and others to violate Americans' privacy for profits and give it back to hardworking Americans.\"</p><p>\"As data continues to play an important new role in families' lives in the 21st century, we need to make sure the constant development of new technology is matched by the development of new best practices and protections that speak to the needs for security, privacy, and good data stewardship,\" said Senator Murray. \"People should be able to expect tech companies are going to treat their most sensitive information responsibly, and give them the tools they need to be able to control how and when their information is disclosed. Our objective should be to make sure tech companies are putting people in the driver's seat, not the other way around.\"</p><p>\"I applaud my colleagues for their great work and am proud to support these strong principles,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>\"I've said for more than a year now that corporations need to mind their own business when it comes to misusing Americans' private information. These principles make clear that Democrats support strong new protections for Americans' data, unprecedented transparency over how our information is used, and new enforcement with teeth that will hold corporations accountable,\" said Senator Wyden. \"Leader Schumer and Ranking Members Cantwell, Feinstein, Brown and Murray deserve enormous credit for putting together a tough, comprehensive list of principles to protect Americans' private data and put consumers back in control of their most sensitive information.\"</p><p>\"I know from having fought for stronger privacy protection over decades, federal action is woefully overdue and urgently necessary now. I will continue to work for bipartisan federal action because Americans absolutely want stronger privacy protection,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"They know from painful experience that the intimate details of our personal lives are used against us every day by unaccountable corporations and foreign actors, deeply endangering our safety and democracy. Americans deserve and rightly expect stronger privacy safeguards, regardless of their politics or their personal circumstance. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass--as soon as possible--new privacy laws that are as strong and comprehensive as possible.\"</p><p>\"We need to update our privacy laws for the internet age.\" said Senator Schatz. \"When consumers let companies use their information they should be able to trust that it will be protected, used ethically, and won't be used to harm them. These principles provide a framework for clear rules of the road for companies, and would give prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"The American people are overdue for a privacy bill of rights that puts consumers first and effectively protects our personal information. And any comprehensive privacy legislation must include heightened safeguards for children and teens, who are uniquely vulnerable in today's digital age,\" said Senator Markey. \"We cannot afford to shrug off the daily data breaches and privacy invasions as a new normal. I am pleased to work with my colleagues on this framework for comprehensive privacy legislation, and I look forward to continuing this important collaboration.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6931352 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6931352</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ4-M7D1-JC11-153Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1260\"/><timeReceived>8:34 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Mark Warner (D-VA) released a 23-page white paper this week detailing about 20 policy proposals for regulating social media companies and big tech companies so that incidents like the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal are not repeated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warner lauds Silicon Valley for their groundbreaking technological innovations, but says the current business model \"involves offering nominally free services, but which results in consumers providing ever-more data in exchange for continued usage,\" which he believes means \"these tech giants\" -- including Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Twitter --  now deserve \"increased scrutiny.\"</p><p>The paper outlines three ways Warner believes tech companies should be regulated: 1) to stop the spread of \"disinformation\" and \"fake news,\" 2) to better protect and facilitate consumer privacy, and 3) to encourage competition and prevent a handful of platforms from dominating the market.</p><p>\"The size and reach of these platforms demand that we ensure proper oversight, transparency and effective management of technologies that in large measure undergird our social lives, our economy, and our politics,\" Warner states in the paper. \"Numerous opportunities exist to work with these companies, other stakeholders, and policymakers to make sure that we are adopting appropriate safeguards to ensure that this ecosystem no longer exists as the 'Wild West' -- unmanaged and not accountable to users or broader society -- and instead operates to the broader advantage of society, competition, and broad-based innovation.\"</p><p>The whole paper is call for tech companies to claim responsibility for the data-sharing practices and information services they use -- something which Facebook has repeatedly evaded in congressional hearings and interviews.</p><p>For example, Warner believes tech companies have a \"duty to clearly and conspicuously label bots, ...determine origin of posts and/or accounts,\" and \"identify inauthentic accounts\" to stop the spread of misinformation on social media.</p><p>Regarding the latter, Warner also wrote, \"Failure to appropriately address inauthentic account activity -- or misrepresentation of the extent of the problem -- could be considered a violation of both SEC disclosure rules and/or Section 5 of the FTC Act.\"</p><p>Warner says Congress should consider making \"platforms liable for state-law torts (defamation, false light, public disclosure of private facts) for failure to take down deep fake or other manipulated audio/video content,\" and floated the idea of a Public Interest Data Access Bill \"to allow researchers to measure and audit social trends on platforms. This would ensure that problems on, and misuse of, the platforms were being evaluated by researchers and academics, helping generate data and analysis that could help inform actions by regulators or Congress.\"</p><p>He suggests requiring tech companies to obtain first party consent for data collection, giving the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) more regulatory power to \"police data protection and unfair competition in digital markets,\" and a \"comprehensive (GDPR-like) data protection legislation.\"</p><p>While the policy proposals Warner discusses in the paper are still just proposals, they do show lawmakers increasingly seeking out regulatory solutions to recent big data scandals like Facebook-Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Technology think tanks almost predicted some kind of regulation for tech companies that collect private user data, and they are already diving deep into the issues.</p><p>Research on the subject has been conducted as early as 2013, but not all experts think the focus on regulating companies' treatment of user privacy is the key to preventing an incident like Facebook-Cambridge Analytica from happening again.</p><p>The nonpartisan Technology Policy Institute's President and Senior Research Fellow Scott Wallsen wrote in an article for RealClearPolitics that \"while the users whose data was taken were not directly harmed, anyone whose voting behavior changed because of misinformation targeted with the help of that data was harmed. This private harm aggregates to larger social harms if it affected the outcomes of any elections.\"</p><p>He continues to say that \"Regardless of whether one believes European-style privacy rules would be a net benefit, they are not a response to the problem at hand. After all, strict privacy rules did not prevent similar election interference in Europe,\" and that Facebook's real responsibility is to stop the spread of misinformation campaigns -- which Warner's paper addresses.</p><p>The nonpartisan Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) noted in a 2017 paper that to efficiently address user privacy and give more control back to users, third parties may need to \"perform state-mandated impact assessments of data-management practices, advocating for users' interests and creating greater transparency,\" especially if companies fail to improve transparency and \"self-regulate.\"</p><p>The paper also advocates for a \"multipronged approach,\" arguing regulation alone will not fix the issue but that private sector transparency and media literacy among individuals are also key.</p><p>Furthermore, the CDT wrote in a June paper that not all companies collecting personal information -- especially nonprofit organizations -- may have the resources to handle that data responsibly.</p><p>\"Many are not equipped...to implement sophisticated legal, technical, and ethical compliance regimes or to understand how certain data collection, use, and sharing activities could put the communities they serve at risk,\" the paper reads.</p><p>Big tech companies like Facebook and the others mentioned by Warner may have the resources to comply with future regulations regarding data collection and user privacy, but smaller companies and small businesses may not, which could put them at a competitive disadvantage.</p><p>While regulations like the European Union's GDPR are touted as the solution to improving individual privacy rights, concerns over whether an American version would stifle tech innovation may prevent such a comprehensive regulation from taking off in the U.S.</p><p>The CDT was unable to grant InsideSources' request for comment.</p><p>___ (c)2018 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Mark Warner said he doesn't favor breaking up U.S. tech giants, for now, telling CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" he's wary of having their Chinese equivalents take their place. \"These are all global companies. Frankly, to have them replaced by Alibaba or Baidu or Tencent \u2013 Chinese companies may not be the better alternative,\" Warner said. Warner's remarks came a day after four U.S. tech CEOs \u2013 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google and Apple's Tim Cook \u2013 testified before  Congress on antitrust and anti-competitive behavior.  Sen. Mark Warner isn't taking a break-up of U.S. tech giants off the table, but said Thursday he's wary of having their Chinese equivalents take their place.   \"I'm not in the break-'em-up category \u2013 yet,\" said Warner, D-Va., when asked  on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" about how companies like Facebook , Apple , Google and Amazon could be regulated.   \"These are all global companies. Frankly, to have them replaced by Alibaba or Baidu or Tencent \u2013 Chinese companies may not be the better alternative,\" Warner said.   \"What I would rather start with, keeping break-up as a reserve option, is, what can we do to add more competition?\" said Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former businessman in the telecommunications industry.   Warner's remarks came a day after four U.S. tech CEOs \u2013 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google and Apple's Tim Cook \u2013 testified before  Congress on antitrust and anti-competitive behavior .   The more than six-hour grilling before the House Antitrust Subcommittee, led by Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., touched on a wide range of topics, including a fixation from multiple Republican members on the alleged suppression of conservative speech .   The executives defended their companies throughout the hearing against accusations of political bias and unfair competitive advantage in the marketplace.   \"Some of the CEOs' testimony was a little bit self serving,\" Warner said on CNBC.   But rather than immediately move to break up those tech giants, Warner said regulators should press for changes including increased transparency in how the companies handle the massive amounts of data they hoard from their users.    \"If we had data portability \u2013 if you're tired of how you're being treated with Youtube or Facebook, you ought to be able to easily move your data to a new platform and still have it interoperable with those of your friends who remain on Facebook.\"   \"I think we ought to have more transparency. I think you ought to be able to know what your data is worth on an either monthly or quarterly basis, so we get rid of this misnomer that somehow these services are free,\" he said.   \"They take your data, they monetize it \u2013 there's nothing wrong with that, but we ought to at least know as consumers how much that data is worth.\"   \"I think there are a series of pro-competition rules of the road that I would much rather use first before I immediately default to the break-up camp.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42721820513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-FV11-F07F-84VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell driving markets this morning. Take a look. Futures pointing to a gain at the start of trading after Powell signaled a rate cut maybe on the way. The Dow futures up 89 points, S&amp;P up six, NASDAQ up 19 points right now. The NASDAQ hitting new intraday high ad closed at a new high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, all the indices hit all new intraday high but it's the only NASDAQ to finish there. The S&amp;P 500 crossed 3,000 yesterday, the NASDAQ as I said at a record-high this morning t 82.02. European indices pretty much flat today. Take a look, FT-100 down two points, CAC quarante up six, DAX index in Germany lower by 22. Minutes from last month's ECB meeting just released saying that the members agreed on the need be ready to provide more stimulus to Eurozone in an environment of heightened uncertainty from the European Central Bank.</p><p>Not a lot of movement in markets, post that. That's basically what we heard from Mario Draghi last week as well. Asian markets were higher this -- overnight, take a look, pretty much higher across the board, a fractional move in China. Escalating tensions with Iran meanwhile. Iranian gunboats tried to seize a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz but the attempt warded after a British warship intervened.</p><p>Delta raised guidance for the year, it's also raising its dividend. The airline reporting a profit beat on higher travel demand and raising its profit guidance. the stock is up better than two percent as the company also takes dividends up. The world's highest-paid entertainers, Kanye West coming in at number three on the Forbes list. Find out you who is earning top dollar. And Steve Forbes is here with us this morning.</p><p>All of that coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, assistant editorial page editor for the Wall Street Journal, James Freeman, and Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be here. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really good show. A lot of interesting interviews as well, talking about the issues of the day. What's most important to you?</p><p>FORBES: Right now is the Federal Reserve. And yes, they're all focusing on interest rates but I'm concerned about getting a non-Fed person on that board. Judy Shelton, they already did a bank shot yesterday with Powell going against the gold standard as a way of hitting her and there is going to be a big battle ahead but we got to get diversity on the Federal Reserve board.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want a dissident there?</p><p>FORBES: Yes. They need to ask hard questions. The idea of the prosperity causing inflation, that's got to be attacked.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. By the way, that's exactly what Charles Plosser just said. Former president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve was here.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And said, what's wrong with prosperity and no inflation?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Shelton is a rock star and, you know, people have talked about President Trump with the -- with the kooky tweets and the rest of it might have trouble attracting talented people to his administration. Here's another outstanding potential hire assuming Senate confirmation. She called the collapse of the Soviet Union, that's one of the -- one of the great calls in history and a lot of smart writing in research since then.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And also, speaking of hires, Alex Acosta, the labor secretary, only thing you need to point out is he's essentially -- his main job is to promote how awesome the job market is and how great job growth is. Wages growing at the fastest pace of 10 years. Is he a distraction? Can he do that job going forward? Who do we see on jobs day? Larry Kudlow, we see Kevin Hassett all the time, the economic adviser.</p><p>Not really Alex Acosta. So why is he there and is he a distraction in the weeks and months to come if he stays around? I just raised that issue but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: No --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, so you're there to promote labor policy, the great -- the great job market, and it's all of this too much?</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're watching that for sure.</p><p>FORBES: The labor department has been doing some good things removing barriers to hiring that don't get much publicity part of this deregulation push.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And skills training.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is another important element there. We're talking about all of that this morning. And our top story right now President Trump is posting a social media summit at the White House later day. Blake Burman live at the White House right now with the very latest. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. We got our very first surprise of the day over here at the White House. At 6:39 this morning it came via Twitter as President Trump announced that after that social media summit here at the White House there will also be a news conference regarding the issue of the citizenship question on the census.</p><p>Let's sort of break this down one by one. The President later went on to Twitter as well to talk about the social media summit and he said the following, he wrote, \"A big subject today at the White House. Social media summit will be a tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practice by certain companies. We will not let them get away with it much longer.\" As you can see at the end of the tweet there, he also followed up with several others.</p><p>He then went on to rail against what calls the fake news media. Now, after that summit, the expectation is the President will announce his course of action, regarding the census and the citizenship question. Earlier this week, the President talked up the possibility of an executive order as the Supreme Court has recently kicked the matter back to a lower court, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll see what happens. We can also add an addition on so we can start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we're working on a lot of things, including an executive order.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Now, if the President goes the route of an executive order, Maria, you can certainly expect the lawsuits to follow after that, because the current dynamic right now is this. This is still a matter that is being handled in the court system and as it relates to the census, the census is already being printed. The President clearly doesn't like that dynamic or where everything stands right now and he is potentially trying to change all of that. We'll see how he tries to go about it later today. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Blake. Thanks so much. Blake Burman with the latest there. Joining me right now is Tennessee Senator, member of the Judiciary and Armed Services Committee is Marsha Blackburn. Senator, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): Good to see you. Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we're talking about this White House summit, you're urging big tech to protect young children. What do you want to see at a big technology?</p><p>BLACKBURN: What I would like to see out of big tech is some responsibility and accountability. And Maria, they go in and subjectively manipulate their algorithms and then opens the doors that it ought not to children like the Snapchat letter that I sent this week. Deals with the way pornography is made public on their site. And this is made available, the ratings are wrong on these apps, children are seeing this, they need to adjust those ratings.</p><p>And also, parents need to be aware. You need to give parents the tools to block this. These videos that are deleted, this becomes a child predator's dream for contacting these children and there are several cases where pedophiles have used Snapchat to contact and to coerce these children.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. That's unbelievable.</p><p>BLACKBURN: It is unbelievable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It feels like this is one issue big tech hits at both corners and both sides of the aisle, you've got people like Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both saying that they want to break these companies up. Do you want to see breakups of some of these large companies that are today, as you know, more powerful than we've ever known?</p><p>BLACKBURN: Well, I think where we start is with privacy issue. And yesterday, Chris Hughes, who was the co-founder of Facebook was in my office, and we had a very productive discussion about how you deal with privacy and giving consumers the toolbox to protect this -- I term (ph, their virtual hue themselves online. So you start with privacy and data security, you look at how the social media giants are prioritizing their content over content that should be readily available online.</p><p>And I'm going to have a meeting later today with the CEO of Yelp concerning this, issue because they're conducting -- Google prioritizes their content, so that determines what people see, what they have access to. We're also going to look at censorship and antitrust and say do these companies need to reposition themselves? But I think first, you look at the privacy issue and you determine how that forces the media companies to adjust their business model.</p><p>Right now, they are -- they built their business model on a no holds barred, they do not have to inform you that they are taking your data, that they are mining your data, that they are positioning your data to be sold to the highest bidder who is going to market back to you or is going to go through and sift your data and then determine what they want to push forward to you in the method of videos or articles.</p><p>It's like with YouTube. You look at one video then they fill a stream with similar videos.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, real quick, I want to move to the border but let me -- let me end this here on this, because when I spoke with the President a couple of weeks ago, he said, look, we might need legislation which will spur competition. Do you want to see regulation for these companies?</p><p>BLACKBURN: The BROWSER Act is legislation that deals with the privacy issue that I introduced in the House. I have reintroduced that in the Senate and we are working to move that forward to get those guardrails in place. And to do first, like touch --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN: -- like touch, but to put those parameters in place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Understood. Let me move to the crisis at the border, Senator, because Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents are reportedly preparing to conduct raids beginning Sunday to arrest thousands of illegal immigrants across the country. The move coming weeks after President Trump said that the operation was first being delayed. You're headed to the southern border with Vice President Mike Pence tomorrow.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you expecting? And do you think we're ever going to get our arms around these loopholes that are encouraging so many illegals, migrants to flood the border?</p><p>BLACKBURN: The thing is we have to get our hands around the loopholes, and we have to plug these loopholes if you will, and make certain that those who are coming to our country come here legally. The border patrol -- I was down there, a couple of months ago and they are in desperate need of some help, and my hope is that our Democrat colleagues will begin to work with us to give the border patrol the three things they continue to say they need, they have been saying this for 20 years. Give them a barrier, give them appropriate technology, give them more officers, agents, and judges to deal with this issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But let's be honest, they don't want the President to have a victory. They -- I mean some people on Democrats side hate him so much that they're just going to try to make a point and not do anything about this issue. Do you really see anything getting done?</p><p>BLACKBURN: Maria -- yes. I've got to tell you, they need to get over their pettiness and they need to put this nation and our sovereignty and the protection of the American people first.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I understand.</p><p>BLACKBURN: They need to -- they need to stop this human trafficking, sex trafficking, drug trafficking that is taking place on our border. Every town is a border down, every state is a border state, because of the drugs and the human trafficking coming through. They need to get over themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Because all these people --</p><p>BLACKBURN: They lost that election, they need to work for the good of the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All these people are coming to the border in facing these situations where before they even get to the border, they've got to deal with the drug lords, so there is that.</p><p>BLACKBURN: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then, you know, they don't want to do anything there, but there's also an issue on trade. So let me ask you about USMCA.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is the likelihood that the -- that the bill comes to the floor for a vote in the fall?</p><p>BLACKBURN: The votes are there. If Pelosi were to put it on the floor today, it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So why isn't she?</p><p>BLACKBURN: I think that there -- again, you're looking at people that say \"Well do we want to give Donald Trump a victory?\" Give the American people a victory. The unions are for this, the farmers are for this, come on, guys. Put it on the floor --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So you don't know -- you don't know is the answer if she's going to bring it to the floor by fall. Is that what you were saying?</p><p>BLACKBURN: She should bring it to the fall -- to the floor next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly. OK. Let me ask about China. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is going to be meeting with members to discuss USMCA. I spoke with Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short on the program yesterday. He is the one who said it's probably going to come to the floor in the fall. What's plan B if she doesn't bring it to the floor? I mean, could that happen that she actually doesn't bring it to the floor?</p><p>BLACKBURN: I think she will see what happened to the border funding bill before last where you will see the moderates in her caucus say, \"Come on, Nancy, let's get with it. Let's get this job done.\" And when you have the unions and so many of the trade groups all saying \"USMCA, let's push it forward,\" she needs to say -- she and Steny need to say, let's put it on the floor and call the vote, let chips fall where they may.</p><p>Let Nancy and Steny declare victory by being able to move something forward. We need to get this thing done. When it comes to China, we're going to continue to encourage holding that line against Huawei. China will steal our intellectual property, they will embed chips and builds Huawei as a spy network in that equipment and consumer products. We need to make certain that we deal with that issue and not give them an edge. We know what they're up to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you certainly have been keeping -- and the President has been keeping his boot on the neck of the Chinese on this issue for sure. Senator, it's good to see you as always. Thanks so much.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Good to see you. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marsha Blackburn joining us there. Coming up. We are awaiting June consumer prices. The CPI is due out in 15 minutes time. The economists are expecting it to be unchanged. Zero percent. We are bringing you the number. We'll see if markets get impacted there. It came up yesterday in the Fed's talk. Then fame and fortune. Forbes' coveted list of highest-paid celebrities is out. The star topping, Kylie Jenner is next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Shares of Delta airlines rallying the premarket this morning. A lot of news there. Cheryl Casone on it right now.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: A lot to unpack, Maria, with these earnings. These are the second-quarter results. They beat expectations both the top and the bottom line. They had strong demand for travel, especially for premium class tickets. They also raised a profit guidance for the year. They did raise their quarterly dividend as well. Take a look at the stock of the premarket, it's up two percent.</p><p>Now, remember, they don't fly any Boeing 737 Max jets. Those, of course, have been grounded following two deadly crashes. Now to a different earnings story this morning. This is Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. Adjusted profit coming in better than expected but revenue fell from a year ago and it actually missed the forecast the street had on them. The stock is down more than 40 percent from a year ago. And as you can see, it's trading down almost four percent in the premarket right now. Two stocks a to watch for you today.</p><p>Also, Lockheed Martin is going to be staying in Pennsylvania. The defense giant keeping a helicopter plant open there after President Trump called for it. The President tweeted after the news was released \"I was just informed by Marillyn Hewson, CEO of Lockheed Martin of decision to keep -- this of course, the helicopter plant in Coatesville, Pennsylvania open and humming. We are very proud of Pennsylvania and the people who work here -- work there. Thank you to Lockheed Martin. One of the USA's great companies.</p><p>And she may be worth a billion dollars but Kylie Jenner is not the world's highest-paid celebrity. This is all for Steve Forbes I think. Shaking it up at the top of the Forbes list, Taylor Swift earned $185 million over the past year. OK. Jenner has now slouched, she came in number two, $170 million. And there are your top five guys of the Forbes list, I'll say that again, musician Kanye West, soccer star Lionel Messi, and musician Ed Sheeran. Interesting names there on that list, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Really are. The Forbes list, something that we look forward to. It's great list. I love the list that Forbes puts together, Steve, because it really gives you a sense of --the equitable amount of wealth in this country.</p><p>FORBES: Wealth and entrepreneurship. We got criticized of putting Kylie Jenner on our cover a year ago. So, saying she's a self-made -- come a self-made billionaire.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: And by golly she is doing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure is. All right. Quick break. And then we are waiting the CPI, the consumer price index due out in 10 minutes time. Economists expected to be unchanged. We'll bring you the numbers, see if it impacts markets, next. Then the Fed in focus. Futures higher this morning rallying after the testimony yesterday hopes that we're going to see a rate cut in a couple of weeks. What you need to know ahead of the open this morning. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets hit record-highs yesterday after Fed Chairman Powell's testimony before Congress. He indicated that a rate cut could be coming later this month. We are looking at more gains today. Dow Industrials up 113 points. S&amp;P up seven and the NASDAQ up 23. This right here, this is the high of the morning. Joining us right now is Invesco Vice Chairman of Investments, Krishna Memani. Great to see you, Krishna.</p><p>KRISHNA MEMANI, VICE CHAIRMAN OF INVESTMENTS, INVESCO: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You said we are looking at further gains, your call is five more years of a bull market.</p><p>MEMANI: Yes. So five more years of growth and therefore five more years of a bull market. The key point that I would like to make is the lack of inflationary pressures in the global economy provides the central bankers the flexibility that they need to manufacture economic outcomes. They're not being forced into a corner, much the way the Fed did in 2018 if things get hot and heavy and they start tightening at the -- at the right moment they have the flexibility to pivot. That's what they did and that's why it's probably going lower for a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How come they don't act like that, Steve? I mean, this is -- it's like we have been having this debate all morning about why the Fed doesn't believe that prosperity is possible without inflation never do anything about it.</p><p>FORBES: No. You don't feel that if the economy starts to do well they're going to talk about overheating, your incomes are going up, so you're sweating at night, you got to cool it off.</p><p>MEMANI: Instinctively, they are still working off of all data sets. You know, in their mind they have been -- unemployment rate gets to a certain level, it will reach -- lead to inflationary pressures. Unfortunately, that's not how things have worked out in the cycle -- for most of the cycle. So I think, they don't like the current environment but I think they are adjusting to the --</p><p>FORBES: Actually they're a lagging indicator.</p><p>MEMANI: Oh, absolutely. Intellectually, they still believe in the Phillips curve although Phillips curve hasn't materialized so far in this cycle and it's unlikely to because the global economy is very different. Globalization, demographic pressures technology keeps inflation under control, that allows overall rates to be far more stimulative --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: What about political travels in New York spilling over? Do you see any threats there?</p><p>MEMANI: Well -- so, you know, if you go back in the cycle 2011, 2012, we had far more political trouble in euro but we were on the verge of -- Europe breaking up the common currency going down and didn't materialize. And I think what we need to do is make sure that at the right pivot points, somebody comes up like Draghi in 2011 to support the economy. So, I think as long as we don't make -- we don't make mistakes, we don't have our own goals, the global growth can continue for a bit.</p><p>FORBES: And the markets down by.</p><p>MEMANI: So -- I think, the markets are going to be driven ultimately by globe economy, and global economy overall continues to do well, the emerging markets --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thank so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday. We have breaking news, another important read -- June consumer prices due out in a couple of seconds. Economists are expecting it to be unchanged month-over-month, but up 1.6 percent year-over-year. The Consumer Price Index is basically measuring prices at the cash register. Are we actually seeing consumers pay more for goods when they are at the register? Month-over-month, it's up one-tenth of a percent, the numbers are out, one-tenth of a percent is certainly higher than we were expecting. Lauren Simonetti with more on the CPI right now. Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We are getting the numbers for the Consumer Price Index, Maria. And market reaction not liking this. A little bit hotter for the month-over-month number for the month of June, a rise of one-tenth of one percent. The market was expecting a flat reading. Year-over-year in line, 1.6 percent. Just looking through the numbers a little bit more right now, Maria, give me one quick second. If I can do the -- I can't get the breakdown at this moment, but I will check back and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The year-over-year -- Lauren, the year-over-year --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- at 1.6 percent is pretty much in line with expectations, and obviously --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- we want to look at this number, because the Federal Reserve continues to say that the inflationary story is below its two percent target, and we're seeing that again at 1.6 percent year-over-year.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Let me get to the core number here, Maria, if I can. This is ex-food and energy, which are more volatile. We were expecting 0.2 percent. This came in hotter at 0.3 percent, so a little bit more inflation in this June CPI read. The year-over-year core read also a tad bit higher at 2.1 percent versus the two percent expectation. So that is some more information from this report.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We are not seeing a major move, but certainly markets have cooled off from the highs of the morning.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well, right --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dow Industrials --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Right --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- before this, the Dow was up 111 seconds before, now it's up 69. The S&amp;P was up seven moments before this report, seconds before. Now it's up two points. So, we do have -- we're looking at a higher open, but nonetheless, we have come off those highs. How much, if at all, does this change the leeway the Fed has to do --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's --</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- to do a cut in a couple weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We are definitely seeing the markets come off of the highs. Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll keep reading these numbers and see what they tell us. And joining us right now is Former Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, Robert Hormats joining the conversation right now. Bob, it's good to see you.</p><p>ROBERT HORMATS, FORMER UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, ENERGY, AND THE ENVIRONMENT: Great to be with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you look at a CPI number like this, you say what? What does this tell us?</p><p>HORMATS: A -- first of all, I don't pay a lot of attention to month-to- month number, second, if there is anything moving it up a little bit, it's -- we've had a decline in healthcare cost for a while. Maybe they're beginning to trickle up a little bit. Housing may be going up a tiny bit. But in general, with a very competitive global environment, we don't have to worry too much about a deflation, and a slight increase in inflation is not really troublesome.</p><p>I do think if we get into a real trade war and prices go up because of higher tariffs, that will be inflationary, but it's also, in a way, going to slow growth, because it's an effective tax, so that may be looked at one way as inflation, another way as actually growth slowing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm wondering about the case for a rate cut, Fed Chairman Jay Powell talking about uncertainties just fighting it. You hear the same kind of similar message from Europe, if President Trump tweets tomorrow morning that Xi of China is a great guy and this beautiful country is going to lower tariffs, does that mean they raise rates?</p><p>HORMATS: Well, I must say I'm very uncomfortable with the point that he links this in rhetoric, perhaps not so much in decision-making, but certainly on what he said to the uncertainty over a trade war, because as you correctly point out, a lot of what's going on in trade is short-term, some of it is negotiating tactics.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>HORMATS: We don't know what's going to happen three or four months from now. There is uncertainty, but if there's a deal with China and they're all eliminated, does that cause the Fed to change its mind? If it gets worse, does that cause the Fed to get even more concerned and lower rates further? But to trigger trade policy -- you have trade policy in effect, trigger Fed policy to me is not a comfortable thing because it's so volatile, so unpredictable, and it can change week-to-week, month-to-month, day-to-day, hour-to-hour. The Fed shouldn't focus on those kind of short- term things. If it's a long-term trade war, that's a different matter. But a lot of this is tactical.</p><p>FORBES: On the trade front, do you have worries about autos that -- that's going to be worrisome?</p><p>HORMATS: Yes, I think it would be a terrible thing if we start -- first of all, the national security argument for restricting, putting tariffs on autos, to me, just doesn't make much sense. Second, it'll have a major impact on a lot of consumers, and third, what we should be doing is getting allies among our major trading partners, the Japanese, the Europeans and working with them to deal with global trade issues. If we take very tough action against them --</p><p>FORBES: Do you think -- do you think tariffs are going to get caught up in the dispute with France over them putting taxes on our --</p><p>HORMATS: Well, I think there will be some dispute and some retaliatory measures by the United States. I would hope that we don't use a sledgehammer, and auto tariffs would certainly be a sledgehammer. Very disruptive, not just to the American consumer, but to the global trading system. And at a time when you need allies, if you're going to try to get our rules of the global order accepted by the rest of the world, you don't want to be making enemies among the countries that have the closest sets of views on the market to those that we have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you -- what do you think of the revenue that this country is taking in? I mean the president will always push back when you -- when you criticize tariffs and say, \"I've taken in a hundred billion dollars, I'm going to be taking in a hundred billion dollars in revenue as a result of these tariffs on China.\"</p><p>HORMATS: Oh, I think this argument has gotten so confusing. Americans pay the tariffs. Now the Chinese may, in some cases, lower the price of certain goods to be able to clear the American market, but the tariff is a tax. Who pays the tax? Americans pay the tax. Second, the amount of money paid by almost all accounts has been something in the order of 20, $20-plus billion, it's not a hundred billion dollars.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>HORMATS: So, I think we have to look at it --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think he's talking about the final -- the final $325 billion (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HORMATS: Well, if we were to do --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HORMATS: If we were to do it. And so far, it's around $20 billion. If we were to do that, Americans would still pay the tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HORMATS: The problem is then you would have a slowing of growth, prices would go up, growth would probably slow because it is a tax. Other countries would and there is some argument here that we wouldn't pay the whole burden, we would pay the taxes but prices that other countries charge us, the exporters of China for instance, charge us would probably go down in order to clear the market at a lower price, but the tariff payments by Americans, the final price may not be as high as the tariffs, because the Chinese may, in effect, cut the sales tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think there's full agreements on this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well -- but let me phrase it. Let me position it like this. U.S. corporations ship these jobs overseas. They used to be good-paying jobs with a safety net here in the United States, and they essentially ship them overseas for what was a boost to their profits. Politicians sat back and went, \"That's fine with us,\" until there was an uproar and President Trump gets elected.</p><p>We now have what is essentially, with these tariffs on Chinese imports, a - -it's not a border tax, but it's a value-added tax on goods coming into this country, but at the same time, they cut corporate taxes, so there is that offset. So, it's actually almost -- if you look at it from 35,000 feet, a change in the way that we tax, we incentivize saving, we -- basically tax spending, if you will, discourage spending in the U.S., and we have the offset of the corporate tax cut here in the United States. It's kind of brilliant if you look at it from an economic perspective.</p><p>HORMATS: Well, the corporate tax cut, I totally agree. That's a very positive thing. What I think is part of the equation here, particularly if this is a longer term trade war, is that the notion of supply chains is going to be changed. There are companies that are moving their source of supply out of China into Vietnam, into Mexico, and some of it back in the United States. So, we're getting some benefit there, but I would -- I would -- I wouldn't necessarily equate the two and it's sort of hard to figure out what the overall impact on the American economy is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good op-ed in The Journal this morning about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. I was going to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) Vietnam loves Donald Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They --</p><p>HORMATS: Yes, they do. But it's very hard to -- you can't use light switch tactics to change your supply chain overnight. These supply chains have been developed in China over decades, literally. Chinese have great infrastructure, Vietnam does not, Chinese have a lot more trained workers, Vietnam does not. They have a lot of STEM workers in China that -- one reason the U.S. wants to invest there, and do research there, is that there are a lot of talented Chinese. I go there all the time and I see them, so it's not so easy to change supply chains in a -- in an instant. It take -- it's costly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But The Journal --</p><p>FREEMAN: What about --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But The Journal cites this, Chinese goods exports to U.S. fell more than 12 percent year-over-year --</p><p>HORMATS: Oh, that's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- from January through May. Vietnam saw a 36 -- more than 36 percent increase over the same period of time.</p><p>HORMATS: Those are mostly in very labor-intensive products.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>HORMATS: That's certainly true.</p><p>FREEMAN: But it is -- it is leverage on China. Who knows if they will want to stop stealing intellectual property, make a deal, but it does suggest if we want to look somewhere other than the Fed for growth, that if this China negotiation is going to continue, the president ought to be lowering barriers in our trade with other countries, right?</p><p>HORMATS: Yes. For two reasons, one, in effect of your lower barriers, your lower taxes in effect. And second, it'll boost growth in these countries and they're our major trading partners, they'll buy more from us. So it would be a stimulus --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they realize the uncertainty because the president has said over and over again that the Europeans treat us worse than China does, that India treats us badly, that there are -- actually, he even said in an interview a week and a half ago when he joined this program, Vietnam is another one. So, you've got all of these questions about who's next in terms of the target of the president.</p><p>FORBES: And Japan, the third largest economy in the world. What -- what's the trade situation there?</p><p>HORMATS: Yes. So I mean the -- you have to pick your spots when you go into these kinds of things. You can't have this against everyone, and it seems to me you want to be work with the Japanese, you want to be working with the Europeans, you want be working with the Canadians, and Mexicans. NAFTA --</p><p>FORBES: Geopolitically with the Indians.</p><p>HORMATS: Geo -- and geo -- and definitely geopolitical with the Indians.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think USMCA passes? Do you think she brings it to the floor for a vote, USMCA?</p><p>HORMATS: Probably not in august, but I do think they're working very hard. And in fact, on a bipartisan basis, which is one of the few things that's happening, Washington bipartisan basis, and they're dealing with issues like labor, enforcement, and environmental issues, and I do think that she'll bring it to a vote. Perhaps they don't want to -- we only have nine days in August, but after the August recess, I would guess they would -- they -- both sides -- both sides would benefit.</p><p>And I'd just like to add one more point on the China thing, we're paying a lot of attention, and understandably so to all the issues with China because we see China as a major competitor now and particularly in technology and in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And a national security risk.</p><p>HORMATS: Yes. And the technology has both economic and national security implications. What we're missing in this debate, and perhaps distracted from it, is that we need to do a lot more to strengthen our own competitiveness at home. If you want to be competing with this rise in China, you need -- you can't be cutting money from the National Science Foundation, the national labs. You need to take advantage of talented foreigner workers, you need a competitive excessive infrastructure environment. You need to support STEM education.</p><p>So, what we ought to be doing, A, is competing with China and trying to get the rules agreed on the basis of much more market orientation for the global trading rules, and the bilateral trading rules, but we also can't be diverted from the fact that we need to do a lot more at home --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HORMATS: -- as we did during the space race to strengthen our capabilities.</p><p>FORBES: And the taxes, flat tax, wouldn't that help?</p><p>HORMATS: Well, lower -- Steve. Steve.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HORMATS: That'll be (INAUDIBLE) but let's -- we got to take an inventory, what do we need to do at home to strengthen --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HORMATS: -- our competitive capabilities as we did during the space race?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All good points. Bob, it's great to have your insights. You got to come back more often.</p><p>HORMATS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Bob Hormats joining us there.</p><p>HORMATS: It's a pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, the markets record run, futures moving higher this morning, all three major indices hitting intraday highs yesterday. Stuart Varney weighs in on that ahead of the opening bell, which is just in about 45 minutes. And then cashing in on cannabis, we're going to take you live to one of the world's largest marijuana companies for closer look at the drug. What is happening here? But first, check out The Tennis Channel.</p><p>JONATHAN NOVACK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report. For FOX Business, I'm Jonathan Novack. The Men's Semifinals are now set at Wimbledon and it's giving us the matchup we've all been dreaming of, Federer versus Nadal. Roger Federer defeated Kei Nishikori in the quarterfinals and made history in the process. He became the first man to win a hundred marches at a single major and broke Jimmy Connors' record for most grass court victories in the Open Era.</p><p>Federer will now face his greatest rival, Rafael Nadal, who won his quarterfinal over Sam Querrey. That will set up the first match between Federer and Nadal at Wimbledon since their epic 2008 final, what many people call the greatest tennis match of all time. In the other semifinal, it'll be top seeded Novak Djokovic against Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut after Djokovic won on Wednesday in just under two hours. Don't forget, you can catch Wimbledon Primetime at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Thursday on Tennis Channel. I'm Jonathan Novack.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the economy firing on all cylinders, has some investors signaling a Goldilocks cycle, once again, Goldilocks, not too hot, not too cold. Stuart Varney from \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" is here now. Stu. Good morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's my expression, I know that it was used back in the 1990s, you know, Goldilocks economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Sure. Of course.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, I think it's a Goldilocks market right now. I mean I'll defend that position. You got good news on interest rates, I think the market's factoring in three rate cuts this year, modestly good news on China trade, profits are looking good for the second half of the year, and the economy is still pretty strong with no sign of inflation. So that's why I would call it a Goldilocks market because we hit a series of new highs yesterday, and look at the screen, left-hand side of the screen, we're going to go up, all three indicators up again first thing this morning. Dow is going to get pretty close to 27,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>VARNEY: I'll call it a Goldilocks market. How about you?</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you know, Stu, the market looks at what's next, what's ahead.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And now we're expecting a slowdown toward the end of the year. Yesterday, Powell said there are crosscurrents that have developed.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it has to do with uncertainty over trade.</p><p>VARNEY: So he'll drop interest rates to take account of those threats on the -- on the horizon. I mean he's going to take care of the market, isn't he?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: I mean he -- he's guaranteeing that this market doesn't crash, or trying to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And the question -- the question we've been asking this morning is, can a rate cut actually fix all ails? We'll see.</p><p>VARNEY: I don't think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. There you go.</p><p>VARNEY: But that's an entire separate debate, isn't it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. I think so. Stu, I know you'll have a lot more in about 12 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see you then.</p><p>VARNEY: You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart after the program, but first, we are cashing in on cannabis next. We're taking you live to one of the world's largest marijuana companies for a closer look at the drug and the prospects for growth there. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. OK. So the big business of CBD, Ashley Webster is live in Smith Falls, Canada this morning with a look at Canopy Growth, one of the world's largest marijuana companies. Ashley, good morning to you. Look at that getup you have on.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Maria. In fact, Canopy -- do you like this? This is a protected suit. Why? Because I'm inside one of the 47 grow rooms. I'm surrounded by marijuana plants. But if I bring in some sort of contaminant, then I could wipeout this crop, and I'd be in a lot of trouble, and I'd have a big bill to pay. So, I'm all suited up.</p><p>Canada only legalized recreational marijuana about nine months ago. And as you can see, business is booming, literally growing. But it's not just marijuana that you smoke, there's also what they called cannabinoid, that's CBD. The health benefits as a health supplement is a big business, $5 billion this year alone. But there are still questions, Maria, as to whether CBD is safe. You can get in it drinks, you can get it in all types of foods. But we spoke to a doctor who said, you know what, he has his doubts right now. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR: Think about all these sources of CBD coming into your body. Is that safe? I, as a doctor, don't have an answer, but I err on the side of caution and say that is not ideal. We need some sort of regulation here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, you know, the FDA also says it has its doubts and is not OK of the ingestion of CBD, but you can go anywhere in America and find CBD products. We spoke to the CEO of Canopy. His name is Mark Zekulin and he says he welcomes regulation. Take a listen to him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZEKULIN, CEO, CANOPY GROWTH: You know, there are people selling tons of CBD products all over America right now, all over the world right now. So, you know, they have a real incentive to put a system in place to make sure that what you're buying is properly labeled, has been tested, produced to a certain standard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER: so there you have it, Maria. They're making a huge bed canopy. It is the world's largest legal marijuana grower. They believe the United States is in the outlook in their forecast. They already have seven big facilities, including one in upstate New York where they're growing hemp. But in the meantime, as you can see, this is what they believe will be the face of the United States to come. The question is, can the Federal authorities in Washington agree with some of those states like California and Colorado and legalize marijuana and CBD for that matter across the board? We'll have to wait and see.</p><p>We're going to be here all day. We're going to show you some remarkable sites. In fact, across the street, there is a billion dollars' worth of marijuana just piled up, and the irony is, it's right next door to the police station.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What?</p><p>WEBSTER: Who would have thunk it? Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. And these companies have gone public. Investors are believing. I know Tilray, when it was IPO'ed, was one of the best IPOs we saw all year.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. Absolutely. And in fact, there has been a change here at Canopy. Bruce Linton was the original CEO. He's been on FOX Business a number of times, he kind of left suddenly. Mark Zekulin, who we spoke to as the new CEO, I asked him, \"What's going on?\" He said, \"Bruce was the founder. He's kind of a blue-sky thinker. He's moving on to his next job. But Canopy continues to grow. You can trade it on the New York Stock Exchange. It can be traded here in Canada under weed.\" They believe this is the future and CBD in particular.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Good symbol there. Ashley, thank you. Ashley Webster in Canada this morning. Still ahead, final thoughts from this all- star panel. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Steve Forbes.</p><p>FORBES: Watch out on the trade front. Watch out for the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. For sure. James.</p><p>FREEMAN: And, you know, I wish the president would realize every other country is not China. He's made a good case that China's mistreatment of American business needs to be addressed. He ought to be seeking trade peace with everybody else.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Again, don't be fixated on the trade deficit because U.S. prosperity, this irrelevant economic measure --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- U.S. prosperity means that we will probably still have a trade deficit as we do. So, trade war, still got a trade deficit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, we're on the doorstep of second quarter earnings. We're going to start getting those numbers next week. That's going to be the driver for the market. The big banks, next week. Great show this morning, guys.</p><p>FREEMAN: Thanks.</p><p>FORBES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.</p><p>FREEMAN: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Steve Forbes, James Freeman, Dagen McDowell, have a great day, everybody. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins now. Stu, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: All right. Thanks, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019071103cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJB-3FT1-JB20-G150-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0001S8A</classCode><className>FORBES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC2721 PERIODICALS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]      MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN HOST:  Joining me right now is Tennessee senator, member of the Judiciary and Armed Services Committee is Marsha Blackburn.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senator, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN):  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we're -- we're talking about this White House summit. You're urging big tech to protect young children. What do you want to see out of big technology?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  What I would like to see out of big tech is some responsibility and accountability. And, Maria, they go in and subjectively manipulate their algorithms and then it opens the doors that it ought not to children, like the SnapChat letter that I sent this week deals with the way pornography is made public on their site. And this is made available. The ratings are wrong on these apps. Children are seeing this. They need to adjust those ratings. And, also, parents need to be aware. You need to give parents the tools to block this.</p><p>These videos that are deleted, this becomes a child predator's dream for contacting these children. And there are several cases where pedophiles have used SnapChat to contact and to coerce these children.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, that's unbelievable. You know, it --</p><p>BLACKBURN:  It is unbelievable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It feels like this is one issue big tech hits at both corners and both sides of the aisle. You've got people like Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both saying that they want to break these companies up. Do you want to see breakups of some of these large companies that are today, as you know, more powerful than we've ever -- we've ever known?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes. Well, I think where we start is with privacy issue. And yesterday Chris Hughes, who was the co-founder of FaceBook, was in my office and we had a very productive discussion about how you deal with privacy and giving consumers the tool box to protect, as I term it, their virtual you, themselves online. So you start with privacy and data security. You look at how the social media giants are prioritizing their content over content that should be readily available online. And I'm going to have a meeting later today with CEOs of Yelp concerning this issue because they're conducting -- Google prioritizes their content.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  So that determines what people see, what they have access to. We're also going to look at censorship and anti-trust and say, do these companies need to reposition themselves? But I think first you look at the privacy issue and you determine how that forces the media companies to adjust their business model. Right now they are -- they built their business model on a no holds barred. They do not have to inform you that they are taking your data, that they are mining your data, that they are positioning your data to be sold to the highest bidder who is going to market back to you or is going to go through and sift your data and then determine what they want to push forward to you in -- in the method of videos or articles. It's like with YouTube.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  You look at one video then they fill a stream with similar videos.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, real quick, we -- I want to move on to the border --</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But let me -- let me end this here on this because when I spoke with the president a couple of weeks ago, he side, look, we might need legislation which will spur competition.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want to see regulation for these companies?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  The Browser Act is legislation that deals with the privacy issue that I introduced in the House. I have reintroduced that in the Senate. And we are working to move that forward to get those guardrails in place and to do that first, like touch --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Like touch, but to put those parameters in place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Understood.</p><p>All right, let me move to the -- the crisis at the border, senator, because immigration and customs enforcement agents are reportedly preparing to conduct raids beginning Sunday to arrest thousands of illegal immigrants across the country. The move coming weeks after President Trump said that the operation was first being delayed. You're headed to the southern border with Vice President Mike Pence tomorrow.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting? And do you think we're ever going to get our arms around these loopholes that are encouraging so many illegals migrants to flood the border?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right. The -- the thing is, we have to get our hands around the loopholes, and we have to plug these loopholes, if you will, and make certain that those who are coming to our country come here legally. The Border Patrol -- I was down there a couple of months ago and they are in desperate need of some help. And my hope is that our Democrat colleagues will begin to work with us to give the Border Patrol the three things they continue to say they need. They have been saying this for 20 years. Give them a barrier, give them appropriate technology, give them more officers, agents and judges to deal with this issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but let's be honest, they don't want the president to have a victory. They -- they -- I mean some people on the Democrats side hate him so much that they're just going to try to make a point and not do anything about this issue.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Maria, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you really see anything getting done?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, I've got to tell you, they need to get over their pettiness and they need to put this nation and our sovereignty and the protection of the American people first.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. I understand.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  They need to -- they need to stop this human trafficking, sex trafficking, drug trafficking that is taking place on our border.</p><p>Every town's a border town. Every state's a border state --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Because of the drugs and the human trafficking coming through. They need to get over themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because all these people are --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That lost that election.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  They need to work for the good of the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All these people are coming to the border and facing these situations where, before they even get to the border, they've got to deal with the drug lords. So there's that.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- and then, you know, they don't want to do anything there, but there's also an issue on trade. So let me asks about USMCA.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What -- what is the likelihood that the -- that the bill comes to the floor for a vote in the fall?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  The votes are there. If Pelosi were to put it on the floor today, it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So why isn't she?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think that there again you're looking at people that say, well, do we want to give Donald Trump a victory? Give the American people a victory!</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  The unions are for this. The farmers are for this. Come on, guys, put it on the floor and call a vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, so you don't know. You don't know is the answering if she's going to bring it to the floor by the fall, is that what you're saying?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  She should bring it to the fall next -- to the floor next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. Exactly.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, let -- let me ask you about China.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is going to be meeting with members to discuss USMCA. I spoke with Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, on the program yesterday --</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he is the one who said it's probably going to come to the floor in the fall. What's plan b if -- if -- if she doesn't bring it to the floor? I mean could that happen that she actually doesn't bring it to the floor?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think she will see what happened to the border funding bill, the week before last, where you will see the moderates in her caucus say, come on, Nancy, let's get with it, let's get this job done. And when you have the unions and so many of the trade groups all saying USMCA let's push it forward, she needs to say -- she and Steny need to say, let's put it on the floor and call the vote. Let the chips fall where they may. Let Nancy and Steny declare victory by being able to move something forward. We need to get this thing done. When it comes to China, we're going to continue to encourage holding that line against Huawei. China will steal our intellectual property. They will embed chips and build Huawei as a spy network in that equipment and consumer products. We need to make certain that we deal with that issue and not give them an inch. We know what they're up to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you certainly have been keeping -- and the president has been keeping his -- his -- his boots on the neck of -- of the Chinese on this issue for sure.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.

MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN)</emphasis>:  Good to see you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Thanks so much for joining me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So we're -- we're talking about this White House summit. You're urging big tech to protect young children. What do you want to see out of big technology?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  What I would like to see out of big tech is some responsibility and accountability. And, Maria, they go in and subjectively manipulate their algorithms and then it opens the doors that it ought not to children, like the SnapChat letter that I sent this week deals with the way pornography is made public on their site. And this is made available. The ratings are wrong on these apps. Children are seeing this. They need to adjust those ratings. And, also, parents need to be aware. You need to give parents the tools to block this.   </p><p>      These videos that are deleted, this becomes a child predator's dream for contacting these children. And there are several cases where pedophiles have used SnapChat to contact and to coerce these children.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Wow, that's unbelievable. You know, it --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  It is unbelievable.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  It feels like this is one issue big tech hits at both corners and both sides of the aisle. You've got people like Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both saying that they want to break these companies up. Do you want to see breakups of some of these large companies that are today, as you know, more powerful than we've ever -- we've ever known?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Yes. Well, I think where we start is with privacy issue. And yesterday Chris Hughes, who was the co-founder of FaceBook, was in my office and we had a very productive discussion about how you deal with privacy and giving consumers the tool box to protect, as I term it, their virtual you, themselves online. So you start with privacy and data security. You look at how the social media giants are prioritizing their content over content that should be readily available online. And I'm going to have a meeting later today with CEOs of Yelp concerning this issue because they're conducting -- Google prioritizes their content.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  So that determines what people see, what they have access to. We're also going to look at censorship and anti-trust and say, do these companies need to reposition themselves? But I think first you look at the privacy issue and you determine how that forces the media companies to adjust their business model. Right now they are -- they built their business model on a no holds barred. They do not have to inform you that they are taking your data, that they are mining your data, that they are positioning your data to be sold to the highest bidder who is going to market back to you or is going to go through and sift your data and then determine what they want to push forward to you in -- in the method of videos or articles. It's like with YouTube.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  You look at one video then they fill a stream with similar videos.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So, real quick, we -- I want to move on to the border --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  But let me -- let me end this here on this because when I spoke with the president a couple of weeks ago, he side, look, we might need legislation which will spur competition.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Do you want to see regulation for these companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  The Browser Act is legislation that deals with the privacy issue that I introduced in the House. I have reintroduced that in the Senate. And we are working to move that forward to get those guardrails in place and to do that first, like touch --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Like touch, but to put those parameters in place.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Understood.  </p><p>      All right, let me move to the -- the crisis at the border, senator, because immigration and customs enforcement agents are reportedly preparing to conduct raids beginning Sunday to arrest thousands of illegal immigrants across the country. The move coming weeks after President Trump said that the operation was first being delayed. You're headed to the southern border with Vice President Mike Pence tomorrow.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  What are you expecting? And do you think we're ever going to get our arms around these loopholes that are encouraging so many illegals migrants to flood the border?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Right. The -- the thing is, we have to get our hands around the loopholes, and we have to plug these loopholes, if you will, and make certain that those who are coming to our country come here legally. The Border Patrol -- I was down there a couple of months ago and they are in desperate need of some help. And my hope is that our Democrat colleagues will begin to work with us to give the Border Patrol the three things they continue to say they need. They have been saying this for 20 years. Give them a barrier, give them appropriate technology, give them more officers, agents and judges to deal with this issue.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, but let's be honest, they don't want the president to have a victory. They -- they -- I mean some people on the Democrats side hate him so much that they're just going to try to make a point and not do anything about this issue.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Maria, I --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Do you really see anything getting done?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Yes, I've got to tell you, they need to get over their pettiness and they need to put this nation and our sovereignty and the protection of the American people first.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes. I understand.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  They need to -- they need to stop this human trafficking, sex trafficking, drug trafficking that is taking place on our border.   </p><p>      Every town's a border town. Every state's a border state --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Because of the drugs and the human trafficking coming through. They need to get over themselves.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, because all these people are --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  That lost that election.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  They need to work for the good of the American people.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All these people are coming to the border and facing these situations where, before they even get to the border, they've got to deal with the drug lords. So there's that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And -- and then, you know, they don't want to do anything there, but there's also an issue on trade. So let me asks about USMCA.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  What -- what is the likelihood that the -- that the bill comes to the floor for a vote in the fall?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  The votes are there. If Pelosi were to put it on the floor today, it would pass.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So why isn't she?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  I think that there again you're looking at people that say, well, do we want to give Donald Trump a victory? Give the American people a victory!   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  The unions are for this. The farmers are for this. Come on, guys, put it on the floor and call a vote.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right, so you don't know. You don't know is the answering if she's going to bring it to the floor by the fall, is that what you're saying?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  She should bring it to the fall next -- to the floor next week.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes. Exactly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  OK, let -- let me ask you about China.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is going to be meeting with members to discuss USMCA. I spoke with Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, on the program yesterday --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And he is the one who said it's probably going to come to the floor in the fall. What's plan b if -- if -- if she doesn't bring it to the floor? I mean could that happen that she actually doesn't bring it to the floor?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  I think she will see what happened to the border funding bill, the week before last, where you will see the moderates in her caucus say, come on, Nancy, let's get with it, let's get this job done. And when you have the unions and so many of the trade groups all saying USMCA let's push it forward, she needs to say -- she and Steny need to say, let's put it on the floor and call the vote. Let the chips fall where they may. Let Nancy and Steny declare victory by being able to move something forward. We need to get this thing done. When it comes to China, we're going to continue to encourage holding that line against Huawei. China will steal our intellectual property. They will embed chips and build Huawei as a spy network in that equipment and consumer products. We need to make certain that we deal with that issue and not give them an inch. We know what they're up to.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, you certainly have been keeping -- and the president has been keeping his -- his -- his boots on the neck of -- of the Chinese on this issue for sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLACKBURN</emphasis>:  Yes.

Menendez said. \u201cWith this bill, we are making very clear to gun sellers who are caught illegally moving their weapons online: if you make the sale, you will pay the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile some technology companies have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their websites, the problem persists,\u201d Sen. Feinstein said. \u201cOur bill would make it illegal for gun sellers to circumvent websites\u2019 terms of service and continue the underground proliferation of firearms. It\u2019s part of a larger effort that needs to be taken to stop the plague of gun violence in our communities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInternet marketplaces like Facebook are the virtual dark alley where unscrupulous gun sellers go to meet dangerous individuals who are trying to get their hands on a firearm,\u201d said John Feinblatt, President of Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cStopping these illegal sales would save lives, and we applaud Senator Feinstein for introducing legislation to do exactly that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverwhelming majorities of Americans support policies that ensure that individuals who should not possess firearms are not able to purchase them, including online,\u201dsaid Kris Brown, President of Brady. \u201cBrady is grateful to Senators Feinstein and Menendez for addressing a dangerous practice of falsely advertising firearm sales online. Such sales are designed to circumvent the regulations that help keep our families and communities safe. This is a common-sense fix to a growing problem that applies the spirit of our nation's existing gun safety laws to novel, 21st century issues.\u201d</p><p>Although technology giants like Facebook have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their platforms, sellers have consistently found ways, like misrepresenting guns as other items, to circumvent those restrictions.</p><p>Last month, Facebook reported it had removed 1.3 million pieces of content related to firearms between April and June 2020 from its platforms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3805125</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XM-D1P1-F0YC-N04K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"425\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Bob Menendez issued the following press release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senators Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who has continually called out Facebook for its failure to monitor and enforce its own ban on gun sales (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-markey-and-colleagues-blast-facebooks-continued-failure-to-monitor-and-enforce-gun-sales-ban\">https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-markey-and-colleagues-blast-facebooks-continued-failure-to-monitor-and-enforce-gun-sales-ban</url>), and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today introduced the Stop Online Fraudulent Sales of Firearms Act (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/stop-online-fraudulent-sales-of-firearms-act%202020.pdf\">https://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/stop-online-fraudulent-sales-of-firearms-act%202020.pdf</url>) that would prevent gun sellers from circumventing technology companies' terms of service by making it illegal to fraudulently sell firearms and ammunition online.</p><p>\"The fact is, no matter how many times big tech companies claim they're cracking down on illegal online firearm sales, determined gun sellers and buyers find new ways to get around it,\" Sen. Menendez said. \"With this bill, we are making very clear to gun sellers who are caught illegally moving their weapons online: if you make the sale, you will pay the price.\"</p><p>\"While some technology companies have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their websites, the problem persists,\" Sen. Feinstein said. \"Our bill would make it illegal for gun sellers to circumvent websites' terms of service and continue the underground proliferation of firearms. It's part of a larger effort that needs to be taken to stop the plague of gun violence in our communities.\"</p><p>\"Internet marketplaces like Facebook are the virtual dark alley where unscrupulous gun sellers go to meet dangerous individuals who are trying to get their hands on a firearm,\" said John Feinblatt, President of Everytown for Gun Safety. \"Stopping these illegal sales would save lives, and we applaud Senator Feinstein for introducing legislation to do exactly that.\"</p><p>\"Overwhelming majorities of Americans support policies that ensure that individuals who should not possess firearms are not able to purchase them, including online,\"said Kris Brown, President of Brady. \"Brady is grateful to Senators Feinstein and Menendez for addressing a dangerous practice of falsely advertising firearm sales online. Such sales are designed to circumvent the regulations that help keep our families and communities safe. This is a common-sense fix to a growing problem that applies the spirit of our nation's existing gun safety laws to novel, 21st century issues.\"</p><p>Although technology giants like Facebook have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their platforms, sellers have consistently found ways, like misrepresenting guns as other items, to circumvent those restrictions.</p><p>Last month, Facebook reported it had removed 1.3 million pieces of content related to firearms between April and June 2020 from its platforms.

Menendez said. \"With this bill, we are making very clear to gun sellers who are caught illegally moving their weapons online: if you make the sale, you will pay the price.\"</p><p>\"While some technology companies have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their websites, the problem persists,\" Sen. Feinstein said. \"Our bill would make it illegal for gun sellers to circumvent websites' terms of service and continue the underground proliferation of firearms. It's part of a larger effort that needs to be taken to stop the plague of gun violence in our communities.\"</p><p>\"Internet marketplaces like Facebook are the virtual dark alley where unscrupulous gun sellers go to meet dangerous individuals who are trying to get their hands on a firearm,\" said John Feinblatt, President of Everytown for Gun Safety. \"Stopping these illegal sales would save lives, and we applaud Senator Feinstein for introducing legislation to do exactly that.\"</p><p>\"Overwhelming majorities of Americans support policies that ensure that individuals who should not possess firearms are not able to purchase them, including online,\"said Kris Brown, President of Brady. \"Brady is grateful to Senators Feinstein and Menendez for addressing a dangerous practice of falsely advertising firearm sales online. Such sales are designed to circumvent the regulations that help keep our families and communities safe. This is a common-sense fix to a growing problem that applies the spirit of our nation's existing gun safety laws to novel, 21st century issues.\"</p><p>Although technology giants like Facebook have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their platforms, sellers have consistently found ways, like misrepresenting guns as other items, to circumvent those restrictions.</p><p>Last month, Facebook reported it had removed 1.3 million pieces of content related to firearms between April and June 2020 from its platforms.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/sen-menendez-introduces-bill-to-stop-fraudulent-online-gun-sales\">https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/sen-menendez-introduces-bill-to-stop-fraudulent-online-gun-sales</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSM9240AKK6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XF-PBW1-DYVR-P0N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Do you agree with The Washington Post publisher on the outcome of this trial?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, my analysis is that Saudi Arabia knew that they had to deliver some heads on a platter, and all of the junior people involved in this plot are the ones taking responsibility and getting the long sentences, whereas those that the U.N. and U.S. Investigators found responsible leading all the way up to MBS himself, the crown prince. They are getting away with a slap on the wrist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And here you go with the news dumped right before a holiday when it's going to get less attention. It's a very savvy move if you're trying to avoid the U.S. public paying a lot of attention to this news. But I don't think The Washington Post or the U.S. media or Capitol Hill are going to let this go so easily.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NOBLES: So the question is does the Trump administration, Kimberly -- obviously, President Trump has offered up excuses for the Saudi government's role in all of this. How do you see President Trump and the White House responding to this verdict?</p><p>DOZIER: I think they're going to embrace this as the Saudi government going as far as it can go. What they've been doing publicly is saying they are encouraged by the kingdom's moves to hold various people responsible. But they had sanctioned Saud al-Qahtani, the senior adviser that the prosecutor in Saudi Arabia said there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute. It will be interesting to see if those sanctions remain as one signal from the White House to the kingdom that they haven't gone far enough.</p><p>Essentially, senior administration officials I've spoken to about this issue and other long-standing issues they have with Saudi Arabia, such as the textbooks that have hate speech towards Jews, towards Christians, towards people who convert from Islam, they haven't changed that text yet. That kind of thing, the officials say that we're encouraged that they keep trying to work these problems, whereas they have hard words with them behind closed doors.</p><p>NOBLES: So we've learned that Khashoggi's family -- and there were some other western diplomats that attended the trial -- what do you view of the significance of having folks like that in the room?</p><p>DOZIER: Well, according to The New York Times, the folks like that are not allowed to speak about what they saw or heard. But that does go some way within Saudi society to show that they have been included and that the death of Jamal Khashoggi is in some way being honored.</p><p>But, again, we also have heard that members of Khashoggi's family in Saudi Arabia have felt fearful of speaking out and have felt torn between wanting to see justice and wanting to be able to continue their life in Saudi Arabia without recrimination or any sort of crackdown from the government.</p><p>NOBLES: All right. Kimberly Dozier, obviously a very important story. We appreciate your perspective. Thank you for being here.</p><p>DOZIER: Thank you.</p><p>NOBLES: And we will be right back.</p><p>[10:35:00]</p><p>NOBLES: Unsurprisingly, Eddie Murphy getting rave reviews for hosting Saturday Night Live 35 years after he left the show. Murphy bringing back some of his classic characters and creating some new ones. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MURPHY: I passed kidney stones with more personality than the two of you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a little rude.</p><p>MURPHY: Face it, kid, the both of you together couldn't Velcro my sneakers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're not exactly a Christmas character, I'm seeing.</p><p>MURPHY: What the hell do you mean I'm not a Christmas character? Look at me. I'm green. I'm green, and all the children love me. The kids love me, and I'm a Christmas character, you jerk.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is this man saying a polar bear got inside the workshop?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I believe he is. But, sir, there's an electrified fence around the perimeter --</p><p>MURPHY: It don't matter about no electrified fence. The bear came right through the fence, it looked just like Jurassic Park. It just ran through the fence. These bears are out there and they're hungry because of global warming and they have smelled that fresh meat and went crazy. The bears are coming for us, you all. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBLES: This was certainly appointment viewing in my House. Dean Obeidallah joins me now. He's a Contributor for The Daily Beast and CNN.com Opinion. He's, of course, the host of the Dean Obeidallah Show on Sirius X.M.</p><p>Dean, if you're an Eddie Murphy fan, you really got a little bit of everything. Bringing back some of his iconic characters from his days at SNL, we saw him there as Gumby, he also did Buckwheat, Mr. Robinson and Velvet Jones. I mean, what was the highlight for you?</p><p>DEAN OBEIDALLAH, CNN.COM OPINION CONTRIBUTOR: Ryan, first of all, I think this is one of the best SNLs ever, and I worked at SNL for eight seasons. I've got to tell you, it really was everything you want to see in comedy. If you like SNL, like Eddie Murphy, this was it.</p><p>To me, I loved the monologue when you had Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan come on stage, Dave Chappelle, and paid homage to Eddie Murphy for blazing the trail for them. As comedians do, they made fun of him a little bit. That was great. I also loved Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood, the sketch they did here. And I looked back at one they did 35 years ago when Eddie was on the show when he talked about white flight.</p><p>In this one, it was updated, he talked about gentrification, how white people are coming back now and pushing black people out.</p><p>So I think it was timely, it was well done.</p><p>[10:40:01]</p><p>Eddie Murphy had a phenomenal night there. And I hope he comes back much more often annually. It would be great to see him back.</p><p>NOBLES: Yes. I'd like you to go a little bit more into that. I was really impressed how they were able to take those iconic characters that we know so well and apply them to the current time. And the Mr. Robinson sketch is a perfect example of that, talking about gentrification. I mean, how much did that impress you the way the writers were able to weave in everything that we loved about those old characters but make them relevant to what we're dealing with today?</p><p>OBEIDALLAH: Well, that's -- the writing staff at SNL is phenomenal. And what they do when old, you know, famous hosts come back who have been on the show years and years ago, they'll look back at the old sketches. That's part of what they do. I used to work in the research department at SNL. That's what I would do, gather them and give them to the writers.</p><p>So it's not a coincidence, they look at it. They do the preparation and see what Eddie was talking about 35 years ago, which was white flight, and update it to now with gentrification.</p><p>And I also think that Eddie was under appreciated in his team on SNL dealing with race issues, challenging white America on issues like white privilege before we even used the term white privilege in other sketches. So that was great.</p><p>Also the Gumby sketch, there was a moment there as Gumby where he lashed out at Lorne Michaels and NBC, why haven't you had me on for 35 years? And that sort of hints to some bad blood between Eddie and the show that is now resolved and I think it was great he had that moment to do that comedically.</p><p>NOBLES: Yes. Of course, that wasn't the only bit of news that Murphy made. He lashed out at Bill Cosby and now Bill Cosby's representatives are pushing back, and that was after he took a jab at Cosby in the opening monologue while talking about his new baby, his tenth child. Let's play that clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MURPHY: If you would have told me 30 years ago that I would be this boring stay-at-home house dad and Bill Cosby would be in jail, even I would have took that bet.</p><p>I'll tell you, who is America's dad now?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBLES: So, Dean, quickly, a Cosby spokesperson issued this statement that said in part, quote, one would think that Mr. Murphy was given his freedom to leave the plantation so that he could make his own decisions, but he decided to sell himself back to being a Hollywood slave. Really strong words from Cosby's people. What's your take on this?</p><p>OBEIDALLAH: I think that line, which is despicable, Eddie Murphy is doing a joke. In the past, to be clear, Eddie Murphy has defended Bill Cosby, not on these allegations but other issues, praised him at times, 2015 when he came back for the 40th anniversary, Eddie Murphy, he would not do comedy mocking Bill Cosby then.</p><p>Since then, Bill Cosby has been convicted. He is in prison right now now. I think the joke was fair. It was edgy. And it's unfortunate Bill Cosby, it seems, wanted to try to take the attention away from Eddie Murphy's triumphant return to SNL.</p><p>NOBLES: All right. Dean, I agree. I hope they bring Eddie Murphy back often after seeing what we saw on Saturday.</p><p>Dean Obeidallah, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>OBEIDALLAH: Thanks, Ryan.</p><p>NOBLES: And we'll be right back.</p><p>[10:45:00]</p><p>NOBLES: With 2020 just days away, we are counting down some of the biggest stories in business this year.
