Dipayan Ghosh worked as a policy executive at Facebook. He's now at Harvard, and I asked him why an average consumer, someone who's happy scrolling through Facebook or buying stuff on Amazon, why should that consumer be concerned about the amount of power these companies have?             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DIPAYAN GHOSH:                 It's really a broader issue than just our individual sense. Sometimes it makes more sense for a Congress member to be thinking about public interests, about social interests, about Democratic interests, which we individually don't necessarily think about. So even if we enjoy Facebook, even if we use Google Search, we enjoy Amazon Fresh to get our groceries during the pandemic, what we might not recognize at an individual level is that what's really happening is that we're giving a huge aggregation of power concentrated within a select few companies. They're drawing wealth away from the rest of society and collecting it within their own coffers.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 Well, how big is too big? How much power is too much power? Like, how do you even measure that?             </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH:                 In the context of our national GDP, how much of a market is social media? How much of a market is Internet search and online retail? If those markets are big enough, then what that suggests is that there is a lot of economic activity flowing through them, which means that they're important for us to look at and provide some regulatory scrutiny over.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 But I guess I'm asking where the line is. Like, when is that regulatory scrutiny merited, and when is it just a company who's - that's really successful and can be left alone being really successful?             </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH:                 Well, I don't think that it's wrong to have a monopoly, and some of the members in the committee have highlighted that. What is wrong is if you got that monopoly through harmful means or if you maintain that monopoly using harmful means or if you exploit your monopoly position by pushing consumer harms in market innovation and price and quality of service on American users. And I think the committee's point is that in each of these four cases of these four companies that circumstance has come to be.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 Well, you were on the inside. Was there an explicit strategy at Facebook to monopolize the social media market?             </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH:                 I wouldn't phrase it as Facebook was trying to monopolize, but just like any of these four companies, Facebook was certainly trying to grow aggressively and really dominate social media around the world. Now, did it engage in harmful means? I think that if it takes a deep look into how the company thinks about acquisitions and how it tries to grow its user base around the world, it could very well discover some very meaningful information.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 Well, would you call Facebook a monopoly at this point?             </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH:                 Absolutely. I think Facebook is not only a monopoly, but that Facebook is a natural monopoly. This is a company that has imposed tremendous barriers to entry to the rest of the digital ecosystem. And when you have a natural monopoly, you don't necessarily think about break up first, but rather what we need to think about in the context of Facebook is utility regulation.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 So what are some policy fixes that you think Congress should be considering right now?             </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH:                 The business model of these companies involves collecting data on an uninhibited basis, using it to develop algorithms that are tremendously opaque to the public and growing their platforms with a level of aggressiveness that diminishes any potential threat from would-be rivals. And so I think we need a three-way regulatory solution with privacy for that uninhibited collection of data and transparency over those algorithms and better market competition, better antitrust regulation and enforcement to combat the growing monopoly power of these companies.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 Dipayan Ghosh is a former Facebook policy executive and author of \"Terms Of Disservice: How Silicon Valley Is Destructive By Design.\"             </p><p>                Thank you very much for joining us today.             </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH:                 Thank you so much, Ailsa. I really appreciate it.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 And a quick note - Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are among our financial supporters.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2020072902</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-J9D1-DY2S-N31W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

'The real threat to the tech giants is competition, not regulation, and everybody is missing what really happened today,' he told his Twitter[1] followers. He was responding to a tweet from Obama-era adviser Ashkan Soltani, who was laying out details[2] surrounding the Federal Trade Commission's settlement Wednesday with Facebook. </p><p>Stamos continued: 'Facebook paid the FTC $5B for a letter that says 'You never again have to create mechanisms that could facilitate competition.'' He urged [3]his former colleagues in March 2018 to purposely avoid collecting people's data.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Facebook agreed [4]to pay a record $5 billion and promised new privacy guarantees Wednesday to settle the FTC investigation. The agency argued Facebook violated the terms of its 2011 settlement 'by deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal information,' a Wednesday statement[5]from the agency reads. Stamos noted that the settlement did not include one important word: competition. 'Facebook already has ~2.5B users. It has the world's second-largest ad network. It never again needs data from anybody else to make money or third parties to facilitate growth,' he said. 'This order doesn't include the word competition or include any balancing tests. It's fantastic for FB.' Lawmakers dinged the FTC for what they believe is the agency's decision to go light on Facebook. 'The FTC just voted to let Facebook off easy with a $5 billion settlement for compromising the data of tens of millions of Americans and allowing our elections to be improperly influenced, ' Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warrenwrote in a July 12[6] tweet. Her comment came the day the FTC approved [7]the settlement.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Sen. Josh Hawley was similarly upset. 'This is very disappointing. It does nothing to hold executives accountable. It utterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way,' the Missouri Republican said in a Wednesday tweet[8]. Hawley has been one of the chief lawmakers calling on the Justice Department to break up what he believes are big tech's monopolistic ways. Other conservatives are also considering [9]ways to hold Facebook and other big tech companies responsible for collecting user data. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, for instance, suggested on July 11 that lawmakers should consider changing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which was passed in 1996 when the internet was new.

For example, he suggests it was in part social media that has made so many Americans aware of the George Floyd tragedy and enabled citizens in the U.S. and at least 12 other countries to organize protests against racism. Without these platforms, he believes, we might even be engaged in another civil war in this country.<br/>That doesn't mean Facebook or others of its gigantic peers are any more immune to regulation, however - not in his view.\u00a0 As Palihapitiya said of the companies during a CB Insights event this morning: \"Are they going to get broken up? Yes. Will every single government go after them? Absolutely.\"<br/>His more specific prediction is that Facebook, as well as Amazon, Google and Apple, will continue to be investigated and fined by regulators around the world until they are no longer the leviathans they have become. \"First, they'll taxed to death, then they'll get trust-busted,\" said Palihapitiya.<br/>He doesn't think it will take all that much longer, either.<br/>While investors are currently being rewarded for \"going long\" on the companies as they grow largely unabated, Palihapitiya said that, \"on the margin, over the next 10 years . . . regulators will get their way\" because \"these internet companies undermine what regulators want, which is power. And the more you distribute power and information to the edges, the more in the crosshairs you will be.\" (Palihapitiya noted that the only big tech company that hasn't become a target of antitrust regulators is Microsoft, and he suggested it won't be spared forever, either. He more or less thinks the company was given a break, following the consent decree approved in 2002 that curbed some of Microsoft's practices and that only expired in 2011.)<br/>Interestingly, no matter Facebook's size going forward, Palihapitiya thinks the \"pendulum will swing for it to be more sort of Middle America, the sort of 'Fox News' \" of social media, as Twitter meanwhile swings to the \"coastal cities in the United States.\"<br/>It's already easy to see these \"demographic segmentations that are happening amongst these huge products,\" he said.<br/>The latter development may be much closer at hand. Kevin Roose, a New York Times columnist covering the intersection of technology, business and culture, occasionally tweets about the top-performing posts on Facebook. Yesterday, as is often the case, the searches skewed heavily toward conservative figures and themes.<br/>Teased by interviewer Robin Wigglesworth of the FT about how Facebook might react to the comparison, Palihapitiya said matter-of-factly of the different platforms, \"The content reinforces the kind of person that wants to be using them. It's no different today than when you choose to watch MSNBC versus CBS versus Fox News.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M1146826</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607X-4991-JBYT-H3MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He also talked about conflict deterrence between nation-states in the age of AI and pondered how secretaries of state might share information in the coming age of artificial general intelligence (AGI). 'What are the norms of this? This area strikes me as one that's nascent but will become very important as general intelligence becomes more and more possible some time from now,' he said. </p><p>'We haven't had a common regime around how all that works.' In a speech at Stanford University's Hoover Institution today, he praised progress made in the field of AI in areas like autonomous driving and medicine, federated learning for privacy-preserving on-device machine learning[1], and eye scans for detection of cardiovascular issues[2]. A combination of generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning will lead to major advances in science in the years ahead. He also urged government restraint in regulation of technology as the AI industry continues to grow. 'I would be careful of building any form of additional regulatory structure that's extralegal,' Schmidt said in response when a member of the audience proposed the creation of a new federal agency to critique algorithms used by private companies. Schmidt shared the stage with Marietje Schaake, a Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) fellow and Dutch former member of European Parliament who played a role in passage of GDPR regulation. She counterpointed that companies that say regulation may stifle innovation often assume technology is more important than democracy and the rule of law. A hands-off approach on tech regulation has led to the creation of new monopolies, thrown journalism into turmoil, and allowed the balkanization of the internet, she said. Failure to act now, she added, could allow for AI to accelerate and amplify discrimination. She suggested systematic impact assessments to operate in parallel with AI research so that our understanding of negative impacts can mirror progress. 'I think it's very clear that tech companies can all stay on the fence in taking a position in relation to values and rights. I personally believe that a rules-based system serves the public interest as well as collective rights and liberties the companies benefit from,' she said. 'I see clear momentum now between the EU and U.S. and a significant part of the democratic world, where [we] can catch up to the civil regulatory gaps platforms and other digital services anticipating the broader use of artificial intelligence.'She also argued that big tech self-regulation efforts have failed and emphasized the need for empowering regulators in order to defend democracy. 'Because with great power should come great responsibility, or at least modesty,' she said. 'Everyone has a role to play to strengthen the resilience of our democracy.' Schaake and Schmidt spoke for more than an hour this morning at a symposium held by the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered AI about AI ethics, policy, and governance. The debate between the two comes at a time when regulators in the United States have increased scrutiny of tech giants. Companies like Google currently face antitrust investigations from state attorneys general[3], and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has made the breakup of tech giants a central part of her campaign. Last month, due to Schmidt's potential role[4] in issues ranging from Google's project to enter mainland China to its work with the Department of Defense to its payout to Andy Rubin of $90 million despite sexual harassment allegations, a number of AI ethicists asked HAI to rescind its invitation to this event. Written by Tech Inquiry founder Jack Poulson, signatories include roughly 50 people, about a dozen of whom currently work as engineers at Google. In response to the petition, HAI published a tweet warning against the dangers of 'damaging intellectual blindness.' Pentagon's Defense Innovation Board AI ethics recommendations and the report from the national security commission on AI \u2014 two committees that Schmidt oversees \u2014 are due out October 31 and November 5, respectively. Both initiatives are aimed at helping the United States create a national AI strategy as roughly 30 other nations around have done, he said. Last week, founders of the Stanford center called for $120 billion in government spending[5] over the course of the next decade as part of a national strategy.

Emails obtained by this news organization showed an exchange in which Walker told LaJeneusse he thought a formal human rights program was unnecessary. </p><p>Walker has not returned a request for comment.</p><p>Once tasked with executing Google search's departure from China in 2010 - which the company attributed to its concern about censorship and that country's human rights record - LaJeunesse said he realized the company had changed.</p><p>\"It was a really special place,\" he said, adding that Google would recruit employees with the promise that they would be joining a world-changing company. But he said that not long after Google pulled its search engine out of China, other company departments wanted to enter the Chinese market. The fast-growing company became more concerned with its quarterly earnings, he said. \"It changed on me.\"</p><p>William Fitzgerald, who worked as a policy analyst for LaJeneusse from 2010 to 2012 in the Google Hong Kong office and now runs his own campaign advocacy firm called the Worker Agency, said LaJeneusse \"would always advocate tirelessly to make sure Google did right by its users even if that decision didn't reap the greatest amount of profits.\"</p><p>The former executive's allegations come as Google grapples with internal strife that includes a couple of years of employee protests over various issues - including Project Dragonfly, a possible return of Google search to China, which the company abandoned after employees (and later Congress) raised concerns. Some of the company's activist employees have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/tech/a30259355/google-walkout-organizer-claire-stapleton/\">since left and accused Google of retaliating against them.</url> Recently, Google  five employees who are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/06/fired-google-workers-claim-anti-union-retaliation-in-federal-labor-filing/\">alleging the company violated their right to organize</url>.</p><p>One of those fired employees is site reliability engineer Laurence Berland.</p><p>Google \"has changed for the worse - for its workers and the world - and, like many of us, Ross could not sit idly by, and was punished for it,\" Berland said Thursday.</p><p>LaJeunesse published a  Thursday, in which he also said he expressed concern about discrimination he witnessed at Google - and over which he told this publication he went to HR several times. He said he saw bullying that caused some young workers to cry, and that diversity exercises at the company included offensive labeling of different groups, which was also shown in emails obtained by this news organization.  He said eventually he was accidentally sent an email in which the HR director instructed a colleague to \"do some digging\" on him.</p><p>The company would not comment about LaJenuesse's specific allegations.</p><p>\"Ross was offered a new position at the exact same level and compensation, which he declined to accept,\" Google spokeswoman Jenn Kaiser said. \"We wish Ross all the best with his political ambitions.\"</p><p>LaJeunesse, who was a deputy chief of staff to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger before he spent 11 years at Google, is now running for a U.S. Senate seat in his home state of Maine, hoping to beat Republican Susan Collins. The Democrat announced his candidacy in November.</p><p>He said that after he was effectively pushed out of Google, he was thrown into \"a complete tailspin. It took me a while to figure out what had happened to me.\"</p><p>LaJeunesse and his husband moved from California to Maine, which he said isn't being represented well by Collins. He sees parallels between what is happening at Google and in Washington, D.C.</p><p>At both places, he sees \"abuse of power and corruption.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/14/san-jose-hilton-hotel-mystery-buyer-revealed-chicago-investor-google-real-estate-adobe/\">           Hilton San Jose hotel buyer is revealed as major player from Chicago       </url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/17/google-fires-engineer-who-created-browser-pop-up-message-about-workers-rights/\">fired</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@rossformaine/i-was-googles-head-of-international-relations-here-s-why-i-left-49313d23065\">blog post</url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/13/symantec-buyers-sale-mega-portfolio-silicon-valley-buildings-mountain-view-google-tech-develop/\">           Norton creator Symantec wants to sell huge portfolio of Silicon Valley buildings       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/08/huge-industrial-complex-is-launched-in-milpitas-could-lure-amazon-or-other-tech-firms/\">           Huge industrial complex is launched in Milpitas, could lure top tech firms       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/03/huge-tech-campus-expansion-north-san-jose-google/\">           Tech campus expansion near Google San Jose sites       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/01/mountain-views-employee-head-tax-goes-into-effect-google-to-pay-3-3-million-a-year/\">           Mountain View's employee head tax goes into effect, Google to pay $3.3 million a year       </url>   What can be done about the problems he sees with Google?

Emails obtained by this news organization showed an exchange in which Walker told LaJeneusse he thought a formal human rights program was unnecessary. </p><p>Walker has not returned a request for comment.</p><p>Once tasked with executing Google search's departure from China in 2010 - which the company attributed to its concern about censorship and that country's human rights record - LaJeunesse said he realized the company had changed.</p><p>\"It was a really special place,\" he said, adding that Google would recruit employees with the promise that they would be joining a world-changing company. But he said that not long after Google pulled its search engine out of China, other company departments wanted to enter the Chinese market. The fast-growing company became more concerned with its quarterly earnings, he said. \"It changed on me.\"</p><p>William Fitzgerald, who worked as a policy analyst for LaJeneusse from 2010 to 2012 in the Google Hong Kong office and now runs his own campaign advocacy firm called the Worker Agency, said LaJeneusse \"would always advocate tirelessly to make sure Google did right by its users even if that decision didn't reap the greatest amount of profits.\"</p><p>The former executive's allegations come as Google grapples with internal strife that includes a couple of years of employee protests over various issues - including Project Dragonfly, a possible return of Google search to China, which the company abandoned after employees (and later Congress) raised concerns. Some of the company's activist employees have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/tech/a30259355/google-walkout-organizer-claire-stapleton/\">since left and accused Google of retaliating against them.</url> Recently, Google  five employees who are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/06/fired-google-workers-claim-anti-union-retaliation-in-federal-labor-filing/\">alleging the company violated their right to organize</url>.</p><p>One of those fired employees is site reliability engineer Laurence Berland.</p><p>Google \"has changed for the worse - for its workers and the world - and, like many of us, Ross could not sit idly by, and was punished for it,\" Berland said Thursday.</p><p>LaJeunesse published a  Thursday, in which he also said he expressed concern about discrimination he witnessed at Google - and over which he told this publication he went to HR several times. He said he saw bullying that caused some young workers to cry, and that diversity exercises at the company included offensive labeling of different groups, which was also shown in emails obtained by this news organization.  He said eventually he was accidentally sent an email in which the HR director instructed a colleague to \"do some digging\" on him.</p><p>The company would not comment about LaJenuesse's specific allegations.</p><p>\"Ross was offered a new position at the exact same level and compensation, which he declined to accept,\" Google spokeswoman Jenn Kaiser said. \"We wish Ross all the best with his political ambitions.\"</p><p>LaJeunesse, who was a deputy chief of staff to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger before he spent 11 years at Google, is now running for a U.S. Senate seat in his home state of Maine, hoping to beat Republican Susan Collins. The Democrat announced his candidacy in November.</p><p>He said that after he was effectively pushed out of Google, he was thrown into \"a complete tailspin. It took me a while to figure out what had happened to me.\"</p><p>LaJeunesse and his husband moved from California to Maine, which he said isn't being represented well by Collins. He sees parallels between what is happening at Google and in Washington, D.C.</p><p>At both places, he sees \"abuse of power and corruption.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/01/08/huge-industrial-complex-is-launched-in-milpitas-could-lure-amazon-or-other-tech-firms/\">           Huge industrial complex is launched in Milpitas, could lure top tech firms       </url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/12/17/google-fires-engineer-who-created-browser-pop-up-message-about-workers-rights/\">fired</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@rossformaine/i-was-googles-head-of-international-relations-here-s-why-i-left-49313d23065\">blog post</url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/01/03/huge-tech-campus-expansion-north-san-jose-google/\">           Tech campus expansion near Google San Jose sites       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/01/01/mountain-views-employee-head-tax-goes-into-effect-google-to-pay-3-3-million-a-year/\">           Mountain View's employee head tax goes into effect, Google to pay $3.3 million a year       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/12/27/key-downtown-san-jose-lot-owned-pacific-bell-bought-by-developer-att-google/\">           Key downtown San Jose lot owned by Pacific Bell is bought by veteran developer       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/12/20/googles-sundar-pichai-gets-240-million-in-stock-grants-pushing-take-toward-1-billion/\">           Google's Sundar Pichai gets $240 million in stock grants, pushing take toward $1 billion       </url>   What can be done about the problems he sees with Google?

Former Google executive and current AliveCor CEO Vic Gundotra explains what he learned during a 'painful' two-year FDA clearance process.\u00a0 Vic Gundotra embarked on his health tech startup journey with the confidence of a tech industry veteran boasting years of experience. Despite leading high-profile projects at Google and Microsoft, Gundotra got a harsh reality check when he tried to steer his startup through a foreign and challenging regulatory landscape. \"I learned that as a former Google executive I was grossly misinformed about how medicine works and had to learn some painful lessons by making some mistakes that probably doubled the process,\" Gundotra told Business Insider in an interview.\u00a0 Gundotra's startup, AliveCor, makes a $200 wristband[1] that connects to the Apple Watch and allows users to take a medical heart reading, or EKG test. </p><p>The KardiaBand, which was released on Thursday is the first\u00a0Food and Drug Administration-cleared accessory[2] for the Apple Watch. Getting the FDA clearance was critical. And it was a lengthy process full of stumbling blocks, which Gundotra says took much longer than it should have. \"It was about a year and a half, two years ago that we announced the KardiaBand for the Apple Watch.

For starry-eyed tech execs accustomed to playing by their own sets of rules, the tightly regulated markets where the next big business opportunities lie present a special challenge. One key to working with the FDA is that slide decks aren't what the agency is looking for \u2014 it's looking for clinical evidence.\u00a0 \"They don't care about your word.

Molinari had previously served as Google's Vice President of Public Policy for the Americas and head of its D.C. office. The New York Times[4] summarized that Molinari was 'paid handsomely to broaden the tech giant's support beyond Silicon Valley Democrats and to lavish money and attention on selected Republicans.'The Times carefully noted that Molinari wielded impressive power in Big Tech during the 2010's: 'To fight off the now constant scrutiny of Google as a behemoth monopoly that reaches far into people's personal lives, Ms. Molinari has aggressively courted lawmakers and federal regulators as she has managed a Google effort that spent a record $18.2 million on lobbying in 2012.' The Times followed by explaining that she pushed congress on a variety of issues in order to aid Google's interests 'like a proposed overhaul of the nation's immigration laws.' In 2013 she also worked with Google's legal team 'to help fend off an antitrust lawsuit after a two-year investigation of the company by the Federal Trade Commission.'Axios observed[5] that even after Molinari stepped down from her role in 2018, she, 'In a new role,' would continue to 'advise the company on building external relationships.'Molinari currently serves[6] on APCO Worldwide's International Advisory Council. APCO describes itself as 'an advisory and advocacy communications consultancy, which purports itself to be 'an independent and majority women-owned business.'The American Prospect[7] summarized 'Molinari will speak at the convention tonight, along with two other Republican luminaries, as Biden attempts to display a united front in opposition to Donald Trump.' </p><p>The article made note that Molinari's involvement with the Democratic convention 'recalls the extremely close relationship[8] between the company [Google] and the Obama administration.' The American Prospect then recalled how: 'During Obama's two terms, members of his administration met with Google representatives more than once a week, on average. And nearly 250 people moved from government service to Google employment, or vice versa, over that period.\" This is not the first case where Big Tech insiders appear eerily cozy with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Biden's campaign.The Times[9] released a report criticizing[10] how 'his campaign and transition teams have welcomed allies of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple onto its staff and policy groups.' There's also concern that Big Tech may be trying to 'co-opt a potential Biden administration.'The Times allegedly obtained a list of rules sent out to groups advising the campaign explicitly telling them: 'Simply put, do not talk to the press,' a fact that lends itself to the notion that the campaign would rather these ties be kept under wraps.

Molinari had previously served as Google's Vice President of Public Policy for the Americas and head of its D.C. office. The New York Times[4] summarized that Molinari was 'paid handsomely to broaden the tech giant's support beyond Silicon Valley Democrats and to lavish money and attention on selected Republicans.'The Times carefully noted that Molinari wielded impressive power in Big Tech during the 2010's: 'To fight off the now constant scrutiny of Google as a behemoth monopoly that reaches far into people's personal lives, Ms. Molinari has aggressively courted lawmakers and federal regulators as she has managed a Google effort that spent a record $18.2 million on lobbying in 2012.' The Times followed by explaining that she pushed congress on a variety of issues in order to aid Google's interests 'like a proposed overhaul of the nation's immigration laws.' In 2013 she also worked with Google's legal team 'to help fend off an antitrust lawsuit after a two-year investigation of the company by the Federal Trade Commission.'Axios observed[5] that even after Molinari stepped down from her role in 2018, she, 'In a new role,' would continue to 'advise the company on building external relationships.'Molinari currently serves[6] on APCO Worldwide's International Advisory Council. APCO describes itself as 'an advisory and advocacy communications consultancy, which purports itself to be 'an independent and majority women-owned business.'The American Prospect[7] summarized 'Molinari will speak at the convention tonight, along with two other Republican luminaries, as Biden attempts to display a united front in opposition to Donald Trump.' </p><p>The article made note that Molinari's involvement with the Democratic convention 'recalls the extremely close relationship[8] between the company [Google] and the Obama administration.' The American Prospect then recalled how: 'During Obama's two terms, members of his administration met with Google representatives more than once a week, on average. And nearly 250 people moved from government service to Google employment, or vice versa, over that period.\" This is not the first case where Big Tech insiders appear eerily cozy with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Biden's campaign.The Times[9] released a report criticizing[10] how 'his campaign and transition teams have welcomed allies of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple onto its staff and policy groups.' There's also concern that Big Tech may be trying to 'co-opt a potential Biden administration.'The Times allegedly obtained a list of rules sent out to groups advising the campaign explicitly telling them: 'Simply put, do not talk to the press,' a fact that lends itself to the notion that the campaign would rather these ties be kept under wraps.

Former congresswoman for the state of New York  Susan Molinari is slated to speak tonight at the Democratic National Convention at Milwaukee, CBS has reported August 17. Molinari had previously served as Google's Vice President of Public Policy for the Americas and head of its D.C. office. The New York Times summarized that Molinari was \u201cpaid handsomely to broaden the tech giant\u2019s support beyond Silicon Valley Democrats and to lavish money and attention on selected Republicans.\u201d    The Times carefully noted that Molinari wielded impressive power in Big Tech during the 2010\u2019s:     \u201cTo fight off the now constant scrutiny of Google as a behemoth monopoly that reaches far into people\u2019s personal lives, Ms. Molinari has aggressively courted lawmakers and federal regulators as she has managed a Google effort that spent a record $18.2 million on lobbying in 2012.\u201d     The Times followed by explaining that she pushed congress on a variety of issues in order to aid Google\u2019s interests \u201clike a proposed overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\u201d In 2013 she also worked with Google\u2019s legal team \u201cto help fend off an antitrust lawsuit after a two-year investigation of the company by the Federal Trade Commission.\u201d    Axios observed that even after Molinari stepped down from her role in 2018, she, \u201cIn a new role,\u201d would continue to \u201cadvise the company on building external relationships.\u201d    Molinari currently serves on APCO Worldwide\u2019s International Advisory Council. APCO describes itself as \u201can advisory and advocacy communications consultancy, which purports itself to be \u201can independent and majority women-owned business.\u201d    The American Prospect summarized \u201cMolinari will speak at the convention tonight, along with two other Republican luminaries, as Biden attempts to display a united front in opposition to Donald Trump.\u201d The article made note that Molinari\u2019s involvement with the Democratic convention \u201crecalls the extremely close relationship between the company [Google] and the Obama administration.\u201d The American Prospect then recalled how:     \u201cDuring Obama\u2019s two terms, members of his administration met with Google representatives more than once a week, on average. And nearly 250 people moved from government service to Google employment, or vice versa, over that period.\"     This is not the first case where Big Tech insiders appear eerily cozy with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Biden\u2019s campaign.    The Times released a report criticizing how \u201chis campaign and transition teams have welcomed allies of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple onto its staff and policy groups.\u201d  There\u2019s also concern that Big Tech may be trying to \u201cco-opt a potential Biden administration.\u201d    The Times allegedly obtained a list of rules sent out to groups advising the campaign explicitly telling them: \u201cSimply put, do not talk to the press,\u201d a fact that lends itself to the notion that the campaign would rather these ties be kept under wraps.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42860756896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M8-FT81-F07F-81NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NewsBusters</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0005PFT</classCode><className>APCO WORLDWIDE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They argue that today's economy requires a new agency akin to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. </p><p>\"We're trying to put out the idea and the concepts, and try to make the case that a new administration may see this as an appropriate challenge,\" Wheeler told Axios. What they're saying: Dominant digital companies have made their own rules for consumers and the market absent federal oversight, the trio writes, maintaining that \"internet capitalism\" should be grounded in \"public interest expectations.\" \"Make no mistake, the innovations and economic growth of the digital platform companies are very much in the public interest,\" they write. \"This paper proposes a structure in which the public interest of strong and innovative companies and the public interest of consumer rights and competitive markets can both be preserved.\" Details: The agency would be able to sue companies over misbehavior, and hold them to reasonable standards of care, stepping in if firms are harming consumers or behaving negligently. \"Move fast, break things means the companies get to break the rules,\" Wheeler said. \"It's time for the public interest to catch up with that.\" He compared the standards the agency would use to the fire and electric codes that businesses have been held to for over a century.The agency would place particular focus on promoting interoperability and responsible data practices and working stop platforms from preferencing their own goods, services or content over rivals'. Yes, but: It's unlikely this Congress will take any action on the paper's ideas. But it could serve as a basis for something the new Congress proposes \u2014 though likely only if Democrats take control of both the House and the Senate and Joe Biden wins the presidency.

Business customers are increasingly alienated from their main financial services provider.</p><p>The big question is whether their frustration is superficial or powerful enough to make them consider alternatives.</p><p>Three times this year, Healy and Hornery have toured through Hong Kong, Shanghai and London to drum up support from investors.</p><p>Judo, according to Healy, has raised \"tens of millions\" of dollars in working capital, mostly in Australia but also Singapore.</p><p>The company is yet to secure a banking licence from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.</p><p>Healy, however, expects Judo will be making loans to small businesses by early to mid-March.</p><p>Mine could be shafted The long-term demand and supply fundamentals in carbon-intensive coalmining are facing further disruption, after a new weekend power plan by the Indian government that rules out construction of any new coal-fired power stations for the next decade.</p><p>According to Adani, the plan has no impact on the Carmichael mine in Queensland because the coal is for the company's own power stations.</p><p>But with NAB ruling out participation in a Carmichael funding package, and ANZ Bank effectively taking the same position at its annual meeting on Friday, the future of the proposed mine remains clouded at best.</p><p>Fintech compromise As 2016 closes, the relationship between legacy institutions and fintech companies has reached another turning point.</p><p>Fintech, the brash upstart, was initially intent on dominance through total disruption, but now has a grudging respect for the scale, if not the agility, of the industry's decades-old incumbents.</p><p>If phase one was all-out disruption, the dominant feature of phase two has been collaboration, with phase three likely to be some kind of hybrid model.</p><p>The hype that lasted several years has been diluted by a recognition that most fintech companies operate in a small, targeted niche of the financial services value chain, with very few aiming to take over the entire banking relationship.</p><p>There has also been a cooling in the white-hot venture capital market. While global VC interest in fintech companies remains high, the big investments of previous years are less common, with the number of deals and the total value of fintech investment declining in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter.</p><p>Total VC funding is unlikely to exceed the 2015 peak of $US14.5bn but overall investment is still on track to exceed last year's total.</p><p>It's not surprising that the \"World Fintech Report 2017\", compiled by technology consultancy Capgemini, found there was a consensus among industry executives that fintech was having an impact, but little agreement on how far it would go.</p><p>After interviewing more than 100 senior executives and surveying 8000 customers in 15 countries, the firm found that some executives believed fintechs did not have the ability to scale or maintain a unique value proposition.</p><p>Fintechs also lacked the capital of large financial institutions and faced uncertainty in venture capital funding.</p><p>Hardeep Walia, founder and chief executive of the Silicon Valley start-up Motif Investing, which invests around business themes, said: \"I always say follow the money. Does it change the economics of investing? If not, then it is usually a sign that it is not innovation, certainly not disruptive innovation.\" Against that, customers have been embracing new fintech providers, with 50.2 per cent of those surveyed already having done business with at least one non-traditional firm.</p><p>The so-called big tech firms such as Amazon, Facebook and Apple also represented an even bigger potential threat, because they had scale, superior data analysis capabilities to match and high levels of customer <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:trust.gluyasr@theaustralian.com.auTwitter\">trust.gluyasr@theaustralian.com.auTwitter</email>: @Gluyasr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20161220Australian22000196309144</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MF2-74B1-F0JP-W55M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 20, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001V19</classCode><className>NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00091HS</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND BANKING GROUP LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002B74</classCode><className>WOOLWORTHS GROUP PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522120 SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp; INTERNATIONAL BANKING INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6081 BRANCHES &amp; AGENCIES OF FOREIGN BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS524210 INSURANCE AGENCIES &amp; BROKERAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC6411 INSURANCE AGENTS, BROKERS, &amp; SERVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS452990 ALL OTHER GENERAL MERCHANDISE STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC5399 MISC.

He proposed this solution to stop 'Russian' interference, to protect privacy, and to prevent a monopoly. He then raised the point that, 'social media platforms can jeopardize both democratic and economic goals.'In the Feb. </p><p>14 Bloomberg op-ed 'Regulate Facebook and Twitter? The Case Is Getting Stronger,'[1] he rejected his previous views about regulation. '[Violating] the First Amendment' and '[squelching] creativity and innovation in the very places where they are most needed' are no longer his primary concerns. He quoted the late English Judge Baron Bramwell to summarize this change of priorities, 'The matter does not appear to me now as it appears to have appeared to me then.'Grassroots conservatives rely on social media to combat liberal media bias and liberal indoctrination in schools. Sunstein has written a previous op-ed praising Chinese school indoctrination and has been dubbed by The Blaze's Glenn Beck as 'the most dangerous man in America.'[2]The first major reason he cited for his new position is that regulating social media is a matter of protecting 'democracy itself,' scapegoating Russia's tendency to 'promote their interests' as if that were the major reason Democrats lost the 2016 election.The second reason was the cause of consumer protection, and the third was suggesting that big tech companies can be 'a kind of monopoly.'His concerns about foreign interference are ironic. Sunstein has said America should learn from the education reforms used in communist China.In his op-ed titled 'Open Brain, Insert ideology' Sunstein praised China's educational reforms designed to \"transform students' political views' and wondered whether such programs would also be effective in the United States.He suggested readers envision a scenario where 'an authoritarian government decides to embark on a program of curricular reform, with the explicit goal of indoctrinating the nation's high school students.'

He proposed this solution to stop 'Russian' interference, to protect privacy, and to prevent a monopoly. He then raised the point that, 'social media platforms can jeopardize both democratic and economic goals.'In the Feb. </p><p>14 Bloomberg op-ed 'Regulate Facebook and Twitter? The Case Is Getting Stronger,'[1] he rejected his previous views about regulation. '[Violating] the First Amendment' and '[squelching] creativity and innovation in the very places where they are most needed' are no longer his primary concerns. He quoted the late English Judge Baron Bramwell to summarize this change of priorities, 'The matter does not appear to me now as it appears to have appeared to me then.'Grassroots conservatives rely on social media to combat liberal media bias and liberal indoctrination in schools. Sunstein has written a previous op-ed praising Chinese school indoctrination and has been dubbed by The Blaze's Glenn Beck as 'the most dangerous man in America.'[2]The first major reason he cited for his new position is that regulating social media is a matter of protecting 'democracy itself,' scapegoating Russia's tendency to 'promote their interests' as if that were the major reason Democrats lost the 2016 election.The second reason was the cause of consumer protection, and the third was suggesting that big tech companies can be 'a kind of monopoly.'His concerns about foreign interference are ironic. Sunstein has said America should learn from the education reforms used in communist China.In his op-ed titled 'Open Brain, Insert ideology' Sunstein praised China's educational reforms designed to \"transform students' political views' and wondered whether such programs would also be effective in the United States.He suggested readers envision a scenario where 'an authoritarian government decides to embark on a program of curricular reform, with the explicit goal of indoctrinating the nation's high school students.' He continued by wondering if such a government could teach 'that their government is good and trustworthy, that their system is democratic and committed to the rule of law, and that free markets are a big problem.'He then mused if that system of indoctrination could work in the United States. He noted that high schools in particular have the power to nudge students toward what they consider 'a correct worldview, a correct view on life, and a correct value system.'Beck's website also notes [3]that Sunstein himselfwrote a controversial paper advocating the use of agents to infiltrate and subvert online groups and disseminate false information.

But it also created problems and challenges that can't be ignored, Xiao Gang, former chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told a fintech industry forum Tuesday in Beijing.</p><p>China's financial sector has entered \"a new stage\" dominated by \"capital strength plus technology monopoly,\" said Xiao, the 61-year-old ex-regulator who oversaw China's trillion-dollar stock market between March 2013 and February 2016.</p><p>\"It is in urgent need to strengthen the supervision of large fintech companies,\" said Xiao, who is now a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference \u2015 China's top political advisory body.</p><p>Xiao warned that risks of fintech companies stem from their complex mixture of business profiles that could cause contagion and systemic risks if things go wrong. The overwhelming market presence of fintech giants could put consumers and investors in a weaker position, and some companies may leverage their market dominance to undermine users' privacy. In addition, there is a lack of effective emergency plans to tackle potential technology security risks, Xiao said.</p><p>Chinese technology companies, led by Alibaba Group Holding Co. and Tencent Holdings, have made forays into financial services over the past few years, using their massive holdings of data and access to users to tap new business opportunities including payment, wealth management and online lending.</p><p>Ant Financial Services Group, the fintech arm of Alibaba, has developed a sprawling business range allowing users to pay bills, book restaurants, buy services and make investments on its app. It is also behind a long list of business startups. Tencent, through its popular messaging app WeChat, has reached more than 1 billion users globally and challenged Alibaba in financial services.</p><p>Ant Financial's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay, China's two online-payment behemoths,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-11-23/alipay-and-wechat-may-have-grown-too-big-to-fail-101351370.html\"> have more users </url>than any of the country's biggest banks.</p><p>China should improve its regulatory framework for large fintech companies with wide business operations and social influence, and adopt macro-prudential management approaches on such institutions with stricter requirements on capital adequacy ratio, debt ratio and information disclosure that are similar to the systemically important financial institutions, Xiao said.</p><p>But requirements for major fintech companies should not be simply copied from those for conventional financial institutions, consistent with the new character of their businesses, Xiao said. For instance, the average bad loan ratio of fintech companies' lending to small and micro businesses is around 1%, compared with 5.9% for traditional banks, reflecting the need for new supervisory criteria, Xiao said.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulations should be worked out to better protect consumers and investors' privacy and personal data to prevent big companies from recklessly collecting, storing and misusing such data, Xiao said. Regulators should also carefully manage financial business licenses and closely monitor monopolistic practices that could damage fair competition, he said.</p><p>Last year, China's central bank<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-11-28/china-to-publish-its-own-too-big-to-fail-list-101352719.html\"> identified </url>Ant Financial among five financial conglomerates as \"financial holding companies\" in a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-07-27/china-proposes-tighter-oversight-of-financial-holding-companies-101444393.html\"> pilot program </url>to tighten supervisions of too-big-to-fail financial institutions.</p><p>Regulators globally have also stepped up oversight of rapidly expanding fintech giants. Authorities in Japan passed a bill that calls on e-commerce sites and app stores - including those of Amazon, Apple and Google - to file government reports about their operations in a move to increase regulations and demand transparency, Reuters reported Tuesday.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Contact reporter Han Wei </emphasis>(<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:weihan@caixin.com\">weihan@caixin.com</email>)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Caixin Global has officially launched<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Caixin CEIC Mobile </emphasis>, a mobile-only version of a world-class platform for macroeconomic and microeconomic data.</emphasis></p><p>From now on, all users can enjoy a one-month<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> free trial </emphasis>on the Caixin App through December 2019.

Al Franken, D-Minn., on Tuesday made his first public appearance since resigning at the beginning of this year following sexual misconduct allegations, using that opportunity to call for more government regulation on tech industry giants. \"Facebook talks about Cambridge Analytica \u2026 as if they are isolated bad actors,\" Franken said Tuesday at the Xchange Forum 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal. \"But as we know\u2026 the vulnerabilities that Cambridge Analytica exploited were well known within Facebook and within the developer community.\"The former comedian said looking at regulating tech companies was also important to stop spread of fake news, which he clarified he meant in a different way than Trump means it.\u201cNow when President Trump uses the term \u201cfake news,\u201d he\u2019s using it to refer to any news story he doesn't like.

As Franken served his tenure in the Senate, he was a critic of big tech companies and even lobbied to create the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law. Franken alluded to the fact that he could be stepping back into the public eye, suggesting he was at the conference to do more than just talk and make sure something like the Facebook- Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal doesn\u2019t happen again. \"I'm not just here to cast blame,\" Franken said. \"I'm here to make sure it doesn't happen again.\"Absent from his discussion at the conference was any mention of reasoning for leaving his post as U.S. senator just four months ago, or any response to the sexual misconduct allegations against him.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2034822093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S87-1DD1-DY0W-40W1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"279\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

And now ringing the closing bell on the  day that's seen the Dow Jones rise 60 odd points.  Hit the gavel.  There we  go.  One, two, three.  Solid gavels.  I think that what we'll today, solid  gavels bring trading to a close on Thursday, it's the 30th of March.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, South Korea's corruption scandal broke.  The former South Korean  president is under arrest and we'll be in Seoul in a moment or two.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Banks based in London are reaching for their passports.  I'll speak to  Lloyd's of London, the chief executive about her company's plans and  switch.</p><p>And Sweden's Finance Minister tells me tonight, Europe's Brexit talks will  need grownups in the room.  I'm Richard Quest live in London, where of  course I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  We begin tonight with breaking news from South Korea.  Where  the ousted President Park Geun-hye has been arrested.  The judge who issued  the arrest warrant said there was a concern that the former president might  try to destroy evidence.  Park was already being held ahead of the court's  decision.  Prosecutors accuse her of abusing presidential powers, taking  bribes from companies and leaking confidential information.  </p><p>CNN's Paula Hancocks, our South Korea correspondent is in Seoul for us  tonight.  Just remind us, before this latest development, Paula, what was  Park's position?  She was out of office.  She's been impeached.  Was she  under arrest?  What was your position before tonight?  </p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, she was basically at a hearing  where she had to plead before the judge and explain why she should not be  arrested.  Prosecutors had sought an arrest warrant for her earlier in the  week, and then all day today or yesterday, now it's 5:00 in the morning,  she was pleading her case.  So, she was impeached.  The constitutional  court had upheld that impeachment so she lost all presidential immunity.   But she was free until they decided this arrest warrant should take place.  </p><p>What we've heard from the judge today is that he said major crimes have  been ascertained.  As you say, he believed there was a fear that she could  destroy evidence, which is one of the main reasons why a judge would agree  with an arrest warrant, or the fact that someone could be a flight risk.   Also, saying that the court recognizes the need and necessity for the  suspect to be arrested.  So right now, she is in Seoul detention center,  just outside Seoul, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  This was the fear, that she might be arrested.  As I recall, that  fear was about not so much destruction of evidence but actually to be  arrested for charges of misfeasance for what she actually did in office.   But this is something different.  </p><p>HANCOCKS:  That's right.  This is one step higher.  This is the prosecutor  saying that she has to be arrested immediately because they believe she  will destroy evidence, and then while she's in detention, while she's  arrested, then they will bring these charges against her.  And the judge  has agreed in this case.  So, it's one step higher.  We know that  prosecutors have been mentioning charges of abuse of power, of bribery, of  leaking classified information.  So, they've given us an indication of the  direction they're going.  And we're expecting within the next 20 days that  they will charge Park Geun-hye.  </p><p>This is what they have, they have 20 days, and then they either have to  renew that or release her.  But we're expecting within the next few weeks  we could see charges against her.  But of course, remember, we're also  going to be seeing a presidential election in this country on May the 9th,  so there are some experts who are speculating whether or not the  prosecutors will want to wait until after that election.  They won't want  to be seen to be politically biased in any way.  So potentially this could  hang on until after the election.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, Paula Hancocks, please let us know when there is more to  report.  Obviously, a stunning development tonight, that the former  impeached president is now in custody, potentially to be charged with  destruction of evidence or at least the worry is that there could be the  destruction of evidence.  </p><p>As Britain prepares for its future outside the European Union, the EU is  planning for its future without the U.K.  At a meeting in Malta, European  leaders said they were determined to move on and tackle the challenges of  economic recovery and nationalism.  The EU council's president Donald Tusk  called on the remaining 27 member states to unite.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:05:00] DONALD TUSK, EU COUNCIL PRESIDENT:  Proclaiming the end of  history, proclaiming the ultimate triumph of liberal democracy, peace, and  international order, have turned out to be, to put it mildly, exaggerated.   For rational and responsible patriots who want to maintain sovereignty and  independence of their nations and states, there is no alternative to a  united and sovereign Europe.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Erin McLaughlin is in Malta for us tonight.  Erin, they are talking  unity, and they always talk unity at a moment of crisis.  So, I'm guessing  that they will stay united for the time being.  </p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That certainly is the hope, Richard.   You know, when Brexit first happened, there was a real concern, that was  the end of the European project, that it was lights out, that such a  prominent and strong EU member state should decide to leave the European  Union by popular vote.  Now fast forward, months later.  EU officials are  saying that's not the case, this scenario is far from apocalyptic.   However, there still are persistent threats of nationalism and populism.  </p><p>And one senior EU official telling me the hope is going forward that the EU  will be able to position itself as sort of an island, he said, in a sea of  insanity, as a bastion for liberal democracy.  And the hope is that that  soft power will be what sees the EU through the crisis.  He said don't  expect the populace to just win outright.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  But here's the problem.  How much of that unity is real  and how much of it is manufactured on the basis of the back of Brexit?  If  you are to take the EU 27, and the question, for example, of a two-speed  Europe, or, for example, of the increased budgetary contributions as a  result of Britain leaving, how likely is that unity to fray?  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  Well, that is, Richard, the million-dollar question.  And  we're really going to have to see how this plays out in the months going  forward.  Right now, what EU officials behind the scenes are telling me is  that they're seeing messages of unity across the remaining 27 EU member  states.  Will that persist?  That is the question.  EU leaders acknowledge  that reforms are need.  They're looking at how to shape the EU going  forward.  They realize the status quo cannot persist when it comes to the  European project.  </p><p>QUEST:  It's interesting, John Claude Juncker making a comment about Donald  Trump, where he basically said stop trying to suggest Brexit is going to  spread.  But he did it in a very strange way.  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  EU leaders, we're hearing, are becoming more and more vocal  about what they've been hearing from the Trump administration.  After all,  President Trump has been vocal himself, openly praising Brexit, comparing  the popular vote that saw Brexit to his own electoral victory.  Let's take  a listen to what the president of the European Commission had to say today.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN CLAUDE JUNCKER, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT (through translator):   Brexit is not the end.  There are many who would find it wonderful if it  were the case.  Also on another continent, where a newly-elected president  was delighted that Britain was leaving the European Union, and has also  encourages other countries to do the same, if it continues in that way, I  would encourage Ohio's independence and the exit of Texas from the United  States of America.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN:  That statement really is not playing well, perhaps no surprise  among Trump supporters.  Nigel Farage one of the architects of the Brexit  campaign tweeting out saying, \"Juncker has made a complete fool of himself  again.  The USA was formed by consent while the EU is being imposed.\"  No  response from President Trump just yet, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  Erin McLaughlin from Malta at the summit, thank you.  </p><p>Britain has two years to leave the European Union.  London's financial  institutions aren't waiting for the details to be worked out.  They are in  many cases, we're getting the evidence now, planning for a hard Brexit and  relocation in the process.  At risk is the so-called passporting rights.   The passport grants them access to EU markets on an equal basis.  Now,  Citigroup today has warned employees, some jobs may move out of the U.K.  </p><p>[16:10:00] As the banks wonder where to go, the cities are making their  pitches.  The postcard from Dublin, which has an English-speaking  workforce, and similar laws to the U.K.  JPMorgan is reportedly in talks  for a new office in Dublin but won't comment or confirm.  </p><p>Then of course Brussels.  The center for European politics.  Very unlikely  to leave the EU.  That's why the insurance fund Lloyd's of London is  setting up a subsidiary there.  The chief executive said the future for  Paris is more uncertain.  The French capital has touted its own culture  even as Marine Le Pen pushes a message of nationalism.  </p><p>And then, Frankfurt, home of the ECB.  It's expecting up to 10,000 new  financial jobs as a result of Brexit.  So already the change is starting to  happen.  And within the hour, the Lloyd's of London chief executive, Inga  Beale will be joining me here in London to talk about the decision to move  or at least to split part of the insurance market off to Brussels.   Germany's foreign minister is warning Britain won't get an easy ride from  the rest of Europe.  Sigmar Gabriel says he expects formal negotiations to  begin in around late May and they won't be straightforward.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIGMAR GABRIEL, GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator):  For the  German government, it is clear that the most important condition for the  negotiations on Britain leaving the EU is safeguarding the interests of the  citizens of the remaining 27 member states.  The unity and the economic,  social, and political interests of the member states as well as of the  European Union institutions.  In all these areas, there can be no special  deal for Britain.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  No special deal.  And yet that's exactly what the British Prime  Minister Theresa May asked for when she sent her letter to Donald Tusk.   So, it's really very straightforward.  Can there be a trade agreement  before Britain leaves?  Sweden's finance minister says the U.K. must  finalize the divorce before talks about trade can begin.  There's only two  years to do it all.  So, I asked Magdalena Andersson who joined me from  Stockholm if there was a new sense of urgency on both sides.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAGDALENA ANDERSSON, SWEDISH FINANCE MINISTER:  Yes, it's true.  The time  schedule is very tight.  And I think the quicker we can begin and the more  force we can do these negotiations, the better.  But I think it's better to  start with a divorce before and then afterwards we start with the trade,  the talks about the future trade agreement that we will have to have.  I  think it's good for both of us that we can sort this out as soon as  possible.  I think that's another good starting point for these  discussions.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, in your statement, you say in the future relationship between  the EU and the U.K., we want trade relations to be as favorable as  possible.  And whether that's negotiated simultaneously or  contemporaneously with the divorce, are you in favor ultimately of a free  trade agreement between the U.K. and the EU 27?  </p><p>ANDERSSON:  Of course, we want to have a good free trade agreement.  And to  have good conditions.  I think that's in the interests of the European  Union but also Great Britain.  Great Britain is important export market for  Swedish companies but also other European companies.  The European Union is  an even more important export market for British companies.  So, I think  having a free trade agreement is in the interests of both partners here.   But at the same time, we have to say, it will be more complicated for  companies to trade.  The administrative burden will increase when the U.K.  leaves the customs union.  So, it will be more complicated, it will be more  expensive, and it will hurt their economy.  Now the discussion is how will  we do damage control to make it hurt as less as possible.  </p><p>QUEST:  As these talks get under way, how do you prevent bad feeling, ill  will, and a wish to have a deterrent effect influencing these talks?  </p><p>ANDERSSON:  Yes, I think most of us know some people that have been  divorced.  And we know that there's often a lot of feeling during divorces.   And you can -- but the thing is we really have to not let our feelings run  away with ourselves during this process.  There will be a need to have a  lot of grownups in the room and we can act in a rational way.  I think this  will be very important.  But it's also in the interest of both partners.   That would be very important.  Lots of grownups in the room.  </p><p>QUEST:  Finally, minister, the question of EU citizens and British  citizens.  This one really can be solved quite quickly, can't it, almost on  day one, both sides just simple have to say, yep, yours that are here can  stay and ours that are there can stay, end of subject.  Do you agree that's  the way forward?  </p><p>ANDERSSON:  I think it will be more complicated.  This will be part of the  negotiations, but of course it's in the interest of both of us that this  will be solved in a good way.  For me, there are 100,000 Swedish citizens  living in the U.K. </p><p>[16:15:00] Of course, there needs to be a solution.  I'm not certain it  will be day one.  </p><p>QUEST:  Here is the problem.  The British are coming under some criticism  for perhaps using the citizens issue as a bargaining chip.  But what you  have just said is basically the same thing.  Both sides are, let's be blunt  about this, minister, both sides are prepared to use the citizenship  question as a bargaining chip, because after all, this is a negotiation.  </p><p>ANDERSSON:  I wouldn't call it a bargaining chip.  But of course, there are  several parts of these negotiations, where we could have good conditions  for our citizens and solving their problems would be one part of it.  We  see in Sweden that lots of people from Great Britain that live-in Sweden,  they are applying for citizenship.  We're looking forward to having more  Swedish-British citizens in Sweden.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  That's the finance minister of Sweden talking to me earlier today  from Stockholm.  Investors in Europe are mostly ignoring the uncertainty of  a Brexit.  Stocks rose for a third straight day in Frankfurt, Paris, and  Zurich.  If you look at BMW shares their round 1 percent higher.  And a BMW  board member told us he's not worried about Brexit.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IAN ROBERTSON, BMW BOARD MEMBER:  Nothing is changing what we want, how  it's delivered in the next two years I think we'll have to wait and see.   I'm an optimist.  My work is in sales and marketing.  I hope, I trust, I  think there are solutions to all of these things.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Consumers in America have gone on a shopping fever spree.  And it  all follows the federal reserve of San Francisco, which is talking about a  goldilocks economy and discussing what it means for the Trump  administration and its ambitious targets after the break.  It's QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS, we're in London.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Growth in the United States got a nice little bump higher in the  last quarter.  And now the challenge is for Donald Trump to double it.   Look at the numbers.  Remember, it's Q4 growth.  It was 1.9 percent.  And  it was revised upwards.  I think this is the final revision, so it's a 2.1  percent.  You get the initial, the first revision, and then the final.</p><p>Donald Trump says his target is 4 percent.  But that's not been seen since  the early 2000s, and even then, it was only for a very short period of time  in some extremely unusual circumstances.  The head of the San Francisco Fed  has been celebrating over the lasting few days, saying we've largely  attained a hard-sought recovery that we've been seeking for the past nine  years.  According to the Fed president or at least the San Francisco Fed  president, it's a case of job done and now it's about sustainable recovery,  not reaching recovery.  All of which gave a boost to all three.  </p><p>[16:20:00] The Dow Jones industrials is up 69 points, over 20,700 once  again.  It's a third of a percent up.  And the NASDAQ, produces a new  record, putting on a third of a percent.  Paul La Monica joins me now.   This is downright fickle, isn't it?  The markets just cannot decide.  Every  time we get a bit of a worry over Trump's agenda, they don't fall out of  bed.  But there's a definite case of the collie wobbles.  </p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I think investors are  clearly growing a little bit more concerned that everything they bought  into in regards to Trump's promises may not be achievable anytime soon.  We  saw that obviously, with health care reform.  Most people I speak to think  that tax reform is doable at some point within the next few months perhaps  and that's why they're remaining optimistic.  And with regards to oil,  which you pointed out, look at oil prices, they shot up today.  That is why  Exxon was one of the winners on the Dow.  JPMorgan Chase, other banks, also  rallying.  There still is this hope that we'll get unwinding of some of  those Dodd/Frank laws.  </p><p>QUEST:  OK, but even for all of this, you have got 2.1 percent growth.   It's a bit lower than par.  You've got unemployment down at 4.5, 4.6  percent.  The Fed pretty much is now just about calling it the goldilocks  economy, not too hot, and not too cool.  It's difficult to know how the  fiscal policies still to come will factor in.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Definitely.  And I think almost everyone believes that 4  percent is not going to happen.  That is a bit fantastical, I think, of Mr.  Trump, to be suggesting that we could get to those levels.  Richard, if we  get to 3 percent, which might be doable if you have a combination of lower  taxes, unwinding some of the Dodd/Frank laws, and then an actual stimulus  plan with infrastructure spending, 3 percent is a victory.  He is not going  to be criticized by many American people for only getting to 3 percent  because that's likely to be accompanied by even more job growth and more  wage gains.  And that's what we all want.  </p><p>QUEST:  Paul La Monica in New York, the guru La Monica, thank you, sir.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  See you back in New York next week when I'm there.  </p><p>A new report from the U.S. State Department shows fewer and fewer Americans  are actually seeking unemployment assistance.  It appears that the job  market is improving.  Unprecedented job destruction could lie just around  the corner.  A warning from billionaire Jeff Greene who says the impact  that globalization had on blue collars workers for 30 to 40 years,  artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, will do the same for  the white-collar workforce, and it will do it in a fraction of the time.   Just 5 to 10 years.  Jeff Greene founded the Greene Institute which holds a  conference on the topic if you days' time.  Jeff joins us from Palm Beach,  Florida, and we are very pleased, sir, to have you on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p>JEFF GREENE, FOUNDER, GREENE INSTITUTE:  Thank you, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  At the end of the day, time and again over the last few months I've  heard people alluding, suggesting, warning that it's really AI, it's really  robotics, it's automation that is going to take the jobs.  But nobody is  sounding a clarion warning, sir.  </p><p>GREENE:  Well, I am, Richard.  I think that, you know, both parties are  ignoring what is really in my view the issue of our time.  Just this week,  Price Waterhouse came out with a report that clearly laid out how 38  percent of all jobs in America will be automated and eliminated in the next  15 years.  If that isn't a wake-up call, what will be?  </p><p>QUEST:  But what's your solution?  And maybe you haven't got one.  Maybe  your idea is the dialogue has to begin to actually find a solution.  </p><p>GREENE:  Well, you hit it on the head.  No one's talking about it.  If  anybody is interested in this, they can go to  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.managingthedestruction.com\">www.managingthedestruction.com</url>.  We'll see what we're talking about on  Monday.  We're bringing in Tom Friedman, Ray Kurzweil, the futurist, Arnie  Duncan, the former education Secretary.  Larry Summers, even David Cameron  is coming over from the U.K. to talk about the Brexit and how some of the  Brexit result was the result of this problem.  </p><p>Look, I mean, what's happening in the world is, job destruction is already  happening.  Everyone looks at Uber.  If you're a taxi driver in New York  City, five years ago, you probably thought not only do you have a steady  income for the rest of your life as long as you want to hop in that yellow  cab, but that medallion is security for you and your child and  grandchildren to make a living.  Now what's happened Uber comes along and  that guy's income is down and he feels uneasy, as he should.  </p><p>We may have driverless cars and eliminate millions of jobs just from that  in this country.  </p><p>[16:25:00] QUEST:  When the president says he's going to bring jobs back,  and we get a few thousand here and a few thousand there coming back from  car companies or Carrier or whatever, is the president missing the point  here?  Has he got the wrong focus?  </p><p>GREENE:  100 percent the wrong focus.  Of course, it is.  I've tried to  reach out to Donald Trump.  I live here in Palm Beach.  I live very close  to the president.  I've tried to reach out to him on this many times.  We  haven't really gotten together, which is unfortunate.  Steve Mnuchin as  Treasure Secretary just this week said that is not going to be AI won't be  a problem for 50 to 100 years.  </p><p>This is ridiculous.  We have to get focused and understand.  We're heading  into a period of unprecedented job destruction, where the greatest  destruction to our economy since the depression, and we have to understand  it's happening, start talking about it and come up with real solutions.   The fact of the matter is we're still the biggest economy in the world, we  have the best universities in the world.  Everyone wants to come here.   Let's take our positives and focus on this problem and get it addressed.  </p><p>QUEST:  Well, some say of course that some nation has to do the value-added  work of building the robots, developing the software for the AI.  And I  understand that will not replace Parry Pursue, the jobs that will be lost.   But there will be people watching tonight who will say, well that Jeff  Greene, a downright alarmist.  </p><p>GREENE:  Well, look.  I mean, the reality is, in a middle-class economy,  most people do routine jobs.  Manufacturing, when I was a kid, it would be  putting things in boxes or if you're in an office, entering data, typing  letters, interesting data on papers.  Those jobs right now are better done  by the machines.  The reality is most people are average.  That's why the  average person has a 100 IQ.  If artificial intelligence is operating at  120 IQ, which it will be soon, people will not be able to compete with  these machines for most of the work they've had traditionally in a middle- class economy.  </p><p>QUEST:  It just makes me what's going to happen to my own job here.  Jeff,  thank you, sir.  Really appreciate it.  If you do get to speak to the  president, maybe go knock on the door at Mar-a-Lago next door.  If you do  come back and tell us what he said.  We look forward to having you on the  program.</p><p>GREENE:  I'm a member of Mar-a-Lago.  I had dinner there a few weeks ago.   I was lucky enough to be seated at the next table to the President.  But we  weren't able to get into this subject.  You can be sure next time I get his  ear, I will definitely remind him this is the issue of our time.  </p><p>QUEST:  You mean you had the chance and you didn't take it! </p><p>GREENE:  Well, you know what, you have a limited amount of time, with the  President of the United States.  Basically, we just wanted to exchange  greetings.  Then he had to get on with his dinner.  </p><p>QUEST:  Excellent, sir.  Next time, come back and tell us what he said  about AI.  I appreciate it.  Jeff Greene at Mar-a-Lago.  </p><p>Britain is leaving the EU.  Lloyd's of London is moving into the EU.  The  chief executive explains why she picks Brussels, she's with us after the  break.  This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  I'll be joined by the chief executive of Lloyd's of London.   By now, U.S. lawmakers want to make it easier to sell on your internet  browsing history.  </p><p>And as we move on, before any of it, this is CNN, and on this network, the  news always comes first.  </p><p>The former South Korean leader Park Geun-Hye has been arrested on  corruption charges.  A judge approved a warrant for her arrest early Friday  saying there was concern the impeached president might destroy evidence.   Park was removed this month as the corruption scandal worsened.  </p><p>Russian president Vladimir Putin is strenuously denying that Russia tried  to interfere in the U.S. presidential election.  He called the allegations  fictional, illusory, and lies.  He says it's not in American interests to  push relations to the point of absurdity.  </p><p>In Ankara, the new secretary of state says America and turkey will work  together to build stability in the region, on the eve of a massive push  against is in Raqqa, Syria.  </p><p>Now, you would expect the world's largest insurance market, Lloyd's, to be  prudent against any risks that the actual market itself may be facing.   Indeed, that's exactly what it's doing, taking out its own insurance  against Brexit.  It's been a British institution for more than three  centuries.  Now it's announced plans to set up a subsidiary in Brussels, a  day after the pm began the formal process of removing the U.K. from the EU.   The chief executive of Lloyd's joins me now.  We talked in Davos.  We said  we would do this but you wouldn't tell me the country you were going to do  it.  Now we know it's Belgium and Brussels.  Why?  </p><p>INGA BEALE, CEO, LLOYD'S OF LONDON:  We didn't tell you at the time because  we had to deliberate very carefully.  Lots of criteria we need to consider.   We wanted to take our time and be very professional about it.  Now, we  chose Brussels.  It's got a very, very strong and quality regulatory  environment.  For Lloyd's, our reputation is paramount.  We've been doing  business for hundreds of years.  We're one of the world's best known  insurance brands.  It's so important we go somewhere with an excellent  reputation.  We also need to hire some people.  So, we wanted access to  multilingual, high caliber talent.  And we had to consider ease of access.   We'll have to be traveling from London, we'll need continental European  clients.  We wanted to choose somewhere in excellent location and in the  heart of Europe.  And importantly, one more factor, we wanted to choose  somewhere that was a high likelihood of remaining in the EU.  </p><p>QUEST:  It's fascinating that that was a factor.  At the end of the day,  the whole thing depends on Belgium and Brussels being in the EU.  </p><p>BEALE:  We need to be in the EU to keep insuring EU customers.  </p><p>QUEST:  How much business goes to the Brussels subsidiary?  Will all  European business go into it?  </p><p>BEALE:  It's more complex than that.  About 5 percent of our global  business is European or EU business.  We will lose the right to issue  policies for post-Brexit.  That's simple insurance business.  Some of the  more complex insurance in the EU, marine business, aviation business, the  reinsurance business that we write, that we'll be able to continue to write  from London.  So, another 6 percent of EU business we'll write in London.   5 percent we'll have to write through this EU subsidiary.  </p><p>QUEST:  This is going to be -- I mean, it's necessary, you don't really  have any choice in doing this.  But it's going to be costly for you, isn't  it?  </p><p>[16:35:00] BEALE:  It's going to add some cost.  Of course, we're providing  this subsidiary for the whole of the Lloyd's market.  We have 84 businesses  writing insurance in Lloyd's.  If you spread it across the whole market,  it's minimal cost.  It will add .1 percent of our premiums.  </p><p>QUEST:  How big is Lloyd's vis-a-vis the global insurance industry?  As you  said before we came on air, you do the bit that nobody wants to touch, the  risky business.  How big is Lloyd's?  </p><p>BEALE:  We write about 30 billion pounds of revenues, of premiums.  We're  in the top five reinsurers in the world.  Which means we're insuring  insurance companies.  We are a major, major player in the specialist  insurance lines for things like the heart of Lloyd's, where we started  insuring ships and cargos around the world, we're the leading writer of  that kind of business.  We will have as much as a 50 percent global market  share.  New products like cyber insurance, which is on the rise, we have a  25 percent global market share of that business.  </p><p>QUEST:  This question of cyber insurance and the writing of cyber  insurance, it's a risk, isn't it?  You're really taking your own risk when  you write that.  Because we really don't know the full range of potential  risk with cyber.  </p><p>BEALE:  We don't.  That is what Lloyd's has always been about.  Just think,  when that first satellite went up into space, we didn't know what the risks  were.  When the first airplane went up.  We take on risks that others can't  take on.  </p><p>QUEST:  What about the risk of Brexit from other companies?  Is there an  insurable risk that you can take out against Brexit?  </p><p>BEALE:  We haven't yet issued a Brexit policy.  </p><p>QUEST:  You're looking at it, I can tell.  </p><p>BEALE:  What we do see is an increased rise in political instability in the  world.  We're seeing a huge increase in demand for things like specialist  insurance related to political instability, the chances that a government  may take action and stop payments being made.  We see a huge demand for  insurance against that sort of thing.  So not just Brexit but sort of the  political instability in the whole world.  And tragically, of course, the  rise in terrorism means that more people are buying terrorism insurance  from us.  So, what's where we come into our -- I suppose our real strength,  is when things are looking bad for business, we can help protect them and  mitigate against those.  </p><p>QUEST:  Finally, you're talking about terrorism, political risk.  I know  last year was a bad year for you with wildfires in Canada.  You also had a  couple of hurricanes.  You really do get the nasty stuff.  </p><p>BEALE:  There's almost every headline in the world, there's something --  Lloyd's will be behind it somewhere, protecting businesses.  </p><p>QUEST:  And the solidness of Lloyd's balance sheet now is -- </p><p>BEALE:  Stronger than ever.  We've got financial net resources getting on  to 30 billion pounds.  $36 billion.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>BEALE:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Nice to have you coming in.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>Ivanka Trump is getting an official job at the White House and she won't be  paid a dime for it.  We're talking about the first daughter and what she'll  be doing for her father, the president.  </p><p>[16:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Trump's surrogates say this unprecedented position is not about  nepotism.  Neither family member is being paid for their work.  The former  White House ethics czar under president Obama says Mr. Trump is trying to  act like a king.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NORMAN EISEN, FMR. ETHICS LAWYER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Do we really want a  country that is run like a monarchy where you have the throne flanked by  family members?  Or do we want people in the oval office whose first  loyalty will be to the country, not to the man sitting behind the desk?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Jeremy Diamond is at the White House for us tonight.  Look, to  anybody watching at home tonight, just how extraordinary is this?  Bearing  in mind that Hillary Clinton certainly did the ill-fated health care plan  for her husband bill Clinton, and one bush son helped another bush father  campaign.  So how different is this?  </p><p>JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Well, Yes, you're right, first  ladies have until the past had pretty significant policy portfolios at the  White House.  But we haven't seen an adult first daughter or first son in  the White House for quite a long time.  And so, it is relatively  unprecedented.  But of course, this is how president Donald Trump has  operated for decades in his business and how he's now operating as  president.  And during the campaign as well, Ivanka Trump had a very  significant role.  She has now become a government employee.  She's been  named assistant to the president.  But this is really nearly a formality.   Ivanka Trump in the last month has gotten a west wing office.  She's begun  to get a security clearance.  And she really has taken on a much more  prominent role.  She's been present for the meeting between chancellor  Angela Merkel of Germany and the president.  </p><p>And so, that more public role has prompted a lot of ethics experts to call  on the White House to decide, is Ivanka Trump a government employee or is  she not?  So now Ivanka Trump taking this additional step to become an  official government employee even though she won't be taking a salary.  She  was hoping to allay some of those concerns.  It hasn't exactly stopped some  folks, as you heard earlier from Norm Eisen, complaining that this is a  violation of the anti-nepotism clause.  We know Jared Kushner, the  president's son-in-law, already in office as a government employee, also  not taking a salary.  The White House essentially arguing because they're  in the executive branch and not taking a salary, they're exempt from that  law.  </p><p>QUEST:  Jeremy, let's put aside the ethics questions for one moment.  Is  anybody actually asking what qualifies Kushner or Ivanka Trump to hold such  senior posts, bearing in mind that people work their entire lives and  study, whether it's politics, diplomacy, or government, what qualifies them  to have that job other than they're part of the president's family?  </p><p>DIAMOND:  That is certainly a question that folks have asked.  Listen,  Jared Kushner, for example, has run his real estate company that he  inherited from his father at a very young age.  He's run that company for  over ten years, I believe.  So, that is one of his qualifications.  Ivanka  in her own right has continued to work at her father's company, a  multibillion dollar company, and also working on her own brand.  But of  course, those questions persist, as to how they are qualified to then take  those experiences and bring them to the government.  But as we've learned  with this White House, what really matters to the president is who he can  trust and who is loyal to him.  And those two certainly are.  </p><p>[16:45:00] And they've taken a pretty broad portfolio in the administration  already.  </p><p>QUEST:  Jeremy Diamond, thank you for that, at the White House tonight.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PRANAY JIVRAJIKA, FOUNDER, OLA:  About three years back, getting a cab on  demand in 15 minutes was a wild experience.  Today, if you see an average  time of arrival, more than five minutes, you actually switch to another car  and see what is available in two minutes.  There's a lot of change that is  happened over the last couple of years.  I'm 29 years old.  I'm the  founding partner at the most popular and largest mobile app in India which  helps users to get the nearest cab.  There are a lot of cabs, and a lot of  users who are looking for these cabs.  But there was no way to discover  this.  </p><p>Ola created this platform where users can locate nearby cabs.  I remember  one of the greatest moments that we cherish, since then the zeroes keep  adding.  The biggest challenges that we foresee, there are also great  opportunities, how do we penetrate into deep India, rural India, where  mobility is a need but there is no smartphone penetration, there is no  internet.  We are still scratching the surface for what the potential lies  in the ride sharing market.  There are more than 300 million rides that  happen in India every day.  As an industry, we're are less than 2 percent  of the 300 million today.</p><p>What motivates me is that fact that we have half a million drivers, roughly  more than two million lives are being touched every day using this  technology platform.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  All right.  So how would you like your internet browsing to be made  public?  Absolutely not.  The former head of the federal communications  commission says it's a tragedy that the U.S. Congress has voted to roll  back online privacy rules that protect users' data.  Now, the privacy vote,  the protections were agreed in the final days of the Obama administration,  really in the dying days of it.  And they were the protections that  basically said that internet providers or ISP could not sell your data.   The former chairman of the FCC tells CNN that U.S. consumers have a lack of  options.  </p><p>[16:50:00] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THOMAS WHEELER, FORMER CHAIRMAN, FCC:  Two-thirds of homes in America have  one choice when it comes to how they get their internet access, their high- speed internet access.  And so, I haven't got any choice.  If I don't like  the fact that my internet service provider is now going to be allowed to  sell my information, I don't have anybody else to go to.  And so, I'm  stuck.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Right now, the rules affect the internet service providers.  Such  as Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Comcast.  They have data on your web browsing  history, on app usage, geolocations.  They're on this side of the equation.   But the rules do not apply to web companies like Facebook and google who  similarly will have information on your web browsing.  And that was the  issue.  Whether or not to extend the rules from this side to encompass them  all or, as they decided, not to have them at all.

No one in America stood up at a town hall and said,  sir, I demand you let somebody else make money off my shameful desires.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Shameful desires indeed.  Clare Sebastian is in New York.  Who is  getting hot under the collar about this?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Richard, in Washington it pretty much  cuts down party lines.  Republicans have largely voted for this law which  disapproves of those privacy rules.  And Democrats, we see privacy  advocates coming out saying this is dangerous for consumers and puts your  data, which should belong to you, in the hands of big companies.  The White  House and the FCC say this is about fairness.  As you pointed out, why  should big ISPs like Verizon and Comcast and AT&amp;T be hamstrung in how they  use consumer data when companies like Facebook and google are not.  But for  consumers, this is extremely worrying.  These advocates and some lawyers  that I've spoken to have said that they believe ISPs have access to a lot  more information about you than companies like google and Facebook, social  media sites and search engines.  I put some of these questions that are  worrying consumers to experts in a quick-fire round, Richard.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW JAY SCHWARTZMAN, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER:  Yes.  In theory,  data can be anonymized.  But it is not very difficult for marketers to  combine certain kinds of data together and do a pretty good job at  identifying exactly who you are.  </p><p>Your financial information and other activities that you do online are  generally encrypted.  This is really much more about the things you do that  are of value to advertisers and marketers.  Who you associate with, where  you travel, what kinds of books and literature you're interested in, what  kinds of things you buy.  Do you buy birth control products and so forth?   Very personal information.  Some of the things that can happen is that your  credit rating can be adversely affected.  And certain kinds of insurance  products may not be readily available to you, life insurance, disability  insurance.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Whether or not you have anything embarrassing in your internet  browsing history, which I'm sure you and I don't, this goes further than  that, there could be real world consequences to this.  This of course is  also a big win for these big companies, both for the likes of Verizon,  AT&amp;T, and Comcast, the big ISPs, and for the big tech companies in Silicon  Valley as well.  This is part of what Donald Trump ran on, pro-business,  de-regulation mandate.  This is what we're seeing here.  </p><p>QUEST:  Clare Sebastian in New York for us tonight, thank you, Clare.  </p><p>We will take a Profitable Moment on a day that the Dow rose 60-odd points.   We'll talk about the market's profitable moment, after the break.  </p><p>[16:55:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment.  We are seeing the ramifications of  Brexit starting to filter out into the business world.  But rather than a  tsunami of announcements and any great cataclysmic changes, what you're  really seeing is little bits here, little bits there.  So, it might be J.P.   Morgan that's looking at taking the banking sector, J.P.  Morgan looking at  Dublin, a city, suggesting it's going to move a few jobs out of London.   What we really saw today is for example Lloyd's of London, Inga Beale  telling us they're moving 5 percent of their business to Brussels because  it makes sense.  I think that's what you're going to see a lot more of.  </p><p>You're going to see little cherry picking here, a few jobs there, a few  jobs there, as companies do what is reasonable and necessary.  Because even  with the best will in the world, even with the most favorable negotiating  status, the uncertainty of the next two years means that organizations like  Lloyd's have no choice.  They have to start preparing for the worst while  they hope for the best.  And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm  Richard Quest in London.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope  it's profitable.  I'm off for the next week.  I hope it's a profitable one  for you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

And now ringing the closing bell on the day that's seen the Dow Jones rise 60 odd points. Hit the gavel. There we go. One, two, three. Solid gavels. I think that what we'll today, solid gavels bring trading to a close on Thursday, it's the 30th of March.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, South Korea's corruption scandal broke. The former South Korean president is under arrest and we'll be in Seoul in a moment or two.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Banks based in London are reaching for their passports. I'll speak to Lloyd's of London, the chief executive about her company's plans and switch.</p><p>And Sweden's Finance Minister tells me tonight, Europe's Brexit talks will need grownups in the room. I'm Richard Quest live in London, where of course I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. We begin tonight with breaking news from South Korea. Where the ousted President <person><nameText>Park Geun-hye </nameText></person>has been arrested. The judge who issued the arrest warrant said there was a concern that the former president might try to destroy evidence. Park was already being held ahead of the court's decision. Prosecutors accuse her of abusing presidential powers, taking bribes from companies and leaking confidential information.</p><p>CNN's Paula Hancocks, our South Korea correspondent is in Seoul for us tonight. Just remind us, before this latest development, Paula, what was Park's position? She was out of office. She's been impeached. Was she under arrest? What was your position before tonight?</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Richard, she was basically at a hearing where she had to plead before the judge and explain why she should not be arrested. Prosecutors had sought an arrest warrant for her earlier in the week, and then all day today or yesterday, now it's 5:00 in the morning, she was pleading her case. So, she was impeached. The constitutional court had upheld that impeachment so she lost all presidential immunity. But she was free until they decided this arrest warrant should take place.</p><p>What we've heard from the judge today is that he said major crimes have been ascertained. As you say, he believed there was a fear that she could destroy evidence, which is one of the main reasons why a judge would agree with an arrest warrant, or the fact that someone could be a flight risk. Also, saying that the court recognizes the need and necessity for the suspect to be arrested. So right now, she is in Seoul detention center, just outside Seoul, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: This was the fear, that she might be arrested. As I recall, that fear was about not so much destruction of evidence but actually to be arrested for charges of misfeasance for what she actually did in office. But this is something different.</p><p>HANCOCKS: That's right. This is one step higher. This is the prosecutor saying that she has to be arrested immediately because they believe she will destroy evidence, and then while she's in detention, while she's arrested, then they will bring these charges against her. And the judge has agreed in this case. So, it's one step higher. We know that prosecutors have been mentioning charges of abuse of power, of bribery, of leaking classified information. So, they've given us an indication of the direction they're going. And we're expecting within the next 20 days that they will charge <person><nameText>Park Geun-hye.</nameText></person></p><p>This is what they have, they have 20 days, and then they either have to renew that or release her. But we're expecting within the next few weeks we could see charges against her. But of course, remember, we're also going to be seeing a presidential election in this country on May the 9th, so there are some experts who are speculating whether or not the prosecutors will want to wait until after that election. They won't want to be seen to be politically biased in any way. So potentially this could hang on until after the election.</p><p>QUEST: All right, Paula Hancocks, please let us know when there is more to report. Obviously, a stunning development tonight, that the former impeached president is now in custody, potentially to be charged with destruction of evidence or at least the worry is that there could be the destruction of evidence.</p><p>As Britain prepares for its future outside the European Union, the EU is planning for its future without the U.K. At a meeting in Malta, European leaders said they were determined to move on and tackle the challenges of economic recovery and nationalism. The EU council's president Donald Tusk called on the remaining 27 member states to unite.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:05:00] DONALD TUSK, EU COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Proclaiming the end of history, proclaiming the ultimate triumph of liberal democracy, peace, and international order, have turned out to be, to put it mildly, exaggerated. For rational and responsible patriots who want to maintain sovereignty and independence of their nations and states, there is no alternative to a united and sovereign Europe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Erin McLaughlin is in Malta for us tonight. Erin, they are talking unity, and they always talk unity at a moment of crisis. So, I'm guessing that they will stay united for the time being.</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That certainly is the hope, Richard. You know, when Brexit first happened, there was a real concern, that was the end of the European project, that it was lights out, that such a prominent and strong EU member state should decide to leave the European Union by popular vote. Now fast forward, months later. EU officials are saying that's not the case, this scenario is far from apocalyptic. However, there still are persistent threats of nationalism and populism.</p><p>And one senior EU official telling me the hope is going forward that the EU will be able to position itself as sort of an island, he said, in a sea of insanity, as a bastion for liberal democracy. And the hope is that that soft power will be what sees the EU through the crisis. He said don't expect the populace to just win outright.</p><p>QUEST: All right. But here's the problem. How much of that unity is real and how much of it is manufactured on the basis of the back of Brexit? If you are to take the EU 27, and the question, for example, of a two-speed Europe, or, for example, of the increased budgetary contributions as a result of Britain leaving, how likely is that unity to fray?</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Well, that is, Richard, the million-dollar question. And we're really going to have to see how this plays out in the months going forward. Right now, what EU officials behind the scenes are telling me is that they're seeing messages of unity across the remaining 27 EU member states. Will that persist? That is the question. EU leaders acknowledge that reforms are need. They're looking at how to shape the EU going forward. They realize the status quo cannot persist when it comes to the European project.</p><p>QUEST: It's interesting, John Claude Juncker making a comment about Donald Trump, where he basically said stop trying to suggest Brexit is going to spread. But he did it in a very strange way.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: EU leaders, we're hearing, are becoming more and more vocal about what they've been hearing from the Trump administration. After all, President Trump has been vocal himself, openly praising Brexit, comparing the popular vote that saw Brexit to his own electoral victory. Let's take a listen to what the president of the European Commission had to say today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN CLAUDE JUNCKER, EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT (through translator): Brexit is not the end. There are many who would find it wonderful if it were the case. Also on another continent, where a newly-elected president was delighted that Britain was leaving the European Union, and has also encourages other countries to do the same, if it continues in that way, I would encourage Ohio's independence and the exit of Texas from the United States of America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: That statement really is not playing well, perhaps no surprise among Trump supporters. Nigel Farage one of the architects of the Brexit campaign tweeting out saying, \"Juncker has made a complete fool of himself again. The USA was formed by consent while the EU is being imposed.\" No response from President Trump just yet, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Erin McLaughlin from Malta at the summit, thank you.</p><p>Britain has two years to leave the European Union. London's financial institutions aren't waiting for the details to be worked out. They are in many cases, we're getting the evidence now, planning for a hard Brexit and relocation in the process. At risk is the so-called passporting rights. The passport grants them access to EU markets on an equal basis. Now, Citigroup today has warned employees, some jobs may move out of the U.K.</p><p>[16:10:00] As the banks wonder where to go, the cities are making their pitches. The postcard from Dublin, which has an English-speaking workforce, and similar laws to the U.K. JPMorgan is reportedly in talks for a new office in Dublin but won't comment or confirm.</p><p>Then of course Brussels. The center for European politics. Very unlikely to leave the EU. That's why the insurance fund Lloyd's of Londonis setting up a subsidiary there. The chief executive said the future for Paris is more uncertain. The French capital has touted its own culture even as Marine Le Pen pushes a message of nationalism.</p><p>And then, Frankfurt, home of the ECB. It's expecting up to 10,000 new financial jobs as a result of Brexit. So already the change is starting to happen. And within the hour, the Lloyd's of Londonchief executive, Inga Beale will be joining me here in London to talk about the decision to move or at least to split part of the insurance market off to Brussels. Germany's foreign minister is warning Britain won't get an easy ride from the rest of Europe. Sigmar Gabriel says he expects formal negotiations to begin in around late May and they won't be straightforward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIGMAR GABRIEL, GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): For the German government, it is clear that the most important condition for the negotiations on Britain leaving the EU is safeguarding the interests of the citizens of the remaining 27 member states. The unity and the economic, social, and political interests of the member states as well as of the European Union institutions. In all these areas, there can be no special deal for Britain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: No special deal. And yet that's exactly what the British Prime Minister Theresa May asked for when she sent her letter to Donald Tusk. So, it's really very straightforward. Can there be a trade agreement before Britain leaves? Sweden's finance minister says the U.K. must finalize the divorce before talks about trade can begin. There's only two years to do it all. So, I asked Magdalena Andersson who joined me from Stockholm if there was a new sense of urgency on both sides.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAGDALENA ANDERSSON, SWEDISH FINANCE MINISTER: Yes, it's true. The time schedule is very tight. And I think the quicker we can begin and the more force we can do these negotiations, the better. But I think it's better to start with a divorce before and then afterwards we start with the trade, the talks about the future trade agreement that we will have to have. I think it's good for both of us that we can sort this out as soon as possible. I think that's another good starting point for these discussions.</p><p>QUEST: So, in your statement, you say in the future relationship between the EU and the U.K., we want trade relations to be as favorable as possible. And whether that's negotiated simultaneously or contemporaneously with the divorce, are you in favor ultimately of a free trade agreement between the U.K. and the EU 27?</p><p>ANDERSSON: Of course, we want to have a good free trade agreement. And to have good conditions. I think that's in the interests of the European Union but also Great Britain. Great Britain is important export market for Swedish companies but also other European companies. The European Union is an even more important export market for British companies. So, I think having a free trade agreement is in the interests of both partners here. But at the same time, we have to say, it will be more complicated for companies to trade. The administrative burden will increase when the U.K. leaves the customs union. So, it will be more complicated, it will be more expensive, and it will hurt their economy. Now the discussion is how will we do damage control to make it hurt as less as possible.</p><p>QUEST: As these talks get under way, how do you prevent bad feeling, ill will, and a wish to have a deterrent effect influencing these talks?</p><p>ANDERSSON: Yes, I think most of us know some people that have been divorced. And we know that there's often a lot of feeling during divorces. And you can -- but the thing is we really have to not let our feelings run away with ourselves during this process. There will be a need to have a lot of grownups in the room and we can act in a rational way. I think this will be very important. But it's also in the interest of both partners. That would be very important. Lots of grownups in the room.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, minister, the question of EU citizens and British citizens. This one really can be solved quite quickly, can't it, almost on day one, both sides just simple have to say, yep, yours that are here can stay and ours that are there can stay, end of subject. Do you agree that's the way forward?</p><p>ANDERSSON: I think it will be more complicated. This will be part of the negotiations, but of course it's in the interest of both of us that this will be solved in a good way. For me, there are 100,000 Swedish citizens living in the U.K.</p><p>[16:15:00] Of course, there needs to be a solution. I'm not certain it will be day one.</p><p>QUEST: Here is the problem. The British are coming under some criticism for perhaps using the citizens issue as a bargaining chip. But what you have just said is basically the same thing. Both sides are, let's be blunt about this, minister, both sides are prepared to use the citizenship question as a bargaining chip, because after all, this is a negotiation.</p><p>ANDERSSON: I wouldn't call it a bargaining chip. But of course, there are several parts of these negotiations, where we could have good conditions for our citizens and solving their problems would be one part of it. We see in Sweden that lots of people from Great Britain that live-in Sweden, they are applying for citizenship. We're looking forward to having more Swedish-British citizens in Sweden.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: That's the finance minister of Sweden talking to me earlier today from Stockholm. Investors in Europe are mostly ignoring the uncertainty of a Brexit. Stocks rose for a third straight day in Frankfurt, Paris, and Zurich. If you look at BMW shares their round 1 percent higher. And a BMW board member told us he's not worried about Brexit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IAN ROBERTSON, BMW BOARD MEMBER: Nothing is changing what we want, how it's delivered in the next two years I think we'll have to wait and see. I'm an optimist. My work is in sales and marketing. I hope, I trust, I think there are solutions to all of these things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Consumers in America have gone on a shopping fever spree. And it all follows the federal reserve of San Francisco, which is talking about a goldilocks economy and discussing what it means for the Trump administration and its ambitious targets after the break. It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we're in London.</p><p>QUEST: Growth in the United States got a nice little bump higher in the last quarter. And now the challenge is for Donald Trump to double it. Look at the numbers. Remember, it's Q4 growth. It was 1.9 percent. And it was revised upwards. I think this is the final revision, so it's a 2.1 percent. You get the initial, the first revision, and then the final.</p><p>Donald Trump says his target is 4 percent. But that's not been seen since the early 2000s, and even then, it was only for a very short period of time in some extremely unusual circumstances. The head of the San Francisco Fed has been celebrating over the lasting few days, saying we've largely attained a hard-sought recovery that we've been seeking for the past nine years. According to the Fed president or at least the San Francisco Fed president, it's a case of job done and now it's about sustainable recovery, not reaching recovery. All of which gave a boost to all three.</p><p>[16:20:00] The Dow Jones industrials is up 69 points, over 20,700 once again. It's a third of a percent up. And the NASDAQ, produces a new record, putting on a third of a percent. Paul La Monica joins me now. This is downright fickle, isn't it? The markets just cannot decide. Every time we get a bit of a worry over Trump's agenda, they don't fall out of bed. But there's a definite case of the collie wobbles.</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNNMONEY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think investors are clearly growing a little bit more concerned that everything they bought into in regards to Trump's promises may not be achievable anytime soon. We saw that obviously, with health care reform. Most people I speak to think that tax reform is doable at some point within the next few months perhaps and that's why they're remaining optimistic. And with regards to oil, which you pointed out, look at oil prices, they shot up today. That is why Exxon was one of the winners on the Dow. JPMorgan Chase, other banks, also rallying. There still is this hope that we'll get unwinding of some of those Dodd/Frank laws.</p><p>QUEST: OK, but even for all of this, you have got 2.1 percent growth. It's a bit lower than par. You've got unemployment down at 4.5, 4.6 percent. The Fed pretty much is now just about calling it the goldilocks economy, not too hot, and not too cool. It's difficult to know how the fiscal policies still to come will factor in.</p><p>LA MONICA: Definitely. And I think almost everyone believes that 4 percent is not going to happen. That is a bit fantastical, I think, of Mr. Trump, to be suggesting that we could get to those levels. Richard, if we get to 3 percent, which might be doable if you have a combination of lower taxes, unwinding some of the Dodd/Frank laws, and then an actual stimulus plan with infrastructure spending, 3 percent is a victory. He is not going to be criticized by many American people for only getting to 3 percent because that's likely to be accompanied by even more job growth and more wage gains. And that's what we all want.</p><p>QUEST: Paul La Monica in New York, the guru La Monica, thank you, sir.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: See you back in New York next week when I'm there.</p><p>A new report from the U.S. State Department shows fewer and fewer Americans are actually seeking unemployment assistance. It appears that the job market is improving. Unprecedented job destruction could lie just around the corner. A warning from billionaire Jeff Greene who says the impact that globalization had on blue collars workers for 30 to 40 years, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, will do the same for the white-collar workforce, and it will do it in a fraction of the time. Just 5 to 10 years. Jeff Greene founded the Greene Institute which holds a conference on the topic if you days' time. Jeff joins us from Palm Beach, Florida, and we are very pleased, sir, to have you on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>JEFF GREENE, FOUNDER, GREENE INSTITUTE: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: At the end of the day, time and again over the last few months I've heard people alluding, suggesting, warning that it's really AI, it's really robotics, it's automation that is going to take the jobs. But nobody is sounding a clarion warning, sir.</p><p>GREENE: Well, I am, Richard. I think that, you know, both parties are ignoring what is really in my view the issue of our time. Just this week, Price Waterhouse came out with a report that clearly laid out how 38 percent of all jobs in America will be automated and eliminated in the next 15 years. If that isn't a wake-up call, what will be?</p><p>QUEST: But what's your solution? And maybe you haven't got one. Maybe your idea is the dialogue has to begin to actually find a solution.</p><p>GREENE: Well, you hit it on the head. No one's talking about it. If anybody is interested in this, they can go to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.managingthedestruction.com\">www.managingthedestruction.com</url>. We'll see what we're talking about on Monday. We're bringing in Tom Friedman, Ray Kurzweil, the futurist, Arnie Duncan, the former education Secretary. Larry Summers, even David Cameron is coming over from the U.K. to talk about the Brexit and how some of the Brexit result was the result of this problem.</p><p>Look, I mean, what's happening in the world is, job destruction is already happening. Everyone looks at Uber. If you're a taxi driver in New York City, five years ago, you probably thought not only do you have a steady income for the rest of your life as long as you want to hop in that yellow cab, but that medallion is security for you and your child and grandchildren to make a living. Now what's happened Uber comes along and that guy's income is down and he feels uneasy, as he should.</p><p>We may have driverless cars and eliminate millions of jobs just from that in this country.</p><p>[16:25:00] QUEST: When the president says he's going to bring jobs back, and we get a few thousand here and a few thousand there coming back from car companies or Carrier or whatever, is the president missing the point here? Has he got the wrong focus?</p><p>GREENE: 100 percent the wrong focus. Of course, it is. I've tried to reach out to Donald Trump. I live here in Palm Beach. I live very close to the president. I've tried to reach out to him on this many times. We haven't really gotten together, which is unfortunate. Steve Mnuchin as Treasure Secretary just this week said that is not going to be AI won't be a problem for 50 to 100 years.</p><p>This is ridiculous. We have to get focused and understand. We're heading into a period of unprecedented job destruction, where the greatest destruction to our economy since the depression, and we have to understand it's happening, start talking about it and come up with real solutions. The fact of the matter is we're still the biggest economy in the world, we have the best universities in the world. Everyone wants to come here. Let's take our positives and focus on this problem and get it addressed.</p><p>QUEST: Well, some say of course that some nation has to do the value-added work of building the robots, developing the software for the AI. And I understand that will not replace Parry Pursue, the jobs that will be lost. But there will be people watching tonight who will say, well that Jeff Greene, a downright alarmist.</p><p>GREENE: Well, look. I mean, the reality is, in a middle-class economy, most people do routine jobs. Manufacturing, when I was a kid, it would be putting things in boxes or if you're in an office, entering data, typing letters, interesting data on papers. Those jobs right now are better done by the machines. The reality is most people are average. That's why the average person has a 100 IQ. If artificial intelligence is operating at 120 IQ, which it will be soon, people will not be able to compete with these machines for most of the work they've had traditionally in a middle- class economy.</p><p>QUEST: It just makes me what's going to happen to my own job here. Jeff, thank you, sir. Really appreciate it. If you do get to speak to the president, maybe go knock on the door at Mar-a-Lago next door. If you do come back and tell us what he said. We look forward to having you on the program.</p><p>GREENE: I'm a member of Mar-a-Lago. I had dinner there a few weeks ago. I was lucky enough to be seated at the next table to the President. But we weren't able to get into this subject. You can be sure next time I get his ear, I will definitely remind him this is the issue of our time.</p><p>QUEST: You mean you had the chance and you didn't take it!</p><p>GREENE: Well, you know what, you have a limited amount of time, with the President of the United States. Basically, we just wanted to exchange greetings. Then he had to get on with his dinner.</p><p>QUEST: Excellent, sir. Next time, come back and tell us what he said about AI. I appreciate it. Jeff Greene at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>Britain is leaving the EU. Lloyd's of Londonis moving into the EU. The chief executive explains why she picks Brussels, she's with us after the break. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. I'll be joined by the chief executive of Lloyd's of London. By now, U.S. lawmakers want to make it easier to sell on your internet browsing history.</p><p>And as we move on, before any of it, this is CNN, and on this network, the news always comes first.</p><p>The former South Korean leader <person><nameText>Park Geun-Hye </nameText></person>has been arrested on corruption charges. A judge approved a warrant for her arrest early Friday saying there was concern the impeached president might destroy evidence. Park was removed this month as the corruption scandal worsened.</p><p>Russian president Vladimir Putin is strenuously denying that Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. presidential election. He called the allegations fictional, illusory, and lies. He says it's not in American interests to push relations to the point of absurdity.</p><p>In Ankara, the new secretary of state says America and turkey will work together to build stability in the region, on the eve of a massive push against is in Raqqa, Syria.</p><p>Now, you would expect the world's largest insurance market, Lloyd's, to be prudent against any risks that the actual market itself may be facing. Indeed, that's exactly what it's doing, taking out its own insurance against Brexit. It's been a British institution for more than three centuries. Now it's announced plans to set up a subsidiary in Brussels, a day after the pm began the formal process of removing the U.K. from the EU. The chief executive of Lloyd's joins me now. We talked in Davos. We said we would do this but you wouldn't tell me the country you were going to do it. Now we know it's Belgium and Brussels. Why?</p><p>INGA BEALE, CEO, LLOYD'S OF LONDON: We didn't tell you at the time because we had to deliberate very carefully. Lots of criteria we need to consider. We wanted to take our time and be very professional about it. Now, we chose Brussels. It's got a very, very strong and quality regulatory environment. For Lloyd's, our reputation is paramount. We've been doing business for hundreds of years. We're one of the world's best known insurance brands. It's so important we go somewhere with an excellent reputation. We also need to hire some people. So, we wanted access to multilingual, high caliber talent. And we had to consider ease of access. We'll have to be traveling from London, we'll need continental European clients. We wanted to choose somewhere in excellent location and in the heart of Europe. And importantly, one more factor, we wanted to choose somewhere that was a high likelihood of remaining in the EU.</p><p>QUEST: It's fascinating that that was a factor. At the end of the day, the whole thing depends on Belgium and Brussels being in the EU.</p><p>BEALE: We need to be in the EU to keep insuring EU customers.</p><p>QUEST: How much business goes to the Brussels subsidiary? Will all European business go into it?</p><p>BEALE: It's more complex than that. About 5 percent of our global business is European or EU business. We will lose the right to issue policies for post-Brexit. That's simple insurance business. Some of the more complex insurance in the EU, marine business, aviation business, the reinsurance business that we write, that we'll be able to continue to write from London. So, another 6 percent of EU business we'll write in London. 5 percent we'll have to write through this EU subsidiary.</p><p>QUEST: This is going to be -- I mean, it's necessary, you don't really have any choice in doing this. But it's going to be costly for you, isn't it?</p><p>[16:35:00] BEALE: It's going to add some cost. Of course, we're providing this subsidiary for the whole of the Lloyd's market. We have 84 businesses writing insurance in Lloyd's. If you spread it across the whole market, it's minimal cost. It will add .1 percent of our premiums.</p><p>QUEST: How big is Lloyd's vis-a-vis the global insurance industry? As you said before we came on air, you do the bit that nobody wants to touch, the risky business. How big is Lloyd's?</p><p>BEALE: We write about 30 billion pounds of revenues, of premiums. We're in the top five reinsurers in the world. Which means we're insuring insurance companies. We are a major, major player in the specialist insurance lines for things like the heart of Lloyd's, where we started insuring ships and cargos around the world, we're the leading writer of that kind of business. We will have as much as a 50 percent global market share. New products like cyber insurance, which is on the rise, we have a 25 percent global market share of that business.</p><p>QUEST: This question of cyber insurance and the writing of cyber insurance, it's a risk, isn't it? You're really taking your own risk when you write that. Because we really don't know the full range of potential risk with cyber.</p><p>BEALE: We don't. That is what Lloyd's has always been about. Just think, when that first satellite went up into space, we didn't know what the risks were. When the first airplane went up. We take on risks that others can't take on.</p><p>QUEST: What about the risk of Brexit from other companies? Is there an insurable risk that you can take out against Brexit?</p><p>BEALE: We haven't yet issued a Brexit policy.</p><p>QUEST: You're looking at it, I can tell.</p><p>BEALE: What we do see is an increased rise in political instability in the world. We're seeing a huge increase in demand for things like specialist insurance related to political instability, the chances that a government may take action and stop payments being made. We see a huge demand for insurance against that sort of thing. So not just Brexit but sort of the political instability in the whole world. And tragically, of course, the rise in terrorism means that more people are buying terrorism insurance from us. So, what's where we come into our -- I suppose our real strength, is when things are looking bad for business, we can help protect them and mitigate against those.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, you're talking about terrorism, political risk. I know last year was a bad year for you with wildfires in Canada. You also had a couple of hurricanes. You really do get the nasty stuff.</p><p>BEALE: There's almost every headline in the world, there's something -- Lloyd's will be behind it somewhere, protecting businesses.</p><p>QUEST: And the solidness of Lloyd's balance sheet now is --</p><p>BEALE: Stronger than ever. We've got financial net resources getting on to 30 billion pounds. $36 billion.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>BEALE: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Nice to have you coming in. Thank you very much.</p><p><person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>is getting an official job at the White House and she won't be paid a dime for it. We're talking about the first daughter and what she'll be doing for her father, the president.</p><p>[16:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Trump's surrogates say this unprecedented position is not about nepotism. Neither family member is being paid for their work. The former White House ethics czar under president Obama says Mr. Trump is trying to act like a king.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NORMAN EISEN, FMR. ETHICS LAWYER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: Do we really want a country that is run like a monarchy where you have the throne flanked by family members? Or do we want people in the oval office whose first loyalty will be to the country, not to the man sitting behind the desk?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Jeremy Diamond is at the White House for us tonight. Look, to anybody watching at home tonight, just how extraordinary is this? Bearing in mind that Hillary Clinton certainly did the ill-fated health care plan for her husband bill Clinton, and one bush son helped another bush father campaign. So how different is this?</p><p>JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Yes, you're right, first ladies have until the past had pretty significant policy portfolios at the White House. But we haven't seen an adult first daughter or first son in the White House for quite a long time. And so, it is relatively unprecedented. But of course, this is how president Donald Trump has operated for decades in his business and how he's now operating as president. And during the campaign as well, <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>had a very significant role. She has now become a government employee. She's been named assistant to the president. But this is really nearly a formality. <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>in the last month has gotten a west wing office. She's begun to get a security clearance. And she really has taken on a much more prominent role. She's been present for the meeting between chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the president.</p><p>And so, that more public role has prompted a lot of ethics experts to call on the White House to decide, is <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>a government employee or is she not? So now <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>taking this additional step to become an official government employee even though she won't be taking a salary. She was hoping to allay some of those concerns. It hasn't exactly stopped some folks, as you heard earlier from Norm Eisen, complaining that this is a violation of the anti-nepotism clause. We know Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, already in office as a government employee, also not taking a salary. The White House essentially arguing because they're in the executive branch and not taking a salary, they're exempt from that law.</p><p>QUEST: Jeremy, let's put aside the ethics questions for one moment. Is anybody actually asking what qualifies Kushner or <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>to hold such senior posts, bearing in mind that people work their entire lives and study, whether it's politics, diplomacy, or government, what qualifies them to have that job other than they're part of the president's family?</p><p>DIAMOND: That is certainly a question that folks have asked. Listen, Jared Kushner, for example, has run his real estate company that he inherited from his father at a very young age. He's run that company for over ten years, I believe. So, that is one of his qualifications. Ivanka in her own right has continued to work at her father's company, a multibillion dollar company, and also working on her own brand. But of course, those questions persist, as to how they are qualified to then take those experiences and bring them to the government. But as we've learned with this White House, what really matters to the president is who he can trust and who is loyal to him. And those two certainly are.</p><p>[16:45:00] And they've taken a pretty broad portfolio in the administration already.</p><p>QUEST: Jeremy Diamond, thank you for that, at the White House tonight. When you're watching QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, you might be browsing the internet during the breaks. I trust you're not browsing while we're talking to each other.

Today, if you see an average time of arrival, more than five minutes, you actually switch to another car and see what is available in two minutes. There's a lot of change that is happened over the last couple of years. I'm 29 years old. I'm the founding partner at the most popular and largest mobile app in India which helps users to get the nearest cab. There are a lot of cabs, and a lot of users who are looking for these cabs. But there was no way to discover this.</p><p>Ola created this platform where users can locate nearby cabs. I remember one of the greatest moments that we cherish, since then the zeroes keep adding. The biggest challenges that we foresee, there are also great opportunities, how do we penetrate into deep India, rural India, where mobility is a need but there is no smartphone penetration, there is no internet. We are still scratching the surface for what the potential lies in the ride sharing market. There are more than 300 million rides that happen in India every day. As an industry, we're are less than 2 percent of the 300 million today.</p><p>What motivates me is that fact that we have half a million drivers, roughly more than two million lives are being touched every day using this technology platform.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: All right. So how would you like your internet browsing to be made public? Absolutely not. The former head of the federal communications commission says it's a tragedy that the U.S. Congress has voted to roll back online privacy rules that protect users' data. Now, the privacy vote, the protections were agreed in the final days of the Obama administration, really in the dying days of it. And they were the protections that basically said that internet providers or ISP could not sell your data. The former chairman of the FCC tells CNN that U.S. consumers have a lack of options.</p><p>[16:50:00] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THOMAS WHEELER, FORMER CHAIRMAN, FCC: Two-thirds of homes in America have one choice when it comes to how they get their internet access, their high- speed internet access. And so, I haven't got any choice. If I don't like the fact that my internet service provider is now going to be allowed to sell my information, I don't have anybody else to go to. And so, I'm stuck.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Right now, the rules affect the internet service providers. Such as Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Comcast. They have data on your web browsing history, on app usage, geolocations. They're on this side of the equation. But the rules do not apply to web companies like Facebook and google who similarly will have information on your web browsing. And that was the issue. Whether or not to extend the rules from this side to encompass them all or, as they decided, not to have them at all.

And Democrats, we see privacy advocates coming out saying this is dangerous for consumers and puts your data, which should belong to you, in the hands of big companies. The White House and the FCC say this is about fairness. As you pointed out, why should big ISPs like Verizon and Comcast and AT&amp;T be hamstrung in how they use consumer data when companies like Facebook and google are not. But for consumers, this is extremely worrying. These advocates and some lawyers that I've spoken to have said that they believe ISPs have access to a lot more information about you than companies like google and Facebook, social media sites and search engines. I put some of these questions that are worrying consumers to experts in a quick-fire round, Richard. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW JAY SCHWARTZMAN, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER: Yes. In theory, data can be anonymized. But it is not very difficult for marketers to combine certain kinds of data together and do a pretty good job at identifying exactly who you are.</p><p>Your financial information and other activities that you do online are generally encrypted. This is really much more about the things you do that are of value to advertisers and marketers. Who you associate with, where you travel, what kinds of books and literature you're interested in, what kinds of things you buy. Do you buy birth control products and so forth? Very personal information. Some of the things that can happen is that your credit rating can be adversely affected. And certain kinds of insurance products may not be readily available to you, life insurance, disability insurance.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Whether or not you have anything embarrassing in your internet browsing history, which I'm sure you and I don't, this goes further than that, there could be real world consequences to this. This of course is also a big win for these big companies, both for the likes of Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Comcast, the big ISPs, and for the big tech companies in Silicon Valley as well. This is part of what Donald Trump ran on, pro-business, de-regulation mandate. This is what we're seeing here.</p><p>QUEST: Clare Sebastian in New York for us tonight, thank you, Clare.</p><p>We will take a Profitable Moment on a day that the Dow rose 60-odd points. We'll talk about the market's profitable moment, after the break.</p><p>[16:55:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment. We are seeing the ramifications of Brexit starting to filter out into the business world. But rather than a tsunami of announcements and any great cataclysmic changes, what you're really seeing is little bits here, little bits there. So, it might be J.P. Morgan that's looking at taking the banking sector, J.P. Morgan looking at Dublin, a city, suggesting it's going to move a few jobs out of London. What we really saw today is for example Lloyd's of London, Inga Beale telling us they're moving 5 percent of their business to Brussels because it makes sense. I think that's what you're going to see a lot more of.</p><p>You're going to see little cherry picking here, a few jobs there, a few jobs there, as companies do what is reasonable and necessary. Because even with the best will in the world, even with the most favorable negotiating status, the uncertainty of the next two years means that organizations like Lloyd's have no choice. They have to start preparing for the worst while they hope for the best. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in London. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. I'm off for the next week. I hope it's a profitable one for you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017033001cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N6P-PN41-JB20-G2JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7088\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 30, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0007EFP</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (UK)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0008RPR</classCode><className>LLOYD'S OF LONDON (GAMBIA)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC6311 LIFE INSURANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC6411 INSURANCE AGENTS, BROKERS, &amp;

Elizabeth Warren's[2] plan to break up tech giants such as Amazon and Facebook. \"What I do agree with is the government needs to create oversight \u2014 not regulation, oversight \u2014 to provide the American people with the safety and security, specifically on the issue of privacy,\" the former Starbucks[3] CEO said. </p><p>Earlier in March, Warren announced a regulatory plan[4] to break up some of the most massive US tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Amazon. DENVER \u2014 Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks CEO who said in late January that he's \"seriously considering\" a presidential run[5] as a centrist independent, has come out against Sen. Elizabeth Warren's plan to break up tech giants including Amazon. \"I do not agree with Elizabeth Warren,\" Schultz said in an interview with Business Insider here on Friday. \"What I do agree with is the government needs to create oversight \u2014 not regulation, oversight \u2014 to provide the American people with the safety and security, specifically on the issue of privacy,\" Schultz continued. Earlier in March, Warren announced a regulatory plan to break up some of the most massive US tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It calls for rolling back major deals, such as Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, and barring companies from sharing users' data with third parties.

He said they had \"developed, with great speed, a level of technology\" that has \"outpaced the government's ability to create legislation and oversight, specifically on the issue of privacy.\" Instead of breaking up tech companies, the government has a responsibility to have experts analyze what oversight is necessary, he said. In the weeks since announcing[7] his consideration of a presidential bid, Schultz has accused what he calls the far right and the far left of failing to provide center-of-the-road policies and solutions. \"I'm as concerned with the current left-leaning tilt of the Democratic Party towards socialism and the leading Democratic nominees at this point ... as I am about reelecting Donald Trump,\" Schultz said on Friday.NOW WATCH: What makes macadamia nuts the most expensive nuts in the world, at $25 per pound[8]See Also: We tried fried-fish sandwiches from every major fast-food chain

Compare that with a 7.8% loss for the S&amp;P 500, according to Morningstar. Last week the Denver growth shop sent regulators paperwork to launch its second value fund along with a list of its firm-wide stock holdings through Dec. 31. Despite Janus' fourth-quarter drubbing, the list shows few changes from 90 days earlier among its favorite stocks. This gives optimists the chance to say Janus managers are sticking to their guns. It also gives pessimists more ammo for the argument that Janus owns too many shares of its favorites like AOL Time Warner (AOL:NYSE) or Nokia(NOK:NYSE ADR) to move out of those positions quickly if it wanted to.\u00a0</p><p>A closer look, however, shows a selective appetite in the tech, health care and energy sectors, and a blooming interest in financial stocks. Today let's tackle tech and save the other sectors for tomorrow. Some might wonder why we still care about Janus managers' tastes given the beating they took last year.

Of the top-15, they own more than 5% of eight shops and more than 10% of four: Comcast (11.6%), Telefonos de Mexico (TMX:NYSE) (12.5%), and semiconductor shops Linear Technology (LLTC:Nasdaq) (12.8%) and Maxim Integrated Products(MXIM:Nasdaq) (11.8%). Those whopping stakes show the depth of Janus managers' love for these companies, but to see their shifting sentiment it's better to look at shifts within their top-100 positions, not just these massive stakes.\u00a0</p><p>For instance, Janus managers ramped up their exposure to the shares of many semiconductor or chip shops already in their portfolios. This includes Janus favorites like Texas Instruments(TXN:NYSE), Linear Technology and Maxim, but also Applied Micro Circuits(AMCC:Nasdaq), Broadcom(BRCM:Nasdaq), PMC-Sierra(PMCS:Nasdaq) and Vitesse Semiconductor(VTSS:Nasdaq). Chip bellwether Intel(INTC:Nasdaq) remained a modest position within this group.\u00a0</p><p>It took guts to buy more chip stocks and the move might work out if the cyclical chip sector has bottomed. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost more than 32% in the fourth quarter, but is up more than 14% in 2001 through Friday's close, according to Baseline/Thomson Financial.\u00a0</p><p>That said, Janus managers weren't indiscriminate chip-stock buyers. For instance, they sharply reduced their exposure to Xilinx(XLNX:Nasdaq), which is up 3.8% since Jan. 1.

Sure, their stakes in Dell(DELL:Nasdaq) and Compaq(CPQ:NYSE) rose from 0 shares to some 4.1 million and more than 830,000 in the fourth quarter, according to Janus' paperwork. That sounds good because both stocks lost more than 40% in the fourth quarter, but both are up more than 30% so far this year. However, these aren't big positions given Janus' more than $180 billion in assets.\u00a0</p><p>Janus managers might wish they'd done more bargain-hunting in the PC sector late last year. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Computer Box Maker Index is up more than 19% this year after losing more than 35% in last year's fourth quarter.\u00a0</p><p>Janus managers more than halved their stake in Apple Computer(AAPL:Nasdaq), up more than 27% this year. They also trimmed already modest positions in IBM(IBM:NYSE) and Gateway(GTW:NYSE). In fact, by the end of the year, they owned no shares of Gateway.\u00a0</p><p>They also sharply trimmed their exposure to another company tied to maturing PC sales, software titan Microsoft(MSFT:Nasdaq). On Sept. 30, Janus funds owned more than 12 million Microsoft shares. The shop's managers sold more than 6.1 million of those shares in the fourth quarter as the stock tumbled 28.1%.

In the fourth quarter, they trimmed their exposure in varying degrees to each of the Net bellwethers: AOL Time Warner, soaring online auctioneer eBay(EBAY:Nasdaq), sagging online book peddler Amazon.com (AMZN:Nasdaq) and Net ad kingpin DoubleClick(DCLK:Nasdaq).\u00a0</p><p>It looks like the managers might be intrigued by business-to-business software shops like i2 Technologies(ITWO:Nasdaq) and Ariba(ARBA:Nasdaq), in which they actually bought shares in the fourth quarter.\u00a0</p><p>You'd also have to suspect -- and hope -- they have confidence in top holding AOL, given the more than $13 billion they've sunk into the stock, which is up almost 40% this year.

It's just such a struggle to keep that neighborhood going.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR (voice over): What's killing the American dream? Veteran journalist and author, Nicholas Lemann aims to answer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR (on camera): Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. House Democrats kick off this week with more congressional evidence and aim to end the week voting on Articles of Impeachment against President Trump.</p><p>Lawyers for Democrats and Republicans are laying out their case for and against.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADLER: President Trump put himself before country. The record shows that President Trump withheld military aid allocated by the United States Congress from Ukraine. It also shows that he withheld a White House meeting from President Zelensky.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): At the end of the day, all this is about is about a clock and a calendar because they can't get over the fact Donald Trump is President of the United States and they don't have a candidate that they think can beat him. It's all political.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, Democrats argue the President abused his power by asking Ukraine for a favor to investigate his domestic political rivals. As you know, President Trump calls all this a witch hunt and a hoax.</p><p>The whole process has shone a spotlight firmly on the endemic corruption in Ukraine though. Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros has spent years working to promote democracy in that country and other emerging East European democracies.</p><p>And Soros has become the target of conspiracy theories that portray him trying to undermine President Trump.</p><p>George Soros is a liberal, a Holocaust survivor and an enduring target of conservatives and the far right, especially since the start of these impeachment hearings. Patrick Gaspard is the President of the Soros Open Society Foundations, one of the world's leading and largest philanthropies. He was also U.S. Ambassador to South Africa under President Obama and he is joining me now to discuss all of this from New York.</p><p>Welcome to the program, Ambassador Gaspard.</p><p>PATRICK GASPARD, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO SOUTH AFRICA: Thank you so very much for having me on again, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So you know, you've been in the White House Legislative Affairs under President Obama, you've been an Ambassador in South Africa. And now for the past several years, you've been working with the Soros Foundation to promote democracy, openness and an end to corruption.</p><p>Why do you think and on what basis is George Soros kind of Exhibit A in the enemies or rather in the allies of President Trump?</p><p>GASPARD: It's a great question, Christiane. And unfortunately, I think that the response to that compels me to talk about a long history of attacks not just against George Soros, but against figures like George Soros. We have George Soros's Jewish ancestry, who have survived the worst horrors of the 20th Century and who have attempted to make a contribution to opening society.</p><p>George Soros, as you said, Christiane, is of Jewish descent. He survived the Holocaust. And there is a long history, as Fiona Hill pointed out, in her testimony, a long history of anti-Semitic tropes that lean into the notion that somehow there are these invisible Jewish protocols and a group of leaders who are owning and corrupting elements in government in the private state. It's the worst kind of anti-Semitism.</p><p>Regrettably, it is not a new thing. But it's unfortunate to see it being transmitted in the highest corridors of office in the most important elected office in the world, which is the presidency of the United States.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So let's take bits of this -- of what you've just said. First, the anti-Semitic tropes, and the anti-Semitism that you say is behind all of this. You mentioned Fiona Hill. She, during her congressional testimony a few weeks ago, said she was called a Soros mole.</p><p>Were there any -- and she said also Marie Yovanovitch, the Ambassador to Ukraine had also been sort of smeared by being in the quote, \"Soros camp.\"</p><p>[23:05:10]</p><p>AMANPOUR: Were there any ties between the Open Society Foundations, George Soros, that might even have excuse this kind of connection?</p><p>GASPARD: Not in the least, Christiane. Like all propaganda, there's a way that authoritarians will take a thread of information and twist and distort it to meet their own political means, and too often their own corrupt interests.</p><p>George Soros and the Open Society Foundations have been engaged in work in Ukraine for 30 years now. At the end of the Cold War, George Soros made a determination that he was going to support the transition from communism to open and robust societies where the average citizen can hold their governments accountable by launching a series of philanthropic initiatives in the region that would enable civil society to create vehicles to push back against corruption, vehicles to create equal access to justice and to healthcare and to education as well.</p><p>And particularly in the Ukraine, George appreciated that the energy sector was powerfully corrupted by special interest and created resources that made it possible for civil society in the Ukraine to take up the transparent accountable transition of their energy sector to a private one.</p><p>That's a long history that was supported not just by Democrats, Christiane, but most especially by Republicans. Republicans like John McCain were proud to work with George Soros to create an opening behind the previous closed-off societies behind the Iron Curtain, and it's reprehensible and altogether shocking not to see Donald Trump's attack, not to see Rudy Giuliani's irresponsible behavior, but to see senior Republicans in the Senate, the Mitch McConnell's of this world, the Lindsey Graham's of this world and most recently, Senator Ted Cruz from Texas, not only being silenced in the face of these anti-Semitic attacks, but now doubling down and taking up the propaganda from Vladimir Putin's Russia about Ukrainian intervention in the U.S. elections. It's beyond irresponsible.</p><p>It borders on criminal, and it's appropriate that the U.S. Congress is taking up these matters with the seriousness with which they've taken on these impeachment hearings.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So just on Cruz, yes, I mean, he did over the weekend, sort of repeat this unproven idea that Ukraine or the bogus idea was involved in the 2016 elections. But then when pressed, he said no, I also think Russia did it as well. But I also think Ukraine did it. So it's kind of weird, all of this.</p><p>You did mention Rudy Giuliani, who is the President's lawyer right now. And he also talked about how, you know -- well, this is what he said in an interview on CNN and we'll talk about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, PERSONAL ATTORNEY TO DONALD TRUMP: George Soros has a not- for-profit called Antec. Antec is the one that developed all of the dirty information that ended up being a false document that was created in order to incriminate Manafort.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So he says he has proof -- I don't know what he's talking about because Antec was not a George Soros organization. I mean, what are his links with it? I mean, I know that it's an organization that a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist started and leads.</p><p>GASPARD: Yes, you know, Christiane, there's so many things about that interview and about Rudy Giuliani's performance in general that are powerfully just distressing.</p><p>As a longtime New Yorker, I understand that Rudy Giuliani has a long history of grandstanding, but it's astonishing to see him lift up these attacks and to not have those attacks checked by Republicans.</p><p>Antec is an organization that we are proud to have provided 17 percent of the funding for from 2012 to today. As you noted, Christiane, it was started by Ukrainians. It's led by Ukrainians and if not for their existence and for their hard work, much of the progress on anti-corruption in the Ukraine would not have been possible.</p><p>Ukraine sits at 120th of 180 countries that were reviewed by Transparency International on the corruption index. That is an acute problem in the Ukraine that Rudy Giuliani and by extension Donald Trump are exploiting to their own political advantage.</p><p>Antec not only has been supported by the Open Society Foundation and our International Renaissance Initiative in Ukraine, but it's also supported by the U.S. government, a quarter of the support for Antec comes from USAID, the British government, the U.K. provides 10 percent of the support for Antec.</p><p>[23:10:06]</p><p>GASPARD: The Netherlands, historically long supporters of anti-corruption work in the Ukraine are proud supporters of the work of Antec as well.</p><p>These tactics are bizarre. They're sad. And this is really a tragic moment in our politics that Rudy Giuliani makes these attacks in ways that are not questioned and checked by those who know better.</p><p>And if I can say this here on CNN, that they give him a free and open platform on Fox News to carry those attacks not only by Giuliani, but by a whole host of their allies who are deliberately trying to take attention from the fact that the President of the United States and his agents tried to use their leverage -- their considerable leverage -- to coerce a foreign leader to interfere in U.S. elections. That is fundamentally what's at stake here.</p><p>This is a question of democratic integrity, and all of these distortions and anti-Semitic attacks from Rudy Giuliani and their whole host of allies will not dissuade Congress from focusing on what's at stake.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, look, you have mentioned Fox News and the platform, the Soros Foundation of which your President has requested banning of a frequent guest on Fox, who continues to say that Soros controls quote, \"a very large part of Korea Foreign Service\" of the U.S. State Department, activities of F.B.I. agents overseas who work for NGOs in Ukraine and you've written a letter to the network calling this McCarthyite. Do you have any hope of breaking through? I mean, have they responded?</p><p>GASPARD: They have not as of yet responded to that one letter, Christiane, but I will give Fox News and their editors some credit for activities -- actions that they took some months ago when a guest was on the air, said similarly insane things on the Lou Dobbs Show and the editors immediately issued a correction and they have prevented that individual from coming back on their airwaves.</p><p>I hope they will do the same now with diGenova, who is a retired military leader in the U.S. who incredibly seems to have been captured by extremists who are promoting Putin talking points on the air.</p><p>But the problem isn't just this one instance of Rudy Giuliani making a comment or this gentleman who went out over the ledge on the Dobbs' Show there is a pattern and a history of this kind of irresponsibility, this propagandistic responsibility on that one network, and they need to be held accountable for that by average citizens, by their Board members, by shareholders and by major corporations who continue to advertise on the air despite some of the worst elements of our polemic politics being lifted there.</p><p>But if I can, Christiane, I just want to say quick word on behalf of the extraordinary men and women who labor without credit in the U.S. Foreign Service. I had the honor of working with them serving with them when I worked, both in the White House and when I served as Ambassador to South Africa.</p><p>Beyond their Intelligence, there was a profound level of integrity and a determination to maintain their non-partisanship. It hurts my heart every single day to see their President attacking them on social media, attacking them in interviews and suggesting somehow that the enemies of the United States like Vladimir Putin, for instance, have greater honor than people like Marie Yovanovitch and Fiona Hill.</p><p>It is -- it's heartbreaking, but I know and trust at this moment shall pass and the strength of our institutions will overcome this petty corruption that we're seeing right now.</p><p>AMANPOUR: What does George Soros himself think about all of this? This vilification? Because it's also happening by the self-declared illiberal democracy the government of Viktor Orban in Hungary. They've actually kicked out the university from there and it's moved on to Vienna, Austria.</p><p>But let's face it, George Soros has given away $32 billion of his wealth to charities, and it's not just in the current impeachment affair. It's the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter who was apparently obsessed with Soros.</p><p>Erdogan, the President of Turkey has accused Soros of leading a Jewish conspiracy to divide the country. Even the Brexiteer, Nigel Farage has said Soros was encouraging people to flood Europe, and that he is a danger to the Western world.</p><p>And as you remember, in the United States, he is accused of being behind one of those caravans coming up with migrants from Central America. I mean, just on a personal level, how does he feel about this vilification?</p><p>GASPARD: You know, thank you so much for the question about Mr. Soros, Christiane. I can tell you that he is someone who takes the long view of history.</p><p>[23:15:06]</p><p>GASPARD: And somehow, through all of the turbulence that we're going through in this moment, he continues to be optimistic about the future for Open Society.</p><p>So George has said a number of times, that he is proud of the enemies that he has because those enemies are brutish authoritarians who are trying to snuff out the freedom of expression of average citizens who are trying to distort democratic practice and who are creating tremendous harm to the most vulnerable, the most marginalized communities all over the world.</p><p>So whether it is Erdogan, whether it's Salvini, Viktor Orban or the President of the United States, George Soros understands that he is a stand-in, that he is a convenient, anti-Semitic opportunity for those who hold these sentiments, and those who are really at risk, for organizations like Antec, who are taking the courage to demand accountability every single day, and organizations who are working in the United States at the border to protect children who are being held in cages.</p><p>So George is proud of the accomplishments of the organization. He is humble about the journey -- the personal journey -- that he has been on from surviving the Holocaust to now being the target of these attacks, but being clear all along about what the mission is, who we are working on behalf and what it is that we're in service of.</p><p>We're in the service of democracy. We're in the service of free and open societies. And if that's a problem for Rudy Giuliani and for Ted Cruz and for Viktor Orban and for Salvini, and for Erdogan, so be it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: The Anti-Defamation League has taken a very serious stance on these issues saying that anti-Semitism and the like is not fringe anymore, it has become mainstream. And they have issued, you know, they've told whoever they'll talk to or will talk to them, \"An extremist, a hardcore anti-Semite who hears a mainstream individual, a pundit, a politician, anyone articulating these sorts of conspiracy theories, they may be emboldened, they may feel that their anti-Semitic ideology has been confirmed. This may energize them in a way they may not have seen.\"</p><p>Do you really believe that President Trump is an anti-Semite? I mean, you know, as you know, his very closest relatives, his own daughter and son-in- law are Orthodox Jews. Do you think it is anti-Semitism? Or is it political, and that George Soros is a, you know, an Olympic liberal who gives money and support to liberal causes that just ticks off the conservatives and the hard right?</p><p>GASPARD: Christiane, it is both anti-Semitic and political. You know, Donald Trump's history in trafficking, in racist language, of racist tropes and taking racist actions didn't begin when he ran for President.</p><p>As I said before, I'm a longtime New Yorker and you know that I've been involved in politics in my city for a very long time. Donald Trump first came to the attention of many of us when he lifted up the violence language to talk about young people in his city who lacked the opportunity, and who were accused despite their innocence of some of the worst crimes.</p><p>He has had the worst language then, took activities that were horrific --</p><p>AMANPOUR: You're talking about the Central Park Five.</p><p>GASPARD: I am talking about the Central Park Five.</p><p>AMANPOUR: He exonerated the Central Park Five.</p><p>GASPARD: He exonerated the innocent Central Park Five, and as someone who was a young black man in the City of New York at that time, who was well aware of the housing -- the racial housing violations of Donald Trump and his father, it did not surprise many of us to see the kind of language and actions that he took then, and it has continued in a way that is uninterrupted.</p><p>I'll remind you, Christiane, that Donald Trump is the person who trafficked in the worst racist accusations about Barack Obama not being a real American, being actually Kenyan and this alien African. When he launched his presidential campaign, he said the worst things about our Mexican brothers and sisters, our Mexican neighbors, and he has gone so far as to attack a Federal judge who is of Latino heritage to suggest that that person was not capable of administering justice because of their ethnicity.</p><p>I won't go on about what he has done at the border of the United States that is dehumanizing.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Thank you so much indeed for joining us.</p><p>[23:20:04]</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, when it comes to other rising, we turn to a woman who has been fighting stereotypes. This year, Bernadine Evaristo became the first black woman and Britain's first black author to win the Booker Prize.</p><p>She won the prestigious Literary Award jointly with Margaret Atwood, a rare occurrence for the Booker. She won at the age of 60, almost 40 years after she began her career, and her novel, \"Girl, Woman, Other\" follows the lives of 12 British women, most of them black, and deals with timeless questions about feminism, race, age, gender, and fluidity.</p><p>She joined me here to discuss this amazing recognition after a career spent trying to make black women visible in literature.</p><p>Bernadine Evaristo, welcome to the program.</p><p>EVARISTO: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So this is an amazing honor. How do you feel about being jointly awarded the Booker Prize?</p><p>EVARISTO: Absolutely delighted. I don't think it's really sunk in yet. It was a couple of months ago and it is a dream come true and it's such an honor. And it's also a game changer in terms of my career. So it's been amazing.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And it's also because you were jointly awarded with another author, Margaret Atwood, it's actually put the Booker Prize much more on the map and really forced a discussion about literature, about this -- the prize and about the subjects that you're tackling.</p><p>EVARISTO: I think so. And also, you know, Margaret is such an international superstar. I think that you know, winning it has been amplified in a way that perhaps might not have happened if we hadn't done it jointly.</p><p>I'm very happy to win it with Margaret. You know, the fact is, we have won it. We haven't won half a prize. We've won it jointly. You know, we're co-winners. And I think it's amazing.</p><p>It's very hard to win the Booker Prize. Almost nobody wins it. I'm the first black woman to win it. I'm very happy with the way in which the judges made their decision.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And the first black British writer to win it.</p><p>EVARISTO: The first black woman, the first black British writer. Absolutely.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Man or woman.</p><p>EVARISTO: That's right. Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, it's very remarkable.</p><p>EVARISTO: In 51 years.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You've been writing for 40 years. You've got eight books under your belt. Why do you think it took this long? And could it have happened before?</p><p>EVARISTO: I'm not sure, really, because I think, you know, prizes are basically run by the panels of people, the juries. And it depends on who is the jury in any particular time.</p><p>And I think this year, the Booker Prize had four women and one man, and I think that makes a difference. And that, in fact, was groundbreaking, because I don't think they've had four women judging the prize before. I think it's usually the other way around, in fact, or at least historically.</p><p>AMANPOUR: This business of the very, very bad, you know, misquote or whatever unintentional or intentional mistake that the BBC correspondent did, which has got a whole load of headlines that the Booker Prize was won by Margaret Atwood and another author.</p><p>I mean, you did tweet pretty --</p><p>EVARISTO: I did.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You know, pretty sharply about it. \"The BBC described me yesterday as another author apropos the Booker Prize 2019. How quickly and casually they have removed my name from history -- first black woman to win it. This is what we've always been up against, folks.\"</p><p>EVARISTO: Well, it was shocking to see that. I mean, I'm not -- I don't really want to have a go at the presenter because, clearly he made a mistake. Maybe he just forgot my name, maybe he hadn't registered my name.</p><p>But the reality is that I had in that moment been completely removed from history, my name, and so the achievement was null and void. And I think it's really important that we draw attention to this because this is what happens with, you know, certain communities in this country, and certainly for black women.</p><p>Even when we do achieve sometimes, we're not acknowledged for it. So I felt I had to draw attention to it. And there was so much outrage on social media, which was quite heartwarming, actually, because people were just shocked on my behalf, but also shocked on behalf of all the communities who are underrepresented and are sort of pushed to the periphery and marginalize.</p><p>And in fact, my book is about censuring black British women. And one of the sort of things I've been saying about the book is that I'm afraid -- I'm so fed up of us being invisible in British literature.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes, I mean, you said it and I thought it was actually -- I mean, I picked it up because I thought it was really interesting commentary from you.</p><p>You said, you know, talking about your characters, mostly black, mostly female.</p><p>Behind all your work, you once said is this question, what does it mean to not see yourself reflected in your nation's stories?</p><p>EVARISTO: Absolutely. And that was the case when I was growing up in the 60s and 70s. But I think we still have an issue today. You know, our society in the U.K. has moved on quite a bit in terms of our sort of gender, politics, racial politics, so on and so forth.</p><p>But at the same time, if we look at the fields of literature, if you look at the field of fiction, there are very few of us publishing books.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>EVARISTO: You know, I've published eight, so I'm one of the few who has published a sort of fairly substantial number of books, but actually, there should be many of us who have published, you know, 10, 20 books each and that's not the case.</p><p>[23:25:03]</p><p>EVARISTO: I can probably name on two hands the number of black British women novelists publishing at the moment.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Let's take the title first, \"Girl, Woman, Other.\" So I was trying to wrestle with what that meant. Is that the chronological line of experience? Is it fluidity, gender or sexuality? What is other?</p><p>EVARISTO: Other is many things in the book. It is the fact that the women, you know, primarily black women, they are othered on the count of their color.</p><p>But there are also women who are of different ages, the oldest character is 93. They are from different classes. They have different sexualities. You know, about third of the women are on the queer spectrum. They have different occupations. They have different cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Some of them are immigrants to this country, from the Caribbean and from Africa. And for all those reasons, they are othered in a society that is predominantly, you know, white and patriarchal and you know, heteronormative and so on and so forth.</p><p>So -- but also I think some of the women would other each other. So there is -- I am not sort of proposing a particular thesis with this book. It is not a book where I'm saying this is who black British women are. Actually, what I'm showing is a range of different kinds of black British women, extending the representation of who we are in this society rather than defining us narrowly.</p><p>And because of that, the women would be in disagreement with each other. And so --</p><p>AMANPOUR: And they are in the book.</p><p>EVARISTO: They are.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Quite a lot. Even mothers and daughters and friends and university friends and all the rest of it. But you just mentioned the 93- year-old woman who actually just fascinated me. The fact that she made -- I want you to sort of tell me, but she made this sort of statement about how she was othered despite the fact that here she is, 93, that she is -- you know, living on a farm that she owns and has been in her family for 200 years. People wouldn't imagine that looking at her.</p><p>EVARISTO: Yes. So I wanted to not just have a very old woman.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Hattie, her name is.</p><p>EVARISTO: Hattie who is somebody who is a rural woman, which is quite unusual for the U.K. She has run the farm all her life originally with her father and her mother. Now, she is living on her own, you know, her husband died a long time ago. She is fully independent. She is fully compos mentis. She is not going to go anywhere.</p><p>Her family is trying to put you in a home. She is not going into a home. So I wanted to show an older woman who is outside of the sort of urban environment where black people are usually positioned in the U.K. So she is in a rural environment, but she's also powerful and formidable because we don't get that representation either of older black women or even older women in fiction or even films or hardly even in television.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Or in the news, I mean ...</p><p>EVARISTO: Or in the news.</p><p>AMANPOUR: ... honestly, I would never have known about a Hattie-type character.</p><p>EVARISTO: Yes, yes, and I don't actually know any women of color who are farmers of that age.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>EVARISTO: But you know, the joy about being a writer is that I can create somebody like that and that's what I did. And people love her. You know, she is a very feisty, wonderful character.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Amma, she kind of opens the book. She is a black female LGBT voice on the London Theater since 40 years, and she is finally making a big break the play opening at the National Theater.</p><p>And after years and years, I mean, I wondered whether there was a little bit of coincidence between your experience and hers. Basically, Amma is now reflecting on her daughter's politics. So I would like you to read on Page 39, which is nicely written out there for you.</p><p>EVARISTO: \"Nor is the child she raised to be a feminist calling herself one lately. 'Feminism is so herd like,' Yazz told her. To be honest, even being a woman is passe these days. We had a non-binary activist at Uni called Morgan Mulenga who opened my eyes. I reckon we're all going to be non-binary in the future -- neither male nor female -- which are gendered performances anyway, which means your women's politics, Mumsy, will become redundant.\"</p><p>\"And by the way, I am humanitarian, which is on a much higher plane than feminism. Do you even know what that is?\"</p><p>AMANPOUR: Do you even mean it, Bernadine?</p><p>EVARISTA: Do I?</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes, do you mean it? I mean I think I was staggered actually because, you know, I mean feminism, you know, to sort of actually write about another generation, kind of diminishing the importance of feminism, maybe what? Thinking that the battle had been won.</p><p>EVARISTO: You know, the conversation around gender at the moment is so interesting, and the whole idea that they are performances and that we don't have to adhere to them.</p><p>I mean, I don't see it sort of gaining worldwide traction anytime soon. But perhaps in the future. Gender -- the idea of gender will become redundant, but I really wanted to explore it as sort of a 19-year-old girl, talking to her political mother who has been a feminist and activist all her life and completely undermining her in the way that can happen.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Just as also, she is actually achieving the pinnacle of her success.</p><p>[23:30:08]</p><p>EVARISTO: Yes. Yes. What I wanted to do was to look at some of these conversations that are happening and some of them are intergenerational and some of them are interracial. Some of them are you know, actually inter- gender, and just to see how I can just explore it through these different characters.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So they're 12 there. I mean, I think at one point, you said there could have been a thousand. I mean, there's so -- how did you even distill? How did you decide, you know, to focus on those 12?</p><p>EVARISTO: Well, I began with Carole who is the daughter of an immigrant -- Nigerian immigrant parents. She grows up in a very working class part of London called Peckham.</p><p>She goes to a state school, a rough state school, and then she is mentored by a woman there. She ends up at Oxford and then she joins the corporate world.</p><p>And then Carole has a mother called Bummi and Bummi came into Carole's story when I was writing her and I really like Bummi. So Bummi is Nigerian. She came to the U.K. with a Degree in Math, ends up a cleaner, as is often the case, and I then gave her, her story to tell -- her section.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So to me, it seems like Carole -- I mean, there are many other characters, but she is the one that we can sort of focus on the class issue, I think. Right? So please read that passage on Page 132.</p><p>EVARISTO: \"Nobody talked loudly about growing up in a Council flat on a skyscraper estate with a single mother who worked as a cleaner. Nobody talked loudly about never having gone on the single holiday -- like ever. Nobody talked loudly about never having been on a plane, seen a play or the sea or eaten in a restaurant with waiters.\"</p><p>\"Nobody talked loudly about feeling too ugly, stupid, fat, poor or just plain out of place, out of sorts, out of their depth. Nobody talked loudly about being gangbanged at 13 and a half.\"</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, there's just so much in there. The violence, obviously, kind of the imposter syndrome maybe. And then what she becomes, a member of the corporate world.</p><p>EVARISTO: Yes. So she goes to Oxford. You know, she is completely out of -- she feels completely out of her league. She doesn't feel that she belongs. She doesn't think she should be there.</p><p>You know, she is a black girl in a predominantly white university, it has to be said. And a mother, she goes home the first time and a mother says, no, you've got to stay. You've got to -- you know, you've got to stick this one out, and she does.</p><p>But in order to do so, she has to drop -- she feels she has to drop her identity.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>EVARISTO: So she loses touch with her roots, with her Nigerian background, with her working class British background -- changes the way she speaks and completely kind of changes her identity to become this kind of corporate animal who will succeed in banking and she does.</p><p>But she loses something of herself and her mother who is an immigrant doesn't really know how to steer her through that kind of world that her mother doesn't know herself.</p><p>So you know, the whole -- the idea of code switching.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>EVARISTO: Carole could go to Oxford, for example, and actually come back to Peckham and still be in touch with her mother's culture and the culture she's grown up in. But she doesn't know that she can do both. She thinks she has to lose one in order to succeed.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So let's just talk about the prose style. It's been described as almost like a very long poem.</p><p>EVARISTO: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Is that right?</p><p>EVARISTO: I call it fiction-fiction.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Would you say -- okay. What does that mean?</p><p>EVARISTO: So it's a book where the stories fuse with each other. So these 12 characters all have their own sections, but they're all fused. So it's not a book of short stories. It's a cohesive novel. But also, I've written a slightly experimental form, whereby there aren't many full stops, but it's very readable.</p><p>But it means that the sort of language fuses with itself and I'm able to talk about the women in a way that I don't think I could if I was writing a traditional novel, so I can cover a whole life in 30 pages and go back and from the past and the present, the present to the past. Be inside then be outside them. And also it's almost like stream of consciousness.</p><p>So that I think that the form allows the reader to engage with the book on a sort of -- on perhaps a deeper level than if it was just a traditional novel.</p><p>AMANPOUR: We've talked about class, we've talked about gender, we've talked about mother-daughter relationships.</p><p>EVARISTO: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And you tackle, obviously age as well, and Winsome, is you know, somebody who you talk about on being her own person and free from imposed roles. So let us read that chapter -- that passage on Page 257, if you wouldn't mind.</p><p>EVARISTO: \"Winsome has listened to her grandchildren's lives since they could speak and they've never asked about her. She understands that young people are consumed by themselves, and her role is to comfort and reassure and be caring towards them when their parents are cross with them.\"</p><p>\"Winsome likes the fact that Rachel is curious enough to know who her grandmother was before she was a mother, when she was a person in her own right, as she described it, except she never had has been. First, she was a daughter, then a wife and mother and now also a grandmother and great grandmother.\"</p><p>[23:35:07]</p><p>AMANPOUR: I think that's so poignant. I mean, you're 60 years old now. I'm kind of around there. And this focus on age and being invisible, and the loneliness, maybe if you don't have a nice, warm family, like Winsome obviously does, but talk a little bit about the age, not just to black women, but of bit of women, and where -- and today, in today's society, where people don't respect the old as much as perhaps they should, or maybe even don't respect in the West as much as they do in Africa and elsewhere.</p><p>EVARISTO: Elsewhere. I know that in some cultures, aging is fine. I would say probably from what I know about Nigeria, you are, you know, afforded more respect if you're aging, if you're an older person.</p><p>Whereas I think what happens here is we're completely obsessed with young people. And you know, as I said earlier, older people just don't feature much in culture. And I would say even older women, often write younger female protagonists, whereas in actual fact, we're very interesting. The older we get, the more interesting we become, right?</p><p>AMANPOUR: I agree.</p><p>EVARISTO: We've lived long lives, you know, we kind of know our own minds.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And the freer we become -- Annette Bening said the same thing.</p><p>EVARISTO: Freer. Yes. And we have -- we have a certain amount of wisdom and perspective, and so much to offer society. And I think it's really important that we show that in our culture. And so, you know, I have women of every generation in this novel. There are lots of middle aged women and older women.</p><p>Hattie is the oldest, but there are lots of others and they all have agency. Nobody is defeated. Nobody is a victim. I hate creating victims, because that's the other thing. There's this expectation that if you create older characters, A, they've got dementia or something, and are feeble, and they're unable to lead full lives. And that's not true.</p><p>And it's certainly not true of the women I see around me. So I just wanted to somehow explore that and to celebrate it, to celebrate aging, we should celebrate it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So you're celebrating your win and your success after a lifetime of working for it. You shared, I believe, a 50,000 pound prize with Margaret Atwood, what are you going to put your side? What do you want to pay for? Buy?</p><p>EVARISTO: It sounds so boring. But I just say mortgage.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Mortgage. Well, that's a very -- every woman thing to worry about. Right?</p><p>EVARISTO: It is. You know, so yes, that's it mortgage.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And do you think this is it now from success will breed success? What is your ambition going forward?</p><p>EVARISTO: To continue to do what I'm doing. And also I am a literary activist. So I know I have much more of a platform now to say the things that I've got to say.</p><p>I think there'll be more pressure on me with my next book, for example.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>EVARISTO: But you know, it will be my ninth book. So I will just try and sort of push that pressure aside and write the book that I want to write and it will land where it lands and we'll see if people like it or not.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Have you already started?</p><p>EVARISTO: No.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right, on that note, you wouldn't tell me anyway.</p><p>EVARISTO: No.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Bernadine Evaristo, thank you so much and congratulations.</p><p>EVARISTO: Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And we turn now from that note of hope, to the ideal of the American dream and why for so many that is dying. Veteran journalist and author, Nicholas Lemann offers his own take on his latest book \"Transaction Man: The rise of the deal and the decline of the American Dream.\" Power, he says has shifted away from government and corporations towards the financial sector.</p><p>And as our Walter Isaacson discovers, the book centers on three key people.</p><p>WALTER ISAACSON, PRESIDENT OF THE ASPEN INSTITUTE: I guess, I should say at the outset, you and I grew up together. I've been a fan of yours for about 50 to 60 years, and especially your new book, \"Transaction Man.\"</p><p>In your book, you talk about a period of American life through much of the 20th Century that there was some economic security that came from big corporations and General Motors and the fact that you've got a good job at a good wage and then a pension. Explain how that happened and how it declined.</p><p>LEMANN: Okay. So it's an interesting story. Well, let's stipulate first, there was a pretty big part of the population that worked for big corporations in the glory days of, you know, American hegemony after the Second World War. And you know, when big industrial corporations really weren't big.</p><p>Let's stipulate, not everybody was cut in on the deal. And you know, you're talking about a heavy white male phenomenon. And that meant that, among other things, it wasn't a very stable social order.</p><p>But it didn't always exist. It was created out of the New Deal in the Second World War. Before then, it didn't exist and corporations were quite new and corporations were forced to and/or decided to become kind of the welfare state that we didn't have in the U.S. -- in government would have in the private sector.</p><p>[23:40:15]</p><p>LEMANN: So for a lot of Americans, things like job security, pensions after you retired, health benefits, annual raises for inflation, unions came through your corporate employer.</p><p>By the way, it's kind of you know, my book is called \"Transaction Man.\" That's a play on a book called \"The Organization Man\" by William Whyte in 1958.</p><p>Now, when you look at that book, and there's a whole shelf of books like that, you still have to laugh because you think okay, you know, this is bitter complaint about the problems with America. The problems are, damn it, everybody -- I mean --</p><p>ISAACSON: Too much conformity with what they could blame about.</p><p>LEMANN: Yes, I mean, you used to work for Time, Inc., so you can relate to this from your own experience. You know, it was, we've got to do something about this situation where everybody has a secure job, and they work nine to five, and they can support a whole family and they can send their kids to college. They can be confident their kids will do better than them. I mean, this is crushing the American spirit.</p><p>So that's what a lot of these liberal social critics, back then, but it went away very dramatically. And the fact that it went away, I think created a lot of the mood in the United States that you're seeing now.</p><p>ISAACSON: So let's bring this down to a specific girth which is, I think Chicago lawn in your years and a guy who owns a Buick dealership, and you know, in the 50s, 60s and 70s, there's nothing better you can be than sort of having a GM dealer and all the auto suppliers and the companies and everybody worked. And this is going fine in Chicago lawn, right?</p><p>LEMANN: Well, okay, so everything looks better in retrospect. The guy that you're talking about is a character in the book named Nick D'Andrea, who is, you know, if he is not a Trump voter, certainly when I was hanging around with him a lot while working on the book, I met a lot of Trump voters.</p><p>And these are, you know, blue-collar people who didn't go to college and made it into the middle class through avenues that don't exist so much anymore.</p><p>So this guy, you know, started out as an auto -- he actually started out running a food cart, and then became an auto salesman, a used car salesman. A used car salesman finally acquired a majority of a dealership in a kind of tough blue-collar neighborhood that was transitioning from white to black and Latino. So it wasn't like the location every auto dealer wanted, but he's a gutsy guy, and he hung on and he was making it work.</p><p>And then, right when GM was going bankrupt, as part of that, a whole bunch of auto dealers were put out of business. And he got a letter in the mail one day saying, sorry, you're out of business, you're not an auto dealer anymore.</p><p>ISAACSON: Well, let me stick up for him for a second because we did the bailout of the banks then -- all OF the financial. We did the bailout of the auto industry back then.</p><p>LEMANN: Right.</p><p>ISAACSON: But the poor guy who has the Buick dealership in the suburb of Chicago, he loses everything.</p><p>LEMANN: Yes. And I would add to that, there's another version that you see or that I saw in the same neighborhood, which is the mortgage holders also didn't get taken care of or the people who took out mortgages didn't get taken care of nearly the same way than the people who issued the mortgages did.</p><p>And you know, the argument, we have to preserve the financial system from collapse and so on, but boy in that neighborhood, it is vivid because you know, when I was doing reporting there, you just empty houses everywhere. It's just such a struggle to keep that neighborhood going.</p><p>You know, there's a really palpable feeling in that neighborhood that whoever is running the country and the financial system just doesn't care about us and they take care of their friends and they don't take care of us. And that leads to a lot of sort of anger and a kind of almost desperate feeling.</p><p>It's really striking when you're there.</p><p>ISAACSON: What's very vivid on the ground in your book, among people who once depended on the General Motors Corporation supply chain and everything else, jobs got shipped overseas, trade didn't help them. Immigration didn't help them. And a growing economy didn't help them.</p><p>LEMANN: Yes. And you and the other thing that you see in that neighborhood and a lot of neighborhoods is just, you know, there'll be these big employers and you look at the big employers and either they disappear, or they're on their eighth owner in the last 20 years.</p><p>There's just - there's a tremendous amount of, you know, breaking apart and reassembling of the large units of the American economy that leaves people feel very confused.</p><p>[23:45:10]</p><p>LEMANN: You know, as people give account of what has led to the current discontent, this is a big part of it that hasn't been in people's standard picture.</p><p>You know, people talk about a whole bunch of different factors. You know, the left has one set, the right has another set, but I don't think people appreciate how important this change in the economy has been in changing the mood of the country, particularly that this kind of shift from institutional corporate kind of orientation to a very fluid financial orientation.</p><p>ISAACSON: The real villain though in your book in terms of the hollowing out of this working middle class, it's not totally government but Wall Street and the transaction folks.</p><p>LEMANN: Yes, I would say not even just Wall Street, but a kind of way of thinking. And I want to say, you know, I don't know if this is actually true, but supposedly Flaubert said \"Madame Bovary\" c'est moi.</p><p>ISAACSON: Yes.</p><p>LEMANN: And I would say, \"Transaction Man\" c'est moi. I mean, I don't know how you would react to this. But when I was young and coming up in the world, I was very enthusiastic as a young liberal journalist about a lot of stuff that I now think of is a terrible mistake.</p><p>So I don't think it was just greedy, evil guys from Wall Street, I think it was bipartisan enthusiasm by sort of elite liberals on both coasts for a different kind of vision of society.</p><p>You know, people who had read \"The Organization Man\" and were really convinced by it and didn't think we'll miss this one day and again, I'm in that category, I thought wouldn't it be great if we can have a more fluid society in which we can break up some of these big institutions that are standing in the way of progress and creativity, and we'll have a much more sort of fluid world.</p><p>So I think out of that fundamental attitude came a lot of specific things in many realms, including Wall Street, but it should be understood in that larger context.</p><p>Wall Street became so much bigger because they went from being one of the most regulated industries in the country, really tightly regulated, coming out of the New Deal, and even the 19th Century to substantially deregulated and that was very bipartisan, that wasn't just, you know, Wall Street runs the country. It wasn't a corporate plot. It wasn't a conservative plot. It was a bipartisan consensus that this was going to work out really well for everybody.</p><p>ISAACSON: In 1997, the Business Roundtable, is it? It sort of says, shareholder value has to be supreme. That's all a company or a corporation should focus on -- it is returning shareholder value.</p><p>This is, of course, different than the corporate world that you write about at the beginning of the rise of corporate America. Well, they cared about the community, they cared about the workers, they cared about the shareholders, stakeholders, everything else. That seems to be an inflection point in '97.</p><p>LEMANN: The sort of great theorist of the shareholder revolution is an economist named, Michael Jensen, who is much featured in the book and who wrote a very influential article in 1976.</p><p>This is one of the most cited academic publications of all time saying, you know, corporations, this age, you were talking about must end and corporations must reorient themselves toward their shareholders.</p><p>So 20 years, you know, of a lot of activity this had become conventional wisdom. If you remember the poster child of CEO then was Jack Welch of GE, who had really embraced this. And by the way, had decided GE, which was the classic Organization Man company, no longer would have de facto lifetime tenure for everybody and, you know, retire at 65 with your defined benefit pension.</p><p>And so that was what everybody thought in 1997. And that was why the Business Roundtable issued the statement.</p><p>Now, just in August, they reversed themselves. So that's really interesting. And they issued a new statement, signed by 180 CEOs organized by Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase saying, nope, we changed our mind. They didn't say that way. And now we embrace something like the old vision of the corporation, the socially responsible corporation that attends to the interests of many stakeholders and the public and so on and not just shareholders. So that's interesting.</p><p>[23:50:07]</p><p>ISAACSON: Do you think that's going to work and it will have an impact?</p><p>LEMANN: Some but not a huge impact would be my guess. And the reason is a couple things; one, you know, legally, they have to listen to their shareholders. So if even Jamie Dimon stops listening to his shareholders, somebody is going to sue, you know, and say, wait a minute, you know, you're taking our money away to attend to some social cause.</p><p>ISAACSON: But didn't the law used to allow -- the Delaware court and others -- to balance shareholder value with other things, and that changed.</p><p>LEMANN: It changed, partly in less, my impression is out of legal changes than of practice changes. In those older days, you didn't have a very aggressive set of lawyers who were sort of making the shareholder revolution happen lawsuit by lawsuit.</p><p>ISAACSON: Well, the big corporations you wrote about in the main part of your book, that General Motors or the GEs or the IBMs that looked after the workers have now been replaced in some ways, both in the economy and in our mindset with these big tech companies.</p><p>LEMANN: Yes. Right.</p><p>ISAACSON: And so how are they going to react to this?</p><p>LEMANN: Well, they did sign the statement. Okay. So things are changing and it's an interesting moment, because it's -- I don't know if maybe you would be willing to put a date on it, but up to X year -- 2015, 2012 -- something like that, you almost could never read anything that said, there's a problem with big tech companies and we were really in awe of Google and Facebook and Apple and so on.</p><p>In the same way that in the late 19th Century, people were in awe of the railroad companies and people like that and it has shifted very quickly.</p><p>ISAACSON: Why has there been a backlash against big tech?</p><p>LEMANN: I think it's partly the tenor of the times that we've been talking about that the economic populism, which really wasn't part of front line American politics has come back to the fore. It is presenting itself in this presidential campaign more than in a lot that I can remember in the recent past, and they're an obvious target. So that's one thing.</p><p>Another thing is, I think people are realizing that, you know, there's a downside to the big tech companies, they're not human saints, they're collecting a lot of data on us. For us journalists, you know, we've watched the newspaper business kind of decline tremendously and the magazine business, too.</p><p>So there's a more sort of nuanced sense that you know, when something very big happens very fast, it's not a hundred percent positive.</p><p>ISAACSON: Let's look at the big picture though. We've had about a decade of good economic growth. We have low unemployment. We have a pretty robust economy. Globally, the economy has been doing pretty well.</p><p>And yet, more and more people rightly feel that they don't have job security, that their kids aren't going to have it better than they are, that they're not going to be able to get great educations for their kids and not be able to afford it.</p><p>So it makes sense that there's this discontent with the deal that we were given that when we all play by the rules, it was going to be better.</p><p>LEMANN: Yes, I agree with that completely. You know, this is another thing where I don't want to put all the blame on conservatives, but also on us, liberals is, you know, I think, at least the younger version of me thought, if you can get sort of the macroeconomic policy right, you know, tax policy and so on, that will solve problems.</p><p>And I personally tended to be very suspicious of anything that attempted to, you know, preserve existing economic arrangements, existing economic institutions, the locations where people lived -- anything like that I thought couldn't possibly work and would be bad.</p><p>And that attitude which is pretty widespread doesn't track with the problems you're talking about, because that's how you can get to a good -- you know, objectively, a good economy that goes along with a tremendous amount of discontent.</p><p>And, by the way, embedded in what we're both saying, I don't think it's -- the discontent is just manufactured by Fox News or whomever. I think it's real. And, you know, politicians have to realize that it's there and think about how to deal with it and they're starting to and that's a good thing.</p><p>[23:55:10]</p><p>ISAACSON: Nick, thanks for being with us.</p><p>LEMANN: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And finally, it is high time we recognize an extraordinary woman overlooked by history -- Dame Janet Vaughan. Born at the turn of the 20th Century, she is credited with discovering the cure for a rare type of anemia.</p><p>A doctor and a scientist Janet Vaughan was also one of the first to advocate for blood banks before the Blitz when the Nazis carpet-bombed London during World War II. And later, she was one of the first into concentration camps, and scientifically devised a way to feed emaciated survivors.</p><p>And after the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, she became a world authority on the effects of plutonium on the bone. What a life.</p><p>That is it for now. Remember to catch us online and on Instagram. Goodbye from London.</p><p>[00:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019120901cbk28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPT-9DD1-JB20-G0KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8908\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government, Politics, Donald Trump, George Soros, Democracy, British, Booker Prize, Literature, American Dream, Dame Janet Vaughan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009IR9</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp;

Payton recently visited with ISACA Now to reflect upon her time in the White House and provide analysis on how the technology and cybersecurity landscapes have evolved in her time since leaving the role. The following is a transcript of the interview, edited for length and clarity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ISACA Now: Are there aspects of working as White House CIO that you miss? What might those be?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Theresa Payton: Working at the White House was truly like no other experience I've had - it was thrilling and ever-changing. The nature of the work is one thing, but when you add to it the fast pace with the rapid advances in technology during my tenure, it made supporting the mission of the White House exciting and challenging, to say the least! I enjoyed that pace and that mission, and do still miss it. I also miss the talented staff that I worked with, many of whom still serve today.</p><p>ISACA Now: How different would that White House CIO role be if you started today as opposed to in 2006, from a technology standpoint?</p><p>Payton: I was CIO at the White House from 2006-08, right at the beginning of the social media revolution, Internet of Things devices, and the first iPhone released in 2007. It was a fabulous time for integrating digital transformations while still maintaining high levels of operational stability, resilience, and security. We were laying the groundwork for today's cybersecurity.</p><p>Moreover, while cyber criminals have been active since technology has existed, it's the pervasiveness and creativeness of cyber criminals that differs today. Anyone with a laptop and $20 can buy a ransomware kit on the dark web, so the access to malicious tools and the ability to learn how to use them has never been this easy to do.</p><p>The attacks for 2019 and beyond will be both nation-state sponsored as well as attacks sponsored by criminal groups and hacktivist groups. The past attacks of 2016-2018 provide a barrage of alarming wake-up calls. The slowdown and widespread unavailability of the internet in the US and parts of the EU on 21 October, 2016 due to the DDoS attack against cloud services host provider, Dyn, reminded us of the fragility of the internet infrastructure we rely upon.</p><p>The disturbing trend of an increasing number of nation-states with more advanced cybersecurity capabilities continues to threaten destabilization across the globe from a national security and economic security perspective. However, there is also an increased ability for a relatively unsophisticated threat actor to be successful within the cyber domain.</p><p>The reason for this is twofold. First, the increasing availability of automated hacking tools in the public domain provides the ability for individuals or groups of individuals with a basic set of skills, or just financial means to buy their way in, to achieve success. Second, the increasing availability of elastic computing infrastructure provides attackers with the ability to design and deploy relatively sophisticated attack infrastructures with ease.</p><p>ISACA Now: What are the most important components of successful incident response?</p><p>Payton: The most important thing when considering incident response to a cyber incident is the upfront planning before something bad happens. Without proper preparation, your company could be utterly non-functioning for days or weeks.</p><p>Ensuring that you have the correct backups in place to restore your systems and making sure that all employees know the proper protocols and chains of command makes an already stressful situation much better. Storing logs for the correct amount of time and capturing the right elements of information is crucial to determining who has attacked you, how they got in, if they are still there, and how catastrophic the incident will be to your company's operations and reputation. Digital forensics also is essential because you can review the logs and facts as to what happened to prevent another attack.</p><p>The reality is that business execs can't outspend the issue - it's an IF not a WHEN - and they must be prepared. Cybersecurity no longer is something that can exist in a vacuum. It must be elevated to the board level and given a seat at the table. Companies can face extreme backlash and brand reputation issues if they mishandle a cyber breach. Conversely, companies that handle a breach well can not only rebound, but grow.</p><p>ISACA Now: Privacy is another of your major areas of interest. Do you sense that GDPR and other similar regulations that are being enacted will have the intended impact of more responsible data privacy and data governance?</p><p>Payton: A big fear I have is that regulation is often onerous and expensive to implement, the money spent on regulation prevents start-ups from entering the space, and it's money diverted away from R&amp;D. To date, the US Congress has kept legislation \"technology-neutral.\"</p><p>If legislation were to pass and be signed by the President, technology companies would owe consumers certain legal duties for the first time. That's an incredible first step. What I'd like to continue to see is a culture change in big tech that consistently prioritizes consumers. That will require a close partnership between big tech, public officials and users of technology.</p><p>ISACA Now: What do you consider to be the most pressing challenges for cybersecurity professionals as we move forward?</p><p>Payton: Cybersecurity approaches and plans are evolving, and so are the tactics of cybercriminals. Cybersecurity professionals need to know as much as they possibly can about cybersecurity, and I highly recommend that they stay a constant student of their profession.</p><p>We are seeing more and more cyber professionals have responsibility for the business side of security, not just the technical side of the matter. I'd encourage all cyber professionals to know the strategic business priorities of their organization and how security relates to those priorities.</p><p>Several years ago, cybersecurity was seen as only a technical issue - and while that's still true - cybersecurity is more than anything a brand issue. Cyber professionals must acknowledge the significant implications an adverse event can have on a company's reputation and do everything in their power to balance implementing technologies and to create interoperability while also fending off cybercriminals.</p><p>We must design security for the human. They can't enact these processes and procedures that are so complex that regular, non-tech employees find ways around them. You have to figure out where your company stands on the secure-ease of use continuum, and go from there.</p><p>For example, many of us have installed child-proof or safety items in our houses for toddlers or pets, yet we still tell them, \"Don't touch this.\" But, just in case they do, we have designed safety features into your house with them in mind. We must build the same security safety nets into our work and daily lives. Design them for your employees and for yourself. Just know they will use free WiFi, they will recycle passwords, they will respond to emails that are tricking them into giving up information - they will break all the security rules because they are not security employees.</p><p>(This post originally appeared on the ISACA blog site, which can be viewedhere).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IFMNGT-0000016a-9c42-d8a2-abee-9d7ad0200000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFMNGT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2S-8411-JCRW-50MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436967</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1244\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

The president's suggestion that NAFTA needed a new name is perhaps the first positive thing he's personally put on the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My suggestion: the North American Free-ish Trade Agreement. If that's too glib, let's just drop \"free\" like the president did when he raised the idea. It would more accurately reflect what is shaping up to be a future of managed cross-border exchange rather than the more liberal kind of which we dreamed back in the early 1990s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NAFTA might have felt like a free-trade agreement because it eliminated duties on things that we see, smell, taste, and touch. But many less tangible sources of wealth - and political influence - remained mostly protected.</p><p>Financial services is a good example. The original NAFTA contained more than 2,000 articles, and not one required Canada to adjust the ownership rules that effectively shield the Bay Street banking oligopoly from international competition.</p><p>The outcome of that makes for a good debate. True free trade, or even freer trade, in financial services might have boosted investment and productivity by making it easier for entrepreneurs to obtain credit.</p><p>On the other hand, the decision to leave protections in place allowed big banks to get bigger, while a handful of others were able to achieve scale that wouldn't have been possible if institutions from the U.S. and Mexico had been permitted behind Canada's walls.</p><p>Royal Bank, Toronto-Dominion, and Bank of Nova Scotia now are the three most important publicly traded companies in the country, and they also are among a relatively small number of Canadian companies with enough size to make some noise abroad.</p><p>We've spent a year fretting about rules of origin for automobiles and farm subsidies. Those things matter, of course.</p><p>Still, agriculture and vehicle manufacturing are the stars of the previous quarter century, not the next one. By allowing established lobbies to dictate the public debate, we risk missing the off-stage dickering that could determine the economy's ability to create wealth two decades from now.</p><p>Canada will continue to grow lots of food, we probably have a comparative advantage in developing snow machines. But most wealth in the near future will be created by the companies that own ideas and data. That means the children of Justin Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland will be affected more by what an updated NAFTA has to say about intellectual property and digitalization than dairy quotas and car parts.</p><p>Nothing will be known until a final text is published, but there are reasons to worry the U.S. is trying to make it harder for Canadian and Mexican startups to gain ground on America's tech behemoths.</p><p>The summaries of the terms to which the U.S. and Mexico agreed aren't entirely reliable because they are vague and could have changed after several days with Canada back at the table. Yet they likely represent the items in play.</p><p>Canada's technology companies will be wary of language that suggests the Trump administration is seeking to tip the scales even more for companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.</p><p>Mexico apparently accepted a \"modernized, high-standard (IP) chapter that provides strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs,\" according to briefing material released by the U.S. Trade Representative.</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico appear to have expanded the range of drugs eligible for minimum patent protection and agreed to stricter patent rules in general. The outline also says the U.S. and Mexico agreed that limits on how data can be used, and where it must be stored, would be \"minimized,\" which would help Big Tech fight attempts by local authorities to regulate data collection.</p><p>\"The current IP provisions are terribly concerning,\" said Patrick Searle, spokesman for the Council of Canadian Innovators (CCI), an assembly of fast-growing tech companies. \"The most important thing to remember in these NAFTA negotiations is that Canada has virtually no IP stocks,\" Searle said, referring to the value of IP owned by Canadian entities.</p><p>\"Stronger and longer IP protections entrench and extend preexisting IP holders.\"</p><p>The value of IP peaked at around $38 billion in each of the first two quarters of 2008, and has struggled to get even close to that mark after collapsing during the recession. Canadian IP was worth about $31 billion in the second quarter, Statistics Canada reported this week.</p><p>Some of what the CCI has asked for is blatantly protectionist. For example, when Freeland asked for submissions on what her priorities should be in the NAFTA negotiations, the group asked specifically that she fight for the ability to control data collection as a \"barrier to entry\" for American firms.</p><p>That makes Canada's upstart wealth creators like all those that came before them.</p><p>If the U.S. and Mexico are negotiating in good faith, Canada will have an opportunity to adjust some of those provisions that it was presented last week, but not all.

The president's suggestion that NAFTA needed a new name is perhaps the first positive thing he's personally put on the table.</p><p>My suggestion: the North American Free-ish Trade Agreement. If that's too glib, let's just drop \"free\" like the president did when he raised the idea. It would more accurately reflect what is shaping up to be a future of managed cross-border exchange rather than the more liberal kind of which we dreamed back in the early 1990s.</p><p>NAFTA might have felt like a free-trade agreement because it eliminated duties on things that we see, smell, taste, and touch. But many less tangible sources of wealth - and political influence - remained mostly protected.</p><p>Financial services is a good example. The original NAFTA contained more than 2,000 articles, and not one required Canada to adjust the ownership rules that effectively shield the Bay Street banking oligopoly from international competition.</p><p>The outcome of that makes for a good debate. True free trade, or even freer trade, in financial services might have boosted investment and productivity by making it easier for entrepreneurs to obtain credit.</p><p>On the other hand, the decision to leave protections in place allowed big banks to get bigger, while a handful of others were able to achieve scale that wouldn't have been possible if institutions from the U.S. and Mexico had been permitted behind Canada's walls.</p><p>Royal Bank, Toronto-Dominion, and Bank of Nova Scotia now are the three most important publicly traded companies in the country, and they also are among a relatively small number of Canadian companies with enough size to make some noise abroad.</p><p>We've spent a year fretting about rules of origin for automobiles and farm subsidies. Those things matter, of course.</p><p>Still, agriculture and vehicle manufacturing are the stars of the previous quarter century, not the next one. By allowing established lobbies to dictate the public debate, we risk missing the off-stage dickering that could determine the economy's ability to create wealth two decades from now.</p><p>Canada will continue to grow lots of food, we probably have a comparative advantage in developing snow machines. But most wealth in the near future will be created by the companies that own ideas and data. That means the children of Justin Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland will be affected more by what an updated NAFTA has to say about intellectual property and digitalization than dairy quotas and car parts.</p><p>Nothing will be known until a final text is published, but there are reasons to worry the U.S. is trying to make it harder for Canadian and Mexican startups to gain ground on America's tech behemoths.</p><p>The summaries of the terms to which the U.S. and Mexico agreed aren't entirely reliable because they are vague and could have changed after several days with Canada back at the table. Yet they likely represent the items in play.</p><p>Canada's technology companies will be wary of language that suggests the Trump administration is seeking to tip the scales even more for companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.</p><p>Mexico apparently accepted a \"modernized, high-standard (IP) chapter that provides strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs,\" according to briefing material released by the U.S. Trade Representative.</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico appear to have expanded the range of drugs eligible for minimum patent protection and agreed to stricter patent rules in general. The outline also says the U.S. and Mexico agreed that limits on how data can be used, and where it must be stored, would be \"minimized,\" which would help Big Tech fight attempts by local authorities to regulate data collection.</p><p>\"The current IP provisions are terribly concerning,\" said Patrick Searle, spokesman for the Council of Canadian Innovators (CCI), an assembly of fast-growing tech companies. \"The most important thing to remember in these NAFTA negotiations is that Canada has virtually no IP stocks,\" Searle said, referring to the value of IP owned by Canadian entities.</p><p>\"Stronger and longer IP protections entrench and extend preexisting IP holders.\"</p><p>The value of IP peaked at around $38 billion in each of the first two quarters of 2008, and has struggled to get even close to that mark after collapsing during the recession. Canadian IP was worth about $31 billion in the second quarter, Statistics Canada reported this week.</p><p>Some of what the CCI has asked for is blatantly protectionist. For example, when Freeland asked for submissions on what her priorities should be in the NAFTA negotiations, the group asked specifically that she fight for the ability to control data collection as a \"barrier to entry\" for American firms.</p><p>That makes Canada's upstart wealth creators like all those that came before them.</p><p>If the U.S. and Mexico are negotiating in good faith, Canada will have an opportunity to adjust some of those provisions that it was presented last week, but not all. Trudeau's choices will show the extent to which he favours established industries over next generation ones. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Osprey Media Group Inc.

The company recently announced that its arthritis drug is one step closer to Food and Drug Administration approval, paving the way for the tech giant's first drug to enter the lucrative U.S. market.</p><p>Samsung is looking to release a version of Remicade, a drug currently sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The medication would be a biosimilar, which means a replica drug similar to a generic alternative that is offered at a lower price than the original drug.</p><p>Samsung is relatively new to the drug industry. Since 2011, it has invested billions in its pharmaceutical companies - Samsung Bioepis, which focuses on biosimilar drugs, and Samsung Biologics, which manufactures original drugs developed by other companies.</p><p>Samsung's choice to invest in a different industry represents a shift in the company's focus as its main business, hardware, begins to slow. And its investments seems to be paying off. It currently has a biosimilar replica of the Pfizer drug Enbrel, which treats rheumatoid arthritis, available in the European market.</p><p>Samsung isn't the only big tech company with fingers in a different pie. Other tech giants have taken on side businesses, such as search engine giant Google, which is heavily invested in the renewable energy business. After securing a deal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy and sell energy, Google has been steadily purchasing wind and solar farms from around the globe. Its latest purchase, a wind farm in Kenya slated to operate 365 wind turbines, is the company's 22nd renewable energy investment since 2009.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo Illustration by Joseph M.

Now, every problem tech companies face is fiendishly hard.Driving the news: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unloaded on Facebook Monday: \"Facebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an 'existential' threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.\"Sen. Warren, on Twitter[1] Why it matters: The last time presidential candidates were warning about interference in U.S. elections, the interloper was Russia. Now, it's Facebook \u2014 and the entire industry it sits atop. The big picture: Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have entered a world where their product innovations and profit margins are beginning to matter less than their ability to navigate treacherous political, social, and ethical rapids. Everywhere you look, far beyond the loudest headlines about hate speech and partisan bias online, tech companies face conflicting imperatives from their customers, governments, stakeholders and critics. 1. Security vs. privacy Americans want tech to make their daily lives safer \u2014 but they also want companies to keep their information private.No one in industry or government can easily reconcile those wishes.Smart doorbells can protect homeowners' front yards \u2014 but they also invoke dystopian scenarios of 24/7 surveillance on every street[2]. Encrypting text messages protects them from advertisers, scammers and snoops. Law enforcement authorities fear it will also make it harder to stop human trafficking[3] and remove images[4] of children's sexual abuse.Big company efforts to make internet infrastructure more secure can look like monopolistic behavior to critics, as Google is discovering with its advocacy of the DNS-over-HTTPS standard[5]. 2. Promoting freedom abroad vs. regulation at home The Trump administration has begun writing protections for internet companies resembling U.S. law into new trade pacts, including one recently signed with Japan and the pending USMCA deal with Mexico and Canada, the New York Times reports[6].Meanwhile, the same U.S. law \u2014 Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act[7], which protects online platforms from liability for user-contributed content even when that material is edited or moderated \u2014 is under fierce attack in Congress from bipartisan critics, who argue it gives tech firms too much power to squelch speech. 3. The lure of convenience vs. the value of resilience The American public has broadly embraced Amazon's e-commerce model, even as some feel twinges of remorse over the death of local retail.Amazon's near-monopoly means it may have to shoulder more public responsibility and more regulation, and critics want it to stop competing as a seller on its own platform. [8]Meanwhile, the now-dominant software-as-a-service model, which offers economies of scale to suppliers and convenience to consumers, is showing its geopolitical vulnerability: Adobe cut off all its customers in Venezuela[9] this week after the U.S. tightened trade sanctions on that nation. 4. The ideal of transparency vs. the reality of disinformation Facebook has long promised to help solve the \"truth decay\" problems its service has deepened by providing academic researchers with the data they need to study the issue, but the effort has stalled[10].That's in part because the company also wants to avoid handing troves of data to third parties who could misuse it \u2014 after all, that's where the Cambridge Analytica scandal that kindled its loss of public trust started. Between the lines: Some experts hold[11] that all these issues are problems for only a subset of the tech industry \u2014 namely social media platforms. But it's hard to see how any players will be able to sidestep the flood of dilemmas. Social media platforms only work because they sit on top of the internet itself. That depends on a mountain of hardware and software, including routers, network protocols, databases, server farms, and devices at the end like your phone and laptop, as well as the power that keeps it all running.Our society is tech all the way down. Our thought bubble: The tech industry still commands such a reserve of money and talent that it might find a path through this maze. Facebook's careful, creative effort to create a \"Supreme Court\"-like appeals board[12] for content moderation decisions is one promising example.Yes, but: Too often, tech leaders and insiders lack knowledge of history, sociology, psychology, and themselves \u2014 and their optimistic self-blindness has often been to blame for the dilemmas they now face. The bottom line: Policymakers and engineers are both accustomed to making and living with tradeoffs, but someone has to make a final call over where these choices land. The fight now is over who that will be: companies, governments, or the public.

(Sorry, Microsoft, but maybe it's for the best.)The big four share enormous power, massive resources, high ideals and, more recently, troubled public images. But there are enormous differences among them, too \u2014 and their leaders will be leaning on those contrasts as lawmakers grill them.Why it matters: These differences will shape how each firm fares in the court of public opinion and the labyrinth of regulatory action as they try to counter lawmakers' charges [3]of monopolistic practices, privacy violations, censorship, and tolerance of misinformation. </p><p>What they do: Facebook's mission is to \"bring the world closer together\" through its social network: it connects people with other people. Google, whose mission is \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,\" connects people with information.Amazon's aim is \"to continually raise the bar of the customer experience.\" Let's just say it connects people with goods. Apple's mission, \"to make great products,\" might be described as giving people the best devices to make all of the above possible. How they make money: Both Facebook and Google sell ads. Together, they're predicted to collect roughly 52% of all U.S. digital ad dollars this year (per eMarketer).Amazon is a retailer that also runs a marketplace for other merchants. It also has a huge cloud services business ($75 billion in revenue for the first quarter of 2020).Apple sells hardware. It's also building revenue from services \u2014 more than $13 billion in the most recent reported quarter, making that line bigger than its Mac and iPad businesses. Who's in charge: Zuckerberg founded Facebook and retains a controlling majority of voting shares, which makes him effectively an absolute ruler.Bezos founded Amazon and has run it from the start, though his substantial stake does not come with voting control of the company.Cook and Pichai both succeeded powerful founders (Steve Jobs and Larry Page) in the CEO chair, and though there's no sign that either of them faces a challenge, they are much more answerable to their boards as a result. Where they're based: Facebook, Google, and Apple are all headquartered within miles of each other a half-hour south of San Francisco. Amazon, like Microsoft, is based in Seattle, but it gets lumped in with Silicon Valley nonetheless \u2014 at least as a state of mind. How they're structured: Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and, though it has moved to integrate them technically, it still operates both as distinct services. That gives lawmakers a potential way to think about breaking up the company.Google's acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007 set up its dominant position in the digital-ad market. YouTube, its vast video platform, also operates independently.Amazon's hugely successful Web Services cloud service operates relatively separately from the company's main business, and some critics have called for the two to be separated.Apple has rarely grown through big acquisitions and offers regulators few obvious fissures to cleave. If they wanted to consider somehow splitting it up, they'd likely explore breaking the App Store off from the iPhone's operating system and Apple's control. Yes, but: The fact that there are four tech superpowers to begin with suggests there's still plenty of competition that opponents of antitrust action can cite. These companies are all in one another's businesses. Apple and Google offer competing smartphone operating systems (iOS and Android).Facebook and Google's huge ad businesses are in competition with each other, and Amazon competes here too, with its roughly 10 percent share of the digital ad market growing. Amazon Web Services faces competition from Google as well as Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and smaller players.Google and Amazon both make devices that compete with Apple, and even Facebook has gotten into the act (with Portal and Oculus).Each company has deep investments in AI products and research, and each has a voice assistant (Facebook's long-rumored entrant is still in development). Microsoft remains a strong competitor in many areas, too. Our thought bubble: Antitrust is all about defining markets[4]. You can't have a monopoly unless it's clear what the monopoly is on. In tech's big previous antitrust epics, cases against IBM and Microsoft, the government took aim at single dominant firms, and labored mightily to make its case. Going after four companies at once will make the job even harder. Go deeper: Tech giants' life cycles shape their crisis responses[5] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/tech-ceos-zuckerberg-cook-bezos-pichai-congress-vs-techs-gang-of-four-635db195-1884-4475-921d-6a7acb1dcd95.html\">https://www.axios.com/tech-ceos-zuckerberg-cook-bezos-pichai-congress-vs-techs-gang-of-four-635db195-1884-4475-921d-6a7acb1dcd95.html</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/dcs-assault-on-tech-crest-ceo-hearing-92dd16fb-7f2f-4887-8943-24eb461788a6.html\">https://www.axios.com/dcs-assault-on-tech-crest-ceo-hearing-92dd16fb-7f2f-4887-8943-24eb461788a6.html</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/the-one-big-thing-each-tech-ceo-will-tell-congress-687f55de-8fdd-4c95-a3dd-ec1cdadb7b60.html\">https://www.axios.com/the-one-big-thing-each-tech-ceo-will-tell-congress-687f55de-8fdd-4c95-a3dd-ec1cdadb7b60.html</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/apple-facebook-google-markets-define-monopolies-3755c7c2-ff91-4647-9b71-9342a89080b8.html\">https://www.axios.com/apple-facebook-google-markets-define-monopolies-3755c7c2-ff91-4647-9b71-9342a89080b8.html</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/tech-giants-crisis-life-cycles-14c079f0-418d-4583-a032-0130d06c5d6a.html\">https://www.axios.com/tech-giants-crisis-life-cycles-14c079f0-418d-4583-a032-0130d06c5d6a.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544159550113592375776100160</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-H971-JCMN-Y112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><timeReceived>10:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

When was the last time a significant social media network was founded in the United States? And what about a competitive search engine company? An online ad network? And what about a truly wide-ranging e-commerce start-up?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are the depressing answers. The social network Snapchat, in 2011. For search, Microsoft\u2019s Bing appeared in 2009, a replacement for its Live Search. I\u2019m drawing a blank on an ad network. With e-commerce, the answer is probably Wayfair, which arrived in 2002, and still has only 1.3 percent of the market (most retail innovation has been in niche areas, like luggage (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.awaytravel.com/\">Away</url>) or special fashion (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.therealreal.com/\">The RealReal</url>)).</p><p>To put this another way: Facebook and its Instagram unit have close to 50 percent of the social media market, dwarfing all the other companies in monthly active users tenfold. Google has about 90 percent of the search market, with Bing and Yahoo dwindling ever further behind by the month. Google and Facebook also suck up 60 percent of the digital ad spend, with only Amazon moving up aggressively in that fast-growing space. And speaking of Amazon, the retail giant has about 50 percent of total e-commerce sales in the United States, with eBay and Walmart at 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively.</p><p>[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1155903372077064193\">Twitter</url>.] </p><p>We\u2019ve all known this for a long time. So it\u2019s not much of a surprise that two American government agencies \u2014 the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 have finally gotten around to looking into the dead obvious by investigating the market power of big tech companies and whether their dominance in a range of arenas has hurt competition and hindered new start-ups from forming.</p><p>Whether it is too little too late, and whether the government will actually take significant action, is another story. And if the recent settlement by the F.T.C. with Facebook is any guide \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/technology/facebook-ftc-fine.html\">the penalty</url> is so extraordinarily light that it makes a slap on the wrist seem like cruel and unusual punishment \u2014 the recent upsurge in stock prices of the tech giants under scrutiny will continue.</p><p>To put it another way, no one in Silicon Valley is holding her breath or is even wary of the reasons the feds are acting. </p><p>\u201cWould I love to see the government F our largest competitors?\u201d joked the chief executive of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reddit.com/\">Reddit</url>, Steve Huffman, in a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode-decode-podcast-kara-swisher\">podcast interview</url> with me last week. \u201cYeah! That\u2019d be great.\u201d But he added that he\u2019d want government action only for the right reasons. </p><p>Mr. Huffman went on to make a larger and more serious point: that it has taken regulators so long to take action as the big tech players have amassed such power that it might be too late. He also noted that the size of many big tech companies doesn\u2019t necessarily help them combat hate speech \u2014 and that more competition would solve myriad such problems faster.</p><p>Encouraging more competition is now the direction that the government seems to be going in, especially since the idea of showing consumer harm \u2014 which has been the traditional standard for bringing an antitrust action \u2014 feels impossible to prove here.</p><p>Instead, as the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust head, Makan Delrahim, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/07/23/us/ap-us-tech-regulation.html\">said last week</url> in a statement, \u201cWithout the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll take a step further by saying that the way that the tech giants have been responsive to consumer demands has lulled us all into a state of continuous partial satisfaction. After all, who doesn\u2019t love free email and maps and adorable photo posting and instant information gratification and getting your heart\u2019s desire delivered in a flash?</p><p>But the fact is that we have all become cheap dates to these tech platforms, making a trade-off in which they get all the real value and we get some free stuff that is inexpensive and easy for them to provide.</p><p>In this setup, we consumers are the gifts that keep on giving, as continuing generators of data that is monetizable and ever more revealing to the companies that collect that information. But, hey, we get Prime! We get Nest! We get Libra!</p><p>The government is now dragging in all kinds of experts \u2014 including some of digital tech\u2019s prominent creators \u2014 to understand how the technology works and how to make a great industry more open to innovation by replacing inadequate self-regulation with some real regulation.</p><p>\u201cCongress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/technology/justice-department-tech-antitrust.html\">said Representative David Cicilline</url>, Democrat of Rhode Island, who leads the antitrust committee in the House. \u201cAs a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201d</p><p>This is a theme, of course, that European regulators have been sounding for a long time. So, does it mean that the reckoning is finally here in the United States, too?</p><p>Like Reddit\u2019s Steve Huffman, I won\u2019t hold my breath, largely because the record of the government in this area has been weak. And, of course, it is already overreaching, as we saw in Attorney General William Barr\u2019s fatuous speech last week calling for tech companies to stop using advanced encryption. (Apple are you listening? No, you are not because you are not spies.)</p><p>But there is no question that the tech story is now a regulatory story, which is good because we need the kind of control that only government can impose. But it\u2019s also sad because the tech story should be one of innovation. It should be a story of what\u2019s next.</p><p>There are glimmers of that. Some recent initial public offerings \u2014 I\u2019m thinking of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.beyondmeat.com/\">Beyond Meat</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</url> \u2014 show some promise of a future that is not totally controlled by a few giant companies, given that none of the market stunners operate in areas the government is policing. </p><p>So, here\u2019s another quiz: Will the government help these newer companies, and so many others, to thrive? Answer: Let\u2019s hope so.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

At a recent tech conference in New York, Tillman, director of public affairs for the Association of Records Managers and Administrators (ARMA), found himself surrounded by vendors hawking hardware and software that promised to help companies get smarter about managing their documents. Offering scanners to smart pens to workflow and routing software as well as full-range governance application suites, the array of technology could overwhelm even the most informed CIO. The most common pitch? Regulatory compliance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It gives me a little angst that all these companies are running around and saying their software is Sarbanes-Oxley compliant,\" Tillman says. \"There is no such thing as 'Sarbanes-Oxley compliant.' It's not like HIPAA, which has this litany of rules. The SEC has not laid down a regimen of things that you as a company have to do for Sarbanes-Oxley, other than the certification and the 404 section of the act.\"</p><p>With analysts calling document management one of the cornerstones of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance (the other is business process management), vendors are looking to cash in on what has become the big tech issue of the moment. But, as Tillman points out, there's no off-the-shelf program that qualifies as the proverbial \"turnkey solution,\" because the scope of Sar-banes is too broad.</p><p>Under the act, public companies are required to archive any and all financial data, and also to keep a record of a document's lifecycle-who within the company had access to, viewed or amended a given document. What's more, all this information has to be retrievable upon request by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in just two business days. Sure, the SEC may grant individual firms extra time to gather the data on a case-by-case basis, but it's not backing down on enforcing the policy. Several major banks and investment firms have already been fined, most notably Bank of America Corp., which in early March was fined $10 million-the largest fine ever levied by the SEC for failure to produce documents-for refusing to produce e-mails and compliance forms concerning trading activities. According to SEC reports, Bank of America refused to provide documents and \"engaged in dilatory tactics that delayed the investigation.\" Moreover, some requested documents had been destroyed after regulators requested them- a move that Bank of America claims was inadvertent. And $10 million proved just the beginning: After agreeing to create a special department to handle data retention, B of A consented the same month (March, 2004) to pony up $375 million-$125 million in fines and $250 million to investors-to settle SEC claims that it traded mutual funds improperly. The bank also agreed to exit the securities clearing business by 2005.</p><p>Still, if Bank of America may be one of the latest to feel the SEC's sting on document retrieval, it's not the first. Another notable precedent for such fines came back in December 2002, when the commission, in a joint action with the New York Stock Exchange and NASD, fined several Wall Street firms-Goldman Sachs, SalomonSmith Barney, Deutsche Bank Securities and U.S. BancorpPiper Jaffray among them-$1.65 million each for failing to produce requested e-mail records fast enough.</p><p>\"That's the one place where the SEC has an amazingly short tolerance,\" says ARMA's Tillman. \"When the SEC says they want information, you better be able to bring it up.\"</p><p>The two-day turnaround presents a significant challenge. \"It really raises the bar in terms of what management needs to do,\" Bruce Winters, a senior manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says. \"Most of the world is not ready for that.\"</p><p>Ask your records manager:</p><p>Do we have a way to easily retrieve old data from our storage facilities?</p><p>Ask your business managers:</p><p>How could document management improve your processes?</p><p>Tell your compliance department:</p><p>Document management will help ensure that our data is clean.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Strategy</emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Use DM to achieve compliance, but with an eye toward what else you can accomplish.</emphasis></p><p>There's at least one way Sarbanes is extremely helpful: It got everyone's attention. Take advantage of this focus and use the following steps to develop an effective document management strategy. First, figure out which documents at your company need to be tracked under federal regulations. Next, talk to your business unit managers to find out what software is already in place (some departments may be using some form of document management under the CIO's radar), and how departments without a document management system could make use of one. Finally, sit down with a team that includes your internal auditor, general counsel, records managers, business unit managers and your company's compliance officer to set a detailed policy about how records will be routed, archived and eventually deleted.</p><p>What documents need to be tracked under Sarbanes-Oxley? The SEC mandates that companies archive and maintain records for everything relating to their finances. This includes not just annual reports and quarterly filings, but also sales receipts, inventory lists, and communications such as e-mails, instant messages, faxes-in short, any and all documents containing or relating to financial or customer-specific data. Audit-related data must be stored for seven years; communications such as instant messages and e-mails must be kept for three.</p><p>As far as the SEC is concerned, there are no set rules as to how you should store data. \"Sarbanes-Oxley covers a whole raft of issues,\" says John Heine, spokesperson for the SEC. \"There has been a fair amount of writing in the technical press about whether the records retention requirements apply to electronic records of all sorts. I don't know that there's anything in particular in [Sarbanes-Oxley] that speaks to electronic archiving.\" In other words, it doesn't matter if your files are stored in boxes, burned on CDs or chiseled in stone-as long as you've got them and can produce them quickly.</p><p>The amount of data you will need to digitize depends on how frequently you refer back to it. But keep in mind, there's no law that says you have to digitize every document your company has ever created. Many companies opt to create digital search engines that simply tell them where hard copies of documents have been stored; they create digital records only for new data.</p><p>To get a green light, chances are you'll have to demonstrate the value of the document management system to upper management. You can. Take the experience of Tim Fives, manager of global content solutions for $4 billion York International Corp., a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. Fives was hired in October 2001 to create a Web-based content-management system, but \"after a month or so,\" he says, \"I realized we had no handle on content processes in general.\"</p><p>Fives took a step back, regrouped and em-barked on a companywide document/content management project with Documentum Inc. His first goal was to prove the value of the project by digitizing all of the company's authorization-for-expenditure forms-forms which must be filed whenever a department requests funds for a project. These documents filled about 20 filing cabinets. \"The goal was to create a repository that was searchable so we could save time when auditors ask us for information,\" he says. Before the document management system was in place, Fives says, the company often had to bring in part-time employees to help comb through the hundreds of files requested by federal authorities, a process that could take days. \"Now, instead of someone having to hunt for all of them, the system returns them in a matter of seconds,\" he says. This expenditure-forms project alone has saved York about $100,000 to date.</p><p>When you've identified which records you want to automate, sit down with your legal, human resources and finance departments-as well as your internal auditors and business unit heads-and develop a plan that details not only how each department can best leverage the system, but also how records should be managed, stored and eventually deleted.</p><p>\"You've got to have a retention policy and a destruction schedule,\" says Tillman. \"Because you don't want records laying around forever. What a good way to get sued!\"</p><p>Ask your CFO:</p><p>What financial documents do we store digitally?</p><p>Ask your legal department:</p><p>What files should we be archiving digitally?</p><p>Explain to your executive team:</p><p>A DM system will better manage our data, and save us money.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROI</emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yes, Virginia, there is an upside to compliance.</emphasis></p><p>David Dietz, CIO of Stillwater National Bank in Stillwater, Okla., well remembers the days before his company installed a document routing system. \"We had between 300 and 400 forms that needed to be changed every day,\" Dietz says, \"and it seemed like something was always getting lost.\" The company, which has seven branches and 340 employees, also wanted to reduce its error rates on all its interoffice, paper-based forms, so, nearly two years ago-before Sarbanes passed-Dietz bought a suite of products from Movaris Inc. and Foxtrot, a back-office system from EnableSoft Inc.</p><p>While this system now helps Stillwater comply with Sarbanes, and with other new regulations, the routing system has also helped the bank reduce its error rates by 50 percent, and it makes sure that only the right people can access certain forms. In addition, Dietz says, Foxtrot has improved customer service because stop payments can now happen almost automatically. \"Many times a stop payment would be filled out at a branch, and it would take about a day to get here by mail, so it wouldn't post until the next business day, which causes problems sometimes,\" he says. \"Now, it happens in about 30 minutes.\"</p><p>Over at Albuquerque, N.M.-based PNM Resources Inc., the state's largest electric and natural gas provider, with more than 1.3 million customers and $1.5 billion in revenue, documents used to be stored on an old mainframe indexing system. But as a utility company regulated by more than a dozen state and federal agencies, PNM realized that it needed greater routing and archiving capabilities than the indexing system could provide, says Carl Seider, PNM's senior analyst and head of the company's document management compliance efforts. To ensure the investment would be worthwhile, Seider sat down with each of his company's business units-including procurement, legal, accounting and human resources-to figure out how to integrate a document management system from Hummingbird Ltd. into each unit's work processes. \"We asked, 'If you could be rid of these file cabinets and have it the way you wanted it, how would you do this?' \" he says.</p><p>Seider found plenty of ways to leverage document management inside the company. For one thing, the company has saved $36,000 on off-site storage fees by digitizing 10,000 boxes' worth of physical documents. The document management program also allowed Seider to retire their microfiche system, saving the company $12,000. In addition, the company's cash-remittance department, which processes customer checks and archives check stubs, needed to upgrade its equipment. They installed imaging hardware that enables check stubs to be digitally photographed and entered into the document management system within 24 hours of processing.</p><p>\"Previously if you called and said there was a problem with a check, we would have to get your phone number and call you back after we did our research,\" Seider says. \"[The DM program] was a big cost savings because now if a customer calls and says their check didn't post correctly, our call-center folks can pull that up and see the image. It saves us about 40 minutes of labor time on every request.\" The company also takes PDF images of all printed bills \"so our call-center people can see exactly what the customer received in their mailbox,\" he says. \"Those files are accessed about 5,000 times a month.\" Today, the company has more than 20 document libraries and is adding roughly 1.2 million new documents each month. And the company is saving nearly $1 million annually in reduced labor time and storage costs.</p><p>Tell your CEO:</p><p>Let's talk to all lines of business to make sure the program meets everyone's needs.</p><p>Tell your executive team:</p><p>This is going to be a major initiative that will require support from all lines of business.</p><p>Tell your line of business managers:</p><p>We need to train our people to make sure they get the most value from this project.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology</emphasis></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One word: Flexible.</emphasis></p><p>As companies endeavor to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, vendors are scrambling to bundle governance, content management and business process tools together in one package. Best-of-breed document management vendors are either buying or creating strong ties with companies offering storage and imaging ser-vices. And the market is huge-more than 33,000 people attended this year's Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM) conference, a record-breaking figure according to the association. Gartner Inc. estimates that 50 percent of all global 1,000 enterprises will have document management systems in place by 2005, and that those companies will budget, on average, roughly $2 million for Sarbanes-Oxley compliance through 2005.</p><p>But think twice before you select a vendor offering Sarbanes-Oxley-specific applications. Though those systems may include a document management capability, they are often difficult to extend beyond the accounting department. What's more, they don't necessarily address the other laws with which you may need to comply, such as HIPAA and Basel II. According to Gartner, which fields hundreds of calls a month regarding Sarbanes, companies that invest this year in a specific Sarbanes solution will likely retire or replace those systems by the end of 2005. \"If you buy a SOX-specific solution,\" says Toby Bell, a Gartner research director, \"the likelihood of it being replaced is fairly high.\"</p><p>When evaluating tech options, Bell and other analysts say, look for specific functions. Version control-the ability to track who has seen and made changes to any particular document-is one, says Jim Murphy, a senior analyst at AMR Research Inc. \"That's a baseline requirement. The other thing is the ability to take documents at a certain point in time and make them static records so they can't change anymore.\"</p><p>PwC's Winters adds that workflow and routing capabilities are also important, \"but most companies are not ready for that. They just want the stamp of approval that their controls are adequate.\" Strong keywording and search capabilities are also must-haves, analysts say.</p><p>As always, beware of how volatile start-up software firms can be. As York International's Tim Fives says, \"Don't forget to consider the viability of the vendor company itself.\"</p><p>Ask your general counsel:</p><p>What other regulations do we need to comply with?</p><p>Tell your executive team:</p><p>We need to make sure we partner with a vendor that understands our long-term strategy.</p><p>Ask potential vendors:</p><p>How do you plan to expand your document management capabilities?</p><p>Go to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/extras\">http://www.cioinsight.com/extras</url><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/extras\">www.cioinsight.com/extras</url> for a</p><p>Q&amp;A with:</p><p>Bob Tillman</p><p>Head of public affairs for the Association of Records Managers and Administrators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNSCOM-%CIO20237393%</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOINS2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4CDK-89V0-01KX-40DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">262909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2542\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CIO Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13921\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2004 Quinstreet, Inc.

There was, however, a hole at its heart. Plans to renationalise the rail, water and parts of the energy industry had a backward-looking feel, and Labour had nothing to say about the new oligopolies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is one reason why Jeremy Corbyn was keen to take on the digital giants in his speech to the Edinburgh Television Festival in August, proposing that the BBC receive a \"digital licence fee\" funded by a tax on tech companies or internet service providers. The Labour leader, who said his party faces \"greater hostility fromthe mainstream media than we've probably ever had before\", inevitably faced media criticism for some of his ideas - not least in respect of a proposed expansion of\"public service journalism\", funded by tech firms, which sceptics doubted would be free from political interference.</p><p>But Corbyn's proposals on the tech multinationals were well timed and reflect a changing public and political mood. In July, Facebook was fined the maximum \u00a3500,000 by the UK Information Commissioner after its data was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Meanwhile, Vote Leave was fined \u00a361,000 and referred to the police after the Electoral Commission ruled that it exceeded its \u00a37m spending limit by channelling \u00a3675,000 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. It must be added that it denies the claim.</p><p>Read more</p><p>I'm leaving Facebook - and it's not because of Cambridge Analytica</p><p>In the same month, the cross-party Digital,Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee produced a devastating critique of the new media landscape. Damian Collins, its Tory chair, warned that democracy itself is at risk. The committee proposed that social media sites be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors and recommended a \"clear legal liability\" for tech companies which failed to act against harmful and illegal content.</p><p>* * *</p><p>For the past 36 years, I've had a ringside seat at the often bruising battles between politicians and the media;the last 20 of them while working for </p><p>The Independent</p><p>. When I became a Westminster-based journalist in 1982, the remnants of a much more deferential age were still evident. The questions we asked were a little more probing than the \"is there anything you'd like to say today, prime minister?\" style of interrogation that was evident in the 1950s, when television news was launched. But the male-dominated club of parliamentary lobby journalists I joined was unnecessarily secretive. \"Maintain the mystique,\" one veteran political editor told me.</p><p>It was an open secret that the Downing Street press secretary - then Bernard Ingham for Margaret Thatcher - briefed the lobby daily. But we were not allowed to quote Number 10; such briefings had to be attributed to \"Whitehall sources\". The archaic system would eventually change, with </p><p>The Independent </p><p>among those championing reform after its launch in 1986.</p><p>The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always there</p><p>The lobby has many critics. Yet if it was scrapped today, it would re-emerge in a different guise tomorrow; politicians and the media need each other, and they need to talk, however strained the relationship. The lobby is not perfect, and still too dominated by men. But some criticism is overdone. Conspiracy theorists on the left recently claimed the existence of a Press Gallery WhatsApp group showed how the lobby pack agrees the line to take on stories. At the time, the group was discussing smelly towels left in the showers and the price of crisps in our canteen.</p><p>Much is also made of anonymous briefings by politicians and their advisers. But if these were abolished and all statements were on the record, many would be so bland as to be worthless. It is the journalist's job to find out what's going on; people are more willing to talk without having their names attached to a quote: such discussions will always take place. Jeremy Corbyn's team often relies on such briefings. Do spin doctors abuse this system and lie? Occasionally, but less than you might think; journalists have long memories and won't believe them next time if they get caught.</p><p>The inevitable \"poacher versus gamekeeper\" relationship between media and politicians has changed markedly during my time at Westminster - and it's changed for the worse, with both sides being to blame. The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always there. When I joined the lobby, old hands told me: \"Right-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to the Conservative Party. And left-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to... the Conservative Party as well!\"</p><p>Andrew Grice on 'Double Take': 'I can barely remember a party in such a bad state as the Tories'</p><p>What's shifted is that some national newspapers have crossed a line, becoming players on the political stage rather than impartial analysts. The dividing line between news and comment has become blurred, and in some cases invisible. It was as if the papers, hit by declining circulations - which fell from a combined 14.8 million in 1983 to 5.9 million last year - decided to shout louder to grab people's attention. The launch from 1989 of the 24-hour television news channels - first Sky, then a BBC offering - meant the papers were no longer first with the news, and sometimes became more focused on infotainment than information.</p><p>The growing influence of TV and the decline of newspapers was made clear when the UK belatedly held its first televised election debates between party leaders at the 2010 general election. The debates dominated press coverage; as soon as one debate ended, the papers previewed the next. Nevertheless, the political spin doctors continue to fret 24/7 about what the papers say, because they often still set the broadcasters' agenda.</p><p>Some elements of the press, particularly on the right, have given news an opinionated twist, and has become less reliable as a result. There's no doubt that hostile, often inaccurate, coverage of the European Union - and underreporting about the benefits of membership - played a critical role in the decision to hold the 2016 referendum; and in the result.</p><p>By then (if not before), some papers had crossed a line between healthy scepticism about politics and its practitioners to unhealthy cynicism. In 2009, </p><p>The Daily Telegraph</p><p> was absolutely right to expose abuses of the MPs' expenses system but there has been a feeding frenzy ever since: a misleading presumption that MPs are in it for themselves. In my view, this has gone too far, fuelling in turn public cynicism and a lack of trust in politicians - though it's also true to say they contributed to this by trying to spin their way out of troubles they had made themselves.</p><p>The exposure of </p><p>MPs</p><p>' expenses claims, including for Peter Viggers' infamous duck house, had a huge impact on public trust(AP)</p><p>At the 1992 election, Neil Kinnock, a modernising Labour leader, faced a barrage of highly personal abuse and criticism in the Tory tabloids. </p><p>The Sun</p><p>'s front page on polling day declared that if Kinnock won, \"will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?\" </p><p>The Sun</p><p> claimed to have \"won it\" when the Conservatives were re-elected but the truth was that Rupert Murdoch liked to back the winner (and be seen to have done so) to maximise his influence.</p><p>Scarred by Kinnock's treatment, Tony Blair made a sea change when he became Labour leader two years later. He told me: \"I'm not going to let them do to me what they did to Neil. Never again.\" In Blair's view, that meant supping with the devil. He flew halfway round the world to address a conference held by Murdoch in Australia. Blair once said: \"It is better to ride the back of a tiger than let it rip your throat out.\"</p><p>The cosying up was accompanied by a much more aggressive response to negative media reports about Labour - there would be a \"rapid rebuttal\" or even \"pre-buttal\" when the party got wind of a potentially damaging story. New Labour spin doctors put pressure on journalists, with threats such as \"you'll never get another interview or exclusive if you write this\"; they complained behind reporters' backs to their editor, occasionally even demanding their removal.They doled out exclusive stories to favoured journalists or papers, though there was nothing new in that.</p><p>Blair's \"hug them close\" strategy worked, at least in opposition. </p><p>The Sun</p><p>, the country's biggest selling paper, came out for Labour at the 1997 election (which it was bound to win in any event). In government though, New Labour became too eager to please its media enemies-turned-friends. Lance Price, who was deputy to Alastair Campbell, Blair's communications director, said \"no major decision could be taken by the government without first assessing the reaction of three people\":Gordon Brown, the chancellor; John Prescott, the deputy prime minister; and Murdoch.</p><p>Neil Kinnock, seen here in 1985, was treated mercilessly by the right-wing tabloids(Getty)</p><p>Spin had its limitations of course. Headline-grabbing works in opposition, when the media is your main weapon; but in power, New Labour discovered that headlines were no substitute for policy or action. Spin would also, in the end, contribute to Blair's demise; and help to tarnish his legacy. In 2003, he discovered that you cannot spin the case for war, when it is based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.</p><p>As papers like </p><p>The Sun</p><p> tired of Blair and reverted to type, he launched an attack on the \"feral beasts\" of the media in one of his last speeches as prime minister. I sat in the front row, appalled that he bizarrely singled out </p><p>The Independent</p><p> for criticism when his real target was the </p><p>Daily Mail</p><p>; he was still too frightened of its power to say so.</p><p>David Cameron copied the New Labour playbook when he began modernising the Conservatives on becoming their leader in 2005. Mirroring Blair's trip to Australia, Cameron flew to the Google Zeitgeist conference in San Francisco in 2007, symbolically paying homage to the new power in the media world.Cameron, who called Blair \"the master\", faithfully adopted his top-down, centralised approach to media management, and imported it into government in 2010. The cosy relationship between leading figures in the government and media was highlighted again during the Leveson inquiry after the phone-hacking scandal.</p><p>Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known...</p><p>When Theresa May succeeded Cameron after his ill-fated EU referendum in 2016 she set out to do everything differently. That included moving away from a rigid day-to-day \"grid\" of centrally controlled initiatives designed to allow the government to set the agenda. May tried to curb headline-grabbing stunts, and focus on fewer, bigger statements. It was an honest attempt to combat spin, but didn't work in a digital age when the battle between government and media (and between parties, and even between factions within parties) had become ever faster and more frenetic. However, it is doubtful whether any administration could dictate the agenda while Brexit eclipses everything.</p><p>May's disastrous snap election last year would prove a watershed for the press. Right-wing papers reprised their 1992 treatment of Kinnock to target Corbyn, but this time - refreshingly - it didn't work. In the age of the insurgent, already exploited by Trump and the Brexiteers, social media helped Corbyn bypass the mainstream media (the hated \"MSM\" in Corbynland). Friends sharing pro-Labour stories on Facebook and other social platforms proved a powerful weapon. Labour's machine outgunned the Tories, diluting the impact of the right-leaning press.</p><p>Jeremy Corbyn has effectively bypassed the 'mainstream media' (</p><p>AFP</p><p>/Getty)</p><p>However, it remains to be seen whether the old media has really been replaced by new media which, despite the early optimism about \"digital democracy\" during Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, seems actually to undermine rather than enhance democracy. In those days of hope, I didn't imagine Trump tweeting from the White House at 5am about the \"fake news media\" and journalists who are \"the enemy of the people\".</p><p>Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known - no coincidence when filter bubbles create echo chambers that reinforce our own views. The abuse hurled around on Twitter, between fellow party members as well as opponents, is nasty, often misogynistic and sometimes racist. It scars our politics.</p><p>* * *</p><p>At the 2017 election, parties spent more than 40 per cent of their advertising budgets online. During the EU referendum, Vote Leave devoted 98 per cent of its ad spend to digital, much on highly targeted \"dark\" ads which no one but the recipients could see. It ran a last-minute blitz claiming falsely: \"Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU. Our schools and hospitals already can't cope!\"</p><p>The social media ads used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented</p><p>Tom Baldwin</p><p>The tech giants have been slow to put their house in order, and politicians slow to force them. While claiming to be platforms rather than publishers, they have often paid little tax in countries where they made vast profits. They have demolished the economic model of newspapers by gobbling up much of their advertising revenue. Some 300 local papers have closed in the UK in the past 10 years, undermining democracy at local leve</p><p>Politicians want to sound modern and offer a vision of the future. But Tom Baldwin, a former political journalist who was Ed Miliband's communications director, believes they do not understand the new technology and are afraid to regulate the new giants roaming the media landscape. In a revealing and thoughtful new book covering politics on both sides of the Atlantic, </p><p>Ctrl Alt Delete</p><p>, published by Hurst, Baldwin argues that the new information age \"has unpicked truth and hollowed out space for a virulent new strain of populism to spread like a contagion across all forms of media\". He says: \"The social media ads that were used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented.\"</p><p>What, then, needs to be done? The government plans to require an imprint showing the identity of those running digital ads, and a new offence of intimidating parliamentary candidates and party campaigners. But it will need to go much further to ensure a system ofelectoral law brought in for an analogue era is fit for a fast-evolving digital age.</p><p>Regulators such as the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner need more powers, resources and tougher penalties. They could be funded by a levy on the tech giants. There should be a statutory code of practice covering the use of personal data by political campaigns. All political ads should be published in some sort of central register so that everyone can see them. In election periods, ads should be limited to registered campaigns, following evidence of Russian interference in the last US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.</p><p>There is rising political support for a ban on online political ads, to bring the internet into line with broadcast media. It extends from Baldwin on the left to William Hague, the former Tory leader, on the right. This would help to stop those with the deepest pockets enjoying an unfair advantage, but would not prevent videos being shared.</p><p>For a government consumed by Brexit, such reforms might not look like a priority. But with growing evidence that our democracy is under threat, the task is urgent.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-48273447</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TGT-TJ71-JCJY-G23C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2605\"/><timeReceived>10:58 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 14, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Two top politicians have set their sights on the Internet giants. One is an old acquaintance for Google and Co: Margrethe Vestager, one of the three Executive Vice-Presidents of the EU Commission, has gained a worldwide reputation as a tough fighter against anti-competitive practices and tax saving models of US corporations during the past five years as Commissioner for Competition. In the past two years it has imposed fines of around eight billion euros on Google alone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vestager is now getting support from another political heavyweight in the fight against US tech companies: Thierry Breton, the super-commissioner for the internal market, industry and defence. The manager and politician proposed for the post by French President Emmanuel Macron threatens to become the second European fear opponent for the Internet companies. As a former French Minister of Economy and Finance, Breton not only has political experience, he has also managed large corporations from the first stock exchange league in the past: The former state monopolist France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, for example, which is now called Orange, or most recently the IT consulting firm Atos.</p><p>Breton and Vestager will present next Wednesday how the EU Commission's digital policy should look in the coming years: This includes an Artificial Intelligence Strategy, which defines rules for the safe and ethical use of this future technology, as well as a European Data Strategy. The Authority's internal drafts for both strategies are available to WELT. And the deliberations have it in them. \"At the moment, a small number of big tech companies hold a large part of the world's data,\" says the draft European Data Space, for example. The authors allude to the fact that large US digital companies currently dominate the data business and that US companies are leaders in the cloud services business.</p><p> \"If Europe wants to take a leading role in the data economy, it must act now,\" the paper says. For example, the Commission intends to examine whether large Internet platforms such as Amazon, Facebook and Google, which collect huge amounts of data on their users, can be prevented from using this data to further increase their lead in the business over smaller European competitors. For example, Breton wants to have a review of how the exchange of data between companies can be advanced. This could also include obliging companies such as Google to share their data treasures. The Commission is examining how Google and Facebook collect and use data.</p><p>The data strategy is close to Breton's heart: he personally insisted on it with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to the Commission. In a long conversation, he had convinced von der Leyen that there was little point in regulating artificial intelligence if the handling of data was not regulated. Promptly the data strategy also appeared in the second version of his official work order.</p><p>The engineer Breton, who wrote books about the information age 30 years ago, is concerned that European companies should be able to access similarly large amounts of data as their American or Chinese competitors in order to refine their algorithms and business models. Data of Europeans should also be stored and processed to protect citizens in Europe.</p><p>Meanwhile, the search engine giant is threatened with further disaster on the cartel front: companies and associations in the travel industry, including industry giants such as Expedia and TripAdvisor, have written an open letter to Vestager, accusing Google of favouring its own new service Google Holiday Homes in the search results of the general Google search and thereby ousting other, sometimes more relevant, providers from the results.</p><p>Two years ago, the Commission had already imposed a \u20ac2.4 billion fine on Google in a similar case because the company preferred the results of its own price comparison service when searching. Google is suing against these and other penalties at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, where the hearing began on Wednesday. The verdict is expected in a few months. If the judges agree with the commission, this should strengthen Breton and Vestager in their fight against the online giants.</p><p>Note: This article has been translated automatically.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVWE20200213DWBEHPWIRTSCHAFTQE65DG442TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DIEWEN-169441119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIEWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6D-T141-DY2B-S3H1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465485</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Axel Springer SE All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Die Welt (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12658\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>No. 37</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

How far will the government go to rein in a service that's perhaps four or five times bigger than Twitter? It depends on how frightened officials are of China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Washington, D.C., the company that makes TikTok is getting its 15 seconds of fame, and it's probably hating every second of it.</p><p>TikTok, the smartphone app that features 15-second video clips set to pop music, bores the daylights out of me, but teens and young adults are all over it. TikTok has rung up between 200 million and half a billion users worldwide, depending on who you ask \u2014 its parent company, ByteDance, isn't especially transparent about such things.</p><p>Then again, ByteDance is based in China, a nation that's not much for transparency but has a real knack for censorship and privacy violations. Which is why the amazing success of TikTok is spooking the Trump administration and Congress.</p><p>The Internet was designed by people who took certain American values for granted \u2014 free speech, limits on government power, stuff like that. But China rejects these assumptions, to put it mildly. China routinely censors newspapers and Internet sites, TV shows and movies, and has put an estimated 1 million people in concentration camps just because they're Muslims.</p><p>And now for the first time, a Chinese company is operating a social media app that's massively popular in the United States. So what if ByteDance does business in accord with Chinese values?</p><p>What happens when an American TikTok user posts a video \u00addefending the pro-democracy \u00adprotesters in Hong Kong or calling for the independence of Taiwan? How long before such videos get taken down? Bad enough for the Chinese to censor their own citizens; with TikTok, they're now in a position to censor the rest of us.</p><p>ByteDance says it doesn't do this, and I had no trouble finding videos backing the Hong Kong protesters. But earlier this week, The Washington Post cited several former US TikTok workers who said they fought losing battles against the head office in Beijing over the removal of videos with controversial political content, or even of people kissing.</p><p>Or what's to stop TikTok from sharing its vast amounts of data about American users with China's government, for use in spying on our citizens? In February, the company paid a $5.7 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission for illegally capturing sensitive information about children under age 13. ByteDance has vowed to sin no more, but can we trust TikTok?</p><p>We've just seen an example of how far a foreign government might go to obtain social media data. On Wednesday, the Justice Department indicted two former employees of Twitter for stealing data at the behest of Saudi Arabia, who used the information to spy on opponents of the regime. It's easy to imagine China making similar demands of ByteDance. And under a law issued last year, all Chinese Internet companies must hand over data on demand to the government.</p><p>ByteDance says its files on adult Americans are stored in the United States, out of reach of China's government. But if Beijing demanded copies of the data, would ByteDance executives dare to refuse?</p><p>Congress is paying attention. On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the US tech industry's links to China. Apple and TikTok were on the agenda, but neither showed up. It wasn't a good look.</p><p>Meanwhile, GOP Senator Marco Rubio has called for an investigation into the deal that spawned \u00adTikTok in the first place. In 2017, ByteDance acquired Musical.ly, a Shanghai video app maker that mostly catered to the US market. At the time, US regulators didn't \u00adobject. But Rubio now wants the \u00adacquisition reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, an agency that can veto deals that might undermine US national security.</p><p>It's possible that the Musical.ly deal could be undone. In 2016, Chinese-based company Beijing Kunlun Tech bought a majority stake in Grindr, a popular gay dating app. Two years later, Kunlun bought the rest of the company. But at about the same time, US lawmakers, including Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward Markey, warned that Grindr is stuffed full of sensitive data about its users \u2014 data that should never be available to the Chinese government.</p><p>In the end, CFIUS ordered Kunlun to divest Grindr by June 2020, either by selling it to a company based outside of China, or by issuing its stock to the public. But now there are reports that CFIUS is indeed investigating TikTok, on national security concerns. How far will the government go to rein in a service that's perhaps four or five times bigger than Twitter? I suppose it depends on how frightened officials are of China.</p><p>A piece in Politico argues that this is all good news for domestic titans such as Facebook and Google, which can pose as defenders of US liberty instead of fending off demands that they be broken up. But why should they get off the hook?</p><p>Facebook, Twitter, and Google's YouTube service are often accused of censoring controversial content, often without any clear explanation. At a time when Americans depend on these services to express themselves, surely we're owed maximum freedom to publish what we want, along with fair, transparent standards for banning the stuff that goes too far.</p><p>As for scooping up all our data without regard to privacy, American companies invented the idea and keep pushing it to new extremes. Google's parent company, Alphabet, recently announced a plan to buy Fitbit, the maker of digital health monitoring devices. It's not enough for Alphabet to track our Web searches or use the location chip in our Android phones to track our movements. Now they want to record our heartbeats as well.</p><p>I can't imagine why US antitrust authorities would let the Fitbit deal go through. About all you can say in its favor is that our medical data won't end up in China.</p><p>Hiawatha Bray can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hiawatha.bray@globe.com\">hiawatha.bray@globe.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-4247090e-0005-11ea-b998-3e45e65632b9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFS-FS21-JC2G-C193-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1026\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, started encouraging Fortnite\u2019s mobile-app users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google. The companies require that they handle all such app payments, so they can collect a 30 percent commission, a policy that has been at the center of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html\">antitrust complaints</url> against the companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hours later, Apple responded, removing the Fortnite app from its App Store.</p><p>\u201cEpic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cWe will make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return Fortnite to the App Store.\u201d</p><p>Within an hour, Epic opened a multifront war against Apple that appeared months in the making.</p><p>First, it sued Apple in federal court, accusing the company of violating antitrust laws by forcing developers to use its payment systems.</p><p>\u201cApple\u2019s removal of Fortnite is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100% monopoly over the\u201d market for in-app payments on iPhones, Epic said in its 62-page lawsuit.</p><p>Then Epic rolled out a sophisticated public-relations campaign that depicted Apple, one of the industry\u2019s most image-conscious companies, as the stodgy old guard trying to stifle the upstart. To do so, it used Apple\u2019s own imagery against it, mimicking Apple\u2019s iconic \u201c1984\u201d ad from its own fight against IBM 36 years ago. This time, Fortnite characters were defying Apple\u2019s totalitarian regime. Within hours, #FreeFortnite was the top trend on Twitter.</p><p>Later on Thursday, Google also removed the Fortnite app from its official Android app store, the Google Play Store, saying the app violated Google\u2019s policies. Epic replied with a similar lawsuit.</p><p>Apple\u2019s confrontation with Epic has much higher stakes than Google\u2019s because Fortnite remains available for Android devices. Google\u2019s Android software allows people to download apps outside Google\u2019s app store, unlike Apple\u2019s approach with iPhones, and Epic had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html\">added Fortnite to the Play store</url> only in April.</p><p>In Epic, Apple has met arguably its toughest adversary in years. The game maker has calculated exactly how to hit Apple where it hurts: by making iPhones less attractive and Apple less cool.</p><p>Epic, a North Carolina company that is valued at roughly $17 billion and is partly owned by the Chinese internet giant Tencent, now appears poised to sacrifice millions of dollars in revenue in a fight that will keep Fortnite off iPhones. That immediately makes Apple\u2019s flagship devices far less attractive to millions of people across the world \u2014 just ahead of Apple\u2019s most prominent iPhone introduction in years.</p><p>Apple, on the verge of a $2 trillion valuation as its stock has soared in recent weeks, now faces a battle with one of its most lucrative partners over a crucial issue for antitrust regulators investigating the power of Big Tech.</p><p>How Apple polices the App Store has drawn intense scrutiny over the past year. App developers have complained that Apple is taking an unfair cut of their business while, in many cases, also competing with their apps with its own offerings.</p><p>European regulators, Justice Department officials and state attorneys general are all investigating Apple\u2019s control over the App Store, and House lawmakers interrogated Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, on the issue in a hearing last month. Google has faced more scrutiny for other issues, in large part because of its more liberal app policy on Android.</p><p>For Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, there are few easy options. Apple has largely staked its future on its services business, which has become its second-largest source of revenue after sales of the iPhone, at $51.7 billion over the past year. But that business is mostly built on its cut of other apps\u2019 sales, so enforcing its 30 percent commission is crucial to keeping its business growing.</p><p>As a result, backing down to Epic would set a dangerous precedent for Apple, while standing up to the gaming company would prolong a fight that risks shrinking its iPhone sales and damaging its carefully crafted image.</p><p>In practical terms, kicking Fortnite out of the App Store means that new users will not be able to download the app, but it will continue to work on iPhones that already have the app installed. Yet Epic now cannot update the Fortnite app, meaning it will eventually become obsolete as Apple updates the iPhone software.</p><p>For Android users, there will be much less of an impact; they can still download Fortnite from Epic\u2019s website. As a result, hordes of Fortnite fans could now favor Google\u2019s devices over Apple\u2019s.</p><p>Suing Apple, in particular, serves two goals for Epic: winning in legal court and winning in the court of public opinion, said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust at Vanderbilt Law School. Epic is more likely to succeed in the latter, she said. \u201cThere is growing business pressure against Apple,\u201d she said, noting an antitrust case would be more complicated and difficult to win.</p><p>Fortnite has become an enormous enterprise, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html\">announced in May</url> that it had more than 350 million registered players. The game generated $1.8 billion in revenue last year, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html\">analysis firm SuperData</url>.</p><p>Since March 2018, Fortnite\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 133 million times on iPhones and iPads and brought in roughly $1.2 billion, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Apple has taken $360 million of that revenue as part of its commission, Sensor Tower said.</p><p>On Android devices, people have been much more likely to download Fortnite from outside Google\u2019s Play Store. Since April, Fortnite\u2019s app has been downloaded 11 million times on the Play Store and generated about $10 million in sales, according to Sensor Tower. Google took about $3 million of that.</p><p>\u201cEpic could likely have worked out a privileged deal with Apple \u2014 as other big tech companies have,\u201d said Matthew Ball, the managing partner at Epyllion Industries, which operates a venture capital fund. \u201cInstead, it is fighting for the marketplace.\u201d</p><p>Apple has had a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html\">series of recent spats</url> with app makers. The music service Spotify has complained to regulators in Europe and the United States. Blix, which makes an email app that competes with Apple&amp;#39;s service, also sued Apple on antitrust grounds last year. And last week, Microsoft ended a pilot of its mobile gaming app and Facebook watered down its gaming app on iPhones because of Apple\u2019s rules.</p><p>Apple has said that all app developers are subject to the same rules, and that its commission is fair. Apple has argued that it spends billions of dollars on the App Store and iPhone technology, creating business opportunities for companies like Epic.</p><p>\u201cEpic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have benefited from the App Store ecosystem, including its tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all developers,\u201d Apple said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThe fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users.\u201d</p><p>In past disputes that led to bad publicity, Apple<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html\">tweaked its rules</url> to let <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/apple-app-store-european-union-antitrust.html\">complaining app developers back into the App Store</url>. But Epic\u2019s fights appears to be about more than just its app.</p><p>In 2018, Epic released its own app store, and began charging developers 12 percent. Tim Sweeney, the chief executive and founder of Epic, said in an interview last month that the Epic Games Store had processed more than $1 billion in transactions. Even with the lower fee, he said, Epic still makes a profit of 5 to 7 percent.</p><p>Mr. Sweeney said that he felt obligated to \u201cmake this industry a better and fairer place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s critical to the future of humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise you have these corporations who control all commerce and all speech.\u201d</p><p>PHOTOS: Fans and competitors at the Fortnite World Cup in New York last year.

Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, started encouraging Fortnite's mobile-app users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google. The companies require that they handle all such app payments so they can collect a 30 per cent commission, a policy that has been at the centre of antitrust complaints against the companies.</p><p>Hours later, Apple responded, removing the Fortnite app from its App Store.</p><p>Within an hour, Epic sued Apple in federal court, accusing the company of violating antitrust laws by forcing developers to use its payment systems.</p><p>\"Apple's removal of Fortnite is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100 per cent monopoly over the\" market for in-app payments on iPhones, Epic said in its 62-page lawsuit.</p><p>Then, Epic rolled out a sophisticated public-relations campaign that depicted Apple, one of industry's most image-conscious companies, as the stodgy old guard trying to stifle the upstart.</p><p>Later Thursday, Google also removed the Fortnite app from its official Android app store, the Google Play Store, saying the app violated Google's policies. Epic replied with a similar lawsuit.</p><p>Apple now faces a battle with one of its most lucrative partners over a crucial issue for antitrust regulators investigating the power of Big Tech.</p><p>How Apple polices the App Store has drawn intense scrutiny over the past year. App developers have complained that Apple is taking an unfair cut of their business while, in many cases, also competing with their apps with its own offerings.</p><p>In practical terms, kicking Fortnite out of the App Store means that new users will not be able to download the app, but it will continue to work on iPhones that already have the app installed. Yet Epic now cannot update the Fortnite app, meaning it will eventually become obsolete as Apple updates the iPhone software.</p><p>For Android users, there will be much less of an impact; they can still download Fortnite from Epic's website. As a result, hordes of Fortnite fans could now favour Google's devices over Apple's.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020081558617030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KN-YSH1-JBTY-W027-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"399\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Hours later, Apple responded, removing the Fortnite app from its App Store.</p><p>Within an hour, Epic sued Apple in federal court, accusing the company of violating antitrust laws by forcing developers to use its payment systems.</p><p>\"Apple's removal of Fortnite is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100 per cent monopoly over the\" market for in-app payments on iPhones, Epic said in its 62-page lawsuit.</p><p>Then, Epic rolled out a sophisticated public-relations campaign that depicted Apple, one of industry's most image-conscious companies, as the stodgy old guard trying to stifle the upstart.</p><p>Later Thursday, Google also removed the Fortnite app from its Android app store, the Google Play Store, saying the app violated Google's policies.

San Francisco: Apple and Google on Thursday pulled video game sensation Fortnite from their mobile app shops after its maker Epic Games released an update that dodges revenue sharing with the tech giants.    The latest version of Fortnite contains a payment system that lets player transactions bypass Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play, preventing the firms from collecting their typical 30 percent cut.    Apple, which does not allow users of its popular devices to download apps from anywhere but its App Store, booted the game from its online marketplace, followed later Thursday by Google.    Epic quickly filed a federal lawsuit against Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of wielding monopoly power.    The game-maker called on a federal judge to order Apple to stop its \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d and invalidate the tech giant\u2019s rules requiring app developers to pay the company 30 percent of transactions.    The suit said Epic is not seeking favorable treatment, but is asking the court to order Apple to change its commission structure for all developers.    Apple said Fortnite was pulled after \u201cEpic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users.\u201d    Google followed suit and removed Fortnite from its Play store for mobile devices powered by its Android software.    \u201cFor game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users,\u201d Google said in reply to an AFP inquiry.    Gamers will still be able to play Fortnite on their mobile devices, though Apple users will no longer be able to receive updates because those would need to come through the App Store.    Android users can still download updates directly from Epic.    Ruling the App Store    Apple has in recent months come under fire for the tight grip it has on the App Store, with the issue coming up during a heated congressional antitrust hearing last month.    \u201cApple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation,\u201d the lawsuit argued.    \u201cApple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear.\u201d    The Silicon Valley colossus has defended its position, saying its commission\u2014which can drop to 15 percent in the second year for subscriptions\u2014helps it keep apps and users safe from hackers and scammers.    \u201cEpic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines freely and we\u2019re glad they\u2019ve built such a successful business on the App Store,\u201d Apple said.    \u201cThe fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users.\u201d    Fortnite has been played by some 350 million people around the world since its release in 2017. Set in a virtual world, players must survive by searching for weapons and resources while eliminating competitors.    It is also a popular e-sports title in which spectators watch expert players compete, in some cases for cash prizes.    Epic is taking a \u201crisky and calculated path\u201d by going after Apple at a time that the App Store is under scrutiny by antitrust regulators, reasoned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.    \u201cThis is a high stakes game of poker being played,\u201d Ives said.    \u201cApple needs to make sure the Epic challenge, which is timely in light of anti-trust swirls and growing opposition to Big Tech within the Beltway, does not create a ripple impact which developers globally are watching carefully,\u201d Ives said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42834647680</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KF-NT91-F07F-80WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Asian Age</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, started encouraging Fortnite's mobile-app users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google. The companies require that they handle all such app payments, so they can collect a 30 percent commission, a policy that has been at the center of antitrust complaints against the companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Hours later, Apple responded, removing the Fortnite app from its App Store.</p><p>  ''Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines,'' Apple said in a statement. ''We will make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return Fortnite to the App Store.''</p><p>  Within an hour, Epic opened a multifront war against Apple that appeared months in the making.</p><p>  First, it sued Apple in federal court, accusing the company of violating antitrust laws by forcing developers to use its payment systems.</p><p>  ''Apple's removal of Fortnite is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100% monopoly over the'' market for in-app payments on iPhones, Epic said in its 62-page lawsuit.</p><p>  Then Epic rolled out a sophisticated public-relations campaign that depicted Apple, one of the industry's most image-conscious companies, as the stodgy old guard trying to stifle the upstart. To do so, it used Apple's own imagery against it, mimicking Apple's iconic ''1984'' ad from its own fight against IBM 36 years ago. This time, Fortnite characters were defying Apple's totalitarian regime. Within hours, #FreeFortnite was the top trend on Twitter.</p><p>  Later on Thursday, Google also removed the Fortnite app from its official Android app store, the Google Play Store, saying the app violated Google's policies. Epic replied with a similar lawsuit.</p><p>Apple's confrontation with Epic has much higher stakes than Google's because Fortnite remains available for Android devices. Google's Android software allows people to download apps outside Google's app store, unlike Apple's approach with iPhones, and Epic had added Fortnite to the Play store only in April.</p><p>  In Epic, Apple has met arguably its toughest adversary in years. The game maker has calculated exactly how to hit Apple where it hurts: by making iPhones less attractive and Apple less cool.</p><p>  Epic, a North Carolina company that is valued at roughly $17 billion and is partly owned by the Chinese internet giant Tencent, now appears poised to sacrifice millions of dollars in revenue in a fight that will keep Fortnite off iPhones. That immediately makes Apple's flagship devices far less attractive to millions of people across the world -- just ahead of Apple's most prominent iPhone introduction in years.</p><p>Apple, on the verge of a $2 trillion valuation as its stock has soared in recent weeks, now faces a battle with one of its most lucrative partners over a crucial issue for antitrust regulators investigating the power of Big Tech.</p><p>  How Apple polices the App Store has drawn intense scrutiny over the past year. App developers have complained that Apple is taking an unfair cut of their business while, in many cases, also competing with their apps with its own offerings.</p><p>  European regulators, Justice Department officials and state attorneys general are all investigating Apple's control over the App Store, and House lawmakers interrogated Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, on the issue in a hearing last month. Google has faced more scrutiny for other issues, in large part because of its more liberal app policy on Android.</p><p>  For Apple, the world's most valuable company, there are few easy options. Apple has largely staked its future on its services business, which has become its second-largest source of revenue after sales of the iPhone, at $51.7 billion over the past year. But that business is mostly built on its cut of other apps' sales, so enforcing its 30 percent commission is crucial to keeping its business growing.</p><p>  As a result, backing down to Epic would set a dangerous precedent for Apple, while standing up to the gaming company would prolong a fight that risks shrinking its iPhone sales and damaging its carefully crafted image.</p><p>  In practical terms, kicking Fortnite out of the App Store means that new users will not be able to download the app, but it will continue to work on iPhones that already have the app installed. Yet Epic now cannot update the Fortnite app, meaning it will eventually become obsolete as Apple updates the iPhone software.</p><p>  For Android users, there will be much less of an impact; they can still download Fortnite from Epic's website. As a result, hordes of Fortnite fans could now favor Google's devices over Apple's.</p><p>  Suing Apple, in particular, serves two goals for Epic: winning in legal court and winning in the court of public opinion, said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust at Vanderbilt Law School. Epic is more likely to succeed in the latter, she said. ''There is growing business pressure against Apple,'' she said, noting an antitrust case would be more complicated and difficult to win.</p><p>  Fortnite has become an enormous enterprise, and announced in May that it had more than 350 million registered players. The game generated $1.8 billion in revenue last year, according to analysis firm SuperData.</p><p>  Since March 2018, Fortnite's app has been downloaded more than 133 million times on iPhones and iPads and brought in roughly $1.2 billion, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Apple has taken $360 million of that revenue as part of its commission, Sensor Tower said.</p><p>  On Android devices, people have been much more likely to download Fortnite from outside Google's Play Store. Since April, Fortnite's app has been downloaded 11 million times on the Play Store and generated about $10 million in sales, according to Sensor Tower. Google took about $3 million of that.</p><p>  ''Epic could likely have worked out a privileged deal with Apple -- as other big tech companies have,'' said Matthew Ball, the managing partner at Epyllion Industries, which operates a venture capital fund. ''Instead, it is fighting for the marketplace.''</p><p>Apple has had a series of recent spats with app makers. The music service Spotify has complained to regulators in Europe and the United States. Blix, which makes an email app that competes with Apple's service, also sued Apple on antitrust grounds last year. And last week, Microsoft ended a pilot of its mobile gaming app and Facebook watered down its gaming app on iPhones because of Apple's rules.</p><p>Apple has said that all app developers are subject to the same rules, and that its commission is fair. Apple has argued that it spends billions of dollars on the App Store and iPhone technology, creating business opportunities for companies like Epic.</p><p>  ''Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have benefited from the App Store ecosystem, including its tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all developers,'' Apple said in a statement on Thursday. ''The fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users.''</p><p>  In past disputes that led to bad publicity, Apple tweaked its rules to let complaining app developers back into the App Store. But Epic's fights appears to be about more than just its app.</p><p>  In 2018, Epic released its own app store, and began charging developers 12 percent. Tim Sweeney, the chief executive and founder of Epic, said in an interview last month that the Epic Games Store had processed more than $1 billion in transactions. Even with the lower fee, he said, Epic still makes a profit of 5 to 7 percent.</p><p>  Mr. Sweeney said that he felt obligated to ''make this industry a better and fairer place.''</p><p>  ''It's critical to the future of humanity,'' he said. ''Otherwise you have these corporations who control all commerce and all speech.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Fans and competitors at the Fortnite World Cup in New York last year.

The latest version of Fortnite contains a payment system that lets player transactions bypass Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play, preventing the firms from collecting their typical 30 percent cut.    Apple, which does not allow users of its popular devices to download apps from anywhere but its App Store, booted the game from its online marketplace, followed later Thursday by Google.    Epic quickly filed a federal lawsuit against Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of wielding monopoly power.    The game-maker called on a federal judge to order Apple to stop its \u201canti-competitive conduct\u201d and invalidate the tech giant\u2019s rules requiring app developers to pay the company 30 percent of transactions.    The suit said Epic is not seeking favorable treatment, but is asking the court to order Apple to change its commission structure for all developers.    Apple said Fortnite was pulled after \u201cEpic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users.\u201d    Google followed suit and removed Fortnite from its Play store for mobile devices powered by its Android software.    \u201cFor game developers who choose to use the Play Store, we have consistent policies that are fair to developers and keep the store safe for users,\u201d Google said in reply to an AFP inquiry.    Gamers will still be able to play Fortnite on their mobile devices, though Apple users will no longer be able to receive updates because those would need to come through the App Store.    Android users can still download updates directly from Epic.   Ruling the App Store   Apple has in recent months come under fire for the tight grip it has on the App Store, with the issue coming up during a heated congressional antitrust hearing last month.    \u201cApple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation,\u201d the lawsuit argued.    \u201cApple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear.\u201d    The Silicon Valley colossus has defended its position, saying its commission \u2014 which can drop to 15 percent in the second year for subscriptions \u2014 helps it keep apps and users safe from hackers and scammers.    \u201cEpic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines freely and we\u2019re glad they\u2019ve built such a successful business on the App Store,\u201d Apple said.    \u201cThe fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users.\u201d    Fortnite has been played by some 350 million people around the world since its release in 2017. Set in a virtual world, players must survive by searching for weapons and resources while eliminating competitors.    It is also a popular e-sports title in which spectators watch expert players compete, in some cases for cash prizes.    Epic is taking a \u201crisky and calculated path\u201d by going after Apple at a time that the App Store is under scrutiny by antitrust regulators, reasoned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.    \u201cThis is a high stakes game of poker being played,\u201d Ives said.    \u201cApple needs to make sure the Epic challenge, which is timely in light of anti-trust swirls and growing opposition to Big Tech within the Beltway, does not create a ripple impact which developers globally are watching carefully,\u201d Ives said.

First, Epic Games, the publisher of the popular online video game, introduced a direct payment option for mobile players \u2013 sidestepping the Apple App store and Google Play store payment methods, which nets each of those tech giants a cut of the revenue.   Apple and Google, subsequently, pulled the mobile game from their stores. Epic Games' answer? Suits filed against both companies describing each one's app store as anti-competitive and monopolistic.   How the confrontation plays out has massive implications for how \u2013 and who \u2013 consumers pay for apps such as games and streaming entertainment. \"This is a big deal,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, in a note to investors. \"Epic is challenging Apple's (and Google's) pricing within their stores and offering an alternative for users to get the same thing at a lower price.\"   Subscription overload?: Get ready for Apple's   TikTok: Trump orders app company to sell U.S. assets by 90 days, citing national security concerns  What is the argument?  Founded in 1991, Epic Games is well-known as the publisher of games such as Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade, as well as the Unreal Engine, which powers countless video games from Batman Arkham Asylum to Sea of Thieves.   Its free-to-play game Fortnite, released in September 2017, has become a hit with 350 million players across multiple gaming platforms including video game consoles, PCs, and Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. The game generated an estimated $2.4 billion in revenue in 2018 and $1.8 billion in 2019, according to SuperData, a Nielsen company.   Fortnite is free to play, but you can buy in-game currency called V-Bucks which is used to purchase new weapons, customized outfits and dances, or emotes , for their in-game personas. When players on Apple and Android devices spend, Apple and Google get a 30% cut of those sales.    Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has argued that the online marketplaces that sell games \u2013 Apple's App Store, the Google Play store and Valve's PC game store Steam \u2013take an unfair cut from game sales and in-game transactions.   Its new mobile payment system for Fortnite players on Android and iOS devices gives players a discount compared to buying through the Apple and Google apps. As of Thursday, players could choose to purchase 1,000 V-Bucks directly from Epic Games for $7.99 \u2013 the same price as on PCs or home video game consoles. Through Apple's App Store and Google Play, the same purchase costs $9.99.   It's not Epic's first move against what it considers higher-than-suitable charges. In December 2018, Epic opened its own online PC game download store, charging game makers 12% for sales, to compete with Steam, which also charges a 30% cut on sales.    \u201cIt\u2019s about economic efficiency when you have these stores sucking out a huge fraction of the profits from games,\" Sweeney told The Verge in April 2019. \"Valve, Apple, and Google make more profit through there storefront fees than the devs make off their own games.\u201d  Are app stores anti-competitive?  Not inherently. App stores serve as one-stop shopping for consumers for all kinds of applications including games. And the device you use allows you to make a choice on which marketplace to support.   Within the app stores, companies such as Apple and Google curate content and help connect game makers with consumers. \"There is value to that,\" Pachter says. \"Epic doesn't dispute the value, but thinks it's closer to 12% than to 30%.\"   Dan Niles, founding partner of AlphaOne Capital Partners, told CNBC  that Apple deserves payment for access to its App Store. \u201cI mean, I have a lot of issues with Apple, but the charges they put on the App Store is not one of them,\" he said. \"I mean, at the end of the day, Epic Games chose to be on the platform; those were the terms. If they didn\u2019t want to do it, they didn\u2019t have to, and they get a lot of benefit from being able to access Apple\u2019s 1.5 billion devices globally.\u201d  Does this mean higher or lower prices?  That depends. If you are currently a Fortnite player on Android or iOS through Epic's payment method, you are getting lower prices with that 20% discount. And Epic's prices on consoles and PCs apparently seem reasonable to the millions who pay for V-bucks on those platforms.   Developers such as Epic, the company argues in its suit against Apple, are forced to charge higher prices \"in order to pay Apple\u2019s app tax.''   Breaking Apple's hold on distribution \u2013 and giving developers access to iPhones directly \u2013 would lead to to lower prices, says Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director of Open Markets Institute. Tying arrangements, such as software for devices, require consumers to pay for a product that could be priced higher simply because the party \u2013 in this case, Apple \u2013 has certain power and leverage in the market, he says.   \u201cWhen firms such as Apple dominate a market, they decide who participates and on what terms,\" he said in a statement. \"Epic\u2019s lawsuit is an important move against Apple\u2019s monopoly in the sale of iPhone apps. The federal judiciary must enforce existing antitrust prohibitions, including the categorical ban on tying by firms with power, and open the app market for iPhone owners and app developers.\u201c   But an open market could lead to consumers paying another way \u2013 with less secure and less reliable apps \u2013 argues tech consultant and business advisor Shelly Palmer in a blog post . Apple and Google created online malls and they \"rent space to 3rd parties. The price is 30% of your sales. For that 'fee,' you are given access to millions of potential customers. There is no version of a mobile Fortnite without the app stores,\" he said. \"The app store guidelines basically ensure a level of quality control for end users.\"   Alex Kantrowitz, founder of the newsletter Big Technology, told CNBC that Apple should back down, and lower Epic's fee. \u201cRent collecting is bad for its business long term. So you have to decide as a business, do you want to make your money milking your asset or do you want to make your money innovating into the future?\u201d   In the end, whether prices go up or down will depend on how this standoff is resolved. Still, Pachter is doubtful that developers will reduce prices.   What happens when Fortnite gets an update later this month and current players cannot get the new content? Will their anger be directed at Apple and Google or Epic? And then, what will the response be?  When will this be resolved?  If the disputes play out in the courts, they could take a long time. The parties could come to a settlement.   And the threat of Congressional regulation on big tech \u2013 the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee two weeks ago  \u2013 could be enough for Apple to submit.   Apple, in the past, has made deals. It reduced how its cut from 30% to 15% after Spotify subscribers' first year. But Spotify still filed  an antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union last year, charging the \"Apple tax\" and other App Store measures hamper its growth.   During the April-June quarter, Apple \u2013 now valued at nearly $2 trillion \u2013 reported revenue from Services , which includes the App Store, Apple Music, iTunes movie rentals and iCloud online storage, of $13.1 billion, up from $11.4 billion a year ago.   Epic, which is private, is braced for battle. Earlier this month, it got $1.78 billion in investments, including $250 million from Sony to acquire a minority interest in Epic, boosting the company's valuation to $17.3 billion.   The influx, Sweeney said in an announcement of the funding, \"accelerates Epic\u2019s efforts to build a new kind of digital ecosystem using real-time 3D technology, services that connect hundreds of millions of people, and a digital storefront that offers a fair business model.\"   Follow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42851832379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M2-DWS1-JCSC-J0WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Greenville News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

It was A Day. Epic baited both Apple and Google into banning Fortnite from their respective app stores and did so with a full game plan in mind - including an in-game anti-Apple video event and two very public lawsuits.</p><p><br/>Beyond Epic, I have many tech topics to weigh in on from this week that I haven't had a chance to tackle because I've been working on our review and video for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra - hit me up if you have questions you'd like to see addressed in that.<br/>But before we get to the Battle Royale between these three companies, I can't not quickly talk about the Microsoft Duo. Holy wow that phone/not-a-phone looks really interesting but also looks like it might be overpriced and underpowered. I am decidedly on team \"specs don't tell the whole story\" but I am also on team \"better specs are a safer bet, especially when the thing costs $1399.\" Long story short: I love the idea of folding devices but the burden of proof is on Microsoft with this one. I absolutely cannot wait to review it.<br/>You are reading Processor, a newsletter about computers, software, and tech by Dieter Bohn.

Expect a long discussion on The Vergecast and articles from reporters on our tech and gaming crews. We have a page where you can see all the updates, too: Everything you need to know about Epic's fight against mobile app stores.<br/>For my part, I'm just going to give you a brief and very incomplete timeline of some of the relevant app store dramas that bought us to the point where the most important gaming company on the planet created a video parodying Apple's famous 1984 Superbowl commercial. I will start... earlier than you might expect.<br/>January 22nd, 1984: the national Super Bowl broadcast of Apple's famous Macintosh advertisement. It was a stunning, wildly influential ad. Directed by Ridley Scott, it told the story of a revolutionary upstart that was going to break the totalitarian rule of the monopolist behemoth who dominated the industry.<br/>\u00a0<br/>June, 2016: Apple very slightly changed its App Store rules to lower its cut on subscription apps from 30 percent to 15 percent after their first year. It was a moment when Apple finally started easing up, if only slightly, on the rules that give it a 30 percent cut on everything in the store.<br/>August 3rd, 2018: Epic took Fortnite off of the Google Play Store because it was angry about Google taking that same 30 percent cut. Epic was able to do this in the first place because Android, unlike iOS, allows people to install apps directly from any source. It just requires clicking \"OK\" on a bunch of relatively intimidating security warnings.<br/>\u00a0<br/>January 17th, 2020: the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing in Colorado about how big tech treats smaller companies in its orbit. Short answer: it's often a \"shakedown.\" Sonos (which is suing Google), PopSockets, Tile, and Basecamp all testify to having been kicked around by Apple in various ways.<br/>April 3rd, 2020: we learned that Apple had given Amazon a special deal that let it do things that other developers couldn't. Apple claimed it was \"an established program,\" but we all saw through it: Amazon got a deal because Amazon had leverage.<br/>April 21st, 2020: Fortnite returned to the Google Play Store. Turns out all those warnings about third party apps (and maybe the lack of easy discovery) was too much of a problem for Epic. Epic's CEO, Tim Sweeney, was pretty blunt about how unhappy he was that his app had to come back.<br/>June 16th, 2020: Basecamp's new email app, Hey, was rejected from the Apple App Store because it didn't offer a way to sign up directly on the iPhone - mainly so that it won't have to pay Apple's fee. Exactly one week later (just in time to keep it from ruining Apple's developer conference) a compromise was reached: Hey offered a kind of minimum functionality that let it sneak on to the App Store.<br/>Daily Steals is offering this phone for $450, which matches the lowest price that we've seen yet. To get this price, enter the code\u00a0VERGEONEP\u00a0in at the checkout page after you add one to your cart. This configuration of the 7 Pro, which features 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS 3.0 storage, was originally priced at $699, so you're saving 35 percent.<br/>This particular device supports GSM carriers only, including T-Mobile and AT&amp;T, but excluding Verizon.<br/>Vox Media has affiliate partnerships. These do not influence editorial content, though Vox Media may earn commissions for products purchased via affiliate links. For more information, see\u00a0our ethics policy. Prices displayed are based on the MSRP at time of posting.<br/>July 29th, 2020: the judiciary committee met again, calling in the CEOs of Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook over video conference. It went better than expected, if only because the committee displayed some semblance of technical knowledge. Still, it didn't create any enduring moments. In particular, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai didn't get pressured on App Store issues in any meaningful way.<br/>August 6th, 2020: Apple reiterated its policies surrounding streaming games platforms: not allowed. Microsoft, Google, and Facebook all would like to offer their streaming game services to iPhone users, but Apple insists that it get a cut on digital purchases and that it have the ability to directly review and list every game. Microsoft and Facebook issued condemnations of the policy.<br/>Alright, that's a lot of history. Believe me when I tell you it's very incomplete - there's a whole other Spotify timeline, European Union timeline, and Android timeline we could do here. Anyway, from this incomplete timeline, here are the key points you should remember as we digest yesterday's hijinks.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>First, there has been a lot of unhappiness related to Apple's monopoly over app distribution on the iPhone, and anger at both Apple and Google over their 30 percent cut. Developers are seeing an opportunity to push back.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>There's also been a general decline in trust and faith in big tech (duh).</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Finally, there's been growing interest from regulators to start enforcing some antitrust laws.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>...And now, welcome to August 13th, 2020. I assure you, all of the events below happened in a single day.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u250f Epic offers new direct payment in Fortnite on iOS and Android to get around app store fees. Epic straight up pushed a server side update to its app that wasn't reviewed by either Apple or Google. That's no-no number one. No-no number two is the big one, though: offering direct payments without giving Apple or Google a cut.<br/>You can already see the seeds of what's to come here. The move was blatant and it was also designed to curry favor with users, presenting the new options with a 20 percent discount. (Interestingly, not 30 percent, but also there are credit card fees and other issues that could account for that discrepancy. Arguing about it misses the point.)<br/>\u250f Apple just kicked Fortnite off the App Store. Apple stuck to its guns. Fortnite broke the rules, Fortnite is out.<br/>\u250f Epic will mock Apple's most iconic ad as possible revenge for Fortnite's App Store ban. It becomes obvious that the original direct payment option was a setup all along. Epic intends to make it a big issue and rally its fans to its cause.<br/>to be clear, I am quite confident that nobody was surprised by this move. I am sure that before it made the decision to kick the app out of the store, Apple knew Epic would do something like this.<br/>\u250f Epic Games is suing Apple. But did Apple know that Epic would sue? Who knows? There are two things to note about Epic's lawsuit:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>It starts with very readable, very passionate language about how Apple used to be good but now it's bad.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>It very carefully positions its anti-trust argument by saying that Apple has a monopoly over iOS distribution, not over all smartphones. The antitrust arguments for every big tech company tends to hinge on some question of \"market definition.\"</p></bodyText></listItem></list>\u250f Microsoft releases Surface Duo press event video with 30 minutes of demos. Yeah okay this has nothing to do with anything else, but it's worth watching. I love gadgets, what can I say?<br/>\u250f Watch Epic's Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite short mocking Apple right here. I cannot begin to express how savvy this video is. It mirrors Apple's famous anti-IBM commercial shot for shot. It re-contextualizes Apple as the bully. It ...tells the story of a revolutionary upstart that is going to break the totalitarian rule of the monopolist behemoth who dominates the industry.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u250f Epic rallies Fortnite players against Apple with a warning that they'll miss the next season. Of course, there is a hashtag. But also, there are real and immediate stakes. Apple and Google banned Fortnite from their stores, but they still work on every device they're already installed on. So a bunch of users might just shrug at this as a fight that will be over before it affects them. Epic is making even those people realize that this is a problem for them.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u250f Fortnite for Android has also been kicked off the Google Play Store. I have to be honest with you, I expected Google to just sit this one out and let Epic break the rules for a day or two. Nope. Late in the day, Google acted. It also pointed out that there are other ways you can install apps on Android. Not just side-loading, but via other stores.<br/>You know how back in the day Microsoft was happy Apple existed because then Microsoft could say it wasn't a total monopoly? That's exactly the vibe I get when Google talks about the Samsung Galaxy App Store.<br/>Sidenote! Both Epic and Microsoft are pointing users to Samsung's store. That's because they're apparently able to get their in-app purchases in without paying a 30 percent fee. What fee are they paying Samsung? Unclear - and Samsung did not return a request for comment.<br/>\u250f Epic is suing Google over Fortnite's removal from the Google Play Store. Epic had a lawsuit ready for Google too, but no video parody. Of course, it followed the same script as the Apple lawsuit. Google used to have this \"don't be evil\" motto, you see.<br/>\u250f Google forced OnePlus to decimate a Fortnite launcher deal, claims Epic Games. One tidbit in the Google lawsuit: we got another example of Google pushing around companies who might not want to put Google's services front and center on their phones out of the box. This seems like a small thing, but it's very close to the practice that made the EU slap a huge fine on Google and force it to use a browser ballot on Android.<br/>What have we learned? As I write this evening, I have a few very preliminary thoughts:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Apple and Google do not want to be pushed around by anybody, not even the most important game company today.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Apple and Google are so fabulously wealthy and powerful that maybe they're just too big to be pushed anyway.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Whether you like him or not, you have to admit that Epic CEO Tim Sweeney sure does know how to put on a show. No wonder Fortnite is so popular.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The backlash against app stores is real and growing.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Apple has largely managed to avoid being seen as a bully, but that perception could change.

Yet, during this period of technological disruption, financial services have continued to grow. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Banking has always been about technology. The 1970s brought us ATMs and credit cards, the 1980s, debit cards, and the 1990s, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3009748/hong-kongs-internet-banking-pioneer-says-it-will-stay-above-fray\">internet banking</url> and e-commerce. The pace of technological change has accelerated over the past decade or so, with the explosive growth of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1207989/grave-effect-smartphone-revolution\">smartphones</url> and the connectivity they bring, laying the groundwork for the development of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/1056521/asia-key-market-mobile-banking\">mobile banking</url>. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Smartphones seldom leave our grip these days, so the distance between customers and banks has been all but eliminated. Customers have come to expect personalised, interactive and instant services for every part of their lives, at their fingertips and at any time. </p><p>This altered landscape is the catalyst for a new generation of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2173270/fintech-ma-deals-set-grow-globally-over-next-two-years-according\">financial-technology</url> start-ups offering tailored services to specific market segments on digital platforms. The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/gadgets/article/3017364/apple-pay-alipay-wechat-pay-and-payme-put-test-find-out-which\">tech giants</url> have also been making bold moves in financial services. </p><p>This innovation has been encouraged by policymakers. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3020144/how-singapore-plans-create-city-future-and-reinvigorate\">Singapore</url>, Australia and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/presented/business/topics/uk-hong-kong-fintech-bridge/article/3003795/why-uks-flourishing-fintech\">Britain</url>, regulators are fostering advancements in fintech by setting up sandboxes to test scenarios. </p><p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched a series of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2100298/plenty-chatter-and-even-some-action-hong-kong-makes-progress-fintech\">initiatives</url> such as opening up its fintech supervisory sandbox to technology firms, the open Application Programming Interface, which allows banks to tap into a global community, and the Faster Payment System, a real-time payment platform. It has also issued licences for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/3004533/virtual-banking-calls-innovation-new-talented-players\">virtual banking</url>. </p><p>But to say that the fintech boom is cannibalising traditional banking would be an exaggeration. </p><p>Most fintech newcomers are entering niche segments of the wider financial industry. They primarily provide innovative financial services targeted at retail businesses, from payments solutions and online banking to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/1450259/hong-kongs-first-p2p-online-lender-expand-asia\">peer-to-peer lending</url>. </p><p>This new wave of technological development has not revolutionised the financial landscape. Financial institutions remain dominant players and continue to welcome this advancement. </p><p>Major banks are already increasing their investment in technology and immersing themselves in digital innovation. This includes changing the culture and mindset of employees, revamping information technology systems, and developing innovative tools such as mobile payment solutions, automation of processes and biometrics. </p><p>On top of this, banks are incorporating advancements in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2152968/hang-seng-bank-relax-loans-rules-using-big-data-and-fintech\">big data</url> analysis and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2186508/citi-turns-ai-early-work-approval-corporate-loans-and\">artificial intelligence</url> to better understand and service their customers' needs, preferences and expectations. </p><p>Most of HSBC's customers are now comfortable using smartphones for financial transactions. Over 80 per cent of our global retail banking transactions occur through digital channels. Our <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2152334/payme-app-comes-e-commerce-platform-hktvmall-hsbcs-first-foray\">PayMe</url> service, a peer-to-peer payment system for Hong Kong, has over 1.6 million users making millions of transactions per month. </p><p>In addition, banks also bring emerging technologies to the trade world in ways that will reduce paper-based processes and support clients' day-to-day activities. They are substituting automation for repetitive tasks, using <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2140428/hsbc-spends-us23b-digital-platforms-ai-and-new-technology\">optical character recognition</url> to scan trade finance documents,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2142997/bank-china-embracing-blockchain-use-hong-kong\">blockchain</url> to reduce trade friction and making trade more accessible. </p><p>This will help speed up, simplify and reduce risk in the US$9.48 trillion of annual global merchandise trade. </p><p>It is critical for the long-term competitiveness of the banks to keep investing in technology. But banks should also focus on developing and deploying technologies that meet their customers' needs and demands. And that is why we are seeing the ecosystem of incumbent banks, big tech companies and fintechs develop in a healthy and constructive way. </p><p>If the first wave of fintech was primarily about providing existing services more easily, quickly and efficiently, then the next wave is going to be about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/money/article/3009314/chinese-fintech-firms-cosy-banks-collaborators-instead-disrupters\">greater collaboration</url> and partnership between tech companies and banks. </p><p>Fintech start-ups will benefit from incumbent banks' strengths: brand recognition, established customer bases, strong balance sheets, regulatory experience, and physical branches with human interaction, which will remain a critical part of banking. </p><p>Meanwhile, traditional banks stand to gain from the out-of-the-box thinking, market intelligence and technical expertise that are the hallmarks of nimble, innovative start-ups. </p><p>As the financial services industry expands its digital footprint, its risk profile is bound to broaden. Digitalisation can also create more vulnerability to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2185782/hong-kong-banks-must-step-cybersecurity-protect-customers-data\">cyberattacks</url>. Banks, fintech start-ups and government all need robust ethical controls throughout data supply chains to be certain they can balance the risks and benefits of data technology. </p><p>The good news is that there is a growing expectation in political, regulatory and public spheres that businesses should have these <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/commodities/article/2157700/ethics-and-pursuit-artificial-intelligence\">frameworks</url> in place to protect customers and maintain effective, competitive markets as big data and AI develop. </p><p>Banks are no stranger to technological innovation, filled with challenges and disruption, while presenting great opportunities. We know we still have a long way to go, but we have long adapted our core business and kept with the times. This fintech wave is no different. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Wong is deputy chairman and chief executive of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2019.

Jeff Fortenberry, R-Nebraska, issued the following column:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last year, I sent a letter to search engine giant Google, challenging them to maintain proper protections for children's online privacy. I was inspired by twenty-three child and privacy advocacy groups, who, in April, 2018, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) arguing that Google's YouTube online video and advertising network systematically collected data on the online habits of tens of millions of children under the age of 13 and sold that data to marketers in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p><p>This week, Google and its subsidiary YouTube agreed to pay a record $170 million to settle allegations that YouTube illegally collected personal data on children without parental consent. While a $170 million fine is a drop in the bucket to Google, it is ten times larger than all previous COPPA fines combined.</p><p>To maintain its online search, advertising, and media dominance, Google collects vast amounts of data on our preferences, our friends' preferences, and the sites we visit, while monitoring our daily conversations. By last measure, the market cap of Google was over $800 billion.</p><p>To be fair, we agreed to Google's Faustian bargain: Our privacy in exchange for their promise of convenience. We did not, however, give Google permission to track and monetize our children. You'd think that Google would implicitly understand this. It seems to be in the nature of monopolies' chase for quarterly profit, however, to lose sight of protections for the people they are intending to serve. This might be due to a fundamental misunderstanding of capitalism itself.</p><p>In his signature book, The Wealth of Nations, \"the father of capitalism,\" Adam Smith, articulated how free-market capitalism operates through an \"invisible hand\" to lift all boats. You may not have heard of Smith's other major work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In it, the famed Scottish economist and philosopher articulated the necessary pre-condition of humane values essential to a properly functioning market. All over the world, we see examples of capitalism devoid of Smith's moral sentiments.</p><p>In our American experience, we naturally accept that the private market system accelerates possibility and opportunity for human well-being and flourishing. We also recognize that the \"free\" market can be distorted, manipulated, stacked, unfair. Herein lies the tension. As some economists have noted, in the long run, the market takes care of all problems. The famous economist John Maynard Keynes retorted: Yes, but, in the long run, we are all dead. Thus, a regulating moral force (properly informed government) is needed to ensure that the market operates fairly.</p><p>Healthy competition births innovation. To its credit, Google won the public's trust in the free marketplace of ideas, not through stifled competition. Like the robber barons of old, however, Google lost sight of the Smithian sentiment of \"sympathy,\" which keeps Smithian \"self-interest\" in check. In the robber baron era, children were exploited through factory sweatshops. While it is more subtle and sanitized, in today's big tech era, a new form of monopolistic exploitation of children has emerged: the tracking of their online behavior for profit.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6846441 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6846441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0J-K8C1-JC11-10B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><timeReceived>8:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 6, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Jeff Fortenberry:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last year, I sent a letter to search engine giant Google, challenging them to maintain proper protections for children's online privacy. I was inspired by twenty-three child and privacy advocacy groups, who, in April, 2018, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) arguing that Google's YouTube online video and advertising network systematically collected data on the online habits of tens of millions of children under the age of 13 and sold that data to marketers in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p><p>This week, Google and its subsidiary YouTube agreed to pay a record $170 million to settle allegations that YouTube illegally collected personal data on children without parental consent. While a $170 million fine is a drop in the bucket to Google, it is ten times larger than all previous COPPA fines combined.</p><p>To maintain its online search, advertising, and media dominance, Google collects vast amounts of data on our preferences, our friends' preferences, and the sites we visit, while monitoring our daily conversations. By last measure, the market cap of Google was over $800 billion.</p><p>To be fair, we agreed to Google's Faustian bargain: Our privacy in exchange for their promise of convenience. We did not, however, give Google permission to track and monetize our children. You'd think that Google would implicitly understand this. It seems to be in the nature of monopolies' chase for quarterly profit, however, to lose sight of protections for the people they are intending to serve. This might be due to a fundamental misunderstanding of capitalism itself.</p><p>In his signature book, The Wealth of Nations, \"the father of capitalism,\" Adam Smith, articulated how free-market capitalism operates through an \"invisible hand\" to lift all boats. You may not have heard of Smith's other major work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In it, the famed Scottish economist and philosopher articulated the necessary pre-condition of humane values essential to a properly functioning market. All over the world, we see examples of capitalism devoid of Smith's moral sentiments.</p><p>In our American experience, we naturally accept that the private market system accelerates possibility and opportunity for human well-being and flourishing. We also recognize that the \"free\" market can be distorted, manipulated, stacked, unfair. Herein lies the tension. As some economists have noted, in the long run, the market takes care of all problems. The famous economist John Maynard Keynes retorted: Yes, but, in the long run, we are all dead. Thus, a regulating moral force (properly informed government) is needed to ensure that the market operates fairly.</p><p>Healthy competition births innovation. To its credit, Google won the public's trust in the free marketplace of ideas, not through stifled competition. Like the robber barons of old, however, Google lost sight of the Smithian sentiment of \"sympathy,\" which keeps Smithian \"self-interest\" in check. In the robber baron era, children were exploited through factory sweatshops.

Rather than naming a CEO, a pope or a baseball executive to top the annual ranking, Fortune named a group -- \"the students\" at\u00a0Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and others around the country whose \"courage, tenacity and sheer eloquence\"\u00a0led the massive March for Our Lives event and other initiatives\u00a0that could finally\u00a0propel U.S. action on gun control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not the only group on this year's list: The #MeToo movement (No. 3). The gymnasts and their allies (No. 22), for their stories of sexual abuse by former USA Gymnastics doctor\u00a0Larry Nassar. The West Virginia teachers (No. 31), who sparked protests in other states. While Fortune has often named pairs\u00a0of individuals (Bill and Melinda Gates, first female U.S. Army Rangers Kristen Griest and Shaye Haver) or groups of leaders (three co-founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, four national co-chairs of the Women's March on Washington), naming a movement or a faceless group appears to be something new.</p><p>\"That says something important about the nature of modern leadership,\" Fortune's Alan Murray wrote. \"We live at a time when the captains of business and government are being taken on by surging currents of social media-fed sentiment.\"\u00a0He points to the recently published book \"New Power: How Power Works in Our Hyperconnected World\" as a way of explanation:\u00a0Top-down hierarchies where power is centralized in the hands of a few is ceding ground to \"new power\" that is \"bottom-up, participatory, peer-driven.\" Leaders who are \"best able to channel the participatory energy of those around them -- for the good, for the bad, and for the trivial,\" the book's authors write, are the ones who will\u00a0do well\u00a0in the future.</p><p>While there are\u00a0still plenty of CEOs on the list\u00a0-- General Motors's <person><nameText>Mary Barra </nameText></person>(No. 11), Apple's Tim Cook (No. 14), JPMorgan\u00a0Chase's Jamie Dimon (No. 33) -- other new\u00a0chief executives\u00a0were selected for power that extends well beyond the walls of their firms. Merck CEO <person><nameText>Kenneth Frazier </nameText></person>(No. 5) was named for\u00a0stepping down from\u00a0President Trump's advisory panel after Trump's tepid response to the violence in Charlottesville last year;\u00a0\"not long ago, no CEO would have dared to throw himself into the midst of such a controversy, with no direct relevance to his business,\" Murray writes. Delta's Ed Bastian (No. 50) gets kudos\u00a0for sticking to principles even after Georgia lawmakers took away a tax break following his decision to end a National Rifle Association discount; Bastian wrote in a letter to employees that \"our values are not for sale.\"</p><p>Such\u00a0a list, by its nature, is arbitrary -- Fortune solicits nominations from experts, but the list is largely shaped by editors with a thematic eye, this year at least, toward\u00a0people who are \"navigating\u00a0this challenge\" of a\u00a0more participatory form of leadership. The\u00a0list changes dramatically each year -- no names have made the cut\u00a0all five years, though a few have appeared on four -- and ranking heads of state or leaders\u00a0of Fortune 100\u00a0companies up against college presidents, architects or actresses really tells us very little.</p><p>Still, it's\u00a0an interesting shapshot of the year's leadership themes, the\u00a0unsung heroes doing powerful work and some of the most influential forces driving change across industries, institutions and geographies. \"Black Panther\" director Ryan Coogler (No. 18)\u00a0gets credit\u00a0for leading the first film to pass $1 billion in sales with a predominantly black cast, while\u00a0European Union Commissioner for Competition Margarethe Vestager\u00a0(No. 7)\u00a0is named for \"thoughtfully and assiduously regulating Big Tech\"\u00a0well before Facebook found itself in the\u00a0klieg lights for the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Perhaps even more interesting than who's on the list is who isn't. This year, only one current U.S. elected\u00a0leader was chosen -- New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, in part for his efforts to take down Civil War monuments -- and none of them are elected Washington officials or members of Trump's cabinet. (Also on Thursday, Time Magazine released its Time 100 list,\u00a0which includes Trump, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), but that is a judgment of influence, and not necessarily on the quality of their leadership.)</p><p>In 2017, Fortune picked Sen. John McCain, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) -- who, yes,\u00a0became\u00a0the first\u00a0Democrat to\u00a0formally declare an entry into the 2020 presidential race -- and in\u00a02016, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo were listed.\u00a0While FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen.\u00a0Joseph Dunford are on\u00a0this year's list, the absence of\u00a0any other elected Washington officials speaks volumes about the state of\u00a0leadership in the nation's capital.</p><p>Also nowhere to be found: Last year's No. 1, Chicago Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein. He had these choice words to say after getting the nod: \"Um, I can't even get my dog to stop peeing in my house,\" he wrote an ESPN writer in a text, calling the whole thing \"patently ridiculous.\" Still, he said something that showed he may have deserved it,\u00a0even\u00a0beyond the World Series ring: \"I'm not even the best leader in our organization; our players are.\"</p><p>          Read also:       </p><p>          Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologized -- again       </p><p>The Cubs' Theo Epstein had a home run response to getting named the 'world's greatest leader'       </p><p>          Like On Leadership?

Rather than naming a CEO, a pope or a baseball executive to top the annual ranking, Fortune named a group - the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and others across the country whose \"courage, tenacity and sheer eloquence\" led the massive March for Our Lives event and other initiatives that could finally propel U.S. action on gun control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not the only group on this year's list, which also includes the #MeToo movement (No. 3); the gymnasts and their allies (No. 22), for their stories of sexual abuse by former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar; and the West Virginia teachers (No. 31), who sparked protests in other states. While Fortune has often named pairs of individuals (Bill and Melinda Gates, first female U.S. Army Rangers Kristen Griest and Shaye Haver) or groups of leaders (three co-founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, four national co-chairs of the Women's March on Washington), naming a movement or a faceless group appears to be something new.</p><p>\"That says something important about the nature of modern leadership,\" Fortune's Alan Murray wrote. \"We live at a time when the captains of business and government are being taken on by surging currents of social media-fed sentiment.\" He points to the recently published book \"New Power: How Power Works in Our Hyperconnected World\" as a way of explanation: Top-down hierarchies in which power is centralized in the hands of a few is ceding ground to \"new power\" that is \"bottom-up, participatory, peer-driven.\"</p><p>While there are still plenty of CEOs on the list - General Motors' Mary Barra (No. 11), Apple's Tim Cook (No. 14) - other new chief executives were selected for power that extends well beyond the walls of their firms. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier (No. 5) was named for stepping down from President Trump's advisory panel after Trump's tepid response to the violence in Charlottesville last year; \"not long ago, no CEO would have dared to throw himself into the midst of such a controversy, with no direct relevance to his business,\" Murray writes. Delta Air Lines's Ed Bastian (No. 50) gets kudos for sticking to principles even after Georgia lawmakers took away a tax break following his decision to end a discount for National Rifle Association members; Bastian wrote in a letter to employees that \"our values are not for sale.\"</p><p>Such a list, by its nature, is arbitrary - Fortune solicits nominations from experts, but the list is largely shaped by editors with a thematic eye, this year at least, toward people who are \"navigating this challenge\" of a more participatory form of leadership. The list changes dramatically each year - no names have made the cut all five years, though a few have appeared on four - and ranking heads of state or leaders of Fortune 100 companies up against college presidents, architects or actresses really tells us very little.</p><p>Still, it's an interesting snapshot of the year's leadership themes, the unsung heroes doing powerful work and some of the most influential forces driving change across industries, institutions and geographies.</p><p>\"Black Panther\" director Ryan Coogler (No. 18) gets credit for leading the first film with a predominantly black cast to pass $1 billion in ticket sales, while the European Union's commissioner for competition, Margarethe Vestager (No. 7), is picked for \"thoughtfully and assiduously regulating Big Tech\" well before Facebook found itself in the klieg lights for the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Perhaps even more interesting than who's on the list is who isn't.
