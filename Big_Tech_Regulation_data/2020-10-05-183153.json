Many observers expected to be treated to a full schedule of oversight programming in the succeeding Congress, with a nearly endless stream of smug incompetents being caught in their lies and obfuscations. Some even dared to hope that the oversight fervor might spill over to another breed of smug incompetents: corporate CEOs. </p><p>But, alas, the promised enthusiasm for oversight never seemed to materialize, let alone spread to new targets. (As usual, House Financial Services Committee chairwoman Maxine Waters, who confronted big bank CEOs within months of assuming control of her committee, stands out as a rare exception).This general dearth of accountability made the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee's hearings last week with Big Tech CEOs all the more refreshing. Through incisive questioning, lawmakers were able to coax out consequential admissions of wrongdoing and bring to public attention the myriad harms these companies have perpetrated and then worked hard to obscure. Perhaps most critically, the information they uncovered and put into the public record lays a solid foundation for future legislative and executive action.Arguably just as important as the policy substance, however, is the fact that the hearings were engaging and frankly satisfying to watch. As they have grown more powerful, the Big Four tech firms have slipped further and further from the grip of democratic accountability. Like private governments, they have set rules that dictate the terms of the livelihoods, social engagements, and media consumption of billions of people around the globe. But as much as they like to pretend to be sovereigns, Big Tech companies are ultimately subject to the rules and regulations our government democratically (at least in theory) sets forth. It's good to see them reminded of that fact periodically.As inspiring as the hearings were, however, they were also frustrating, as they begged the question: Why stop with Big Tech? Although Silicon Valley giants may be the most widely-recognized examples of corporate power run amok, they are far from the only ones. In other words, last Wednesday's success can and should be widely replicated.The possibilities are endless, and potentially overwhelming. Given the current crisis, committees would be well-advised to start by challenging the corporate giants who have made the pandemic worse.As they have grown more powerful, the Big Four tech firms have slipped further and further from the grip of democratic accountability. That includes the private equity firms whose mismanagement of nursing home conglomerates left them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks. In their heartless pursuit of profits, private equity firms loaded the nursing homes under their control with unsustainable debt, forcing them to cut staff, cut pay, and cut corners. Even before the pandemic, researchers documented how this led to worse outcomes and higher fatalities for patients in private equity-backed homes. And when COVID-19 hit, these facilities were particularly ill-prepared to respond.The House Ways and Means Committee should make the heads of these private equity firms\u2014behemoths like Carlyle Group, Blackstone, and Warburg Pincus\u2014answer for their actions. With jurisdiction over the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which sets standards of care for nursing facilities, Ways and Means is well-positioned to not only get answers, but ensure that those answers lead to action. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[1]Many of these same private equity titans are long overdue for an appearance before the Energy and Commerce Committee as well. When they weren't snapping up nursing home chains, private equity firms were quietly constructing an empire of hospital chains. Just as with long-term care facilities, the aggressive pursuit of profit and mounds of debt left hospitals with little cushion to absorb unexpected blows. Sure enough, when the pandemic put lucrative elective surgeries on hold, some private equity-backed hospitals were quick to crumble. At least one leveraged its collapse into a bailout, holding healthcare amid a pandemic hostage in exchange for relief.Given these and other bad outcomes, it's time that Energy and Commerce put private equity CEOs under the microscope and consider the implications for the agencies under its jurisdiction like the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services.Meanwhile, the Education and Labor committee would do well to put another set of corporate villains\u2014meatpacking companies\u2014in the hot seat. Meatpacking plants quickly became coronavirus hotspots in the U.S. The experience in other countries shows that this was not just an inevitable function of poor working conditions, but a result of distinct choices from meatpacking companies and policymakers. Rather than working to protect their employees, meatpackers turned their attention to warding off health officials and regulation. That choice has had fatal consequences and they should be asked to account for it. A close examination of the breakdowns in the enforcement of occupational safety standards and the processes by which regulators are supposed to respond in an emergency, will also be a prerequisite to getting the response better next time.Moreover, meatpackers appear to have claimed shortages in product from their plants as a pretense to charge groceries more for beef and pork, which resulted in higher prices for consumers. Yet at the same time, these companies were shipping record amounts of meat abroad, suggesting that they were creating the shortages themselves, and pocketing the profits. The Education and Labor Committee could join Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in exploring that as well.Furthermore, to the extent that all of these industries are highly concentrated, the House Antitrust Subcommittee itself could haul in these corporate leaders to ask them about their businesses. Big Tech isn't the only industry requiring a second look through an antitrust lens.As the success of last week's hearing makes clear, House Democrats' choice to largely spurn corporate oversight has been a big missed opportunity. Confrontations with the country's ever more powerful corporate giants not only make for good policy but also good politics. If House Democrats are serious about either, they will fill the coming months with such clashes.

He went on:</p><p>                     \"Once someone wins at a specific mechanic, it's difficult for others to supplant them without doing something different...\"What we're really buying is time. Buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare etc now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again.\"Within that time, if we incorporate the social mechanics they were using, those new products won't get much traction since we'll already have their mechanics deployed at scale.\"In other words: Facebook is so big that nobody else can challenge it within its specific arena. And if other apps invent a new arena, Facebook can gobble it up in order to stay unbeatable. (About an hour later, Zuckerberg followed up with an email clarifying that he didn't want \"to prevent them from competing with us in any way\")..<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">@RepJayapal</url> asks Facebook CEOs Mark Zuckerberg about copying and threatening smaller competitors like Instagram and Snapchat in order to pressure them into selling to the company.Full video here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">https://t.co/CNTNmIDxiY</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">pic.twitter.com/Itwu0lRf77</url>- CSPAN (@cspan) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">July 29, 2020</url>Zuckerberg accordingly pressed hard for a sale, insistently pushing past Systrom's initial refusal. In another document, he notes that Facebook is developing its own photo features, saying that Systrom should \"thoughtfully\" consider whether they should be \"partners vs competitors\" (Zuckerberg told the hearing he did not remember this as a threat).<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">The tactic worked</url>. A chat log shows Systrom privately worrying whether Zuckerberg will go into \"destroy mode\", which might mean cutting off Instagram's access to Facebook's services in order to strangle it. Systrom concludes: \"I don't think we'll ever escape the wrath of Mark. It just depends on how we avoid it.\"Bezos doesn't really get how Amazon worksTime and time again, Jeff Bezos struggled to answer questions about how his company operates behind the scenes.He was unable to confirm whether sellers were verified using their name and address, or if Amazon kept a phone number of sellers to police the marketplace for stolen or dangerous goods. The leader could not give a \"yes or no\" answer to a question about whether Amazon uses third party seller data to advantage its private label brand-<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">claims which were made in a Wall Street Journal investigation</url>.\"What I can tell you is, we have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\" he said. \"But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\"It's wild that Jeff Bezos doesn't have better answers about Amazon employee use of third-party seller data. House witnesses and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">@WSJ</url> have documented this. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">pic.twitter.com/hwpvEMMw69</url>- Jonathan Capriel (@CaprielWBJ) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">July 29, 2020</url>Faced with claims that vendors were forced to pay for Amazon adverts in exchange for removing counterfeits, and that Alexa is programmed to promote Amazon's products above other, Bezos, again, played dumb. \"That is unacceptable, if those are the facts,\" he said. But these claims have been around for several months. One presumes Washington Post owner Bezos reads the news.Political squabbling took centre stageWatching the committee ask its questions was like watching two parallel hearings happening at the same time. The Democratic and Republican sides of the aisle operate in entirely different universes, with priorities and demands that often pull directly against each other. A frequent theme of the Republican side, picked up by congressmen Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz, was the common belief that the companies are biased against conservatives. The connection of those questions to competition, ostensibly the issue at hand, is unclear.Meanwhile their Democratic colleagues accused them of having a \"persecution complex\" and urged the companies to do more to crack down on the very content he was criticising them for removing, which they argue constitutes disinformation and propaganda.A deeper divide also lies in the belief from the Republican lawmakers that attempts to regulate businesses in this way are inappropriate and an unnecessary check on American innovation. The real threat, they argue, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">comes from China</url> and from the unfair liberal influence they believe is controlling these powerful companies. There's a common belief that action is required, but while the two sides are so far apart that they are not even discussing the same issues, there seems little prospect that the political will exists to make any significant moves against the companies for stifling competition. The 'cyber barons' have terrible memoriesIt's amazing how those little things can slip your mind. Who among us hasn't forgotten the date of a party, the type of battery we needed to buy, or whether or not we used our dominant position in a market to suppress fair competition?Fear not: this hearing proved that the \"cyber barons\" are as absent-minded as the rest of us. Was it fair for Apple to pressure book publishers to join its services? \"I can't see the email, so I don't know the context of it,\" said Cook. Maybe the app was too glitchy, he suggested.Did Mark Zuckerberg ever threaten Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel in any way while attempting to buy his company? \"I don't remember the specific conversations,\" said the Facebook chief (the two men <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">had a famously passive-aggressive exchange</url>).How about reports that Amazon had used information from investment discussions with smaller companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/tech-bosses-google-apple-amazon-facebook-face-us-congress/\">to copy their products</url>? \"I read that article but I didn't remember that piece... I don't know the specifics of the situation,\" said Jeff Bezos.Wow! Even Jeff Bezos forgets he's on mute sometimes. pic.twitter.com/xE6rIddsJz- Joma (@jomaoppa) July 29, 2020</p><p>Google locking in advertising customers? \"I'm not aware of that specific issue.\" Facebook spying on children? \"I'm not familiar with that.\" Amazon exempting its own products from the coronavirus delivery squeeze? \"I don't know the answer to that question\".</p><p>It was a remarkable performance for men running some of the world's most powerful companies, particularly for Zuckerberg and Bezos, who are famously hands-on and personally built their own companies from scratch. At points, Pichai and Zuckerberg had to go back and correct themselves: yes, they did remember certain massive scandals.</p><p>So perhaps there really is hope for us all to become the next Jeff Bezos. Where were those car keys again?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64824337</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-X7M1-F021-60X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1445\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The list of absentees includes Oracle, IBM, Cisco and Palantir. </p><p>Amazon is also not included in this filing, but it backed a separate legal challenge to the travel ban. Tesla and SpaceX, meanwhile, weren't part of the original court motion Sunday, but they signed on to it late Monday.</p><p>But the current silence from certain businesses that met with Trump speaks volumes. </p><p>While much of Silicon Valley opposed Trump throughout his campaign and the early days of his presidency, some big names want to maintain a good working relationship with him.</p><p><person><nameText>Safra Catz, </nameText></person>co-CEO of Oracle, was on Trump's transition team. Oracle was also one of the few big tech companies not to speak out on Trump's executive order last month, which banned travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.</p><p>IBM CEO Ginni Rometty was the first tech executive to join Trump's business advisory council and penned an open letter about working with him to create jobs. </p><p>\"IBM's CEO conveyed the company's views directly to the president and the secretary of Homeland Security in person on Friday, including suggestions for how technology can help to promote both national security and lawful immigration,\" Adam Pratt, a spokesman for IBM, said in a statement provided to CNNTech.</p><p>Palantir declined to comment. Reps for the other companies did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p>IBM and Cisco each previously put out tame statements in reaction to the executive order, citing the value of diversity. </p><p>At least some tech companies absent from the amicus brief may find their way into the legal battle.</p><p>\"There's very obviously a community of like-minded people that are in touch and ready to act,\" Amol Sarva, cofounder of Knotel, one of the companies that signed the amicus brief.</p><p>Slack, a billion-dollar messaging startup, wasn't included in the initial brief Sunday. But like Tesla and SpaceX, it joined on Monday.</p><p>\"We heard about the amicus brief when it appeared in the media, and of course we support it,\" a spokesperson for Slack told CNNMoney.</p><p><person><nameText>Elon Musk, </nameText></person>the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is now a member of two different councils advising Trump. His proximity to Trump has encouraged Tesla investors.</p><p>\"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer,\" Musk wrote in one of several recent tweets defending his position on the councils. \"How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?\"</p><p>Musk's SpaceX, like Oracle and Palantir, has lucrative government contracts. (Trump adviser Peter Thiel also happens to be the cofounder and chairman of Palantir.)</p><p>Musk criticized the travel ban in one tweet as \"not the best way to address the country's challenges.\"</p><p>\"As soon we saw the brief this morning, we insisted on being added,\" a Tesla spokesman said Monday. </p><p>Other companies may choose to sit on the sidelines. </p><p>The big four telecom companies -- AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint -- are absent from the filing. They were also quiet when the executive order was announced last month. </p><p>AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson said last month that he was optimistic Trump would push through tax and regulatory reforms, which could be beneficial to its business. </p><p>AT&amp;T is looking for regulatory approval on its mega merger with Time Warner, the parent company of CNN.

There wouldn't be any reason for the agencies to determine who handles what if they weren't ramping up investigations. Companies harmed by Big Tech areassembling their complaints[2], lawmakers in both parties aredemanding action[3], and we could very well have the biggest monopolization case in America since the legal fight against Microsoft during the Clinton administration. This newly vigorous enforcement throws into sharp relief the failures of the past, and actually the failures of one pivotal year: 2012. There could have been credible antitrust investigations that year of both Big Tech companies that are now squarely in the government's sights: Google and Facebook. </p><p>In both cases, the FTC had demonstrable evidence of anti-competitive conduct. Lower-level FTC officials, in the case of Google, even recommended a lawsuit. But the FTC\u2014President Obama's hand-picked regulators at the FTC, I should add\u2014chose to remain silent. The failure to prosecute reveals the shortcomings of a government that was too close to Silicon Valley, enabling a dominant set of monopolists to entrench themselves. Belatedly, the antitrust agencies are only now making noises about taking action. The lessons of 2012 are too clear for them to take a pass again. We know a lot about the Google case because the FTC inadvertently sentThe Wall Street Journalaconfidential staff report[4]in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The report from the agency's Bureau of Competition, dated August 8, 2012,made an extensive case[5]for indicting Google for exploiting its monopoly power. Officials concluded that Google illegally 'scraped' other websites for reviews and other information and passed off the content as its own; threatened to remove sites from its search engine if it couldn't scrape their content; barred advertisers from using data obtained from Google ad campaigns for ads on other search engines; stopped websites using its search results from doing business with rivals like Bing or Yahoo; and caused 'significant harm' to websites by favoring its own shopping, travel, and local content in searches. The report didn't recommend a lawsuit on one of those counts\u2014preferring its own content in search\u2014but did accuse Google of violating antitrust laws in the other areas. Google has beenfined billions[6]of dollars[7]for harms of this nature by the European Union. But the five-member commission overruled the recommendations of its own staff, choosing not to move forward in January 2013, after Google agreed voluntarily to change some of its business practices. The vote was unanimous to close the case, but only after Google's voluntary changes. Edith Ramirez, then a commissioner on the FTC and later the chair,told a Senate committee afterward[8]that a majority of commissioners didn't support a case. In the FTC commissioners'statement following the Google investigation[9], a footnote suggests that Ramirez was the swing vote, because she did not share the other Democratic commissioners' concerns about Google restricting advertisers from doing business with rival search engines. Ramirez has strolled back and forth through the revolving door in her career, fromrepresenting corporate clients[10]at the law firm ofQuinn Emanuel Urquhart ...llivan, to the FTC, and back torepresenting corporate clients at Hogan Lovells[11]. Facebook also could have been slowed down in 2012, particularly in regard to its purchase of rival social media site Instagram. The FTC had the ability to file a lawsuit to block that merger, and considered doing so. During the investigation, the agency uncovered a document written by a high-level Facebook executive (no name is given).According to theNew York Post[12], the executive said bluntly that Facebook was buying Instagram to eliminate a competitor. One source called it a 'spectacular' document. But Jon Leibowitz, the FTC chair, 'couldn't generate enough support from his fellow commissioners' to sue to block the merger, according to thePost, despite what amounts to smoking-gun evidence that Facebook was buying out a rival to prevent competition. The deal would eventually get FTC approval in August 2012\u2014the same month that the Bureau of Competition released its report recommending a lawsuit against Google. The way thePostdescribed the situation again seems to single out Ramirez. Julie Brill, the other Democratic commissioner, was seen as more aggressive in pursuing antitrust issues at the time. But the Obama administration as a whole was not really one to rankle its friends in Silicon Valley. As I detailed in areport for The Intercept[13]in 2016, Google representatives attended White House meetings more than once a week, on average, during the Obama presidency, and nearly 250 people moved from government service into Google's employment, or vice versa, during Obama's tenure. The Google/Obama White House meetings grew more frequent while Google was under FTC investigation, and minutes before the FTC's final decision, a White House officialsolicited Google for talking points[14]about the matter. Obamapersonally met with Mark Zuckerberg[15]on several occasions, including at aFacebook town hall[16]. Obama's campaign teamused Facebook extensively[17]in the 2012 election, including using the type of data mining now decried after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Today, the FTC isprowling around Silicon Valley[18],seeking information[19]on the two companies it's charged with investigating, Amazon and Facebook. But seven years ago, it had an opportunity to address what even then we could identify as growing monopoly power by two leading tech giants. Through lawsuits and discovery we could have learned much more, well before the 2016 election, about how these businesses operated. We could have stopped their continued purchases of rival companies and cast a skeptical eye on mergers in the entire tech space, which continue unabated (Google justbought a data analytics firm[20]last week). Enforcement cases in an age where the judiciary has been polluted with Chicago school theories of antitrust would have been a tough road, especially considering the tech industry's army oflobbyists[21]andinfluencers[22]. But as antitrust attorney Gary Reback said about the Microsoft antitrust case in the 1990s,the trial is the remedy[23]. It could have created a completely different environment around the regulatory posture, and prodded Big Tech to step more gingerly. It could have created space for innovators to challenge platform dominance, the way Google did in the wake of the Microsoft trial. But choices were made in 2012. Specific choices, by conflicted regulators and an administration dazzled by Big Tech. These choices had weight; they created an impenetrable set of giants now hanging over our economy. Now we can only wonder what might have been, and what we lost in the process.

That amount is about equal to the market capitalization of McDonald's. The biggest loser among the tech giants was Amazon, which lost $51 billion in market value. You could just about buy McDonald's with the amount of value the most widely watched tech stocks shed on Tuesday. If you include Microsoft's market losses, you could snap up Burger King's owner as well \u2014 or a heck of a lot of Big Macs and Whoppers. </p><p>On a down day for the markets, the big tech stocks got crushed. Collectively, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent company Alphabet, lost $141 billion in market value, as their stocks declined 4.5% on average. Microsoft, which has been vying with Apple for the title of most valuable public company in the world, saw its shares fall 3%, as the company's market capitalization dropped $27 billion. Read this: Microsoft's surprising comeback over Apple is the outcome of two new CEOs with radically different game plans[1] By comparison, McDonald's has a market value of $143 billion and Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Burger King, has a market value of $26 billion.Amazon was the biggest loserAmong the big tech shares, Amazon was the biggest loser. With its stock falling nearly 6% to $1,668.40, the e-commerce giant's market capitalization plunged by $51 billion. That's about the same amount that General Motors is worth in total. Apple was the next biggest loser, at least in terms of the market value it lost. The iPhone maker saw its capitalization drop by $39 billion thanks to its stock falling 4% to $176.69. In terms of percentage declines, Netflix was the second to Amazon. Its stock fell 5% to $275.33, resulting in a drop in its valuation of $6.5 billion. The selloff in shares of the big tech companies has been going on for months now[2], amid broader concerns about slowing growth and stricter regulations. Although Facebook only saw its shares and market valuation drop by 2% Tuesday, its stock has declined the most from its peak this year of any of its peers. Since hitting their apex in July, Facebook's shares are down nearly 37%. Netflix is a close second in that category. Its shares are down 35% since they peaked in June. Tuesday's decline in tech shares extended far beyond the giants, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index falling 3.8% to 7,158.43. Intel's shares fell by 5%. Western Digital, Micron, and Nvidia all saw their shares drop by more than 7%. ETrade declined by 8%. And AMD shares fell by a whopping 11%.

France pushed forward with plans to tax the revenue of internet giants, with a bill that could generate $563 million more in income for the French government being passed by lower parliament.

In France, the country's lower parliament passed a pioneering bill aimed at taxing the revenues, rather than the profits, of companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, AP reports.[2] Meanwhile, the favorite to become Britain's next prime minister, Boris Johnson, indicated his support for similar proposals in the UK, where there is growing anger about the amount of tax paid by giant US corporations. The idea of a tax on revenues is designed to combat the complex arrangements most US tech firms have in place to avoid paying high tax bills. Tech firms do this by routeing their sales through a subsidiary in a country with lower taxes, such as Ireland. Their subsidiaries report revenue based on services provided to the parent company, resulting in drastically lower revenue and profit, and, therefore, lower corporation tax.

The country estimates that this could raise about \u20ac500 million ($563 million),[4] for the public purse every year. The bill proposing the tax was approved by France's lower house of parliament on Thursday. It will be put before the Senate next week, where it is expected to be rubber-stamped, AP reports. Bruno le Maire, the finance minister in President Emmanuel Macron's government, said in March that the tax was about \"justice.\" \"These digital giants use our personal data, make huge profits out of these data,\" and \"then transfer the money somewhere else without paying their fair amount of taxes.\"Elsewhere on Thursday, the man most likely to be Britain's new prime minister signaled that he will get behind similar proposals currently under consideration in the UK. In October, Chancellor Philip Hammond said[5] the UK would tax 2% of British user-generated revenue in a new \"digital services tax,\" which could bring in up to 400 million ($502 million), a year for the Treasury. Johnson appears to like the idea. \"It's deeply unfair that high street businesses are paying tax through the nose ... whereas the internet giants, the FAANGs \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are paying virtually nothing,\" he said at a leadership event, according to Reuters.[6] \"We've got to find a way of taxing the internet giants on their income, because at the moment it is simply unfair.\" Johnson's words were welcomed by Damian Collins, the British lawmaker who has been relentless in holding Facebook to account for the Cambridge Analytica data breach. \"The big tech companies should pay a level of tax that directly relates to the huge value of the business they do in the UK,\" he tweeted on Friday.[7] Support for a tax on big tech runs across party lines as well. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted at snarky happy 25th birthday message for Amazon[8] on Friday. He was pictured signing a card, which contained the message: \"You owe the British people millions in taxes that pay for the public services that we all rely on. Please pay your fair share.\"Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1147044691742883840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw My card to @Amazon[9] on its 25th birthday.\"You owe the British people millions in taxes that pay for the public services that we all rely on. Please pay your fair share.\"#Amazon[10] #Amazon25[11] pic.twitter.com/8YewzxEb1K[12];Both France and the UK have said they hope their plans will appeal to other countries. There are ongoing talks among the G20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to reform the way the companies are taxed. Big tech firms have unsurprisingly bristled at the notion of paying billions more in tax. At the time Chancellor Philip Hammond announced his vision, TechUK \u2014 the British lobbying group that counts Facebook, Amazon, and Google among its members \u2014 said: \"The kind of tax being proposed will be bad for investment and bad for the UK economy.\"NOW WATCH: Facebook's scandals weren't enough for people to stop using it.

It\u2019s not Amazon and Google we\u2019re talking about first. It\u2019s Facebook and Apple , as they square off on planned changes for iOS 14, which will be the iPhones operating system set for release this fall.   The issue gets fairly deep into the weeds about how operating systems and Facebook advertising work together \u2013 or, in this case, may not work together. With the amount of advertising that retailers do on Facebook, and the burgeoning world of mobile advertising in the balance, the outcome of the spat will be important for many stakeholders.   Here are the basics. When it was announced in June, iOS 14 came with an opt-in clause and opt-out option for users. According to Apple Insider , inside the iOS 14 privacy settings, users can indicate whether they want apps to ask permission to track them across other apps and websites \u2013 something that Facebook uses as the basis for much of its advertising technology.   Currently, if a user is posting on Facebook about plans for a summer vacation, a whole host of companies will see that information through what\u2019s known as an IDFA (identifier for advertisers). It\u2019s technically anonymous, but has enough information to serve up a relevant ad. For example, in the current iOS scheme, if the user posts about a driving trip from Boston to Washington, DC, a DC restaurant that is in the Facebook ecosystem could serve an ad to that user. With iOS 14, the user can choose to stop that from happening. What\u2019s more, even if the feature is shut off, apps must get opt-in consent before they can track users.   Facebook is not happy. In fact, it says its ad revenue could take a 50 percent hit on Apple devices.   \u201cWe expect these changes will disproportionately affect Audience Network, given its heavy dependence on app advertising,\u201d noted a post on the Facebook advertising blog on Wednesday (Aug. 26). \u201cLike all ad networks on iOS 14, advertiser ability to accurately target and measure their campaigns on Audience Network will be impacted, and as a result, publishers should expect their ability to effectively monetize on Audience Network to decrease. Ultimately, despite our best efforts, Apple\u2019s updates may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14. We expect less impact to our own advertising business, and we\u2019re committed to supporting advertisers and publishers through these updates.\u201d   Facebook has made some changes. First, it will not collect IDFA data on iOS 14, at least until \u201cApple offers more guidance.\u201d It will also remind users that it also has an \u201coff-Facebook activity\u201d feature, although it does not require an opt-in. For retailers, the biggest change might be the release of an updated SDK (software development kit) that will limit the data available for running and measuring campaigns.   \u201cIn light of these limitations, and in an effort to mitigate the impact on the efficacy of app install campaign measurement, we will also ask businesses to create a new ad account dedicated to running app install ad campaigns for iOS 14 users,\u201d noted the advertising blog.   Expect more developments as the iOS 14 release date (still unknown) approaches.   And on to California\u2026   Facebook also has beef with the state of California, which has one of the country\u2019s strictest consumer privacy laws. This fight, too, revolves around the ability to collect user information and advertise against it. The California law (the California Consumer Protection Act , or CCPA) is complex and restrictive. On a very basic level, it gives users the ability to see the information that is collected about them and then opt-out from allowing companies to sell that data. The problem goes back to the amount of data Facebook collects on behalf of its advertisers, and it also involves the right of consumers to opt-out.   Faecbook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner addressed the law on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call . \u201cYou know, in the near term, that\u2019s really around implementing CCPA. And in the longer term, it\u2019s more potential for further similar regulation across the globe,\u201d Wehner said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an impact to the business from CCPA today. We don\u2019t know what the impact will be. How things play out will depend on advertiser implementation, [and] adoption rates in terms of opting out of tracking. So there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to how it plays out.\u201d   The law went into effect on July 1. The big problem is that the law not only applies to Facebook, but also to every business that uses any kind of data from California residents. Just before the law went into effect, Facebook announced a new feature called Limited Data Use, which businesses can use to limit the data they send to Facebook.   \u201cWhen a business applies this feature, it will direct Facebook to process information about people in California as the business' service provider,\u201d explained the Facebook for Business blog . \u201cThat means we will limit how this information is processed as specified in our  State-Specific Terms . When Limited Data Use is enabled, businesses may notice an impact to campaign performance and effectiveness, and retargeting and measurement capabilities will be limited.\u201d   One month into Limited Data Use, Facebook is expected to provide an update on its effectiveness, or potentially recommend changes.   Google Simplifies Listings   The third techy item of the week came from Google , and this one is positive for retailers. It\u2019s a bit \u201cinside baseball,\u201d so buckle up.   For the last year, Google has been making changes to its Merchant Center to make life and listings easier for retailers. For example, earlier this year, Google launched a new way for shoppers to find clothes, shoes and other retail products on Search in the U.S. The company also recently announced that  free retail listings are coming to product knowledge panels on Google Search, in an effort to simplify the process and technology involved in creating them.   Google is essentially giving retailers more control over their information in search results through utilizing meta tags and an HTML attribute. Retailers will also be able to customize product display content in search results.   \u201cMany retailers already use schema.org markup or  Google Merchant Center  to make certain specifications in their product\u2019s display in Google Search results, but there are chances [for] Google to start displaying other on-page content that it may find through regular crawling through the Robots.txt files,\u201d said Digital Information World of the changes. \u201cThat is why robot meta tags are useful, as they give some interesting controls and customization options to the retailers about how their products appear in the search results and how much product data and information can be controlled from displaying.\u201d   The way Google describes it on the Merchant Center is by visualizing a mobile screen. In one iteration, the new technology allows retailers to submit a simple text listing. In another, the listing is accompanied by an image.   \u201cThese are some pretty interesting controls that can let the retailers practically do whatever they can with their products\u2019 search snippets on Google search,\u201d said DIW . However, the important thing to note is that these attributes or robots meta tags will not apply if the retailer has already used the markup by schema.org or product data submitted through Google Merchant Center.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS AND AMAZON PAY CONVERSATION: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 CONSUMER TRUST     From tiny Main Street shops to the tech giants of Silicon Valley, companies are working fervently to revive and reinvent the economy.

Passenger expectations are changing too. Todays passenger is more digitally connected than ever before, more tech-savvy and more demanding. Shifting expectations are driven in large part by the evolution of the on-demand economy, as travelers become accustomed to accessing services from the likes of Amazon, Netflix and Uber, flexibly, when they want and how they want.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response, we are witnessing a shift toward the smart airport: one that combines technology and data to drive efficiency and deliver a higher quality of service. Pioneered by leaders such as Singapores Changi Airport, these smart airports are becoming more experiential, offering a highly personalized service from touchpoints that are increasingly technology-enabled.</p><p>In 2020 I expect airports around the world to invest more in technology. When it comes to passenger-handling applications, for instance those used at check-in  the workhorses of the industry  we will continue to see a move toward the cloud, automation and optimization to secure greater capabilities, more efficiently. But there are also a host of emerging technologies that will begin to secure an increased share of the IT budget with the objective of delivering transformative new services.</p><p>The rise of the distributed airport</p><p>Innovation in the airport check-in process continues to be a focus, and cloud technology is a key enabler of this. The cloud provides airports with flexibility, enabling them to scale their passenger services up and down based on demand, and to transcend the limitations of fixed infrastructure at the airport terminal.</p><p>Increasingly, airports and their airline customers are moving check-in and bag-drop processes off-airport. Travelers can have their bags handled at hotels and resorts, at convention halls, major sporting events, or in the city center. This frees up more leisure time for passengers, enabling them to enjoy their day bag-free, while reducing congestion at the airport itself.</p><p>A number of airlines and airports are recognizing the value in providing off-airport services. Ground handling firm Off Airport Check In Solutions (OACIS) pioneered this approach in Australia and recently began a new pilot internationally with Air New Zealand to offer a pop-up check-in facility in downtown Queenstown, New Zealand. Similarly, Hong Kong International Airport is leveraging the cloud to offer mobile check-in kiosks at off-site locations, such as hotels and at the countrys border crossing facilities.</p><p>Now the model is thoroughly proven, I expect a rapid expansion of such projects in 2020; the first steps toward a fully distributed airport.</p><p>The end of boarding passes?</p><p>Not quite yet, but 2019 marked some key milestones in the roll-out of biometrics. By no means a new technology, biometrics have been talked about for years as an essential component in enabling frictionless travel  2020 will be a critical year for the technology as it begins to meet its long-held potential.</p><p>Biometrics promises a faster, more efficient check-in process for passengers, reducing queues and physical touchpoints. Passengers will no longer have to repetitively present boarding passes and passports at checkpoints such as immigration and VIP lounges, and boarding will take place much faster. For instance, at a recent pilot at Fraport Slovenija Airport in Ljubljana, average boarding times were reduced by 75% per passenger using biometric systems. In this pilot, passengers registered with a selfie taken on a smartphone. Enabling passengers to capture their biometric data and store it locally on their own smartphone means that they can be in control of their data. Passengers can share their data with airlines and airports only for the duration of the passenger handling process and then relax, confident in the knowledge that the only place their data is held permanently is on their own device.</p><p>Still, with so many solutions being rolled out across the world, there is significant fragmentation, a major source of frustration for the industry. Without a common standard, biometric systems will continue to be siloed with limited capacity for integration. Passengers will continue to be forced to register and reregister for different systems while airlines and airports will have to continually invest in complex and costly upgrades across biometric systems to match changes in technology, airline policies, and regulations such as GDPR in Europe and the US Customs and Border Protection biometric exit mandate. To alleviate this, the industry needs a common standard in biometrics, one which integrates systems, and which enables compliance with differing global regulations.</p><p>The IoT begins to deliver</p><p>Its been a long time in the making but the Internet of Things (IoT) is now a reality, with more than three billion everyday objects connected to the internet. The value of the data that can be collected, stored and analyzed as a result of this trend is almost unfathomable.</p><p>Airports, with their complex operating environment enabled by a large number of physical assets and operational technology, are ideally placed to benefit from IoT sensors, although this opportunity still remains largely untapped today. But things are changing quickly, with the French IoT company Sigfox providing a light-infrastructure network that now reaches more than one billion people and is ideally suited for connecting up all these sensors embedded in equipment.</p><p>Last month, the company unveiled its new airport asset-tracking platform, Pinpoint. The platform provides end-to-end tracking for the industry, helping airports manage and transfer key assets such as luggage and landing gear.</p><p>Since the introduction of IATAs Resolution 753, which mandates that baggage be tracked at key checkpoints throughout its journey, airlines and ground handlers are increasingly looking to improve their baggage handling processes. As such we can expect a much greater focus on technologies that help them achieve this as we move into 2020.</p><p>The sustainability effect</p><p>Public awareness and concern about climate change have been growing for some time, but 2019 was in many respects a breakthrough year. In November the UNs IPCC report showed more drastic action was needed to tackle the crisis and throughout the year there have been widespread climate protests across the world.</p><p>A burgeoning no-fly movement is gaining momentum in Europe. But sustainability is influencing traveler decisions in subtler ways too, changing spending habits, destinations of choice, and the way travelers think and feel about their journey.</p><p>In 2020, we can expect airports to respond to concerns as a priority. Airports Council International (ACI) Europe recently set ambitious targets for European airports to cut total carbon emission to zero by 2050. Airports, among them London Heathrow, have also announced innovative recycling schemes.</p><p>Airports are investing in ultra-low-emission planes and green technologies. The Avinor Group for instance, which represents 44 Norwegian airports, reduced its total carbon emissions by 5,000 tons annually through investment in cloud technology. The group also unveiled groundbreaking plans for the entirety of short-haul Norwegian flights to be fully electric by 2040, and at our own annual customer conference, the group explained how it stores ice underground during winter to use for cooling in the summer.

Then when a motion sensor detects a person in the house, like your house cleaner, it sends an alert to your phone. When you arrive home, a camera recognizes who you are and the door automatically unlocks.</p><p>Automated technologies like these will be at the forefront of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ces.tech/\">CES</url>, one of the world\u2019s largest tech conventions, next week in Las Vegas. They underline one major trend: Increasingly, the innovations that are making their way into your personal technology aren\u2019t physical electronics or gadgets at all.</p><p>The real star is artificial intelligence, the culmination of software, algorithms and sensors working together to make your everyday appliances smarter and more automated. It is A.I. that is telling the door to unlock when the camera recognizes you, or sending an alert to your phone when sensors detect a person.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s less about the hardware, and more about what\u2019s inside,\u201d Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst for Creative Strategies, said about the prominence of artificial intelligence and software innovations at CES. For consumers who are dazzled by flashy new devices, A.I. is never as exciting, she said \u2014 but it\u2019s the magic that is making hardware evolve.</p><p>That artificial intelligence will take center stage at CES also speaks to how the event has changed in the last few years. It has become less of a venue for tech companies to unveil splashy new products like smartphones or computers, and instead has turned into a showcase for nascent technologies.</p><p>Here are some highlights you can expect from next week\u2019s show.</p><p>Alexa and Her Counterparts</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/amazon-echo-alexa.html\">Alexa</url>, Amazon\u2019s intelligent assistant that listens to your voice commands to play music, order diapers and place a phone call, will be everywhere at CES.</p><p>Smaller tech companies have teamed up with Amazon to bring voice-controlled smarts to their products. Devices like light bulbs, car stereo accessories, robovacuums, home security systems and even coffee makers will work with Alexa. In addition, thousands of companies have developed \u201cSkills,\u201d or third-party apps, that work with Alexa voice commands. Sonos, a premium audio brand, recently released a speaker with Alexa functionality built in.</p><p>What\u2019s fueling interest in Alexa? Amazon\u2019s success with Echo, the smart speakers enabled with the personal assistant. Amazon said last month that it sold tens of millions of Echo devices over the holiday season. Strategy Analytics, a research firm, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/news/strategy-analytics-press-releases/strategy-analytics-press-release/2017/10/12/smart-speakers-sales-head-towards-24-million-in-2017-despite-confusing-array-of-choice-says-strategy-analytics#.Wd94oGtSxhE\">estimates</url> that 68 percent of voice-controlled speakers sold last year worked with Alexa.</p><p>Other tech giants want a piece of the pie, too. In 2016, Google introduced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/technology/personaltech/google-home-vs-amazon-echo-a-face-off-of-smart-speakers.html\">Home</url>, an artificially intelligent speaker to rival the Echo. The search giant will have a large presence at CES, where the company is also expected to highlight accessories that work with its Home speaker and Google Assistant.</p><p>Apple this year will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/technology/personaltech/apple-postpones-release-homepod.html\">release HomePod</url>, a speaker that relies on Siri, the Apple assistant, to control some smart home accessories. And Samsung Electronics, the South Korean manufacturer, is expected to unveil a major upgrade for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/bixby/\">Bixby</url>, its virtual assistant, later this year.</p><p>\u201cIf I had to make a bet, it\u2019s the year of A.I. and conversational interfaces,\u201d said J. P. Gownder, an analyst for Forrester Research.</p><p>Smart Cities</p><p>Nowadays, it\u2019s easy to shop for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/guides/technology/how-to-make-a-smart-home\">high-quality internet-connected home accessories</url>, like light bulbs, thermostats and security cameras. At CES, Samsung is even planning to introduce a smart refrigerator at the electronics show that can listen to voice commands to control other home accessories.</p><p>Now tech companies are looking to push internet connectivity beyond products in your home.</p><p>Consider parking spaces that can sense whether cars are occupying them, and can then alert people when spots free up. Or a garbage can that can notify a waste collection facility when the container is full, or street lamps planted throughout a city that could monitor air quality.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the smart home,\u201d Mr. Gownder said. \u201cThe smart city is elevating that to the next level.\u201d</p><p>Deloitte, the consulting firm, has been making a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/tr/Documents/public-sector/deloitte-nl-ps-smart-cities-report.pdf\">big push for smart cities</url>. It envisions a future where a multitude of sensors work together to create a healthier, safer and more energy efficient town. Sensors in a river could detect pollution like leaks from chemical plants, and sensors that detect the sound of a gunshot could be used to alert the police, for example.</p><p>Next week, companies will demonstrate prototypes of devices embedded with some of these sensors with the hope that cities will soon begin adopting these technologies within their infrastructure.</p><p>Smarter Cars</p><p>Self-driving-car enthusiasts like Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, dream of a future where driverless cars eliminate traffic accidents while letting people do work on their commutes.</p><p>They can keep dreaming: Autonomous vehicles still have a long way to go before they become safe and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/technology/arizona-tech-industry-favorite-self-driving-hub.html\">properly regulated.</url></p><p>\u201cYour car doesn\u2019t drive itself, at least not reliably for a long period of time,\u201d said Ms. Milanesi of Creative Strategies.</p><p>Still, at CES, carmakers like Ford, Hyundai, BMW and Audi are expected to show off the latest improvements to self-driving tech, like smarter parking assistance and less error-prone collision avoidance. These are baby steps toward truly driverless vehicles, but some features may appear in cars in the coming years.</p><p>Likely coming sooner is the so-called connected car. Tech and car companies will demonstrate new features for internet-equipped cars, like the ability to pay for parking and gas through a dashboard or cameras that enhance a driver\u2019s side and rear vision. At the trade show, Gentex Corporation, a company that develops car technology, will <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/gentex-to-demonstrate-new-connected-car-biometrics-and-digital-rear-vision-technologies-at-ces-2018-20180102-00463\">demonstrate</url> in-vehicle biometrics that scan a driver\u2019s iris to verify his or her identity before turning on the car.</p><p>Next-Generation Wireless Technology</p><p>As a growing number of devices rely on artificial intelligence, they will require faster bandwidth speeds. At CES, wireless companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon are expected to give progress reports on so-called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/technology/5g-is-a-new-frontier-at-mobile-world-congress.html\">5G</url>, the fifth-generation network technology.</p><p>With 5G, wireless carriers envision an era of incredibly fast speeds that let smartphone users download a movie in less than five seconds \u2014 roughly 100 times faster than the current network technology, 4G. Even more important, 5G is expected to greatly reduce latency to let devices communicate with each other with extremely fast response times.</p><p>(One caveat: the wireless industry is not expected to roll out 5G until 2020. Telecom equipment makers and tech companies are still fighting over which of their technologies should be standardized globally.)</p><p>So <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/technology/what-5g-will-mean-for-you.html\">why should you care</url>? All of the above \u2014 the smart city, the driverless car and smarter artificial intelligence \u2014 will need extremely fast response times for devices to work reliably. The chief example is driverless cars, which will have to communicate with each other practically in real-time to avoid collisions.</p><p>\u201cIt could be foundational to the next generation of advancements,\u201d said Greg Roberts, an executive at Accenture, a tech consulting firm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see more talk around the potential of 5G to remove the barriers around bandwidth.\u201d</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:brian.chen@nytimes.com\">brian.chen@nytimes.com</email>; Twitter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/bxchen\">@bxchen</url>.</p><p>PHOTOS: Top, a robot interacting with attendees at last year\u2019s CES, the giant tech trade show.

Then when a motion sensor detects a person in the house, like your house cleaner, it sends an alert to your phone. When you arrive home, a camera recognizes who you are and the door automatically unlocks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Automated technologies like these will be at the forefront of CES, one of the world's largest tech conventions, next week in Las Vegas. They underline one major trend: Increasingly, the innovations that are making their way into your personal technology aren't physical electronics or gadgets at all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The real star is artificial intelligence, the culmination of software, algorithms and sensors working together to make your everyday appliances smarter and more automated. It is A.I. that is telling the door to unlock when the camera recognizes you, or sending an alert to your phone when sensors detect a person.</p><p>\"It's less about the hardware, and more about what's inside,\" Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst for Creative Strategies, said about the prominence of artificial intelligence and software innovations at CES. For consumers who are dazzled by flashy new devices, A.I. is never as exciting, she said - but it's the magic that is making hardware evolve.</p><p>That artificial intelligence will take center stage at CES also speaks to how the event has changed in the last few years. It has become less of a venue for tech companies to unveil splashy new products like smartphones or computers, and instead has turned into a showcase for nascent technologies.</p><p>Here are some highlights you can expect from next week's show.</p><p>Alexa and Her Counterparts</p><p>Alexa, Amazon's intelligent assistant that listens to your voice commands to play music, order diapers and place a phone call, will be everywhere at CES.</p><p>Smaller tech companies have teamed up with Amazon to bring voice-controlled smarts to their products. Devices like light bulbs, car stereo accessories, robovacuums, home security systems and even coffee makers will work with Alexa. In addition, thousands of companies have developed \"Skills,\" or third-party apps, that work with Alexa voice commands. Sonos, a premium audio brand, recently released a speaker with Alexa functionality built in.</p><p>What's fueling interest in Alexa? Amazon's success with Echo, the smart speakers enabled with the personal assistant. Amazon said last month that it sold tens of millions of Echo devices over the holiday season. Strategy Analytics, a research firm, estimates that 68 percent of voice-controlled speakers sold last year worked with Alexa.</p><p>Other tech giants want a piece of the pie, too. In 2016, Google introduced Home, an artificially intelligent speaker to rival the Echo. The search giant will have a large presence at CES, where the company is also expected to highlight accessories that work with its Home speaker and Google Assistant.</p><p>Apple this year will release HomePod, a speaker that relies on Siri, the Apple assistant, to control some smart home accessories. And Samsung Electronics, the South Korean manufacturer, is expected to unveil a major upgrade for Bixby, its virtual assistant, later this year.</p><p>\"If I had to make a bet, it's the year of A.I. and conversational interfaces,\" said J. P. Gownder, an analyst for Forrester Research.</p><p>Smart Cities</p><p>Nowadays, it's easy to shop for high-quality internet-connected home accessories, like light bulbs, thermostats and security cameras. At CES, Samsung is even planning to introduce a smart refrigerator at the electronics show that can listen to voice commands to control other home accessories.</p><p>Now tech companies are looking to push internet connectivity beyond products in your home.</p><p>Consider parking spaces that can sense whether cars are occupying them, and can then alert people when spots free up. Or a garbage can that can notify a waste collection facility when the container is full, or street lamps planted throughout a city that could monitor air quality.</p><p>\"You've seen the smart home,\" Mr. Gownder said. \"The smart city is elevating that to the next level.\"</p><p>Deloitte, the consulting firm, has been making a big push for smart cities. It envisions a future where a multitude of sensors work together to create a healthier, safer and more energy efficient town. Sensors in a river could detect pollution like leaks from chemical plants, and sensors that detect the sound of a gunshot could be used to alert the police, for example.</p><p>Next week, companies will demonstrate prototypes of devices embedded with some of these sensors with the hope that cities will soon begin adopting these technologies within their infrastructure.</p><p>Smarter Cars</p><p>Self-driving-car enthusiasts like Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, dream of a future where driverless cars eliminate traffic accidents while letting people do work on their commutes.</p><p>They can keep dreaming: Autonomous vehicles still have a long way to go before they become safe and properly regulated.</p><p>\"Your car doesn't drive itself, at least not reliably for a long period of time,\" said Ms. Milanesi of Creative Strategies.</p><p>Still, at CES, carmakers like Ford, Hyundai, BMW and Audi are expected to show off the latest improvements to self-driving tech, like smarter parking assistance and less error-prone collision avoidance. These are baby steps toward truly driverless vehicles, but some features may appear in cars in the coming years.</p><p>Likely coming sooner is the so-called connected car. Tech and car companies will demonstrate new features for internet-equipped cars, like the ability to pay for parking and gas through a dashboard or cameras that enhance a driver's side and rear vision. At the trade show, Gentex Corporation, a company that develops car technology, will demonstrate in-vehicle biometrics that scan a driver's iris to verify his or her identity before turning on the car.</p><p>Next-Generation Wireless Technology</p><p>As a growing number of devices rely on artificial intelligence, they will require faster bandwidth speeds. At CES, wireless companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon are expected to give progress reports on so-called 5G, the fifth-generation network technology.</p><p>With 5G, wireless carriers envision an era of incredibly fast speeds that let smartphone users download a movie in less than five seconds - roughly 100 times faster than the current network technology, 4G. Even more important, 5G is expected to greatly reduce latency to let devices communicate with each other with extremely fast response times.</p><p>(One caveat: the wireless industry is not expected to roll out 5G until 2020. Telecom equipment makers and tech companies are still fighting over which of their technologies should be standardized globally.)</p><p>So why should you care? All of the above - the smart city, the driverless car and smarter artificial intelligence - will need extremely fast response times for devices to work reliably. The chief example is driverless cars, which will have to communicate with each other practically in real-time to avoid collisions.</p><p>\"It could be foundational to the next generation of advancements,\" said Greg Roberts, an executive at Accenture, a tech consulting firm. \"You're going to see more talk around the potential of 5G to remove the barriers around bandwidth.\"</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:brian.chen@nytimes.com\">brian.chen@nytimes.com</email>;

However, big tech makers are refusing to attract deposits to avoid tougher regulation, as evidenced yesterday during the report by Francisco Ur\u00eda, KPMG's financial sector partner in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.<br/>One of the main advantages of the emergence of so-called bigtech, according to the report, is precisely that they can offer free services to users at a sensitive time to generate revenue for traditional banking. Big technology doesn't aim with their arrival in the financial sector to raise their turnover, but they seek to improve their value chain and monetize customer information through product sales and advertising. But the big risk, according to Santiago Carb\u00f3, director of financial studies at Funcas, is the impact on financial stability by the least supervision over the technological ones. They can also encourage banks to make lending more flexible and take more risks, according to the study.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-9677010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMF-MPB1-DY1R-B1SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The \"Big techs\", as they are known to Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google, Alibaba, impose a certain fear. \"The ' big techs ' operate in a global way and its goal is not only to work in Europe or the United States but have a global vision and, from the control of the information they already have, take advantage of it in a continuous and global way\" , says Nuno Sousa, \"vertical lead financial Services\" by Claranet.</p><p><br/>\"The ' Big Techs ' live in the realm of a billion-dollar international market and can shoot billions to build a lost-bottom market position until they have the scale to do so at prices that no one supports,\" stressed Ricardo Chaves, \"chief commercial Officer \"of SIBS Partner In Payments. \"You can put millions to do something you don't even know how to monetize, and you can do this in a series of adjacent sectors. It pulls innovation, serves the consumer because it brings a set of new services, but it is essential to see if you are not walking towards a model of concentration worse than the starting point \".<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy and regulation</emphasis><br/>Politicians and regulators have to make themselves heard, even by the power of intervention that still bears. Fernando Faria de Oliveira admits that \"there are a number of problems related to the financial stability that arises from the emergence of these new ' players '\". Stresses that this change is being \"the subject of great attention by political power and regulatory authorities, but there has not yet been enough pathways to ensure that the development of ' big techs ' penetration in the markets Not develop major problems. \" He adds that \"the disruptive appearance, if not properly regulated and monitored, can create serious problems with implications in society.\"<br/>\"The regulator must establish a ' level playing field ' and level the various concerns of financial stability, data protection and privacy, competition. Apple has its closed payment system and could be integrated into the ' apps ' of the banks. It is stipulated the ' open banking ' for the banks and we know that these new ' players ' have a lot of information that would be very useful to us but not available through the API \", maintains Maria Jos\u00e9 Campos, administrator of Millennium bcp.<br/>\"The European banking system, through the developments that are made in the EBF [European Banking Federation], considers that a correct ' level playing field ' is in perfect condition to face this competition as aggressive as it may be. But we have concerns of data protection, privacy, competition, DML [Data Manipulation Language], which are put to the launch of assets as cryptocurrencies, \"says Fernando Faria de Oliveira, president of the Portuguese Association of Banks.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The New Generations</emphasis><br/>Lu\u00eds Melo, director of information systems at Montepio, said that in the United States the cost of attracting clients by the incumbents was in the house of 200, 300 dollars, while for the \"Big techs\" walkedIn the penny-dollar house. \"This is an abyssal difference to the challenge that banks have to face from the point of view of the cost of structure to compete,\" he concluded.<br/>Paulo Figueiredo argues that the \"big techs\" have a great fragility, \"which is the ease that you had to be able to access your customers ' databases in an uncontrolled way, as was the case with Facebook. Few people would be available to give their bank account access to Facebook, or Google. \" It considers that trust is the big pillar of banking and that the position that the end customer has, with regard to their personal data, in relation to the banking is different from that which has a ' fintech ' or a ' big tech '. The bankroll has this asset, the ' big techs ' don't have '. Lu\u00eds Melo counteracts that \"the new generations are willing to lose part of their privacy to obtain this convenience.\"<br/>\"The theme of ' Big techs ' is of great importance from a strategic point of view to Europe and the European Union. The capture of value on the part of ' Big tech ', which is mainly located in the United States and China, creates problems for the European project and its ability to create \"big techs\" that are comparable, \"Faria de Oliveira warned.<br/>The real power of the \"big tech\"<br/>\"The ' big techs ' already have blocking cases in the access of fundamental functionalities,\" said Ricardo Chaves. In the case of MB Way, Apple Pay prevented NFC (\"contactless\") payments. In Switzerland, the mobile payment rival Twint asked for an investigation of the competition authority against Apple Pay that blocked the Twint app when a phone scanned a QR code to make a payment, differing that it was resolved afterwards. According to Ricardo Chaves, \"SIBS has already requested/demanded Apple access to this development piece for the banks that are using the MB Way features in the ' apps ' and for the ' app ' of the MB Way.\" Explains that \"for a year and a half that customers could use the functionality, because 70% of the transaction is in the IOS and we could not do and we had to invent a payment by Q-code, which is less effective, to circumvent this difficulty, because the regulator does not Decides \".<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-7630367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJF-H3X1-DY1R-B3KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

I picked a forgettable name, snapped a profile pic with my face obscured, and clicked \"Like\" on the official pages of Donald Trump and his reelection campaign. Facebook's algorithm prodded me to follow Ann Coulter, Fox Business, and a variety of fan pages with names like \"In Trump We Trust.\" I complied. I also gave my cellphone number to the Trump campaign, and joined a handful of private Facebook groups for MAGA diehards, one of which required an application that seemed designed to screen out interlopers.</p><p><br/>To hear more feature stories, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=atlantic&amp;amp;utm_content=2020_disinformation_war\">get the Audm iPhone app.</url><br/>The president's reelection campaign was then in the midst of a multimillion-dollar ad blitz aimed at shaping Americans' understanding of the recently launched impeachment proceedings. Thousands of micro-targeted ads had flooded the internet, portraying Trump as a heroic reformer cracking down on foreign corruption while Democrats plotted a coup. That this narrative bore little resemblance to reality seemed only to accelerate its spread. Right-wing websites amplified every claim. Pro-Trump forums teemed with conspiracy theories. An alternate information ecosystem was taking shape around the biggest news story in the country, and I wanted to see it from the inside.<br/>The story that unfurled in my Facebook feed over the next several weeks was, at times, disorienting. There were days when I would watch, live on TV, an impeachment hearing filled with damning testimony about the president's conduct, only to look at my phone later and find a slickly edited video-served up by the Trump campaign-that used out-of-context clips to recast the same testimony as an exoneration. Wait, I caught myself wondering more than once, is that what happened today?<br/>As I swiped at my phone, a stream of pro-Trump propaganda filled the screen: \"That's right, the whistleblower's own lawyer said, ~The coup has started 'S\" Swipe. \"Democrats are doing Putin's bidding \" Swipe. \"The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing \" Swipe. \"Only one man can stop this chaos \" Swipe, swipe, swipe.<br/>I was surprised by the effect it had on me. I'd assumed that my skepticism and media literacy would inoculate me against such distortions. But I soon found myself reflexively questioning every headline. It wasn't that I believed Trump and his boosters were telling the truth. It was that, in this state of heightened suspicion, truth itself-about Ukraine, impeachment, or anything else-felt more and more difficult to locate. With each swipe, the notion of observable reality drifted further out of reach.<br/>What I was seeing was a strategy that has been deployed by illiberal political leaders around the world. Rather than shutting down dissenting voices, these leaders have learned to harness the democratizing power of social media for their own purposes-jamming the signals, sowing confusion. They no longer need to silence the dissident shouting in the streets; they can use a megaphone to drown him out. Scholars have a name for this: censorship through noise.<br/>After the 2016 election, much was made of the threats posed to American democracy by foreign disinformation. Stories of Russian troll farms and Macedonian fake-news mills loomed in the national imagination. But while these shadowy outside forces preoccupied politicians and journalists, Trump and his domestic allies were beginning to adopt the same tactics of information warfare that have kept the world's demagogues and strongmen in power.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/the-branching-possibilities-of-the-facebook-russian-ad-buy/541002/?utm_source=feed\">Read: What, exactly, were Russians trying to do with those Facebook ads?</url>]<br/>Every presidential campaign sees its share of spin and misdirection, but this year's contest promises to be different. In conversations with political strategists and other experts, a dystopian picture of the general election comes into view-one shaped by coordinated bot attacks, Potemkin local-news sites, micro-targeted fearmongering, and anonymous mass texting. Both parties will have these tools at their disposal. But in the hands of a president who lies constantly, who traffics in conspiracy theories, and who readily manipulates the levers of government for his own gain, their potential to wreak havoc is enormous.<br/>The Trump campaign is planning to spend more than $1 billion, and it will be aided by a vast coalition of partisan media, outside political groups, and enterprising freelance operatives. These pro-Trump forces are poised to wage what could be the most extensive disinformation campaign in U.S. history. Whether or not it succeeds in reelecting the president, the wreckage it leaves behind could be irreparable.<br/>THE DEATH STAR<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-2020-campaign-wants-order-and-discipline-down-to-font-sizes-11560524198\">The campaign is run</url> from the 14th floor of a gleaming, modern office tower in Rosslyn, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. Glass-walled conference rooms look out on the Potomac River. Rows of sleek monitors line the main office space. Unlike the bootstrap operation that first got Trump elected-with its motley band of B-teamers toiling in an unfinished space in Trump Tower-<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-campaign-machine-has-two-year-head-start-11555243200\">his 2020 enterprise</url> is heavily funded, technologically sophisticated, and staffed with dozens of experienced operatives. One Republican strategist referred to it, admiringly, as \"the Death Star.\"<br/>Presiding over this effort is Brad Parscale, a 6-foot-8 Viking of a man with a shaved head and a triangular beard. As the digital director of Trump's 2016 campaign, Parscale didn't become a household name like Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway. But he played a crucial role in delivering Trump to the Oval Office-and his efforts will shape this year's election.<br/>In speeches and interviews, Parscale <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-myths-of-the-genius-behind-trumps-reelection-campaign\">likes to tell his life story as a tidy rags-to-riches tale</url>, embroidered with Trumpian embellishments. He grew up a simple \"farm boy from Kansas\" (read: son of an affluent lawyer from suburban Topeka) who managed to graduate from an \"Ivy League\" school (Trinity University, in San Antonio). After college, he went to work for a software company in California, only to watch the business collapse in the economic aftermath of 9/11 (not to mention allegations in a lawsuit that he and his parents, who owned the business, had illegally transferred company funds-claims that they disputed). Broke and desperate, Parscale took his \"last $500\" (not counting the value of three rental properties he owned) and used it to start a one-man web-design business in Texas.<br/>Parscale Media was, by most accounts, a scrappy endeavor at the outset. Hustling to drum up clients, Parscale cold-pitched shoppers in the tech aisle of a Borders bookstore. Over time, he built enough websites for plumbers and gun shops that bigger clients took notice-including the Trump Organization. In 2011, Parscale was invited to bid on designing a website for Trump International Realty. An ardent fan of The Apprentice, he offered to do the job for $10,000, a fraction of the actual cost. \"I just made up a price,\" he later told The Washington Post. \"I recognized that I was a nobody in San Antonio, but working for the Trumps would be everything.\" The contract was his, and a lucrative relationship was born.<br/>Over the next four years, he was hired to design websites for a range of Trump ventures-a winery, a skin-care line, and then a presidential campaign. By late 2015, Parscale-a man with no discernible politics, let alone campaign experience-was running the Republican front-runner's digital operation from his personal laptop.<br/>Parscale slid comfortably into Trump's orbit. Not only was he cheap and unpretentious-with no hint of the savvier-than-thou smugness that characterized other political operatives-but he seemed to carry a chip on his shoulder that matched the candidate's. \"Brad was one of those people who wanted to prove the establishment wrong and show the world what he was made of,\" says a former colleague from the campaign.<br/>Perhaps most important, he seemed to have no reservations about the kind of campaign Trump wanted to run. The race-baiting, the immigrant-bashing, the truth-bending-none of it seemed to bother Parscale. While some Republicans wrung their hands over Trump's inflammatory messages, Parscale came up with ideas to more effectively disseminate them.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/01/future-politics-bots-drowning-out-humans/604489/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Bots are destroying political discourse as we know it</url>]<br/>The campaign had little interest at first in cutting-edge ad technology, and for a while, Parscale's most valued contribution was the merchandise page he built to sell MAGA hats. But that changed in the general election. Outgunned on the airwaves and lagging badly in fundraising, campaign officials turned to Google and Facebook, where ads were inexpensive and shock value was rewarded. As the campaign poured tens of millions into online advertising-amplifying themes such as Hillary Clinton's criminality and the threat of radical Islamic terrorism-Parscale's team, which was christened Project Alamo, grew to 100.<br/>Parscale was generally well liked by his colleagues, who recall him as competent and intensely focused. \"He was a get-shit-done type of person,\" says <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/from-trump-aide-to-single-mom/536892/?utm_source=feed\">A. J. Delgado, who worked with him</url>. Perhaps just as important, he had a talent for ingratiating himself with the Trump family. \"He was probably better at managing up,\" Kurt Luidhardt, a consultant for the campaign, told me. He made sure to share credit for his work with the candidate's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and he excelled at using Trump's digital ignorance to flatter him. \"Parscale would come in and tell Trump he didn't need to listen to the polls, because he'd crunched his data and they were going to win by six points,\" one former campaign staffer told me. \"I was like, ~Come on, man, don't bullshit a bullshitter.'S\" But Trump seemed to buy it. (Parscale declined to be interviewed for this story.)<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/fake-news-republicans-democrats/591211/?utm_source=feed\">David A. Graham: The real problem with fake news</url>]<br/>James Barnes, a Facebook employee who was dispatched to work closely with the campaign, told me Parscale's political inexperience made him open to experimenting with the platform's new tools. \"Whereas some grizzled campaign strategist who'd been around the block a few times might say, ~Oh, that will never work,' Brad's predisposition was to say, ~Yeah, let's try it.'S\" From June to November, Trump's campaign ran <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/trump-s-campaign-said-it-was-better-at-facebook-facebook-agrees\">5.9 million ads on Facebook, while Clinton's ran just 66,000</url>. A Facebook executive would later write in a leaked memo that Trump \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/facebook-trump-2020.html\">got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser</url>.\"<br/>Though some strategists questioned how much these ads actually mattered, Parscale was hailed for Trump's surprise victory. Stories appeared in the press calling him a \"genius\" and the campaign's \"secret weapon,\" and in 2018 he was tapped to lead the entire reelection effort. The promotion was widely viewed as a sign that the president's 2020 strategy would hinge on the digital tactics that Parscale had mastered.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/?utm_source=feed\">Read: What Facebook did to American democracy</url>]<br/>Through it all, the strategist has continued to show a preference for narrative over truth. Last May, Parscale regaled a crowd of donors and activists in Miami with the story of his ascent. When a ProPublica reporter confronted him about the many misleading details in his account, he shrugged off the fact-check. \"When I give a speech, I tell it like a story,\" he said. \"My story is my story.\"<br/>DISINFORMATION ARCHITECTURE<br/>In his book <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/peter-pomerantsev/this-is-not-propaganda/9781541762138/\">This Is Not Propaganda</url>, Peter Pomerantsev, a researcher at the London School of Economics, writes about a young Filipino political consultant he calls \"P.\" In college, P had studied the \"Little Albert experiment,\" in which scientists conditioned a young child to fear furry animals by exposing him to loud noises every time he encountered a white lab rat. The experiment gave P an idea. He created a series of Facebook groups for Filipinos to discuss what was going on in their communities. Once the groups got big enough-about 100,000 members-he began posting local crime stories, and instructed his employees to leave comments falsely tying the grisly headlines to drug cartels. The pages lit up with frightened chatter. Rumors swirled; conspiracy theories metastasized. To many, all crimes became drug crimes.<br/>Unbeknownst to their members, the Facebook groups were designed to boost Rodrigo Duterte, then a long-shot presidential candidate running on a pledge to brutally crack down on drug criminals. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-killings.html\">Duterte once boasted</url> that, as mayor of Davao City, he rode through the streets on his motorcycle and personally executed drug dealers.) P's experiment was one plank in a larger \"disinformation architecture\"-which also included social-media influencers paid to mock opposing candidates, and mercenary trolls working out of former call centers-that experts say aided Duterte's rise to power. Since assuming office in 2016, Duterte has reportedly ramped up these efforts while presiding over thousands of extrajudicial killings.<br/>The <url normalizedValue=\"http://newtontechfordev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Architects-of-Networked-Disinformation-Executive-Summary-Final.pdf\">campaign in the Philippines</url> was emblematic of an emerging propaganda playbook, one that uses new tools for the age-old ends of autocracy. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5722805/rethink-information-war-russia/\">Kremlin has long been an innovator in this area</url>. (A 2011 manual for Russian civil servants favorably compared their methods of disinformation to \"an invisible radiation\" that takes effect while \"the population doesn't even feel it is being acted upon.\") But with the technological advances of the past decade, and the global proliferation of smartphones, governments around the world have found success deploying Kremlin-honed techniques against their own people.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Peter Pomerantsev on Russia and the menace of unreality</url>]<br/>In the United States, we tend to view such tools of oppression as the faraway problems of more fragile democracies. But the people working to reelect Trump understand the power of these tactics. They may use gentler terminology-muddy the waters; alternative facts-but they're building a machine designed to exploit their own sprawling disinformation architecture.<br/>Central to that effort is the campaign's use of micro-targeting-the process of slicing up the electorate into distinct niches and then appealing to them with precisely tailored digital messages. The advantages of this approach are obvious: An ad that calls for defunding Planned Parenthood might get a mixed response from a large national audience, but serve it directly via Facebook to 800 Roman Catholic women in Dubuque, Iowa, and its reception will be much more positive. If candidates once had to shout their campaign promises from a soapbox, micro-targeting allows them to sidle up to millions of voters and whisper personalized messages in their ear.<br/>Parscale didn't invent this practice-Barack Obama's campaign famously used it in 2012, and Clinton's followed suit. But Trump's effort in 2016 was unprecedented, in both its scale and its brazenness. In the final days of the 2016 race, for example, Trump's team tried to suppress turnout among black voters in Florida by slipping ads into their News Feeds that read, \"Hillary Thinks African-Americans Are Super Predators.\" An unnamed campaign official boasted to Bloomberg Businessweek that it was one of \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go\">three major voter suppression operations underway</url>.\" (The other two targeted young women and white liberals.)<br/>The weaponization of micro-targeting was pioneered in large part by the data scientists at Cambridge Analytica. The firm began as part of a nonpartisan military contractor that used digital psyops to target terrorist groups and drug cartels. In Pakistan, it worked to thwart jihadist recruitment efforts; in South America, it circulated disinformation to turn drug dealers against their bosses.<br/>The emphasis shifted once the conservative billionaire Robert Mercer became a major investor and installed Steve Bannon as his point man. Using a massive trove of data it had gathered from Facebook and other sources-without users' consent-Cambridge Analytica worked <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">to develop detailed \"psychographic profiles\"</url> for every voter in the U.S., and began experimenting with ways to stoke paranoia and bigotry by exploiting certain personality traits. In one exercise, the firm asked white men whether they would approve of their daughter marrying a Mexican immigrant; those who said yes were asked a follow-up question designed to provoke irritation at the constraints of political correctness: \"Did you feel like you had to say that?\"<br/>Christopher Wylie, who was the director of research at Cambridge Analytica and later testified about the company to Congress, told me that \"with the right kind of nudges,\" people who exhibited certain psychological characteristics could be pushed into ever more extreme beliefs and conspiratorial thinking. \"Rather than using data to interfere with the process of radicalization, Steve Bannon was able to invert that,\" Wylie said. \"We were essentially seeding an insurgency in the United States.\"<br/>Cambridge Analytica was dissolved in 2018, shortly after its CEO was caught on tape bragging about using bribery and sexual \"honey traps\" on behalf of clients. (The firm denied that it actually used such tactics.) Since then, some political scientists have questioned how much effect its \"psychographic\" targeting really had. But Wylie-who spoke with me from London, where he now works for H&amp;amp;M, as a fashion-trend forecaster-said the firm's work in 2016 was a modest test run compared with what could come.<br/>\"What happens if North Korea or Iran picks up where Cambridge Analytica left off?\" he said, noting that plenty of foreign actors will be looking for ways to interfere in this year's election. \"There are countless hostile states that have more than enough capacity to quickly replicate what we were able to do  and make it much more sophisticated.\" These efforts may not come only from abroad: A group of former Cambridge Analytica employees have formed a new firm that, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/96928216bdc341ada659447973a688e4\">according to the Associated Press</url>, is working with the Trump campaign. (The firm has denied this, and a campaign spokesperson declined to comment.)<br/>After the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?hp&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;amp;module=first-column-region&amp;amp;region=top-news&amp;amp;WT.nav=top-news\">Facebook was excoriated for its mishandling of user data</url> and complicity in the viral spread of fake news. Mark Zuckerberg promised to do better, and rolled out a flurry of reforms. But then, last fall, he handed a major victory to lying politicians: Candidates, he said, would be allowed to continue running false ads on Facebook. (Commercial advertisers, by contrast, are subject to fact-checking.) In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10109815371842941/?notif_id=1571332000346664&amp;amp;notif_t=live_video\">a speech at Georgetown University</url>, the CEO argued that his company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/business/zuckerberg-facebook-free-speech.html\">shouldn't be responsible for arbitrating political speech</url>, and that because political ads already receive so much scrutiny, candidates who choose to lie will be held accountable by journalists and watchdogs.<br/>To bolster his case, Zuckerberg pointed to the recently launched-and publicly accessible-<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/\">\"library\" where Facebook archives every political ad it publishes</url>. The project has a certain democratic appeal: Why censor false or toxic content when a little sunlight can have the same effect? But spend some time scrolling through the archive of Trump reelection ads, and you quickly see the limits of this transparency.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/is-the-first-amendment-obsolete/563762/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The age of reverse censorship</url>]<br/>The campaign doesn't run just one ad at a time on a given theme. It runs hundreds of iterations-adjusting the language, the music, even the colors of the \"Donate\" buttons. In the 10 weeks after the House of Representatives began its impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign ran roughly 14,000 different ads containing the word impeachment. Sifting through all of them is virtually impossible.<br/>Both parties will rely on micro-targeted ads this year, but the president is likely to have a distinct advantage. The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign have reportedly compiled an average of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/1217/Watch-golf-Own-guns-Trump-data-team-has-ads-just-for-you\">3,000 data points on every voter in America</url>. They have spent years experimenting with ways to tweak their messages based not just on gender and geography, but on whether the recipient owns a gun or watches the Golf Channel.<br/>While these ads can be used to try to win over undecided voters, they're most often deployed for fundraising and for firing up the faithful-and Trump's advisers believe this election will be decided by mobilization, not persuasion. To turn out the base, the campaign has signaled that it will return to familiar themes: the threat of \"illegal aliens\"-<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-brad-parscale-once-a-nobody-in-san-antonio-shaped-trumps-combative-politics-and-rose-to-his-inner-circle/2018/11/09/b4257d58-dbb7-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html\">a term Parscale has reportedly encouraged Trump to use</url>-and the corruption of the \"swamp.\"<br/>Beyond Facebook, the campaign is also investing in a texting platform that could allow it to send anonymous messages directly to millions of voters' phones without their permission. Until recently, people had to opt in before a campaign could include them in a mass text. But with new \"peer to peer\" texting apps-including one developed by Gary Coby, a senior Trump adviser-<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbjjw9/text-campaigns-are-changing-american-politics-and-nobodys-ready\">a single volunteer can send hundreds of messages an hour</url>, skirting federal regulations by clicking \"Send\" one message at a time. Notably, these messages aren't required to disclose who's behind them, thanks to a 2002 ruling by the Federal Election Commission that cited the limited number of characters available in a text.<br/>Most experts assume that these regulations will be overhauled sometime after the 2020 election. For now, campaigns from both parties are hoovering up as many cellphone numbers as possible, and Parscale has said texting will be at the center of Trump's reelection strategy. The medium's ability to reach voters is unparalleled: While robocalls get sent to voicemail and email blasts get trapped in spam folders, peer-to-peer texting companies say that at least 90 percent of their messages are opened.<br/>The Trump campaign's texts so far this cycle have focused on shouty fundraising pleas (\"They have NOTHING! IMPEACHMENT IS OVER! Now let's CRUSH our End of Month Goal\"). But the potential for misuse by outside groups is clear-and shady political actors are already discovering how easy it is to wage an untraceable whisper campaign by text.<br/>In 2018, as early voting got under way in Tennessee's Republican gubernatorial primary, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/tn-elections/2018/07/13/tn-governors-race-tennesseans-receive-potentially-illegal-text-messages-attacking-randy-boyd-billlee/783785002/\">voters began receiving text messages</url> attacking two of the candidates' conservative credentials. The texts-written in a conversational style, as if they'd been sent from a friend-were unsigned, and people who tried calling the numbers received a busy signal. The local press covered the smear campaign. Law enforcement was notified. But the source of the texts was never discovered.<br/>WAR ON THE PRESS<br/>One afternoon last March, I was on the phone with a Republican operative close to the Trump family when he casually mentioned that a reporter at Business Insider was about to have a very bad day. The journalist, John Haltiwanger, had tweeted something that annoyed Donald Trump Jr., prompting the coterie of friends and allies surrounding the president's son to drum up a hit piece. The story they had coming, the operative suggested to me, would demolish the reporter's credibility.<br/>I wasn't sure what to make of this gloating-people in Trump's circle have a tendency toward bluster. But a few hours later, the operative sent me a link to a Breitbart News article documenting Haltiwanger's \"history of intense Trump hatred.\" The story was based on a series of Instagram posts-all of them from before Haltiwanger started working at Business Insider-in which he made fun of the president and expressed solidarity with liberal protesters.<br/>The next morning, Don Jr. <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/1108705539951939584?lang=en\">tweeted the story</url> to his 3 million followers, denouncing Haltiwanger as a \"raging lib.\" Other conservatives piled on, and the reporter was bombarded with abusive messages and calls for him to be fired. His employer issued a statement conceding that the Instagram posts were \"not appropriate.\" Haltiwanger kept his job, but the experience, he told me later, \"was bizarre and unsettling.\"<br/>The Breitbart story was part of a coordinated effort by a coalition of Trump allies to air embarrassing information about reporters who produce critical coverage of the president. (The New York Times <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/us/politics/trump-allies-news-media.html\">first reported on this project</url> last summer; since then, it's been described to me in greater detail.) According to people with knowledge of the effort, pro-Trump operatives have scraped social-media accounts belonging to hundreds of political journalists and compiled years' worth of posts into a dossier.<br/>Often when a particular news story is deemed especially unfair-or politically damaging-to the president, Don Jr. will flag it in a text thread that he uses for this purpose. (Among those who text regularly with the president's eldest son, someone close to him told me, are the conservative activist Charlie Kirk; two GOP strategists, Sergio Gor and Arthur Schwartz; Matthew Boyle, a Breitbart editor; and U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell.) Once a story has been marked for attack, someone searches the dossier for material on the journalists involved. If something useful turns up-a problematic old joke; evidence of liberal political views-Boyle turns it into a Breitbart headline, which White House officials and campaign surrogates can then share on social media. (The White House has denied any involvement in this effort.)<br/>Descriptions of the dossier vary. One source I spoke with said that a programmer in India had been paid to organize it into a searchable database, making posts that contain offensive keywords easier to find. Another told me the dossier had expanded to at least 2,000 people, including not just journalists but high-profile academics, politicians, celebrities, and other potential Trump foes. Some of this, of course, may be hyperbolic boasting-but the effort has yielded fruit.<br/>In the past year, the operatives involved have gone after journalists at CNN, The Washington Post, and The New York Times. They exposed one reporter for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/10/08/cnn-reporter-kaitlan-collins-under-fire-for-seven-year-old-homophobic-tweets/\">using the word fag in college</url>, and another for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crappy-jew-year-new-york-times-editor-apologizes-for-offensive-tweets\">posting anti-Semitic and racist jokes a decade ago</url>. These may not have been career-ending revelations, but people close to the project said they're planning to unleash much more opposition research as the campaign intensifies. \"This is innovative shit,\" said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing activist with a history of trolling. \"They're appropriating call-out culture.\"<br/>What's notable about this effort is not that it aims to expose media bias. Conservatives have been complaining-with some merit-about a liberal slant in the press for decades. But in the Trump era, an important shift has taken place. Instead of trying to reform the press, or critique its coverage, today's most influential conservatives <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2017/07/19/breitbarts-boyle-goal-elimination-entire-mainstream-media/\">want to destroy the mainstream media altogether</url>. \"Journalistic integrity is dead,\" Boyle declared in a 2017 speech at the Heritage Foundation. \"There is no such thing anymore. So everything is about weaponization of information.\"<br/>It's a lesson drawn from demagogues around the world: When the press as an institution is weakened, fact-based journalism becomes just one more drop in the daily deluge of content-no more or less credible than partisan propaganda. Relativism is the real goal of Trump's assault on the press, and the more \"enemies of the people\" his allies can take out along the way, the better. \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/us/politics/trump-allies-news-media.html\">A culture war is a war</url>,\" Steve Bannon told the Times last year. \"There are casualties in war.\"<br/>This attitude has permeated the president's base. At rallies, people wear T-shirts that read rope. tree. journalist. some assembly required. A CBS News/YouGov poll has found that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a22600827/donald-trump-supporters-believe-the-media/\">just 11 percent of strong Trump supporters trust the mainstream media</url>-while 91 percent turn to the president for \"accurate information.\" This dynamic makes it all but impossible for the press to hold the president accountable, something Trump himself seems to understand. \"Remember,\" he told a crowd in 2018, \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-44959340/donald-trump-what-you-re-seeing-and-what-you-re-reading-is-not-what-s-happening\">what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening</url>.\"<br/>Bryan Lanza, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016 and remains a White House surrogate, told me flatly that he sees no possibility of Americans establishing a common set of facts from which to conduct the big debates of this year's election. Nor is that his goal. \"It's our job to sell our narrative louder than the media,\" Lanza said. \"They're clearly advocating for a liberal-socialist position, and we're never going to be in concert. So the war continues.\"<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-media-democracy/600763/?utm_source=feed\">From December 2019: The dark psychology of social networks</url>]<br/>Parscale has indicated that he plans to open up a new front in this war: local news. Last year, he said the campaign <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20190531/brad-parscale-genius-who-won-trumps-campaign-and-how-hell-get-him-reelected\">intends to train \"swarms of surrogates\"</url> to undermine negative coverage from local TV stations and newspapers. Polls have long found that Americans across the political spectrum trust local news more than national media. If the campaign has its way, that trust will be eroded by November. \"We can actually build up and fight with the local newspapers,\" Parscale told donors, according to a recording provided by The Palm Beach Post. \"So we're not just fighting on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC with the same 700,000 people watching every day.\"<br/>Running parallel to this effort, some conservatives have been experimenting with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/upshot/fake-local-news.html\">a scheme to exploit the credibility of local journalism</url>. Over the past few years, hundreds of websites with innocuous-sounding names like the Arizona Monitor and The Kalamazoo Times have begun popping up. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/hundreds-of-pink-slime-local-news-outlets-are-distributing-algorithmic-stories-conservative-talking-points.php\">At first glance, they look like regular publications, complete with community notices and coverage of schools</url>. But look closer and you'll find that there are often no mastheads, few if any bylines, and no addresses for local offices. Many of them are organs of Republican lobbying groups; others belong to a mysterious company called Locality Labs, which is run by a conservative activist in Illinois. Readers are given no indication that these sites have political agendas-which is precisely what makes them valuable.<br/>According to one longtime strategist, candidates looking to plant a negative story about an opponent can pay to have their desired headlines posted on some of these Potemkin news sites. By working through a third-party consulting firm-instead of paying the sites directly-candidates are able to obscure their involvement in the scheme when they file expenditures to the Federal Election Commission. Even if the stories don't fool savvy readers, the headlines are convincing enough to be flashed across the screen in a campaign commercial or slipped into fundraising emails.<br/>DIGITAL DIRTY TRICKS<br/>Shortly after polls closed in Kentucky's gubernatorial election last November, an anonymous Twitter user named @Overlordkraken1 announced to his 19 followers that he had \"just shredded a box of Republican mail in ballots\" in Louisville.<br/>There was little reason to take this claim at face value, and plenty of reason to doubt it (beginning with the fact that he'd misspelled Louisville). But the race was tight, and as incumbent Governor Matt Bevin began to fall behind in the vote total, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/kentucky-election-disinformation-twitter.html\">an army of Twitter bots began spreading the election-rigging claim</url>.<br/>The original post was removed by Twitter, but by then thousands of automated accounts were circulating screenshots of it with the hashtag #StoptheSteal. Popular right-wing internet personalities jumped on the narrative, and soon the Bevin campaign was making noise about unspecified voting \"irregularities.\" When the race was called for his opponent, the governor refused to concede, and asked for a statewide review of the vote. (No evidence of ballot-shredding was found, and he finally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/politics/kentucky-governor-recanvas-begins/index.html\">admitted defeat nine days later</url>.)<br/>The Election Night disinformation blitz had all the markings of a foreign influence operation. In 2016, Russian trolls had worked in similar ways to contaminate U.S. political discourse-<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/17/russia-social-media-senate-report/2334382002/\">posing as Black Lives Matter activists</url> in an attempt to inflame racial divisions, and fanning pro-Trump conspiracy theories. (They even used Facebook to organize rallies, including one for Muslim supporters of Clinton in Washington, D.C., where they <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/russians-organized-pro-anti-trump-rallies-to-sow-discord-2018-2#july-9-2016-washington-dc-2\">got someone to hold up a sign</url> attributing a fictional quote to the candidate: \"I think Sharia law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.\")<br/>But when Twitter employees later reviewed the activity surrounding Kentucky's election, they concluded that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/kentucky-election-disinformation-twitter.html\">bots were largely based in America</url>-a sign that political operatives here were learning to mimic Russian trolling tactics.<br/>Of course, dirty tricks aren't new to American politics. From Lee Atwater and Roger Stone to the crooked machine Democrats of Chicago, the country has a long history of underhanded operatives smearing opponents and meddling in elections. And, in fact, Samuel Woolley, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/samuel-woolley/the-reality-game/9781541768253/\">a scholar who studies digital propaganda</url>, told me that the first documented deployment of politicized Twitter bots was in the U.S. In 2010, an Iowa-based conservative group set up a small network of automated accounts with names like @BrianD82 to promote the idea that Martha Coakley, a Democrat running for Senate in Massachusetts, was anti-Catholic.<br/>Since then, the tactics of Twitter warfare have grown more sophisticated, as regimes around the world experiment with new ways to deploy their cybermilitias. In Mexico, supporters of then-President Enrique Pe\u00b1a Nieto created \"sock puppet\" accounts to pose as protesters and sabotage the opposition movement. In Azerbaijan, a pro-government youth group waged coordinated harassment campaigns against journalists, flooding their Twitter feeds with graphic threats and insults. When these techniques prove successful, Woolley told me, Americans improve upon them. \"It's almost as if there's a Columbian exchange between developing-world authoritarian regimes and the West,\" he said.<br/>Parscale has denied that the campaign uses bots, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/60_minutes/video/elHhrLFmOS2ZYFqRG68KQPAu0_aUKPKC/who-is-brad-parscale-/\">saying in a 60 Minutes interview</url>, \"I don't think [they] work.\" He may be right-it's unlikely that these nebulous networks of trolls and bots could swing a national election. But they do have their uses. They can simulate false consensus, derail sincere debate, and hound people out of the public square.<br/>According to one study, <url normalizedValue=\"https://firstmonday.org/article/view/7090/5653\">bots accounted for roughly 20 percent</url> of all the tweets posted about the 2016 election during one five-week period that year. And Twitter is already infested with bots that seem designed to boost Trump's reelection prospects. Regardless of where they're coming from, they have tremendous potential to divide, radicalize, and stoke hatred that lasts long after the votes are cast.<br/>Rob Flaherty, who served as the digital director for Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaign, told me that Twitter in 2020 is a \"hall of mirrors.\" He said one mysterious account started <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/orourke-campaign-responds-to-bot-promoted-conspiracy-theory-that-odessa-shooter-was-a-supporter/\">a viral rumor</url> that the gunman who killed seven people in Odessa, Texas, last summer had a beto bumper sticker on his car. Another masqueraded as an O'Rourke supporter and hurled racist invective at a journalist. Some of these tactics echoed 2016, when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/04/12/new-data-suggests-russians-targeted-bernie-sanders-voters-to-help-elect-trump/\">Russian agitators posed as Bernie Sanders supporters</url> and stirred up anger toward Hillary Clinton.<br/>Flaherty said he didn't know who was behind the efforts targeting O'Rourke, and the candidate dropped out before they could make a real difference. \"But you can't watch this landscape and not get the feeling that someone's fucking with something,\" he told me. Flaherty has since joined Joe Biden's campaign, which has had to contend with similar distortions: Last year, a website resembling an official Biden campaign page appeared on the internet. It emphasized elements of the candidate's legislative record likely to hurt him in the Democratic primary-opposition to same-sex marriage, support for the Iraq War-and featured video clips of his awkward encounters with women. The site quickly became one of the most-visited Biden-related sites on the web. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/us/politics/fake-joe-biden-website.html\">It was designed by a Trump consultant</url>.<br/>FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE<br/>As the president's reelection machine ramps up, Democratic strategists have found themselves debating an urgent question: Can they defeat the Trump coalition without adopting its tactics?<br/>On one side of this argument is Dmitri Mehlhorn, a consultant notorious for his willingness to experiment with digital subterfuge. During Alabama's special election in 2017, Mehlhorn helped fund at least two \"false flag\" operations against the Republican Senate candidate, Roy Moore. For one scheme, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/alabama-senate-roy-jones-russia.html\">faux Russian Twitter bots followed the candidate's account</url> to make it look like the Kremlin was backing Moore. For another, a fake social-media campaign, dubbed \"Dry Alabama,\" was designed to link Moore to fictional Baptist teetotalers trying to ban alcohol. (Mehlhorn has claimed that he unaware of the Russian bot effort and does not support the use of misinformation.)<br/>When The New York Times <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/alabama-senate-facebook-roy-moore.html\">uncovered the second plot, one of the activists involved, Matt Osborne, contended</url> that Democrats had no choice but to employ such unscrupulous techniques. \"If you don't do it, you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back,\" Osborne said. \"You have a moral imperative to do this-to do whatever it takes.\"<br/>Others have argued that this is precisely the wrong moment for Democrats to start abandoning ideals of honesty and fairness. \"It's just not in my values to go out there making shit up and tricking voters,\" Flaherty told me. \"I know there's this whole fight-fire-with-fire contingent, but generally when you ask them what they mean, they're like, ~Lie!'S\" Some also note that the president has already handed them plenty of ammunition. \"I don't think the Democratic campaign is going to need to make stuff up about Trump,\" Judd Legum, the author of a progressive newsletter about digital politics, told me. \"They can stick to things that are true.\"<br/>One Democrat straddling these two camps is a young, tech-savvy strategist named Tara McGowan. Last fall, she and the former Obama adviser David Plouffe launched a political-action committee with a pledge to spend $75 million attacking Trump online. At the time, the president's campaign was running more ads on Facebook and Google than the top four Democratic candidates combined. McGowan's plans to return fire included such ads, but she also had more creative-and controversial-measures in mind.<br/>For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-25/acronym-s-newsrooms-are-a-liberal-digital-spin-on-local-news\">she established a media organization with a staff of writers</url> to produce left-leaning \"hometown news\" stories that can be micro-targeted to persuadable voters on Facebook without any indication that they're paid for by a political group. Though she insists that the reporting is strictly factual, some see the enterprise as a too-close-for-comfort co-opting of right-wing tactics.<br/>When I spoke with McGowan, she was open about her willingness to push boundaries that might make some Democrats queasy. As far as she was concerned, the \"super-predator\" ads Trump ran to depress black turnout in 2016 were \"fair game\" because they had some basis in fact. (Clinton did use the term in 1996, to refer to gang members.) McGowan suggested that a similar approach could be taken with conservatives. <url normalizedValue=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/facebook-silicon-valley-democratic-party.html\">She ruled out attempts to misinform Republicans about when and where to vote</url>-a tactic Mehlhorn reportedly considered, though he later said he was joking-but said she would pursue any strategy that was \"in the bounds of the law.\"<br/>\"We are in a radically disruptive moment right now,\" McGowan told me. \"We have a president that lies every day, unabashedly  I think Trump is so desperate to win this election that he will do anything. There will be no bar too low for him.\"<br/>This intraparty split was highlighted last year when state officials urged the Democratic National Committee to formally disavow the use of bots, troll farms, and \"deepfakes\" (digitally manipulated videos that can, with alarming precision, make a person appear to do or say anything). Supporters saw the proposed pledge as a way of contrasting their party's values with those of the GOP. But after months of lobbying, the committee refused to adopt the pledge.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/realitys-end/556877/?utm_source=feed\">From May 2018: The era of fake video begins</url>]<br/>Meanwhile, experts worried about domestic disinformation are looking to other countries for lessons. The most successful recent example may be Indonesia, which cracked down on the problem after a wave of viral lies and conspiracy theories pushed by hard-line Islamists led to the defeat of a popular Christian Chinese candidate for governor in 2016. To prevent a similar disruption in last year's presidential election, a coalition of journalists from more than two dozen top Indonesian news outlets worked together to identify and debunk hoaxes before they gained traction online. But while that may sound like a promising model, it was paired with aggressive efforts by the state to monitor and arrest purveyors of fake news-an approach that would run afoul of the First Amendment if attempted in the U.S.<br/>Richard Stengel, who served as the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy under President Obama, spent almost three years trying to counter digital propaganda from the Islamic State and Russia. By the time he left office, he told me, he was convinced that disinformation would continue to thrive until big tech companies were forced to take responsibility for it. Stengel has proposed amending the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability for messages posted by third parties. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter, he believes, should be required by law to police their platforms for disinformation and abusive trolling. \"It's not going to solve the whole problem,\" he told me, \"but it's going to help with volume.\"<br/>There is one other case study to consider. During the Ukrainian revolution in 2014, pro-democracy activists found that they could defang much of the false information about their movement by repeatedly exposing its Russian origins. But this kind of transparency comes with a cost, Stengel observed. Over time, alertness to the prevalence of propaganda can curdle into paranoia. Russian operatives have been known to encourage such anxiety by spreading rumors that exaggerate their own influence. Eventually, the fear of covert propaganda inflicts as much damage as the propaganda itself.<br/>Once you internalize the possibility that you're being manipulated by some hidden hand, nothing can be trusted. Every dissenting voice on Twitter becomes a Russian bot, every uncomfortable headline a false flag, every political development part of an ever-deepening conspiracy. By the time the information ecosystem collapses under the weight of all this cynicism, you're too vigilant to notice that the disinformationists have won.<br/>POWERS OF INCUMBENCY<br/>If there's one thing that can be said for Brad Parscale, it's that he runs a tight ship. Unauthorized leaks from inside the campaign are rare; press stories on palace intrigue are virtually nonexistent. When the staff first moved into its new offices last year, journalists were periodically invited to tour the facility-but Parscale put an end to the practice: He didn't want them glimpsing a scrap of paper or a whiteboard scribble that they weren't supposed to see.<br/>Notably, while the Trump White House has endured a seemingly endless procession of shake-ups, the Trump reelection campaign has seen very little turnover since Parscale took charge. His staying power is one reason many Republicans-inside the organization or out-hesitate to talk about him on the record. But among allies of the president, there appears to be a growing skepticism.<br/>Former colleagues began noticing a change in Parscale after his promotion. Suddenly, the quiet guy with his face buried in a laptop was wearing designer suits, tossing out MAGA hats at campaign rallies, and traveling to Europe to speak at a political-marketing conference. In the past few years, Parscale has bought a BMW, a Range Rover, a condo, and a $2.4 million waterfront house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \"He knows he has the confidence of the family,\" one former colleague told me, \"which gives him more swagger.\" When <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7375719/Brad-Parscale-fortune-companies-cut-Trumps-campaign-contributions.html\">the U.K.'s Daily Mail ran a story spotlighting Parscale's spending spree</url>, he attempted deflection through flattery. \"The president is an excellent businessman,\" he told the tabloid, \"and being associated with him for years has been extremely beneficial to my family.\"<br/>But according to a former White House official with knowledge of the incident, Trump was irritated by the coverage, and the impression it created that his campaign manager was getting rich off him. For a moment, Parscale's standing appeared to be in peril, but then Trump's attention was diverted by the G7 summit in France, and he never returned to the issue. (A spokesperson for the campaign disputed this account.)<br/>Some Republicans worry that for all Parscale's digital expertise, he doesn't have the vision to guide Trump to reelection. The president is historically unpopular, and even in red states, he has struggled to mobilize his base for special elections. If Trump's message is growing stale with voters, is Parscale the man to help overhaul it? \"People start to ask the question-you're building this apparatus, and that's great, but what's the overarching narrative?\" said a former campaign staffer.<br/>But whether Trump finds a new narrative or not, he has something this time around that he didn't have in 2016-the powers of the presidency. While every commander in chief looks for ways to leverage his incumbency for reelection, Trump has shown that he's willing to go much further than most. In the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, he seized on reports of a migrant caravan traveling to the U.S. from Central America to claim that the southern border was facing a national-security crisis. Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/us/politics/caravan-trump-shooting-elections.html\">warned of a coming \"invasion\"</url> and claimed, without evidence, that the caravan <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1056919064906469376\">had been infiltrated by gang members</url>.<br/>Parscale aided this effort by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-brad-parscale-once-a-nobody-in-san-antonio-shaped-trumps-combative-politics-and-rose-to-his-inner-circle/2018/11/09/b4257d58-dbb7-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html\">creating a 30-second commercial</url> that interspersed footage of Hispanic migrants with clips of a convicted cop-killer. The ad ended with an urgent call to action: stop the caravan. vote republican. In a final maneuver before the election, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/us/politics/american-troops-border-migrants.html\">Trump dispatched U.S. troops to the border</url>. The president insisted that the operation was necessary to keep America safe-but within weeks the troops were quietly called back, the \"crisis\" having apparently ended once votes were cast. Skeptics were left to wonder: If Trump is willing to militarize the border to pick up a few extra seats in the midterms, what will he and his supporters do when his reelection is on the line?<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/dispatch-tries-sell-real-news-right/605860/?utm_source=feed\">Read: McKay Coppins on the conservatives trying to ditch fake news</url>]<br/>It doesn't require an overactive imagination to envision a worst-case scenari On Election Day, anonymous text messages direct voters to the wrong polling locations, or maybe even circulate rumors of security threats. Deepfakes of the Democratic nominee using racial slurs crop up faster than social-media platforms can remove them. As news outlets scramble to correct the inaccuracies, hordes of Twitter bots respond by smearing and threatening reporters. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has spent the final days of the race pumping out Facebook ads at such a high rate that no one can keep track of what they're injecting into the bloodstream.<br/>After the first round of exit polls is released, a mysteriously sourced video surfaces purporting to show undocumented immigrants at the ballot box. Trump begins retweeting rumors of voter fraud and suggests that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers should be dispatched to polling stations. are illegals stealing the election? reads the Fox News chyron. are russians behind false videos? demands MSNBC.<br/>The votes haven't even been counted yet, and much of the country is ready to throw out the result.<br/>NOTHING IS TRUE<br/>There is perhaps no better place to witness what the culture of disinformation has already wrought in America than a Trump campaign rally. One night in November, I navigated through a parking-lot maze of folding tables covered in MAGA merch and entered the BancorpSouth Arena in Tupelo, Mississippi. The election was still a year away, but thousands of sign-waving supporters had crowded into the venue to cheer on the president in person.<br/>Once Trump took the stage, he let loose a familiar flurry of lies, half-lies, hyperbole, and nonsense. He spun his revisionist history of the Ukraine scandal-the one in which Joe Biden is the villain-and claimed, falsely, that the Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams wanted to \"give illegal aliens the right to vote.\" At one point, during a riff on abortion, Trump casually asserted that \"the governor of Virginia executed a baby\"-prompting a woman in the crowd to scream, \"Murderer!\"<br/>This incendiary fabrication didn't seem to register with my companions in the press pen, who were busy writing stories and shooting B-roll. I opened Twitter, expecting to see a torrent of fact-checks laying out the truth of the case-that the governor had been answering a hypothetical question about late-term abortion; that a national firestorm had ensued; that there were certainly different ways to interpret his comments but that not even the most ardent anti-abortion activist thought the governor of Virginia had personally \"executed a baby.\"<br/>But Twitter was uncharacteristically quiet (apparently the president had said this before), and the most widely shared tweet I found on the subject was from his own campaign, which had blasted out a context-free clip of the governor's abortion comments to back up Trump's smear.<br/><br/>After the rally, I loitered near one of the exits, chatting with people as they filed out of the arena. Among liberals, there is a comforting caricature of Trump supporters as gullible personality cultists who have been hypnotized into believing whatever their leader says. The appeal of this theory is the implication that the spell can be broken, that truth can still triumph over lies, that someday everything could go back to normal-<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/the-strange-effect-fact-checking-has-on-trump-supporters/532701/?utm_source=feed\">if only these voters were exposed to the facts</url>. But the people I spoke with in Tupelo seemed to treat matters of fact as beside the point.<br/>One woman told me that, given the president's accomplishments, she didn't care if he \"fabricates a little bit.\" A man responded to my questions about Trump's dishonest attacks on the press with a shrug and a suggestion that the media \"ought to try telling the truth once in a while.\" Tony Willnow, a 34-year-old maintenance worker who had an American flag wrapped around his head, observed that Trump had won because he said things no other politician would say. When I asked him if it mattered whether those things were true, he thought for a moment before answering. \"He tells you what you want to hear,\" Willnow said. \"And I don't know if it's true or not-but it sounds good, so fuck it.\"<br/>The political theorist Hannah Arendt once wrote that the most successful totalitarian leaders of the 20th century instilled in their followers \"a mixture of gullibility and cynicism.\" When they were lied to, they chose to believe it. When a lie was debunked, they claimed they'd known all along-and would then \"admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.\" Over time, Arendt wrote, the onslaught of propaganda conditioned people to \"believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true.\"<br/>Leaving the rally, I thought about Arendt, and the swaths of the country that are already gripped by the ethos she described. Should it prevail in 2020, the election's legacy will be clear-not a choice between parties or candidates or policy platforms, but a referendum on reality itself.<br/><br/>This article appears in the March 2020 print edition with the headline \"The 2020 Disinformation War.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLANT-the2020disinformationwar605530</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLANT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7H-SSM1-JCG7-V0WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">368376</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Over the course of six-hours, US congressmen in an anti-trust sub-committee grilled the $4.5 trillion industry\u2019s elite chiefs. The tech sector, it was argued, had become too powerful, wielding its dominance against rivals, occasionally against its very own consumers and now frequently, against democracy itself as algorithms amplified political echo chambers and biases.    \u201cOur goal is (to be) the best, not the most. Apple does not have a dominant share in any market or any product category where we do business\u201d \u2013 Tim Cook to US congress    Credit: Visual Capitalist is also the Battle for Luxury fashion\u2019s next frontier   Indeed, the Big Five Tech companies generate $900 billion, rivalling the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of countries like Netherlands and even oil-rich Saudi Arabia. Four out of five of Big Tech companies have achieved trillion-dollar market capitalisations, eclipsing Big Oil and other major industry groups to comprise some of the most valuable publicly-traded companies in the world.       With the global coronavirus pandemic, these valuations are set to rocket as digital disruption becomes the new normal. But early Thursday morning, 13 August, the Big Tech cash grab grew heated as Epic Games, maker of the popular billion dollar game- Fortnite , provoked a ban from tech giants Apple and Google in apparent violation of respective App store policies concerning in-app transactions, and in response, a lawsuit from the game developer.    These Fortnite skins are typically priced between $13 and $18 and nothing is known about Nike\u2019s revenue split with Epic Games but what is known, is that Big Tech like Apple and Google want their 30% cut of the sale of digital fashion and accessories via in-app transactions.    In normal times, greater technological adoption is the biggest driver of increased revenues. During a pandemic, in-home quarantine has sent the tech sector into overdrive as people were forced to live in a combination of virtual and physical environments. Pre-pandemic, Epic Games banked a cool $3 billion in 2018 on the back of Fortnite, an online survival video game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player combat to be the last one standing. Fast-paced, action-packed, and not unlike The Hunger Games, it looks like real life is about to mirror the game\u2019s Battle Royale mode as tech conglomerates find new ways to earn a larger slice of the pie for themselves.    It\u2019s not hyperbole either, if the idea of an in-game Travis Scott concert might seem silly, the 12.3 million Fortnite players who attended the extravaganza in game proves that the game is more than virtual.       Fortnite\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 133 million times on iPhones and iPads and brought in roughly $1.2 billion, and Apple has taken $360 million of that revenue as part of its commission \u2013 Sensor Tower on how lucrative Fortnite has been for Epic Games and Apple   The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes: Virtual Fashion becomes Big Business   Fortnite is free to play but makes money selling digital items like virtual clothing or \u201cskins\u201d. Pre-pandemic, Nike\u2019s Jordan brand teamed with the massively popular online game to show off some of the brand\u2019s signature sneakers. The #FortniteXJumpman collaboration saw two new limited edition skins for characters, wearing streetwear icon Nike Air Force 1s in a variety of colours including the signature black and red Chicago Bull\u2019s colour scheme. These Fortnite skins are typically priced between $13 and $18 and nothing is known about Nike\u2019s revenue split with Epic Games but what is known, is that Big Tech like Apple and Google want their 30% cut of the sale via in-app transactions.       It\u2019s hard to imagine but as late as August 2019, many fashion retailer senior executives were still confused as to why anyone would pay real money for virtual garments and accessories. Speaking with CNBC, Scandinavian fashion retailer Carlings approached Virtue, the creative agency owned by Vice media, to do something that would draw people to its website. Virtue pitched an idea inspired by games like \u2018Fortnite\u2019 and the concept of \u201cvirtual skinning\u201d, arguing that digital clothing was what you\u2019d have on web shops in the near future. Carlings CEO Ronny Mikalsen called it \u201cthe strangest meeting of my life. I didn\u2019t understand what they were talking about, making a digital collection \u2026 I was like, this can\u2019t be serious.\u201d       Four months later, fashion and cosmetics collaborations have hit the online gaming scene in a big way, looking for new audiences in a US$152 billion market. Earlier this year, Louis Vuitton teamed up with Riot Games to create a series of digital \u201cskins\u201d for characters in League of Legends as well as capsule collections that can be worn in real life.    Louis Vuitton\u2019s capsule collections for League of Legends including clothing and accessories which included a US$5,600 leather jacket designed by Louis Vuitton\u2019s artistic director of women\u2019s collections Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re each item possessed \u201cunique and original references true to the universes of League of Legends.\u201d       According to analytics firm Newzoo, China and the Asia-Pacific market is particularly important \u2013 in 2018, China\u2019s online gaming population (which includes mobile gamers) was made up of nearly half a billion players, with women making up more than half of this market. They also  forecasted over $40 billion in virtual gaming revenue in China.   The Pandemic makes Digital Disruption the New Normal: Nike, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Valentino are some of the new players   When the global pandemic hit and the subsequent national lockdown measures took place, the virtual environments of these online games became fashion\u2019s new battlegrounds. Free of the COVID-19, masses including A-list celebrities like Chrissy Teigen and Brie Larson have called the online world of Animal Crossing home. Such is the game\u2019s popularity that the Nintendo Switch handheld console on which it is played, has remained sold out since lockdowns began rolling out in March.    Valentino in Animal Crossing    Locked in and with no avenues to \u2018peacock\u2019 their style, sartorially minded players have taken to designing clothes for their Animal Crossing avatars, recreating high fashion and streetwear looks. At first, a majority of these virtual garments were re-created by virtual wardrobes with the creations on Animal Crossing Fashion Archive, which is run by fashion photographer and visual artist, Kara Chung. Painstakingly, Chung\u2019s Animal Crossing Fashion Archive became a source for players to don the hippest designs from Chanel, Dior, and old Celine.    Anna Sui in Animal Crossing    From virtual rip-offs to collaboration, luxury fashion brands like Marc Jacobs, Valentino and Anna Sui have gotten in on the action, allowing players to dress their characters in any item from Marc Jacobs\u2019 Animal Crossing capsule, or choose from a selection of looks.Valentino also digitised Spring/Summer 2020 and Pre-Fall 2020 collections, players can also don Moncler\u2019s puffer jackets virtually, while these fashion offerings are entirely free, the lawsuit between Fortnite creator Epic Games and Apple and Google, will shape the future of digital luxury fashion.      Fortnite\u2019s in-game clothes have also become a status symbol of sorts among today\u2019s youth. Techspot raised the point that Fortnite is more than a player vs. player competitive title, the game also serves as a digital playground and a place to hang out and socialise with peers. As is the case with real-world playgrounds, Fortnite\u2019s digital space is ripe with bullies. And just like in the real world, one\u2019s outward appearance can be a prime target for teasing : A \u201cdefault\u201d character outfit can attract bullying, leading many to believe that having individualised in-game costume is a form of \u201cstreet-cred\u201d among pre-teens and Gen Z. Hence, fashion as a tool for expression is as vital in the virtual world as it is in the real world.    Louis Vuitton League of Legends capsule collection was available both online and offline   David versus Goliath: Epic Games versus Apple   According to Tech Crunch, Epic Games never had a problem making money. Their first game, Gear of Wars grossed $100 million on a $12 million development budget. But with Fortnite, the company redefined modern gaming by making true cross-platform experiences possible and by pulling in vast amounts of money . Epic Games is privately held and hence keeps its financials closely guarded.    Sensor Tower, a tech blog tracking the global app economy, discerned that players spent an average of $1.23 million per day in the iOS version of Fortnite in 2018, contributing a total of approximately $37 million to the game\u2019s life-to-date gross of more than $385 million. Fortnite\u2019s sixth season began in September 2018, bringing in an estimated $17.6 million in its first week on Apple\u2019s platform, an increase of 41% over the previous week. When player spending surged past the $1 billion mark amid the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, it was immediately clear to Big Tech what was at stake when Epic Games started encouraging Fortnite\u2019s mobile-app users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google. The companies require that all in-app payments are handled through their eco-systems so they can collect a 30% commission, a policy that has been at the center of antitrust complaints against the companies.       According to Sensor Tower, Fortnite\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 133 million times on iPhones and iPads and brought in roughly $1.2 billion, and Apple has taken $360 million of that revenue as part of its commission, call us cynical, but it\u2019s easy to see why the Cupertino brand wouldn\u2019t give that up without a fight.    It was a war that Epic Games was apparently prepared to wage. Just after the ban, the game developer launched a snarky public relations campaign, lampooning Apple\u2019s famous Orwell 1984 advert from the Cupertino company\u2019s own fight against IBM 36 years ago. This time, it was Fortnite characters who were defying Apple\u2019s totalitarian regime. According to NYT, #FreeFortnite was the top trend on Twitter within hours as Google followed suit and also removed Fortnite from its Android Play app store later that day. That said, the Android eco-system allows for external 3rd party downloads and so, Fortnite still remains available on Android phones, hence the battle between Apple and Epic Games is the one closely watched as it sets a precedent for how brands can potentially interact with their virtual partners for years to come.       Apple has been subject to anti-competitive investigation by European regulators and the US Justice Department over the last few years following complaints from App developers that Apple is taking an unfair cut of their business and in some instances, competing with their apps with its own offerings. Indeed, Apple has a business philosophy of acquiring small companies that can be easily integrated into existing company projects , in some cases, they would buy up a smaller rival of a dominant software developer and then repackage a competing product as their own.    The services business is Apple\u2019s second largest source of revenue after iPhone sales. Given increasingly competition from the likes of Huawei and Samsung, the $51.7 billion iPhone revenue has been under increasing pressure and so the 30% service commission is a vital component of the world\u2019s most valuable company\u2019s profit and growth machine. While it is clear that the $1.58 trillion company is clearly the Goliath in this fight; Epic, a North Carolina company valued at roughly $17 billion and partially owned by the Chinese internet giant Tencent, is no mere David either.    David, with sword and empty sling, poised above Goliath about to take his head. A statue in the forecourt of Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland, England    It appears that the strategy is to sacrifice millions of dollars in revenue in a fight that will keep Fortnite off iPhones but alienate Apple\u2019s core consumers since the game still remains available to Android users who can download it outside the official  Play  store. Fortnite announced more than 350 million registered players in May and if a percentage of those players, suddenly find themselves unable to get updates of their beloved game on iOS, Apple might witness a mass migration to Android devices instead. It\u2019s not just a battle in courts of law but also the court of public opinion.    Epic Games is not the first software company with issues against Apple. Other big players like music streamer Spotify and email app-maker Blix have also made formal complaints to regulators in Europe and the United States.    Beyond how luxury fashion might eventually sell virtual garments in online games like Carlings\u2019 digital collection which starts at $9 for a headband and up to $27 for an oversized shiny nylon puffer jacket,  Forbes senior tech contributor John Koetsier also posits that this is also a war for the future of mobile in-app payments: Will the old-school PC-centric model of a company (Apple or Google) selling a device (laptop) which the customer (you) can install any software you want on from any source win, or will the new-school locked-down one-official-place-to-get-software model win? At stake is likely tens of billions in Apple and Google annual revenue.

Indian regulators, used to lectures and advocacy from global firms and diplomats peddling their models - not intellectually different from Thomas Macaulay's quip in 1835 that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India - should be proud of reaching our target of a billion monthly digital payments. We make the case that digital payment transactions on the Universal Payment Interface (UPI) platform rising from 0.1 million in October 2016 to 1.3 billion in January 2020 represents the magic of entrepreneurs, nonprofits and policymakers working together. And gives us a new target - a billion transactions a day.</p><p>India was long a financially excluded nation - only 17 per cent of Indians had a bank account in 2011. The World Bank suggests it would have taken 50 more years for 80 per cent of Indians to get a bank account at the pre-2011 speed. Yet, we reached that milestone in 2018. How? A magical combination of political will (Jan Dhana Yojana and Aadhaar embedding), a proactive central bank (creating a non-profit market participant entity and leveling the playing field between non-banks and banks), and a technology stack with three layers (identity, payments, and data).</p><p>India's payment revolution comes from a clear vision (shifting the system from low volume, high value, and high cost to high volume, low value, low cost), a clear strategy (regulated and unregulated private players innovating on top of public infrastructure) and trade-offs balanced by design (regulation vs innovation, privacy vs personalisation, and ease-of-use vs fraud prevention). Consumers wanted a payment experience that was mobile-first, low-cost, 24/7, instant, convenient, interoperable, fintech friendly, inside banking, and safe. This was UPI, a platform operated by the entrepreneurial nonprofit National Payments Corporation of India. UPI created interoperability between all sources and recipients of funds (consumers, businesses, fintechs, wallets, 140 member banks), settled instantly inside the central bank in fiat money (state-issued money declared by the sovereign to be legal tender) and blunted data monopolies (big tech firms have strong autonomy but weak fiduciary responsibilities over customer data). A new paper by the Bank for International Settlements ('The design of digital financial infrastructure: lessons from India') suggests that India demonstrates how \"a central bank can be proactive and equal partners with private sector counterparts when it comes to fostering technological innovation in finance\".</p><p>UPI offers five policy lessons. First, how the India stack - interconnected yet independent platforms or open APIs - are a public good that lowers costs, spurs innovation, and blunts the natural digital winner-takes-all. Replicating this in education, healthcare, and government services are likely to be a harbinger of large scale multi-domain collaborative innovation. Second, collaboration can create ecosystems that overcome the birth defects of its constituents - the execution deficit of government, the trust deficit of private companies, and the scale deficit of nonprofits. Third, complementary policy interventions are important. Demonetisation and GST are changing the stories that firms and individuals tell themselves around cash and informality. Fourth, human capital and diversity matter. This revolution needed career bureaucrats to partner with academics, tech entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, global giants and private firms. The final lesson is that India doesn't need to be Western or Chinese to be modern. If our policymakers had copied Alipay or US banks, we wouldn't have leapfrogged their birth defects.</p><p>Google's letter to the Federal Reserve counters powerful lobbying by US banks against the \"FedNow\" payment system that will undermine their supernormal profits. FedNow will do far less than UPI, but its launch delay supports the thesis of the new book, The Great Reversal, by Thomas Philippon that American capitalism, once a model for the world, is giving up on healthy competition. Many sectors are more concentrated than 20 years ago, dominated by fewer and bigger players who lobby politicians aggressively to protect and expand their profit margins. But capitalism without competition - India has seen that movie before - hurts growth, investments, productivity and wages.</p><p>There is more work to be done. The central government must deadline digitising all its payments. The RBI must implement the 100-plus action items arising from its own Vision 2021 document and the Nandan Nilekani Committee for Deepening Digital Payments. It must also make UPI and RuPay fit for use in our $70 billion inward remittances that currently come through exploitative financial institutions which don't have clients but hostages. More importantly, the RBI must replicate the core design of UPI - fierce but sustainable private and public competition - in bank credit because our 50 per cent credit-to -GDP ratio is one of the reasons India is poor. China's 300 per cent is the wrong number, but reaching the OECD average of 100 per cent needs the RBI to do many things - raising its human capital and technology game in regulation and supervision, catalysing an ecosystem for lending against the rapidly expanding digital exhaust of small firms and individuals, issuing more private bank licences, facilitating management changes in old private banks with market caps that signal questions about book value, and shepherding a governance and human capital revolution at PSU banks (their risk-weighted assets being lower than two years ago despite a capital injection of Rs 2.5 lakh crore should be unacceptable).</p><p>Converting the collective independence our citizens got in 1947 to individual freedom surely involved universal financial inclusion. The gap between this aspiration and reality was not a lie but a disappointment because our capital got handicapped without labour and our labour got handicapped without capital. Change has begun - the RBI, the finance ministry, and many individuals deserve our gratitude and duas for a billion digital payments a month. We now ask you for a billion digital payments a day.</p><p>Sabharwal and Phatak are with Teamlease Services and IIT Bombay respectively</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0051601231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y55-YJ21-JB5M-W271-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now, to a billion transactions a day</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google's letter to the US Federal Reserve two months ago asking them to learn from Indian digital payments must be an unfamiliar feeling for the central bank. Indian regulators, used to lectures and advocacy from global firms and diplomats peddling their models - not intellectually different from Thomas Macaulay's quip in 1835 that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India - should be proud of reaching our target of a billion monthly digital payments. We make the case that digital payment transactions on the Universal Payment Interface (UPI) platform rising from 0.1 million in October 2016 to 1.3 billion in January 2020 represents the magic of entrepreneurs, nonprofits and policymakers working together. And gives us a new target - a billion transactions a day.</p><p>India was long a financially excluded nation - only 17 per cent of Indians had a bank account in 2011. The World Bank suggests it would have taken 50 more years for 80 per cent of Indians to get a bank account at the pre-2011 speed. Yet, we reached that milestone in 2018. How? A magical combination of political will (Jan Dhana Yojana and Aadhaar embedding), a proactive central bank (creating a non-profit market participant entity and leveling the playing field between non-banks and banks), and a technology stack with three layers (identity, payments, and data).</p><p>India's payment revolution comes from a clear vision (shifting the system from low volume, high value, and high cost to high volume, low value, low cost), a clear strategy (regulated and unregulated private players innovating on top of public infrastructure) and trade-offs balanced by design (regulation vs innovation, privacy vs personalisation, and ease-of-use vs fraud prevention). Consumers wanted a payment experience that was mobile-first, low-cost, 24/7, instant, convenient, interoperable, fintech friendly, inside banking, and safe. This was UPI, a platform operated by the entrepreneurial nonprofit National Payments Corporation of India. UPI created interoperability between all sources and recipients of funds (consumers, businesses, fintechs, wallets, 140 member banks), settled instantly inside the central bank in fiat money (state-issued money declared by the sovereign to be legal tender) and blunted data monopolies (big tech firms have strong autonomy but weak fiduciary responsibilities over customer data). A new paper by the Bank for International Settlements ('The design of digital financial infrastructure: lessons from India') suggests that India demonstrates how \"a central bank can be proactive and equal partners with private sector counterparts when it comes to fostering technological innovation in finance\".</p><p>UPI offers five policy lessons. First, how the India stack - interconnected yet independent platforms or open APIs - are a public good that lowers costs, spurs innovation, and blunts the natural digital winner-takes-all. Replicating this in education, healthcare, and government services are likely to be a harbinger of large scale multi-domain collaborative innovation. Second, collaboration can create ecosystems that overcome the birth defects of its constituents - the execution deficit of government, the trust deficit of private companies, and the scale deficit of nonprofits. Third, complementary policy interventions are important. Demonetisation and GST are changing the stories that firms and individuals tell themselves around cash and informality. Fourth, human capital and diversity matter. This revolution needed career bureaucrats to partner with academics, tech entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, global giants and private firms. The final lesson is that India doesn't need to be Western or Chinese to be modern. If our policymakers had copied Alipay or US banks, we wouldn't have leapfrogged their birth defects.</p><p>Google's letter to the Federal Reserve counters powerful lobbying by US banks against the \"FedNow\" payment system that will undermine their supernormal profits. FedNow will do far less than UPI, but its launch delay supports the thesis of the new book, The Great Reversal, by Thomas Philippon that American capitalism, once a model for the world, is giving up on healthy competition. Many sectors are more concentrated than 20 years ago, dominated by fewer and bigger players who lobby politicians aggressively to protect and expand their profit margins. But capitalism without competition - India has seen that movie before - hurts growth, investments, productivity and wages.</p><p>There is more work to be done. The central government must deadline digitising all its payments. The RBI must implement the 100-plus action items arising from its own Vision 2021 document and the Nandan Nilekani Committee for Deepening Digital Payments. It must also make UPI and RuPay fit for use in our $70 billion inward remittances that currently come through exploitative financial institutions which don't have clients but hostages. More importantly, the RBI must replicate the core design of UPI - fierce but sustainable private and public competition - in bank credit because our 50 per cent credit-to -GDP ratio is one of the reasons India is poor. China's 300 per cent is the wrong number, but reaching the OECD average of 100 per cent needs the RBI to do many things - raising its human capital and technology game in regulation and supervision, catalysing an ecosystem for lending against the rapidly expanding digital exhaust of small firms and individuals, issuing more private bank licences, facilitating management changes in old private banks with market caps that signal questions about book value, and shepherding a governance and human capital revolution at PSU banks (their risk-weighted assets being lower than two years ago despite a capital injection of Rs 2.5 lakh crore should be unacceptable).</p><p>Converting the collective independence our citizens got in 1947 to individual freedom surely involved universal financial inclusion. The gap between this aspiration and reality was not a lie but a disappointment because our capital got handicapped without labour and our labour got handicapped without capital. Change has begun - the RBI, the finance ministry, and many individuals deserve our gratitude and duas for a billion digital payments a month. We now ask you for a billion digital payments a day.</p><p>Sabharwal and Phatak are with Teamlease Services and IIT Bombay respectively</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0051600087</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y55-YJ21-JB5M-W225-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1089\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We give to the correct candidates, support the correct causes, and even fire the politically incorrect employees. Now our friends have turned on us, writing books and policy manifestos calling for beefed up antitrust and even raising the possibility of the corporate death penalty \u2014 the breakup.</p><p>Meanwhile, conservatives have finally had enough. As natural allies of these entrepreneurial firms, capitalist Republicans spent the past 15 years trying to build bridges to Silicon Valley, without much success. Despite Big Tech\u2019s overwhelming financial support for Democrats, most Republicans admired these most innovative of American firms and resisted the temptation to retaliate. Now, however, conservative patience may finally have run out. They believe the Silicon Valley firms have become explicitly partisan entities \u2014 in politics and the culture wars.</p><p>Combine this partisanship with the overwhelming power to control information (as the Democrats charge), and you make a lot of people nervous. Some of this is political gamesmanship. But many serious conservatives and libertarians are sincerely concerned.</p><p>George Mason University professor Alex Tabarrok, for example, wonders why Google and Apple are blocking Gab, an alternative to Twitter that emphasizes free speech. The number of incidents where YouTube refused to publish mainstream conservative commentary and educational materials has grown, and conservatives have come to view it not as a glitch in Google\u2019s system but a company policy. Tabarrok, echoing my own thoughts, summarizes the deep problem:</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I also fear that Google and Apple haven\u2019t thought very far down the game tree. One of the arguments for leaving the meta-platforms alone is that they are facially neutral with respect to content. But if Google and Apple are explicitly exercising their power over speech on moral and political grounds then they open themselves up to regulation. If code is law then don\u2019t be surprised when the legislators demand to write the code.</p><p>If Silicon Valley wants to do politics, politicians will be more than happy to do tech. This is not an outcome many conservatives and libertarians relish, but neither is unilateral disarmament.</p><p>One irony is that Silicon Valley spent the past 15 years supporting hypothetical scare narratives about internet service providers (ISPs). ISPs were the key gatekeepers of information and, they insisted, monopolists who were likely to block or throttle competitive content or inconvenient speech. The tech firms succeeded in parlaying this story into Title II net neutrality regulations imposed on the ISPs. It was a solution in search of a problem. The fact is, the blocking and throttling never emerged. The ISPs, moreover, never had nearly the insight into the actual content of data traveling across networks, compared to Silicon Valley\u2019s deep knowledge. In hindsight, it looks like a classic case of projection.</p><p>This drama will unfold over the next decade. For now, the take away for me is not that breaking up or regulating the Tech Titans is right.

We give to the correct candidates, support the correct causes, and even fire the politically incorrect employees. Now our friends have turned on us, writing books and policy manifestos calling for beefed up antitrust and even raising the possibility of the corporate death penalty \u2014 the breakup.  </p><p><br/>Meanwhile, conservatives have finally had enough. As natural allies of these entrepreneurial firms, capitalist Republicans spent the past 15 years trying to build bridges to Silicon Valley, without much success. Despite Big Tech\u2019s overwhelming financial support for Democrats, most Republicans admired these most innovative of American firms and resisted the temptation to retaliate. Now, however, conservative patience may finally have run out. They believe the Silicon Valley firms have become explicitly partisan entities \u2014 in politics and the culture wars.  <br/>Combine this partisanship with the overwhelming power to control information (as the Democrats charge), and you make a lot of people nervous. Some of this is political gamesmanship. But many serious conservatives and libertarians are sincerely concerned.  <br/>George Mason University professor Alex Tabarrok, for example, wonders why Google and Apple are blocking Gab, an alternative to Twitter that emphasizes free speech. The number of incidents where YouTube refused to publish mainstream conservative commentary and educational materials has grown, and conservatives have come to view it not as a glitch in Google\u2019s system but a company policy. Tabarrok, echoing my own thoughts, summarizes the deep problem:  <br/>    I also fear that Google and Apple haven\u2019t thought very far down the game tree. One of the arguments for leaving the meta-platforms alone is that they are facially neutral with respect to content. But if Google and Apple are explicitly exercising their power over speech on moral and political grounds then they open themselves up to regulation. If code is law then don\u2019t be surprised when the legislators demand to write the code.  <br/>If Silicon Valley wants to do politics, politicians will be more than happy to do tech. This is not an outcome many conservatives and libertarians relish, but neither is unilateral disarmament.  <br/>One irony is that Silicon Valley spent the past 15 years supporting hypothetical scare narratives about internet service providers (ISPs). ISPs were the key gatekeepers of information and, they insisted, monopolists who were likely to block or throttle competitive content or inconvenient speech. The tech firms succeeded in parlaying this story into Title II net neutrality regulations imposed on the ISPs. It was a solution in search of a problem. The fact is, the blocking and throttling never emerged. The ISPs, moreover, never had nearly the insight into the actual content of data traveling across networks, compared to Silicon Valley\u2019s deep knowledge. In hindsight, it looks like a classic case of projection.  <br/>This drama will unfold over the next decade. For now, the take away for me is not that breaking up or regulating the Tech Titans is right. One take away is that the dominant narrative of the past 15 years was wrong. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN206117320170824</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PB3-HGY1-DXCW-D3BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"573\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 24, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RFI</classCode><className>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

As we have seen, this heavily influences how Big Tech polices content on their platforms. For years, tech companies have waged a very public war against platform users who speak out against the popular narrative, abusing the \"Section 230\" protections Congress created to protect growing tech firms and encourage innovation. The dynamic between users and platforms has changed, though--and now, Congress must change the law that guides that dynamic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Image ENDING CHILD EXPLOITATION</p><p>Social media users have flagged and reported tens of millions of images depicting child sexual abuse, but more often than not, digital platforms delete the evidence before law enforcement officers have a chance to see it.</p><p>My bipartisan END Child Exploitation Act (cosponsored with Senator Cortez Masto from Nevada) was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee this week as an amendment to the EARN IT Act. It will extend Big Tech's data preservation timeline and give law enforcement officers more time to gather evidence against online child predators.</p><p>PROTECTING OUR FREEDOM</p><p>If the COVID-19 pandemic has made one thing clear, it's that the United States needs to reassert its position as a global leader and stand united with our allies and partners against the threat of Chinese and Russian aggression.</p><p>My colleagues and I on the Senate Armed Services Committee have been working hard to set our national defense priorities -- to enhance U.S. global leadership, sustain national security, and secure homegrown manufacturing and innovation.</p><p>SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE MOB</p><p>The threats mounted online against Shuford's Smokehouse, a Chattanooga area business, should worry us all. Freedom's cause is always well served by robust political debate; this is how we arrive at consensus--but the digital mob is not interested in a discussion. They're on a mission to shut down debate by whatever means necessary. To sit back, say nothing and appease the mob will not end well.</p><p>MARSHA'S WRAPUP</p><p>Relying on the Supreme Court to protect women and children from careless abortion providers is a terrible strategy. Read my op-ed on how we should focus on the vulnerable women Big Abortion preys upon and hold clinics accountable for their abusive practices.</p><p>The United States has the strongest fighting force on Earth, but to remain a superpower, we must anticipate the next generation of threats. Tennessee National Guard Major General Jeffrey Holmes joined me to discuss the space and cyber battlespace.</p><p>U.S. companies and small businesses created jobs at a record speed in June. Nearly 4.8 million positions opened up, marking the biggest jump in job creation since the government started keeping records in 1939!</p><p>This week, the United States--Mexico--Canada Agreement (USMCA) took effect! This new policy updates a trade deal that predates the mainstream use of smartphones. In 2018, the Volunteer state exported $12.7 billion in goods to Canada and Mexico, and the USMCA will help even more Tennessee-based small businesses cut through unnecessary regulatory red tape and tap into this growing international market.</p><p>Happy Fourth of July from the Blackburn family!</p><p>CORONAVIRUS RESOURCES</p><p>*COVID-19 testing sites can be found here</p><p>*General information about the coronavirus can be found here</p><p>*Information regarding COVID-19 in Tennessee can be found here</p><p>*You can call the Tennessee Coronavirus Public Information Line from 10 AM to 10 PM CST at 877-857-2945.</p><p>*Information for cleaning and disinfecting your home when someone is sick can be found here</p><p>STAY IN TOUCH</p><p>As a reminder, you can reach any of my six offices in Tennessee to share a concern or request assistance with a federal agency.</p><p>My Best,</p><p>Marsha</p><p>Chattanooga</p><p>10 West M.

An anonymous source told Bloomberg the probe will center on Facebook's core business \u2014 social media. According to the source, the FTC has already reached out to third-parties for help understanding the competitive dynamics of social media. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] Facebook announced on Wednesday that it's being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission over potential antitrust concerns[2], and a source told Bloomberg the probe focus on its core business \u2014 social media. This could mean that Facebook, known as the \"big blue app\" internally, and Instagram will come under scrutiny. Together, the two social media platforms have more than 3 billion users. Bloomberg's anonymous source said the FTC has already contacted third-parties to help it assess the competitive dynamics of social media. With the focus kept on social media, it could mean Facebook's growth into other markets is not of interest. Since its inception, Facebook has moved into encrypted messaging, AI, virtual reality, and it plans to launch its own cryptocurrency next year[3]. The announcement of the investigation came just hours after the FTC slapped Facebook with a record-breaking $5 billion penalty for its mishandling of the Cambridge Analytica[4] scandal. Read more: Facebook's humbling deal with the FTC is the biggest assault on Mark Zuckerberg's power in the firm's history[5] Antitrust lawyer Barbara Scalds told Bloomberg the FTC would need to find examples of Facebook damaging competition either through acquisitions or restrictive business arrangements. \"Somebody has to have raised with them actual conduct that would fall within the realm of antitrust harm, which is limiting innovation, raising prices, or restricting output... They could have restraints that limit people's access, like vendors or other people's access,\" she said. Internal Facebook documents released late last year showed that in 2013, CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally gave the go-ahead on restricting Twitter-owned looping video company Vine's access to Facebook data[6], meaning Vine users couldn't connect to Facebook friends in-app. Vine shut down in 2016. The documents were published by the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Chair Damian Collins said the Vine emails \"show evidence of Facebook taking aggressive positions against apps, with the consequence that denying them access to data led to the failure of that business.\" Facebook stringently denied this, saying \"at that time we made the decision to restrict apps built on top of our platform that replicated our core functionality.\" NOW WATCH: Why Apple's

Now, let's talk about how to make money off a Trump administration. It is so easy, a caveman could do it.  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Trump-vs-clinton.jpgTrumpBy\">http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Trump-vs-clinton.jpgTrumpBy</url> Krassotkin (derivative), Gage Skidmore (Donald Trump), Gage Skidmore (Hillary Clinton) [CC BY-SA 3.0[3]], via Wikimedia Commons[4]The bond market and President Trump I've already talked a lot about this topic. Please\u00a0read this\u00a0before you go any further. It's something I wrote back in April.  Interest rates shot up right after the election. Some thoughts: We discussed this months ago. There are a lot of bond bulls[5] out there. What do they say now? This is the first time in forever that the bond market has actually been afraid of supply. Possibly the first time since 1994. The curve steepened massively. Trump did what the Fed has been trying to do for years. Speaking of the Fed, given the price action yesterday, the chance of a rate hike in December has to be close to 100%. Fed funds futures sold off yesterday. The market is believing in rate hikes. Growth during a Trump presidency  As you can see from the stock market reaction, the market went from worrying about global thermonuclear war to getting hopeful about Trump's plan for growth[6]. Tariffs aren't really a plan for growth, but let me tell you what is: Cutting marginal income tax rates Cutting corporate tax rates Repatriating overseas earnings Rolling back regulations (Obamacare, Dodd-Frank) Energy policy That is assuming Trump is going to do what he said he is going to do. Which is a stretch, because Trump probably isn't going to build a wall, and he isn't going to send Hillary to prison. There are a lot of promises he won't follow through on. So I'll believe the tax cuts when I see them. But the market has hope. Other Trade Ideas I'd be a fool not to save the good stuff for\u00a0Street Freak\u00a0and\u00a0The Daily Dirtnap. But I will say up front that, on a sector basis, a Trump presidency is bullish for the most-regulated sectors of the economy: Financials Health Care[7] Energy Now, here's what I would short: Technology This is the least-regulated sector of the economy. It's also the sector that was most vocally anti-Trump. Big tech likes to shake hands with the government\u2014the relationship between Google and the Obama administration is especially cozy. So what if that comes to a halt? Don't worry you're not too late The number one question I get from people in situations like this is: Am I too late? Did I miss it? Interest rates go from 15% to 1.3%, and then they go to 2%, and you think you missed it? These are trends that are going to continue for months, weeks, years. Nobody missed anything.[8] The hardest thing to do is to buy a chart that is up against the upper right corner of the screen.

His focus was more prosaic. A computational neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr Gallant worked for years to improve our understanding of how brains encode information \u2014 what regions become active, for example, when a person sees a plane or an apple or a dog \u2014 and how that activity represents the object being viewed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the late 2000s, scientists could determine what kind of thing a person might be looking at from the way the brain lit up \u2014 a human face, say, or a cat. But Dr Gallant and his colleagues went further. They figured out how to use machine learning to decipher not just the class of thing, but which exact image a subject was viewing. (Which photo of a cat, out of three options, for instance.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">see also<br/><br/>Pakistani stars open discussions on mental health after the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh  <br/>Sushant Singh Rajput's death triggers mental health debate  <br/>Senegal's first female pro surfer draws others in her wake  <br/>11 celebrities who spoke up about their battle with depression  </p><p>One day, Dr Gallant and his postdocs got to talking. In the same way that you can turn a speaker into a microphone by hooking it up backward, they wondered if they could reverse engineer the algorithm they'd developed so they could visualise, solely from brain activity, what a person was seeing.</p><p>How to train the AI</p><p>The first phase of the project was to train the AI. For hours, Dr Gallant and his colleagues showed volunteers in fMRI machines movie clips. By matching patterns of brain activation prompted by the moving images, the AI built a model of how the volunteers' visual cortex, which parses information from the eyes, worked. Then came the next phase: translation. As they showed the volunteers movie clips, they asked the model what, given everything it now knew about their brains, it thought they might be looking at.</p><p>The experiment focused just on a subsection of the visual cortex. It didn't capture what was happening elsewhere in the brain - how a person might feel about what she was seeing, for example, or what she might be fantasising about as she watched. The endeavor was, in Dr. Gallant's words, a primitive proof of concept.</p><p>And yet the results, published in 2011, are remarkable.</p><p>The reconstructed images move with a dreamlike fluidity. In their imperfection, they evoke expressionist art. (And a few reconstructed images seem downright wrong.) But where they succeed, they represent an astonishing achievement: a machine translating patterns of brain activity into a moving image understandable by other people - a machine that can read the brain.</p><p>How brain-reading technology can help</p><p>Dr Gallant was thrilled. Imagine the possibilities when better brain-reading technology became available? Imagine the people suffering from locked-in syndrome, Lou Gehrig's disease, the people incapacitated by strokes, who could benefit from a machine that could help them interact with the world?</p><p>He was also scared because the experiment showed, in a concrete way, that humanity was at the dawn of a new era, one in which our thoughts could theoretically be snatched from our heads. What was going to happen, Dr Gallant wondered, when you could read thoughts the thinker might not even be consciously aware of, when you could see people's memories?</p><p>\"That's a real sobering thought that now you have to take seriously,\" he told me recently.</p><p>What's the 'Google cap'</p><p>For decades, we've communicated with computers mostly by using our fingers and our eyes, by interfacing via keyboards and screens. These tools and the bony digits we prod them with provide a natural limit to the speed of communication between human brain and machine. We can convey information only as quickly (and accurately) as we can type or click.</p><p>Voice recognition, like that used by Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, is a step toward more seamless integration of human and machine. The next step, one that scientists around the world are pursuing, is technology that allows people to control computers \u2014 and everything connected to them, including cars, robotic arms and drones - merely by thinking.</p><p> There are lower-tier versions of brain-writing gizmos that, in exchange for their free use, occasionally \"make suggestions\" directly to your brain. How will you know if your impulses are your own?  -</p><p>Dr Gallant jokingly calls the imagined piece of hardware that would do this a \"Google cap\": a hat that could sense silent commands and prompt computers to respond accordingly.</p><p>The problem is that, to work, that cap would need to be able to see, with some detail, what's happening in the nearly 100 billion neurons that make up the brain.</p><p>How you can see into the brain</p><p>Technology that can easily peer through the skull, like the MRI machine, is far too unwieldy to mount on your head. Less bulky technology, like electroencephalogram, or EEG, which measures the brain's electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp, doesn't provide nearly the same clarity. One scientist compares it to looking for the surface ripples made by a fish swimming underwater while a storm roils the lake.</p><p>Other methods of \"seeing\" into the brain might include magnetoencephalography, or MEG, which measures magnetic waves emanating outside the skull from neurons firing beneath it; or using infrared light, which can penetrate living tissue, to infer brain activity from changes in blood flow. (Pulse oximeters work this way, by shining infrared light through your finger.)</p><p>What technologies will power the brain-computer interface of the future is still unclear. And if it's unclear how we'll \"read\" the brain, it's even less clear how we'll \"write\" to it.</p><p>Technology to transmit information to the brain</p><p>This is the other holy grail of brain-machine research: technology that can transmit information to the brain directly. We're probably nowhere near the moment when you can silently ask, \"Alexa, what's the capital of Peru?\" and have \"Lima\" materialise in your mind.</p><p>Even so, solutions to these challenges are beginning to emerge. Much of the research has occurred in the medical realm, where, for years, scientists have worked incrementally toward giving quadriplegics and others with immobilising neurological conditions better ways of interacting with the world through computers. But in recent years, tech companies \u2014 including Facebook, Microsoft and Elon Musk's Neuralink \u2014 have begun investing in the field.</p><p> We'll soon have lasers mounted on our heads that play us 'like pianos', but that brain-reading and possibly brain-writing technologies are fast approaching, and society isn't prepared for them.  -</p><p>Some scientists are elated by this infusion of energy and resources. Others worry that as this tech moves into the consumer realm, it could have a variety of unintended and potentially dangerous consequences, from the erosion of mental privacy to the exacerbation of inequality.</p><p>Rafael Yuste, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, counts two great advances in computing that have transformed society: the transition from room-size mainframe computers to personal computers that fit on a desk (and then in your lap), and the advent of mobile computing with smartphones in the 2000s. Noninvasive brain-reading tech would be a third great leap, he says.</p><p>\"Forget about the COVIDcrisis,\" Dr Yuste told me. \"What's coming with this new tech can change humanity.\"</p><p>Restoring mobility to the paralysed</p><p>Not many people will volunteer to be the first to undergo a novel kind of brain surgery, even if it holds the promise of restoring mobility to those who've been paralysed. So when Robert Kirsch, the chairman of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve University, put out such a call nearly 10 years ago, and one person both met the criteria and was willing, he knew he had a pioneer on his hands.</p><p>The man's name was Bill Kochevar. He'd been paralysed from the neck down in a biking accident years earlier. His motto, as he later explained it, was \"somebody has to do the research.\"</p><p>At that point, scientists had already invented gizmos that helped paralysed patients leverage what mobility remained \u2014 lips, an eyelid \u2014 to control computers or move robotic arms. But Dr Kirsch was after something different. He wanted to help Kochevar move his own limbs.</p><p> We're going to evolve to augmenting humans.  - Jose Carmena, scientist at Berkeley and co-founder of Iota Biosciences</p><p>The first step was implanting two arrays of sensors over the part of the brain that would normally control Kochevar's right arm. Electrodes that could receive signals from those arrays via a computer were implanted into his arm muscles. The implants, and the computer connected to them, would function as a kind of electronic spinal cord, bypassing his injury.</p><p>Once his arm muscles had been strengthened \u2014 achieved with a regimen of mild electrical stimulation while he slept \u2014 Kochevar, who at that point had been paralysed for over a decade, was able to feed himself and drink water. He could even scratch his nose.</p><p>What's BrainGate?</p><p>About two dozen people around the world who have lost the use of limbs from accidents or neurological disease have had sensors implanted on their brains. Many, Kochevar included, participated in a United States government-funded programme called BrainGate. The sensor arrays used in this research, smaller than a button, allow patients to move robotic arms or cursors on a screen just by thinking. But as far as Dr. Kirsch knows, Kochevar, who died in 2017 for reasons unrelated to the research, was the first paralysed person to regain use of his limbs by way of this technology.</p><p>This fall, Dr. Kirsch and his colleagues will begin version 2.0 of the experiment. This time, they'll implant six smaller arrays \u2014 more sensors will improve the quality of the signal. And instead of implanting electrodes directly in the volunteers' muscles, they'll insert them upstream, circling the nerves that move the muscles. In theory, Dr Kirsch says, that will enable movement of the entire arm and hand.</p><p>The next major goal is to restore sensation so that people can know if they're holding a rock, say, or an orange \u2014 or if their hand has wandered too close to a flame. \"Sensation has been the longest ignored part of paralysis,\" Dr. Kirsch told me.</p><p>A few years ago, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh began groundbreaking experiments on that front with a man named Nathan Copeland who was paralysed from the upper chest down. They routed sensory information from a robotic arm into the part of his cortex that dealt with his right hand's sense of touch.</p><p>How to construct a new brain decoder</p><p>Every brain is a living, undulating organ that changes over time. That's why, before each of Copeland's sessions, the AI has to recalibrate \u2014 to construct a new brain decoder. \"The signals in your brain shift,\" Copeland told me. \"They're not exactly the same every day.\"</p><p>And the results weren't perfect. Copeland described them to me as \"weird,\" \"electrical tingly\" but also \"amazing.\" The sensory feedback was immensely important, though, in knowing that he'd actually grasped what he thought he'd grasped. And more generally, it demonstrated that a person could \"feel\" a robotic hand as his or her own, and that information coming from electronic sensors could be fed into the human brain.</p><p>Preliminary as these experiments are, they suggest that the pieces of a brain-machine interface that can both \"read\" and \"write\" already exist. People cannot only move robotic arms just by thinking; machines can also, however imperfectly, convey information to the brain about what that arm encounters.</p><p>Who knows how soon versions of this technology will be available for kids who want to think-move avatars in video games or think-surf the web. People can already fly drones with their brain signals, so maybe crude consumer versions will appear in coming years. But it's hard to overstate how life-changing such tech could be for people with spinal cord injuries or neurological diseases.</p><p>Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco, who works on brain-based speech recognition, said that maintaining the ability to communicate can mean the difference between life or death. \"For some people, if they have a means to continue to communicate, that may be the reason they decide to stay alive,\" he told me. \"That motivates us a lot in our work.\"</p><p>In a recent study, Dr. Chang and his colleagues predicted with up to 97 per cent accuracy to construct a new brain decoder the best rate yet achieved, they say to construct a new brain decoder what words a volunteer had said (from about 250 words used in a predetermined set of 50 sentences) by using implanted sensors that monitored activity in the part of the brain that moves the muscles involved in speaking. (The volunteers in this study weren't paralysed; they were epilepsy patients undergoing brain surgery to address that condition, and the implants were not permanent.)</p><p>Dr Chang used sensor arrays similar to those Dr. Kirsch used, but a non-invasive method may not be too far away.</p><p>Full speech recognition remains distant</p><p>Facebook, which funded Dr Chang's study, is working on a brain-reading helmet-like contraption that uses infrared light to peer into the brain. Mark Chevillet, the director of brain-computer interface research at Facebook Reality Labs, told me in an email that while full speech recognition remains distant, his lab will be able to decode simple commands like \"home,\" \"select\" and \"delete\" in \"coming years.\"</p><p>This progress isn't solely driven by advances in brain-sensing technology - by the physical meeting point of flesh and machine. The AI matters as much, if not more.</p><p>Trying to understand the brain from outside the skull is like trying to make sense of a conversation taking place two rooms away. The signal is often messy, hard to decipher. So it's the same types of algorithms that now allow speech-recognition software to do a decent job of understanding spoken speech - including individual idiosyncrasies of pronunciation and regional accents - that may now enable brain-reading technology.</p><p>Want to zap that urges and binges?</p><p>Not all the applications of brain reading require something as complex as understanding speech, however. In some cases, scientists simply want to blunt urges.</p><p>When Casey Halpern, a neurosurgeon at Stanford, was in college, he had a friend who drank too much. Another was overweight but couldn't stop eating. \"Impulse control is such a pervasive problem,\" he told me.</p><p>As a budding scientist, he learned about methods of deep brain stimulation used to treat Parkinson's disease. A mild electric current applied to a part of the brain involved in movement could lessen tremors caused by the disease. Could he apply that technology to the problem of inadequate self control?</p><p>Working with mice in the 2010s, he identified a part of the brain, called the nucleus accumbens, where activity spiked in a predictable pattern just before a mouse was about to gorge on high-fat food. He found he could reduce how much the mouse ate by disrupting that activity with a mild electrical current. He could zap the compulsion to gorge as it was taking hold in the rodents' brains.</p><p>Earlier this year, he began testing the approach in people suffering from obesity who haven't been helped by any other treatment, including gastric-bypass surgery. He implants an electrode in their nucleus accumbens. It's connected to an apparatus that was originally developed to prevent seizures in people with epilepsy.</p><p>As with Dr Chang or Dr Gallant's work, an algorithm first has to learn about the brain it's attached to - to recognize the signs of oncoming loss of control. Dr. Halpern and his colleagues train the algorithm by giving patients a taste of a milkshake, or offering a buffet of the patient's favorite foods, and then recording their brain activity just before the person indulges.</p><p>He's so far completed two implantations. \"The goal is to help restore control,\" he told me. And if it works in obesity, which afflicts roughly 40 percent of adults in the United States, he plans to test the gizmo against addictions to alcohol, cocaine and other substances.</p><p>Dr Halpern's approach takes as fact something that he says many people have a hard time accepting: that the lack of impulse control that may underlie addictive behavior isn't a choice, but results from a malfunction of the brain. \"We have to accept that it's a disease,\" he says. \"We often just judge people and assume it's their own fault. That's not what the current research is suggesting we should do.\"</p><p>Get a concentration implant</p><p>I must confess that of the numerous proposed applications of brain-machine interfacing I came across, Dr. Halpern's was my favourite to extrapolate on. How many lives have been derailed by the inability to resist the temptation of that next pill or that next beer? What if Dr. Halpern's solution was generalisable?</p><p>What if every time your mind wandered off while writing an article, you could, with the aid of your concentration implant, prod it back to the task at hand, finally completing those life-changing projects you've never gotten around to finishing?</p><p>These applications remain fantasies, of course. But the mere fact that such a thing may be possible is partly what prompts Dr. Yuste, the neurobiologist, to worry about how this technology could blur the boundaries of what we consider to be our personalities.</p><p> A major challenge to implants is that your brain doesn't like having stuff stuck in your brain.\" Over time, immune cells may swarm the implant, covering it with goop.  - Dr. Jack Gallant, computational neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley</p><p>Such blurring is already an issue, he points out. Parkinson's patients with implants sometimes report feeling more aggressive than usual when the machine is \"on.\" Depressed patients undergoing deep brain stimulation sometimes wonder if they're really themselves anymore. \"You kind of feel artificial,\" one patient told researchers. The machine isn't implanting ideas in their minds, like Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie Inception, but it is seemingly changing their sense of self.</p><p>What happens if people are no longer sure if their emotions are theirs, or the effects of the machines they're connected to?</p><p>Dr Halpern dismisses these concerns as overblown. Such effects are part of many medical treatments, he points out, including commonly prescribed antidepressants and stimulants. And sometimes, as in the case of hopeless addiction, changing someone's behavior is precisely the goal.</p><p>Still the longer-term issue of what could happen when brain-writing technology jumps from the medical into the consumer realm is hard to forget. If my imagined focus enhancer existed, for example, but was very expensive, it could exacerbate the already yawning chasm between those who can afford expensive tutors, cars and colleges \u2014 and now grit-boosting technology \u2014 and those who cannot.</p><p>\"Certain groups will get this tech, and will enhance themselves,\" Dr. Yuste told me \"This is a really serious threat to humanity.\"</p><p>The best brain-sensing tech</p><p>\"The idea that you have to drill holes in skulls to read the brains is nuts,\" Mary Lou Jepsen, the chief executive and founder of Openwater, told me in an email. Her company is developing technology that, she says, uses infrared light and ultrasonic waves to peer into the body.</p><p>Other researchers are simply trying to make invasive approaches invasive. A company called Synchron seeks to avoid opening the skull or touching brain tissue at all by inserting a sensor through the jugular vein in the neck. It's currently undergoing a safety and feasibility trial.</p><p>Dr Kirsch suspects that Elon Musk's Neuralink is probably the best brain-sensing tech in development. It requires surgery, but unlike the BrainGate sensor arrays, it's thin, flexible and can adjust to the mountainous topography of the brain. The hope is that this makes it less caustic. It also has hairlike filaments that sink into brain tissue. Each filament contains multiple sensors, theoretically allowing the capture of more data than flatter arrays that sit at the brain's surface. It can both read and write to the brain, and it's accompanied by a robot that assists with the implantation.</p><p>A major challenge to implants is that, as Dr. Gallant says, \"your brain doesn't like having stuff stuck in your brain.\" Over time, immune cells may swarm the implant, covering it with goop.</p><p>One way to try to avoid this is to drastically shrink the size of the sensors. Arto Nurmikko, a professor of engineering and physics at Brown University who's part of the BrainGate effort, is developing what he calls \"neurograins\" \u2014 tiny, implantable silicon sensors no larger than a handful of neurons. They're too small to have batteries, so they're powered by microwaves beamed in from outside the skull.</p><p>He foresees maybe 1,000 mini sensors implanted throughout the brain. He's so far tested them only in rodents. But maybe we shouldn't be so sure that healthy people wouldn't volunteer for \"mental enhancement\" surgery. Every year, Dr Nurmikko poses a hypothetical to his students: 1,000 neurograin implants that would allow students to learn and communicate faster; any volunteers?</p><p>\"Typically about half the class says, 'Sure,'\" he told me. \"That speaks to where we are today.\"</p><p>A Fitbit for your liver</p><p>Jose Carmena and Michel Maharbiz, scientists at Berkeley and founders of a start-up called Iota Biosciences, have their own version of this idea, which they call \"neural dust\": tiny implants for the peripheral nervous system \u2014 arm, legs and organs besides the brain. \"It's like a Fitbit for your liver,\" Dr. Carmena told me.</p><p>They imagine treating inflammatory diseases by stimulating nerves throughout the body with these tiny devices. And where Dr. Nurmikko uses microwaves to power the devices, Dr Carmena and Dr Maharbiz foresee the use of ultrasound to beam power to them.</p><p>Generally, they say, this kind of tech will be adopted first in the medical context and then move to the lay population. \"We're going to evolve to augmenting humans,\" Dr Carmena told me. \"There's no question.\"</p><p>But hype permeates the field, he warns. Sure, Elon Musk has argued that closer brain-machine integration will help humans compete with ever-more-powerful AIs. But in reality, we're nowhere near a device that could, for example, help you master Kung Fu instantaneously like Keanu Reeves in The Matrix.</p><p>What does the near future look like for the average consumer? Ramses Alcaide, the chief executive of a company called Neurable, imagines a world in which smartphones tucked in our pockets or backpacks act as processing hubs for data streaming in from smaller computers and sensors worn around the body. These devices \u2014 glasses that serve as displays, earbuds that whisper in our ears \u2014 are where the actual interfacing between human and computer will occur.</p><p>Projecting images onto the retina</p><p>Microsoft sells a headset called HoloLens that superimposes images onto the world, an idea called \"augmented reality.\" A company called Mojo Vision is working toward a contact lens that projects monochrome images directly onto the retina, a private computer display superimposed over the world.</p><p>And Dr Alcaide himself is working on what he sees as the linchpin to this vision, a device that, one day, may help you to silently communicate with all your digital paraphernalia. He was vague about the form the product will take \u2014 it isn't market ready yet \u2014 except to note that it's an earphone that can measure the brain's electrical activity to sense \"cognitive states,\" like whether you're hungry or concentrating.</p><p>We already compulsively check Instagram and Facebook and email, even though we're supposedly impeded by our fleshy fingers. I asked Dr. Alcaide: What will happen when we can compulsively check social media just by thinking?</p><p>Ever the optimist, he told me that brain-sensing technology could actually help with the digital incursion. The smart earbud could sense that you're working, for instance, and block advertisements or phone calls. \"What if your computer knew you were focusing?\" he told me. \"What if it actually removes bombardment from your life?\"</p><p>Maybe it's no surprise that Dr. Alcaide has enjoyed the HBO sci-fi show Westworld, a universe where technologies that make communicating with computers more seamless are commonplace (though no one seems better off for it). Rafael Yuste, on the other hand, refuses to watch the show. He likens the idea to a scientist who studies COVID-19 watching a movie about pandemics. \"It's the last thing I want to do,\" he says.</p><p>Reading and writing to the brain with precision</p><p>To grasp why Dr Yuste frets so much about brain-reading technology, it helps to understand his research. He helped pioneer a technology that can read and write to the brain with unprecedented precision, and it doesn't require surgery. But it does require genetic engineering.</p><p>Dr. Yuste infects mice with a virus that inserts two genes into the animals' neurons. One prompts the cells to produce a protein that make them sensitive to infrared light; the other makes the neurons emit light when they activate. Thereafter, when the neurons fire, Dr. Yuste can see them light up. And he can activate neurons in turn with an infrared laser. Dr. Yuste can thus read what's happening in the mouse brain and write to the mouse's brain with an accuracy impossible with other techniques.</p><p>And he can, it appears, make the mice \"see\" things that aren't there.</p><p>In one experiment, he trained mice to take a drink of sugar water after a series of bars appeared on a screen. He recorded which neurons in the visual cortex fired when the mice saw those bars. Then he activated those same neurons with the laser, but without showing them the actual bars. The mice had the same reaction: They took a drink.</p><p>Implanting an hallucination</p><p>He likens what he did to implanting an hallucination. \"We were able to implant into these mice perceptions of things that they hadn't seen,\" he told me. \"We manipulated the mouse like a puppet.\"</p><p>This method, called optogenetics, is a long way from being used in people. To begin with, we have thicker skulls and bigger brains, making it harder for infrared light to penetrate. And from a political and regulatory standpoint, the bar is high for genetically engineering human beings. But scientists are exploring workarounds \u2014 drugs and nanoparticles that make neurons receptive to infrared light, allowing precise activation of neurons without genetic engineering.</p><p> Just as people have the right not to self-incriminate with speech, we should have the right not to self-incriminate with information gleaned from our brains.  - Dr Rafael Yuste, neurobiologist at Columbia University</p><p>The lesson in Dr Yuste's view is not that we'll soon have lasers mounted on our heads that play us \"like pianos,\" but that brain-reading and possibly brain-writing technologies are fast approaching, and society isn't prepared for them.</p><p>\"We think this is a human rights issue,\" he told me.</p><p>In a 2017 paper in the journal Nature, Dr Yuste and 24 other signatories, including Dr. Gallant called for the formulation of a human rights declaration that explicitly addressed \"neurorights\" and what they see as the threats posed by brain-reading technology before it becomes ubiquitous. Information taken from people's brains should be protected like medical data, Dr.Yuste says, and not exploited for profit or worse. And just as people have the right not to self-incriminate with speech, we should have the right not to self-incriminate with information gleaned from our brains.</p><p>Dr Yuste's activism was prompted in part, he told me, by the large companies suddenly interested in brain-machine research.</p><p>Harvesting thoughts, daydreams, desires</p><p>Say you're using your Google Cap. And like many products in the Google ecosystem, it collects information about you, which it uses to help advertisers target you with ads.

Are our daydreams safe?</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jack Gallant never set out to create a mind-reading machine. His focus was more prosaic. A computational neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Gallant worked for years to improve our understanding of how brains encode information - what regions become active, for example, when a person sees a plane or an apple or a dog - and how that activity represents the object being viewed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the late 2000s, scientists could determine what kind of thing a person might be looking at from the way the brain lit up - a human face, say, or a cat. But Dr. Gallant and his colleagues went further. They figured out how to use machine learning to decipher not just the class of thing, but which exact image a subject was viewing. (Which photo of a cat, out of three options, for instance.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One day, Dr. Gallant and his postdocs got to talking. In the same way that you can turn a speaker into a microphone by hooking it up backward, they wondered if they could reverse engineer the algorithm they'd developed so they could visualize, solely from brain activity, what a person was seeing.</p><p>The first phase of the project was to train the AI. For hours, Dr. Gallant and his colleagues showed volunteers in fMRI machines movie clips. By matching patterns of brain activation prompted by the moving images, the AI built a model of how the volunteers' visual cortex, which parses information from the eyes, worked. Then came the next phase: translation. As they showed the volunteers movie clips, they asked the model what, given everything it now knew about their brains, it thought they might be looking at.</p><p>The experiment focused just on a subsection of the visual cortex. It didn't capture what was happening elsewhere in the brain - how a person might feel about what she was seeing, for example, or what she might be fantasizing about as she watched. The endeavor was, in Dr. Gallant's words, a primitive proof of concept.</p><p>And yet the results, published in 2011, are remarkable.</p><p>The reconstructed images move with a dreamlike fluidity. In their imperfection, they evoke expressionist art. (And a few reconstructed images seem downright wrong.) But where they succeed, they represent an astonishing achievement: a machine translating patterns of brain activity into a moving image understandable by other people - a machine that can read the brain.</p><p>Dr. Gallant was thrilled. Imagine the possibilities when better brain-reading technology became available? Imagine the people suffering from locked-in syndrome, Lou Gehrig's disease, the people incapacitated by strokes, who could benefit from a machine that could help them interact with the world?</p><p>He was also scared because the experiment showed, in a concrete way, that humanity was at the dawn of a new era, one in which our thoughts could theoretically be snatched from our heads. What was going to happen, Dr. Gallant wondered, when you could read thoughts the thinker might not even be consciously aware of, when you could see people's memories?</p><p>\"That's a real sobering thought that now you have to take seriously,\" he told me recently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The 'Google Cap'</emphasis></p><p>For decades, we've communicated with computers mostly by using our fingers and our eyes, by interfacing via keyboards and screens. These tools and the bony digits we prod them with provide a natural limit to the speed of communication between human brain and machine. We can convey information only as quickly (and accurately) as we can type or click.</p><p>Voice recognition, like that used by Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, is a step toward more seamless integration of human and machine. The next step, one that scientists around the world are pursuing, is technology that allows people to control computers - and everything connected to them, including cars, robotic arms and drones - merely by thinking.</p><p>Dr. Gallant jokingly calls the imagined piece of hardware that would do this a \"Google cap\": a hat that could sense silent commands and prompt computers to respond accordingly.</p><p>The problem is that, to work, that cap would need to be able to see, with some detail, what's happening in the nearly 100 billion neurons that make up the brain.</p><p>Technology that can easily peer through the skull, like the MRI machine, is far too unwieldy to mount on your head. Less bulky technology, like electroencephalogram, or E.E.G., which measures the brain's electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp, doesn't provide nearly the same clarity. One scientist compares it to looking for the surface ripples made by a fish swimming underwater while a storm roils the lake.</p><p>Other methods of \"seeing\" into the brain might include magnetoencephalography, or M.E.G., which measures magnetic waves emanating outside the skull from neurons firing beneath it; or using infrared light, which can penetrate living tissue, to infer brain activity from changes in blood flow. (Pulse oximeters work this way, by shining infrared light through your finger.)</p><p>What technologies will power the brain-computer interface of the future is still unclear. And if it's unclear how we'll \"read\" the brain, it's even less clear how we'll \"write\" to it.</p><p>This is the other holy grail of brain-machine research: technology that can transmit information to the brain directly. We're probably nowhere near the moment when you can silently ask, \"Alexa, what's the capital of Peru?\" and have \"Lima\" materialize in your mind.</p><p>Even so, solutions to these challenges are beginning to emerge. Much of the research has occurred in the medical realm, where, for years, scientists have worked incrementally toward giving quadriplegics and others with immobilizing neurological conditions better ways of interacting with the world through computers. But in recent years, tech companies - including Facebook, Microsoft and Elon Musk's Neuralink - have begun investing in the field.</p><p>Some scientists are elated by this infusion of energy and resources. Others worry that as this tech moves into the consumer realm, it could have a variety of unintended and potentially dangerous consequences, from the erosion of mental privacy to the exacerbation of inequality.</p><p>Rafael Yuste, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, counts two great advances in computing that have transformed society: the transition from room-size mainframe computers to personal computers that fit on a desk (and then in your lap), and the advent of mobile computing with smartphones in the 2000s. Noninvasive brain-reading tech would be a third great leap, he says.</p><p>\"Forget about the Covid crisis,\" Dr. Yuste told me. \"What's coming with this new tech can change humanity.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dear Brain</emphasis></p><p>Not many people will volunteer to be the first to undergo a novel kind of brain surgery,even if it holds the promise of restoring mobility to those who've been paralyzed. So when Robert Kirsch, the chairman of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve University, put out such a call nearly 10 years ago, and one person both met the criteria and was willing, he knew he had a pioneer on his hands.</p><p>The man's name was Bill Kochevar. He'd been paralyzed from the neck down in a biking accident years earlier. His motto, as he later explained it, was \"somebody has to do the research.\"</p><p>At that point, scientists had already invented gizmos that helped paralyzed patients leverage what mobility remained - lips, an eyelid - to control computers or move robotic arms. But Dr. Kirsch was after something different. He wanted to help Mr. Kochevar move his own limbs.</p><p>The first step was implanting two arrays of sensors over the part of the brain that would normally control Mr. Kochevar's right arm. Electrodes that could receive signals from those arrays via a computer were implanted into his arm muscles. The implants, and the computer connected to them, would function as a kind of electronic spinal cord, bypassing his injury.</p><p>Once his arm muscles had been strengthened - achieved with a regimen of mild electrical stimulation while he slept - Mr. Kochevar, who at that point had been paralyzed for over a decade, was able to feed himself and drink water. He could even scratch his nose.</p><p>About two dozen people around the world who have lost the use of limbs from accidents or neurological disease have had sensors implanted on their brains. Many, Mr. Kochevar included, participated in a United States government-funded program called BrainGate. The sensor arrays used in this research, smaller than a button, allow patients to move robotic arms or cursors on a screen just by thinking. But as far as Dr. Kirsch knows, Mr. Kochevar, who died in 2017 for reasons unrelated to the research, was the first paralyzed person to regain use of his limbs by way of this technology.</p><p>This fall, Dr. Kirsch and his colleagues will begin version 2.0 of the experiment. This time, they'll implant six smaller arrays - more sensors will improve the quality of the signal. And instead of implanting electrodes directly in the volunteers' muscles, they'll insert them upstream, circling the nerves that move the muscles. In theory, Dr. Kirsch says, that will enable movement of the entire arm and hand.</p><p>The next major goal is to restore sensation so that people can know if they're holding a rock, say, or an orange - or if their hand has wandered too close to a flame. \"Sensation has been the longest ignored part of paralysis,\" Dr. Kirsch told me.</p><p>A few years ago, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh began groundbreaking experiments on that front with a man named Nathan Copeland who was paralyzed from the upper chest down. They routed sensory information from a robotic arm into the part of his cortex that dealt with his right hand's sense of touch.</p><p>Every brain is a living, undulating organ that changes over time. That's why, before each of Mr. Copeland's sessions, the AI has to recalibrate - to construct a new brain decoder. \"The signals in your brain shift,\" Mr. Copeland told me. \"They're not exactly the same every day.\"</p><p>And the results weren't perfect. Mr. Copeland described them to me as \"weird,\" \"electrical tingly\" but also \"amazing.\" The sensory feedback was immensely important, though, in knowing that he'd actually grasped what he thought he'd grasped. And more generally, it demonstrated that a person could \"feel\" a robotic hand as his or her own, and that information coming from electronic sensors could be fed into the human brain.</p><p>Preliminary as these experiments are, they suggest that the pieces of a brain-machine interface that can both \"read\" and \"write\" already exist. People cannot only move robotic arms just by thinking; machines can also, however imperfectly, convey information to the brain about what that arm encounters.</p><p>Who knows how soon versions of this technology will be available for kids who want to think-move avatars in video games or think-surf the web. People can already fly drones with their brain signals, so maybe crude consumer versions will appear in coming years. But it's hard to overstate how life-changing such tech could be for people with spinal cord injuries or neurological diseases.</p><p>Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco, who works on brain-based speech recognition, said that maintaining the ability to communicate can mean the difference between life or death. \"For some people, if they have a means to continue to communicate, that may be the reason they decide to stay alive,\" he told me. \"That motivates us a lot in our work.\"</p><p>In a recent study, Dr. Chang and his colleagues predicted with up to 97 percent accuracy - the best rate yet achieved, they say - what words a volunteer had said (from about 250 words used in a predetermined set of 50 sentences) by using implanted sensors that monitored activity in the part of the brain that moves the muscles involved in speaking. (The volunteers in this study weren't paralyzed; they were epilepsy patients undergoing brain surgery to address that condition, and the implants were not permanent.)</p><p>Dr. Chang used sensor arrays similar to those Dr. Kirsch used, but a noninvasive method may not be too far away.</p><p>Facebook, which funded Dr. Chang's study, is working on a brain-reading helmet-like contraption that uses infrared light to peer into the brain. Mark Chevillet, the director of brain-computer interface research at Facebook Reality Labs, told me in an email that while full speech recognition remains distant, his lab will be able to decode simple commands like \"home,\" \"select\" and \"delete\" in \"coming years.\"</p><p>This progress isn't solely driven by advances in brain-sensing technology - by the physical meeting point of flesh and machine. The AI matters as much, if not more.</p><p>Trying to understand the brain from outside the skull is like trying to make sense of a conversation taking place two rooms away. The signal is often messy, hard to decipher. So it's the same types of algorithms that now allow speech-recognition software to do a decent job of understanding spoken speech - including individual idiosyncrasies of pronunciation and regional accents - that may now enable brain-reading technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zap That Urge</emphasis></p><p>Not all the applications of brain reading require something as complex as understanding speech, however. In some cases, scientists simply want to blunt urges.</p><p>When Casey Halpern, a neurosurgeon at Stanford, was in college, he had a friend who drank too much. Another was overweight but couldn't stop eating. \"Impulse control is such a pervasive problem,\" he told me.</p><p>As a budding scientist, he learned about methods of deep brain stimulation used to treat Parkinson's disease. A mild electric current applied to a part of the brain involved in movement could lessen tremors caused by the disease. Could he apply that technology to the problem of inadequate self control?</p><p>Working with mice in the 2010s, he identified a part of the brain, called the nucleus accumbens, where activity spiked in a predictable pattern just before a mouse was about to gorge on high-fat food. He found he could reduce how much the mouse ate by disrupting that activity with a mild electrical current. He could zap the compulsion to gorge as it was taking hold in the rodents' brains.</p><p>Earlier this year, he began testing the approach in people suffering from obesity who haven't been helped by any other treatment, including gastric-bypass surgery. He implants an electrode in their nucleus accumbens. It's connected to an apparatus that was originally developed to prevent seizures in people with epilepsy.</p><p>As with Dr. Chang or Dr. Gallant's work, an algorithm first has to learn about the brain it's attached to - to recognize the signs of oncoming loss of control. Dr. Halpern and his colleagues train the algorithm by giving patients a taste of a milkshake, or offering a buffet of the patient's favorite foods, and then recording their brain activity just before the person indulges.</p><p>He's so far completed two implantations. \"The goal is to help restore control,\" he told me. And if it works in obesity, which afflicts roughly 40 percent of adults in the United States, he plans to test the gizmo against addictions to alcohol, cocaine and other substances.</p><p>Dr. Halpern's approach takes as fact something that he says many people have a hard time accepting: that the lack of impulse control that may underlie addictive behavior isn't a choice, but results from a malfunction of the brain. \"We have to accept that it's a disease,\" he says. \"We often just judge people and assume it's their own fault. That's not what the current research is suggesting we should do.\"</p><p>I must confess that of the numerous proposed applications of brain-machine interfacing I came across, Dr. Halpern's was my favorite to extrapolate on. How many lives have been derailed by the inability to resist the temptation of that next pill or that next beer? What if Dr. Halpern's solution was generalizable?</p><p>What if every time your mind wandered off while writing an article, you could, with the aid of your concentration implant, prod it back to the task at hand, finally completing those life-changing projects you've never gotten around to finishing?</p><p>These applications remain fantasies, of course. But the mere fact that such a thing may be possible is partly what prompts Dr. Yuste, the neurobiologist, to worry about how this technology could blur the boundaries of what we consider to be our personalities.</p><p>Such blurring is already an issue, he points out. Parkinson's patients with implants sometimes report feeling more aggressive than usual when the machine is \"on.\" Depressed patients undergoing deep brain stimulation sometimes wonder if they're really themselves anymore. \"You kind of feel artificial,\" one patient told researchers. The machine isn't implanting ideas in their minds, like Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie \"Inception,\" but it is seemingly changing their sense of self.</p><p>What happens if people are no longer sure if their emotions are theirs, or the effects of the machines they're connected to?</p><p>Dr. Halpern dismisses these concerns as overblown. Such effects are part of many medical treatments, he points out, including commonly prescribed antidepressants and stimulants. And sometimes, as in the case of hopeless addiction, changing someone's behavior is precisely the goal.</p><p>Still the longer-term issue of what could happen when brain-writing technology jumps from the medical into the consumer realm is hard to forget. If my imagined focus enhancer existed, for example, but was very expensive, it could exacerbate the already yawning chasm between those who can afford expensive tutors, cars and colleges - and now grit-boosting technology - and those who cannot.</p><p>\"Certain groups will get this tech, and will enhance themselves,\" Dr. Yuste told me. \"This is a really serious threat to humanity.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Brain Business</emphasis></p><p>\"The idea that you have to drill holes in skulls to read the brains is nuts,\" Mary Lou Jepsen, the chief executive and founder of Openwater, told me in an email. Her company is developing technology that, she says, uses infrared light and ultrasonic waves to peer into the body.</p><p>Other researchers are simply trying to make invasive approaches <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">less</emphasis> invasive. A company called Synchron seeks to avoid opening the skull or touching brain tissue at all by inserting a sensor through the jugular vein in the neck. It's currently undergoing a safety and feasibility trial.</p><p>Dr. Kirsch suspects that Elon Musk's Neuralink is probably the best brain-sensing tech in development. It requires surgery, but unlike the BrainGate sensor arrays, it's thin, flexible and can adjust to the mountainous topography of the brain. The hope is that this makes it less caustic. It also has hairlike filaments that sink into brain tissue. Each filament contains multiple sensors, theoretically allowing the capture of more data than flatter arrays that sit at the brain's surface. It can both read and write to the brain, and it's accompanied by a robot that assists with the implantation.</p><p>A major challenge to implants is that, as Dr. Gallant says, \"your brain doesn't like having stuff stuck in your brain.\" Over time, immune cells may swarm the implant, covering it with goop.</p><p>One way to try to avoid this is to drastically shrink the size of the sensors. Arto Nurmikko, a professor of engineering and physics at Brown University who's part of the BrainGate effort, is developing what he calls \"neurograins\" - tiny, implantable silicon sensors no larger than a handful of neurons. They're too small to have batteries, so they're powered by microwaves beamed in from outside the skull.</p><p>He foresees maybe 1,000 mini sensors implanted throughout the brain. He's so far tested them only in rodents. But maybe we shouldn't be so sure that healthy people wouldn't volunteer for \"mental enhancement\" surgery. Every year, Dr. Nurmikko poses a hypothetical to his students: 1,000 neurograin implants that would allow students to learn and communicate faster; any volunteers?</p><p>\"Typically about half the class says, 'Sure,'\" he told me. \"That speaks to where we are today.\"</p><p>Jose Carmena and Michel Maharbiz, scientists at Berkeley and founders of a start-up called Iota Biosciences, have their own version of this idea, which they call \"neural dust\": tiny implants for the peripheral nervous system - arm, legs and organs besides the brain. \"It's like a Fitbit for your liver,\" Dr. Carmena told me.</p><p>They imagine treating inflammatory diseases by stimulating nerves throughout the body with these tiny devices. And where Dr. Nurmikko uses microwaves to power the devices, Dr. Carmena and Dr. Maharbiz foresee the use of ultrasound to beam power to them.</p><p>Generally, they say, this kind of tech will be adopted first in the medical context and then move to the lay population. \"We're going to evolve to augmenting humans,\" Dr. Carmena told me. \"There's no question.\"</p><p>But hype permeates the field, he warns. Sure, Elon Musk has argued that closer brain-machine integration will help humans compete with ever-more-powerful A.I.s. But in reality, we're nowhere near a device that could, for example, help you master Kung Fu instantaneously like Keanu Reeves in \"The Matrix.\"</p><p>What does the near future look like for the average consumer? Ramses Alcaide, the chief executive of a company called Neurable, imagines a world in which smartphones tucked in our pockets or backpacks act as processing hubs for data streaming in from smaller computers and sensors worn around the body. These devices - glasses that serve as displays, earbuds that whisper in our ears - are where the actual interfacing between human and computer will occur.</p><p>Microsoft sells a headset called HoloLens that superimposes images onto the world, an idea called \"augmented reality.\" A company called Mojo Vision is working toward a contact lens that projects monochrome images directly onto the retina, a private computer display superimposed over the world.</p><p>And Dr. Alcaide himself is working on what he sees as the linchpin to this vision, a device that, one day, may help you to silently communicate with all your digital paraphernalia. He was vague about the form the product will take - it isn't market ready yet - except to note that it's an earphone that can measure the brain's electrical activity to sense \"cognitive states,\" like whether you're hungry or concentrating.</p><p>We already compulsively check Instagram and Facebook and email, even though we're supposedly impeded by our fleshy fingers. I asked Dr. Alcaide: What will happen when we can compulsively check social media just by thinking?</p><p>Ever the optimist, he told me that brain-sensing technology could actually help with the digital incursion. The smart earbud could sense that you're working, for instance, and block advertisements or phone calls. \"What if your computer knew you were focusing?\" he told me. \"What if it actually removes bombardment from your life?\"</p><p>Maybe it's no surprise that Dr. Alcaide has enjoyed the HBO sci-fi show \"Westworld,\" a universe where technologies that make communicating with computers more seamless are commonplace (though no one seems better off for it). Rafael Yuste, on the other hand, refuses to watch the show. He likens the idea to a scientist who studies Covid-19 watching a movie about pandemics. \"It's the last thing I want to do,\" he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'A Human Rights Issue'</emphasis></p><p>To grasp why Dr. Yuste frets so much about brain-reading technology, it helps to understand his research. He helped pioneer a technology that can read and write to the brain with unprecedented precision, and it doesn't require surgery. But it does require genetic engineering.</p><p>Dr. Yuste infects mice with a virus that inserts two genes into the animals' neurons. One prompts the cells to produce a protein that make them sensitive to infrared light; the other makes the neurons emit light when they activate. Thereafter, when the neurons fire, Dr. Yuste can see them light up. And he can activate neurons in turn with an infrared laser. Dr. Yuste can thus read what's happening in the mouse brain and write to the mouse's brain with an accuracy impossible with other techniques.</p><p>And he can, it appears, make the mice \"see\" things that aren't there.</p><p>In one experiment, he trained mice to take a drink of sugar water after a series of bars appeared on a screen. He recorded which neurons in the visual cortex fired when the mice saw those bars. Then he activated those same neurons with the laser, but without showing them the actual bars. The mice had the same reaction: They took a drink.</p><p>He likens what he did to implanting an hallucination. \"We were able to implant into these mice perceptions of things that they hadn't seen,\" he told me. \"We manipulated the mouse like a puppet.\"</p><p>This method, called optogenetics, is a long way from being used in people. To begin with, we have thicker skulls and bigger brains, making it harder for infrared light to penetrate. And from a political and regulatory standpoint, the bar is high for genetically engineering human beings. But scientists are exploring workarounds - drugs and nanoparticles that make neurons receptive to infrared light, allowing precise activation of neurons without genetic engineering.</p><p>The lesson in Dr. Yuste's view is not that we'll soon have lasers mounted on our heads that play us \"like pianos,\" but that brain-reading and possibly brain-writing technologies are fast approaching, and society isn't prepared for them.</p><p>\"We think this is a human rights issue,\" he told me.</p><p>In a 2017 paper in the journal Nature, Dr. Yuste and 24 other signatories, including Dr. Gallant, called for the formulation of a human rights declaration that explicitly addressed \"neurorights\" and what they see as the threats posed by brain-reading technology before it becomes ubiquitous. Information taken from people's brains should be protected like medical data, Dr. Yuste says, and not exploited for profit or worse. And just as people have the right not to self-incriminate with speech, we should have the right not to self-incriminate with information gleaned from our brains.</p><p>Dr. Yuste's activism was prompted in part, he told me, by the large companies suddenly interested in brain-machine research.</p><p>Say you're using your Google Cap. And like many products in the Google ecosystem, it collects information about you, which it uses to help advertisers target you with ads. Only now, it's not harvesting your search results or your map location; it's harvesting your thoughts, your daydreams, your desires.</p><p>Who owns those data?</p><p>Or imagine that writing to the brain is possible. And there are lower-tier versions of brain-writing gizmos that, in exchange for their free use, occasionally \"make suggestions\" directly to your brain. How will you know if your impulses are your own, or if an algorithm has stimulated that sudden craving for Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's ice cream or Gucci handbags?</p><p>\"People have been trying to manipulate each other since the beginning of time,\" Dr. Yuste told me. \"But there's a line that you cross once the manipulation goes directly to the brain, because you will not be able to tell you are being manipulated.\"</p><p>When I asked Facebook about concerns around the ethics of big tech entering the brain-computer interface space, Mr. Chevillet, of Facebook Reality Labs, highlighted the transparency of its brain-reading project. \"This is why we've talked openly about our B.C.I. research - so it can be discussed throughout the neuroethics community as we collectively explore what responsible innovation looks like in this field,\" he said in an email.</p><p>Ed Cutrell, a senior principal researcher at Microsoft, which also has a B.C.I. program, emphasized the importance of treating user data carefully. \"There needs to be clear sense of where that information goes,\" he told me. \"As we are sensing more and more about people, to what extent is that information I'm collecting about you yours?\"</p><p>Some find all this talk of ethics and rights, if not irrelevant, then at least premature.</p><p>Medical scientists working to help paralyzed patients, for example, are already governed by HIPAA laws, which protect patient privacy. Any new medical technology has to go through the Food and Drug Administration approval process, which includes ethical considerations.</p><p>(Ethical quandaries still arise, though, notes Dr. Kirsch. Let's say you want to implant a sensor array in a patient suffering from locked-in syndrome. How do you get consent to conduct surgery that might change the person's life for the better from someone who can't communicate?)</p><p>Leigh Hochberg, a professor of engineering at Brown University and part of the BrainGate initiative, sees the companies now piling into the brain-machine space as a boon. The field needs these companies' dynamism - and their deep pockets, he told me. Discussions about ethics are important, \"but those discussions should not at any point derail the imperative to provide restorative neurotechnologies to people who could benefit from them,\" he added.</p><p>Ethicists, Dr. Jepsen told me, \"must also see this: The alternative would be deciding we aren't interested in a deeper understanding of how our minds work, curing mental disease, really understanding depression, peering inside people in comas or with Alzheimer's, and enhancing our abilities in finding new ways to communicate.\"</p><p>There's even arguably a national security imperative to plow forward. China has its own version of BrainGate. If American companies don't pioneer this technology, some think, Chinese companies will. \"People have described this as a brain arms race,\" Dr. Yuste said.</p><p>Not even Dr. Gallant, who first succeeded in translating neural activity into a moving image of what another person was seeing - and who was both elated and horrified by the exercise - thinks the Luddite approach is an option. \"The only way out of the technology-driven hole we're in is more technology and science,\" he told me. \"That's just a cool fact of life.\"</p><p>Moises Velasquez-Manoff, the author of \"An Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases,\" is a contributing opinion writer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

Are our daydreams safe?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jack Gallant never set out to create a mind-reading machine. His focus was more prosaic. A computational neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Gallant worked for years to improve our understanding of how brains encode information \u2014 what regions become active, for example, when a person sees a plane or an apple or a dog \u2014 and how that activity represents the object being viewed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the late 2000s, scientists could determine what kind of thing a person might be looking at from the way the brain lit up \u2014 a human face, say, or a cat. But Dr. Gallant and his colleagues went further. They figured out how to use machine learning to decipher not just the class of thing, but which exact image a subject was viewing. (Which photo of a cat, out of three options, for instance.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One day, Dr. Gallant and his postdocs got to talking. In the same way that you can turn a speaker into a microphone by hooking it up backward, they wondered if they could reverse engineer the algorithm they\u2019d developed so they could visualize, solely from brain activity, what a person was seeing.</p><p>The first phase of the project was to train the AI. For hours, Dr. Gallant and his colleagues showed volunteers in fMRI machines movie clips. By matching patterns of brain activation prompted by the moving images, the AI built a model of how the volunteers\u2019 visual cortex, which parses information from the eyes, worked. Then came the next phase: translation. As they showed the volunteers movie clips, they asked the model what, given everything it now knew about their brains, it thought they might be looking at.</p><p>The experiment focused just on a subsection of the visual cortex. It didn\u2019t capture what was happening elsewhere in the brain \u2014 how a person might feel about what she was seeing, for example, or what she might be fantasizing about as she watched. The endeavor was, in Dr. Gallant\u2019s words, a primitive proof of concept.</p><p>And yet <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326357/\">the results</url>, published in 2011, are remarkable.</p><p>The reconstructed images <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326357/\">move with a dreamlike fluidity</url>. In their imperfection, they evoke expressionist art. (And a few reconstructed images seem downright wrong.) But where they succeed, they represent an astonishing achievement: a machine translating patterns of brain activity into a moving image understandable by other people \u2014 a machine that can read the brain.</p><p>Dr. Gallant was thrilled. Imagine the possibilities when better brain-reading technology became available? Imagine the people suffering from locked-in syndrome, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, the people incapacitated by strokes, who could benefit from a machine that could help them interact with the world?</p><p>He was also scared because the experiment showed, in a concrete way, that humanity was at the dawn of a new era, one in which our thoughts could theoretically be snatched from our heads. What was going to happen, Dr. Gallant wondered, when you could read thoughts the thinker might not even be consciously aware of, when you could see people\u2019s memories?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a real sobering thought that now you have to take seriously,\u201d he told me recently.</p><p>The \u2018Google Cap\u2019</p><p>For decades, we\u2019ve communicated with computers mostly by using our fingers and our eyes, by interfacing via keyboards and screens. These tools and the bony digits we prod them with provide a natural limit to the speed of communication between human brain and machine. We can convey information only as quickly (and accurately) as we can type or click.</p><p>Voice recognition, like that used by Apple\u2019s Siri or Amazon\u2019s Alexa, is a step toward more seamless integration of human and machine. The next step, one that scientists around the world are pursuing, is technology that allows people to control computers \u2014 and everything connected to them, including cars, robotic arms and drones \u2014 merely by thinking.</p><p>Dr. Gallant jokingly calls the imagined piece of hardware that would do this a \u201cGoogle cap\u201d: a hat that could sense silent commands and prompt computers to respond accordingly.</p><p>The problem is that, to work, that cap would need to be able to see, with some detail, what\u2019s happening in the nearly 100 billion neurons that make up the brain.</p><p>Technology that can easily peer through the skull, like the MRI machine, is far too unwieldy to mount on your head. Less bulky technology, like electroencephalogram, or E.E.G., which measures the brain\u2019s electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp, doesn\u2019t provide nearly the same clarity. One scientist <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326357/\">compares it</url> to looking for the surface ripples made by a fish swimming underwater while a storm roils the lake.</p><p>Other methods of \u201cseeing\u201d into the brain might include magnetoencephalography, or M.E.G., which measures magnetic waves emanating outside the skull from neurons firing beneath it; or using infrared light, which can penetrate living tissue, to infer brain activity from changes in blood flow. (Pulse oximeters work this way, by shining infrared light through your finger.)</p><p>What technologies will power the brain-computer interface of the future is still unclear. And if it\u2019s unclear how we\u2019ll \u201cread\u201d the brain, it\u2019s even less clear how we\u2019ll \u201cwrite\u201d to it.</p><p>This is the other holy grail of brain-machine research: technology that can transmit information to the brain directly. We\u2019re probably nowhere near the moment when you can silently ask, \u201cAlexa, what\u2019s the capital of Peru?\u201d and have \u201cLima\u201d materialize in your mind.</p><p>Even so, solutions to these challenges are beginning to emerge. Much of the research has occurred in the medical realm, where, for years, scientists have worked incrementally toward giving quadriplegics and others with immobilizing neurological conditions better ways of interacting with the world through computers. But in recent years, tech companies \u2014 including Facebook, Microsoft and Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink \u2014 have begun investing in the field.</p><p>Some scientists are elated by this infusion of energy and resources. Others worry that as this tech moves into the consumer realm, it could have a variety of unintended and potentially dangerous consequences, from the erosion of mental privacy to the exacerbation of inequality.</p><p>Rafael Yuste, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, counts two great advances in computing that have transformed society: the transition from room-size mainframe computers to personal computers that fit on a desk (and then in your lap), and the advent of mobile computing with smartphones in the 2000s. Noninvasive brain-reading tech would be a third great leap, he says.</p><p>\u201cForget about the Covid crisis,\u201d Dr. Yuste told me. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming with this new tech can change humanity.\u201d</p><p>Dear Brain</p><p>Not many people will volunteer to be the first to undergo a novel kind of brain surgery, even if it holds the promise of restoring mobility to those who\u2019ve been paralyzed. So when Robert Kirsch, the chairman of biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve University, put out such a call nearly 10 years ago, and one person both met the criteria and was willing, he knew he had a pioneer on his hands.</p><p>The man\u2019s name was Bill Kochevar. He\u2019d been paralyzed from the neck down in a biking accident years earlier. His motto, as he later explained it, was \u201csomebody has to do the research.\u201d</p><p>At that point, scientists had already invented gizmos that helped paralyzed patients leverage what mobility remained \u2014 lips, an eyelid \u2014 to control computers or move robotic arms. But Dr. Kirsch was after something different. He wanted to help Mr. Kochevar move his own limbs.</p><p>The first step was implanting two arrays of sensors over the part of the brain that would normally control Mr. Kochevar\u2019s right arm. Electrodes that could receive signals from those arrays via a computer were implanted into his arm muscles. The implants, and the computer connected to them, would function as a kind of electronic spinal cord, bypassing his injury.</p><p>Once his arm muscles had been strengthened \u2014 achieved with a regimen of mild electrical stimulation while he slept \u2014 Mr. Kochevar, who at that point had been paralyzed for over a decade, was able to feed himself and drink water. He could even scratch his nose.</p><p>About two dozen people around the world who have lost the use of limbs from accidents or neurological disease have had sensors implanted on their brains. Many, Mr. Kochevar included, participated in a United States government-funded program called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326357/\">BrainGate</url>. The sensor arrays used in this research, smaller than a button, allow patients to move robotic arms or cursors on a screen just by thinking. But as far as Dr. Kirsch knows, Mr. Kochevar, who died in 2017 for reasons unrelated to the research, was the first paralyzed person to regain use of his limbs by way of this technology.</p><p>This fall, Dr. Kirsch and his colleagues will begin version 2.0 of the experiment. This time, they\u2019ll implant six smaller arrays \u2014 more sensors will improve the quality of the signal. And instead of implanting electrodes directly in the volunteers\u2019 muscles, they\u2019ll insert them upstream, circling the nerves that move the muscles. In theory, Dr. Kirsch says, that will enable movement of the entire arm and hand.</p><p>The next major goal is to restore sensation so that people can know if they\u2019re holding a rock, say, or an orange \u2014 or if their hand has wandered too close to a flame. \u201cSensation has been the longest ignored part of paralysis,\u201d Dr. Kirsch told me.</p><p>A few years ago, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh began groundbreaking experiments on that front with a man named Nathan Copeland who was paralyzed from the upper chest down. They routed sensory information from a robotic arm into the part of his cortex that dealt with his right hand\u2019s sense of touch.</p><p>Every brain is a living, undulating organ that changes over time. That\u2019s why, before each of Mr. Copeland\u2019s sessions, the AI has to recalibrate \u2014 to construct a new brain decoder. \u201cThe signals in your brain shift,\u201d Mr. Copeland told me. \u201cThey\u2019re not exactly the same every day.\u201d</p><p>And the results weren\u2019t perfect. Mr. Copeland described them to me as \u201cweird,\u201d \u201celectrical tingly\u201d but also \u201camazing.\u201d The sensory feedback was immensely important, though, in knowing that he\u2019d actually grasped what he thought he\u2019d grasped. And more generally, it demonstrated that a person could \u201cfeel\u201d a robotic hand as his or her own, and that information coming from electronic sensors could be fed into the human brain.</p><p>Preliminary as these experiments are, they suggest that the pieces of a brain-machine interface that can both \u201cread\u201d and \u201cwrite\u201d already exist. People cannot only move robotic arms just by thinking; machines can also, however imperfectly, convey information to the brain about what that arm encounters.</p><p>Who knows how soon versions of this technology will be available for kids who want to think-move avatars in video games or think-surf the web. People <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326357/\">can already fly</url> drones with their brain signals, so maybe crude consumer versions will appear in coming years. But it\u2019s hard to overstate how life-changing such tech could be for people with spinal cord injuries or neurological diseases.</p><p>Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco, who works on brain-based speech recognition, said that maintaining the ability to communicate can mean the difference between life or death. \u201cFor some people, if they have a means to continue to communicate, that may be the reason they decide to stay alive,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat motivates us a lot in our work.\u201d</p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326357/\">recent study</url>, Dr. Chang and his colleagues predicted with up to 97 percent accuracy \u2014 the best rate yet achieved, they say \u2014 what words a volunteer had said (from about 250 words used in a predetermined set of 50 sentences) by using implanted sensors that monitored activity in the part of the brain that moves the muscles involved in speaking. (The volunteers in this study weren\u2019t paralyzed; they were epilepsy patients undergoing brain surgery to address that condition, and the implants were not permanent.)</p><p>Dr. Chang used sensor arrays similar to those Dr. Kirsch used, but a noninvasive method may not be too far away.</p><p>Facebook, which funded Dr. Chang\u2019s study, is working on a brain-reading helmet-like contraption that uses infrared light to peer into the brain. Mark Chevillet, the director of brain-computer interface research at Facebook Reality Labs, told me in an email that while full speech recognition remains distant, his lab will be able to decode simple commands like \u201chome,\u201d \u201cselect\u201d and \u201cdelete\u201d in \u201ccoming years.\u201d</p><p>This progress isn\u2019t solely driven by advances in brain-sensing technology \u2014 by the physical meeting point of flesh and machine. The AI matters as much, if not more.</p><p>Trying to understand the brain from outside the skull is like trying to make sense of a conversation taking place two rooms away. The signal is often messy, hard to decipher. So it\u2019s the same types of algorithms that now allow speech-recognition software to do a decent job of understanding spoken speech \u2014 including individual idiosyncrasies of pronunciation and regional accents \u2014 that may now enable brain-reading technology.</p><p>Zap That Urge</p><p>Not all the applications of brain reading require something as complex as understanding speech, however. In some cases, scientists simply want to blunt urges.</p><p>When Casey Halpern, a neurosurgeon at Stanford, was in college, he had a friend who drank too much. Another was overweight but couldn\u2019t stop eating. \u201cImpulse control is such a pervasive problem,\u201d he told me.</p><p>As a budding scientist, he learned about methods of deep brain stimulation used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease. A mild electric current applied to a part of the brain involved in movement could lessen tremors caused by the disease. Could he apply that technology to the problem of inadequate self control?</p><p>Working with mice in the 2010s, he identified a part of the brain, called the nucleus accumbens, where activity spiked in a predictable pattern just before a mouse was about to gorge on high-fat food. He found he could reduce how much the mouse ate by disrupting that activity with a mild electrical current. He could zap the compulsion to gorge as it was taking hold in the rodents\u2019 brains.</p><p>Earlier this year, he began testing the approach in people suffering from obesity who haven\u2019t been helped by any other treatment, including gastric-bypass surgery. He implants an electrode in their nucleus accumbens. It\u2019s connected to an apparatus that was originally developed to prevent seizures in people with epilepsy.</p><p>As with Dr. Chang or Dr. Gallant\u2019s work, an algorithm first has to learn about the brain it\u2019s attached to \u2014 to recognize the signs of oncoming loss of control. Dr. Halpern and his colleagues train the algorithm by giving patients a taste of a milkshake, or offering a buffet of the patient\u2019s favorite foods, and then recording their brain activity just before the person indulges.</p><p>He\u2019s so far completed two implantations. \u201cThe goal is to help restore control,\u201d he told me. And if it works in obesity, which afflicts roughly 40 percent of adults in the United States, he plans to test the gizmo against addictions to alcohol, cocaine and other substances.</p><p>Dr. Halpern\u2019s approach takes as fact something that he says many people have a hard time accepting: that the lack of impulse control that may underlie addictive behavior isn\u2019t a choice, but results from a malfunction of the brain. \u201cWe have to accept that it\u2019s a disease,\u201d he says. \u201cWe often just judge people and assume it\u2019s their own fault. That\u2019s not what the current research is suggesting we should do.\u201d</p><p>I must confess that of the numerous proposed applications of brain-machine interfacing I came across, Dr. Halpern\u2019s was my favorite to extrapolate on. How many lives have been derailed by the inability to resist the temptation of that next pill or that next beer? What if Dr. Halpern\u2019s solution was generalizable?</p><p>What if every time your mind wandered off while writing an article, you could, with the aid of your concentration implant, prod it back to the task at hand, finally completing those life-changing projects you\u2019ve never gotten around to finishing?</p><p>These applications remain fantasies, of course. But the mere fact that such a thing may be possible is partly what prompts Dr. Yuste, the neurobiologist, to worry about how this technology could blur the boundaries of what we consider to be our personalities.</p><p>Such blurring is already an issue, he points out. Parkinson\u2019s patients with implants sometimes report feeling more aggressive than usual when the machine is \u201con.\u201d Depressed patients undergoing deep brain stimulation sometimes wonder if they\u2019re really themselves anymore. \u201cYou kind of feel artificial,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326357/\">one patient told</url> researchers. The machine isn\u2019t implanting ideas in their minds, like Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character in the movie \u201cInception,\u201d but it is seemingly changing their sense of self.</p><p>What happens if people are no longer sure if their emotions are theirs, or the effects of the machines they\u2019re connected to?</p><p>Dr. Halpern dismisses these concerns as overblown. Such effects are part of many medical treatments, he points out, including commonly prescribed antidepressants and stimulants. And sometimes, as in the case of hopeless addiction, changing someone\u2019s behavior is precisely the goal.</p><p>Still the longer-term issue of what could happen when brain-writing technology jumps from the medical into the consumer realm is hard to forget. If my imagined focus enhancer existed, for example, but was very expensive, it could exacerbate the already yawning chasm between those who can afford expensive tutors, cars and colleges \u2014 and now grit-boosting technology \u2014 and those who cannot.</p><p>\u201cCertain groups will get this tech, and will enhance themselves,\u201d Dr. Yuste told me. \u201cThis is a really serious threat to humanity.\u201d</p><p>The Brain Business</p><p>\u201cThe idea that you have to drill holes in skulls to read the brains is nuts,\u201d Mary Lou Jepsen, the chief executive and founder of Openwater, told me in an email. Her company is developing technology that, she says, uses infrared light and ultrasonic waves to peer into the body.</p><p>Other researchers are simply trying to make invasive approaches less invasive. A company called Synchron seeks to avoid opening the skull or touching brain tissue at all by inserting a sensor through the jugular vein in the neck. It\u2019s currently undergoing a safety and feasibility trial.</p><p>Dr. Kirsch suspects that Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink is probably the best brain-sensing tech in development. It requires surgery, but unlike the BrainGate sensor arrays, it\u2019s thin, flexible and can adjust to the mountainous topography of the brain. The hope is that this makes it less caustic. It also has hairlike filaments that sink into brain tissue. Each filament contains multiple sensors, theoretically allowing the capture of more data than flatter arrays that sit at the brain\u2019s surface. It can both read and write to the brain, and it\u2019s accompanied by a robot that assists with the implantation.</p><p>A major challenge to implants is that, as Dr. Gallant says, \u201cyour brain doesn\u2019t like having stuff stuck in your brain.\u201d Over time, immune cells may swarm the implant, covering it with goop.</p><p>One way to try to avoid this is to drastically shrink the size of the sensors. Arto Nurmikko, a professor of engineering and physics at Brown University who\u2019s part of the BrainGate effort, is developing what he calls \u201cneurograins\u201d \u2014 tiny, implantable silicon sensors no larger than a handful of neurons. They\u2019re too small to have batteries, so they\u2019re powered by microwaves beamed in from outside the skull.</p><p>He foresees maybe 1,000 mini sensors implanted throughout the brain. He\u2019s so far tested them only in rodents. But maybe we shouldn\u2019t be so sure that healthy people wouldn\u2019t volunteer for \u201cmental enhancement\u201d surgery. Every year, Dr. Nurmikko poses a hypothetical to his students: 1,000 neurograin implants that would allow students to learn and communicate faster; any volunteers?</p><p>\u201cTypically about half the class says, \u2018Sure,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cThat speaks to where we are today.\u201d</p><p>Jose Carmena and Michel Maharbiz, scientists at Berkeley and founders of a start-up called Iota Biosciences, have their own version of this idea, which they call \u201cneural dust\u201d: tiny implants for the peripheral nervous system \u2014 arm, legs and organs besides the brain. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Fitbit for your liver,\u201d Dr. Carmena told me.</p><p>They imagine treating inflammatory diseases by stimulating nerves throughout the body with these tiny devices. And where Dr. Nurmikko uses microwaves to power the devices, Dr. Carmena and Dr. Maharbiz foresee the use of ultrasound to beam power to them.</p><p>Generally, they say, this kind of tech will be adopted first in the medical context and then move to the lay population. \u201cWe\u2019re going to evolve to augmenting humans,\u201d Dr. Carmena told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no question.\u201d</p><p>But hype permeates the field, he warns. Sure, Elon Musk has argued that closer brain-machine integration will help humans compete with ever-more-powerful A.I.s. But in reality, we\u2019re nowhere near a device that could, for example, help you master Kung Fu instantaneously like Keanu Reeves in \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d</p><p>What does the near future look like for the average consumer? Ramses Alcaide, the chief executive of a company called Neurable, imagines a world in which smartphones tucked in our pockets or backpacks act as processing hubs for data streaming in from smaller computers and sensors worn around the body. These devices \u2014 glasses that serve as displays, earbuds that whisper in our ears \u2014 are where the actual interfacing between human and computer will occur.</p><p>Microsoft sells a headset called HoloLens that superimposes images onto the world, an idea called \u201caugmented reality.\u201d A company called Mojo Vision is working toward a contact lens that projects monochrome images directly onto the retina, a private computer display superimposed over the world.</p><p>And Dr. Alcaide himself is working on what he sees as the linchpin to this vision, a device that, one day, may help you to silently communicate with all your digital paraphernalia. He was vague about the form the product will take \u2014 it isn\u2019t market ready yet \u2014 except to note that it\u2019s an earphone that can measure the brain\u2019s electrical activity to sense \u201ccognitive states,\u201d like whether you\u2019re hungry or concentrating.</p><p>We already compulsively check Instagram and Facebook and email, even though we\u2019re supposedly impeded by our fleshy fingers. I asked Dr. Alcaide: What will happen when we can compulsively check social media just by thinking?</p><p>Ever the optimist, he told me that brain-sensing technology could actually help with the digital incursion. The smart earbud could sense that you\u2019re working, for instance, and block advertisements or phone calls. \u201cWhat if your computer knew you were focusing?\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat if it actually removes bombardment from your life?\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s no surprise that Dr. Alcaide has enjoyed the HBO sci-fi show \u201cWestworld,\u201d a universe where technologies that make communicating with computers more seamless are commonplace (though no one seems better off for it). Rafael Yuste, on the other hand, refuses to watch the show. He likens the idea to a scientist who studies Covid-19 watching a movie about pandemics. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing I want to do,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u2018A Human Rights Issue\u2019</p><p>To grasp why Dr. Yuste frets so much about brain-reading technology, it helps to understand his research. He helped pioneer a technology that can read and write to the brain with unprecedented precision, and it doesn\u2019t require surgery. But it does require genetic engineering.</p><p>Dr. Yuste infects mice with a virus that inserts two genes into the animals\u2019 neurons. One prompts the cells to produce a protein that make them sensitive to infrared light; the other makes the neurons emit light when they activate. Thereafter, when the neurons fire, Dr. Yuste can see them light up. And he can activate neurons in turn with an infrared laser. Dr. Yuste can thus read what\u2019s happening in the mouse brain and write to the mouse\u2019s brain with an accuracy impossible with other techniques.</p><p>And he can, it appears, make the mice \u201csee\u201d things that aren\u2019t there.</p><p>In one experiment, he trained mice to take a drink of sugar water after a series of bars appeared on a screen. He recorded which neurons in the visual cortex fired when the mice saw those bars. Then he activated those same neurons with the laser, but without showing them the actual bars. The mice had the same reaction: They took a drink.</p><p>He likens what he did to implanting an hallucination. \u201cWe were able to implant into these mice perceptions of things that they hadn\u2019t seen,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe manipulated the mouse like a puppet.\u201d</p><p>This method, called optogenetics, is a long way from being used in people. To begin with, we have thicker skulls and bigger brains, making it harder for infrared light to penetrate. And from a political and regulatory standpoint, the bar is high for genetically engineering human beings. But scientists are exploring workarounds \u2014 drugs and nanoparticles that make neurons receptive to infrared light, allowing precise activation of neurons without genetic engineering.</p><p>The lesson in Dr. Yuste\u2019s view is not that we\u2019ll soon have lasers mounted on our heads that play us \u201clike pianos,\u201d but that brain-reading and possibly brain-writing technologies are fast approaching, and society isn\u2019t prepared for them.</p><p>\u201cWe think this is a human rights issue,\u201d he told me.</p><p>In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326357/\">a 2017 paper in the journal Nature</url>, Dr. Yuste and 24 other signatories, including Dr. Gallant, called for the formulation of a human rights declaration that explicitly addressed \u201cneurorights\u201d and what they see as the threats posed by brain-reading technology before it becomes ubiquitous. Information taken from people\u2019s brains should be protected like medical data, Dr. Yuste says, and not exploited for profit or worse. And just as people have the right not to self-incriminate with speech, we should have the right not to self-incriminate with information gleaned from our brains.</p><p>Dr. Yuste\u2019s activism was prompted in part, he told me, by the large companies suddenly interested in brain-machine research.</p><p>Say you\u2019re using your Google Cap. And like many products in the Google ecosystem, it collects information about you, which it uses to help advertisers target you with ads. Only now, it\u2019s not harvesting your search results or your map location; it\u2019s harvesting your thoughts, your daydreams, your desires.</p><p>Who owns those data?</p><p>Or imagine that writing to the brain is possible. And there are lower-tier versions of brain-writing gizmos that, in exchange for their free use, occasionally \u201cmake suggestions\u201d directly to your brain. How will you know if your impulses are your own, or if an algorithm has stimulated that sudden craving for Ben &amp;amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream or Gucci handbags?</p><p>\u201cPeople have been trying to manipulate each other since the beginning of time,\u201d Dr. Yuste told me. \u201cBut there\u2019s a line that you cross once the manipulation goes directly to the brain, because you will not be able to tell you are being manipulated.\u201d</p><p>When I asked Facebook about concerns around the ethics of big tech entering the brain-computer interface space, Mr. Chevillet, of Facebook Reality Labs, highlighted the transparency of its brain-reading project. \u201cThis is why we\u2019ve talked openly about our B.C.I. research \u2014 so it can be discussed throughout the neuroethics community as we collectively explore what responsible innovation looks like in this field,\u201d he said in an email.</p><p>Ed Cutrell, a senior principal researcher at Microsoft, which also has a B.C.I. program, emphasized the importance of treating user data carefully. \u201cThere needs to be clear sense of where that information goes,\u201d he told me. \u201cAs we are sensing more and more about people, to what extent is that information I\u2019m collecting about you yours?\u201d</p><p>Some find all this talk of ethics and rights, if not irrelevant, then at least premature.</p><p>Medical scientists working to help paralyzed patients, for example, are already governed by HIPAA laws, which protect patient privacy. Any new medical technology has to go through the Food and Drug Administration approval process, which includes ethical considerations.</p><p>(Ethical quandaries still arise, though, notes Dr. Kirsch. Let\u2019s say you want to implant a sensor array in a patient suffering from locked-in syndrome. How do you get consent to conduct surgery that might change the person\u2019s life for the better from someone who can\u2019t communicate?)</p><p>Leigh Hochberg, a professor of engineering at Brown University and part of the BrainGate initiative, sees the companies now piling into the brain-machine space as a boon. The field needs these companies\u2019 dynamism \u2014 and their deep pockets, he told me. Discussions about ethics are important, \u201cbut those discussions should not at any point derail the imperative to provide restorative neurotechnologies to people who could benefit from them,\u201d he added.</p><p>Ethicists, Dr. Jepsen told me, \u201cmust also see this: The alternative would be deciding we aren\u2019t interested in a deeper understanding of how our minds work, curing mental disease, really understanding depression, peering inside people in comas or with Alzheimer\u2019s, and enhancing our abilities in finding new ways to communicate.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s even arguably a national security imperative to plow forward. China has its own version of BrainGate. If American companies don\u2019t pioneer this technology, some think, Chinese companies will. \u201cPeople have described this as a brain arms race,\u201d Dr. Yuste said.</p><p>Not even Dr. Gallant, who first succeeded in translating neural activity into a moving image of what another person was seeing \u2014 and who was both elated and horrified by the exercise \u2014 thinks the Luddite approach is an option. \u201cThe only way out of the technology-driven hole we\u2019re in is more technology and science,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s just a cool fact of life.\u201d</p><p>Moises Velasquez-Manoff, the author of \u201cAn Epidemic of Absence: A New Way of Understanding Allergies and Autoimmune Diseases,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3326357/\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

Here is a selection of key developments and news you should know in Latin America's largest economy during the week ending July, 25, 2020:        Startups avoid redundancies and boost revenue amid crisis    Most Brazilian startups have not reduced their workforce despite the pressure of the Covid-19 crisis, according to a new survey released by the Brazilian Service of Support for Micro and Small Enterprises (SEBRAE) in partnership with the Brazilian Innovation Agency (FINEP).    The survey with 833 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) carried out between May 28 and 3 June has found that 76% of tech-based, innovative businesses have not made any employees redundant as a result of the pandemic and 16% have continued to hire. On the other hand, 36% of the businesses deemed \"traditional\" in the survey had to let staff go since the new coronavirus outbreak began and recruitment has been mostly stagnant.     Some 13% of the startups polled have also managed to boost their revenues despite the crisis, something that has been reported by only 4% of the traditional SMEs. However, tech startups have more difficulty in accessing credit: this has been reported by 52% of these innovative businesses in relation to 39% of smaller enterprises where business models don't rely on technology.    ***    Brazilian games market among world's top five    Brazil is the world's fourth largest market for games after India, United States and China. According to a new study by Comscore with data from Mobile Metrix and Multiplatform, there are 84 million gamers in Brazil, which is 70% of the country's online population, currently estimated at 120 million. Of that total, 64.3 million only use mobile devices to play games, while 8.4 million do so through more than one platform and 11.6 million connect only through desktop computers.    ***    Google releases economic impact figures for Brazil    Use of Google tools has generated BRL 51 billion (USD 9.7 billion) in economic impact in Brazil in 2019, according to a report released by the company to mark its 15 years in the country. According to the Big Tech, over 188,000 Brazilian businesses, publishers, NGOs, creators and developers in the country have benefitted from the company's offering including ad and search tools, as well as Google Play and YouTube.    ***    Facebook requests consent for personal data use    Facebook has introduced requests to use certain types of personal user data in Brazil on Monday (20). Without specifying which types of data would require user consent, the social media platform said this was part of wider measures towards data protection compliance. The General Data Protection Regulations will go live in Brazil on August 14, with sanctions for non-compliance set to be enforced a year later, in August 2021.    ***    Central Bank speeds up instant payments launch    Brazil's Central Bank announced it has decided to bring forward the first stage of its instant payments system PIX. The previous launch date of November 3 has changed to October 5. From that date, bank customers will be able to register the keys that will enable payments through the system. With PIX, Brazilians will no longer have to use information such as bank number, branch and account to make transfers, which will take place round-the-clock rather than only on weekdays.    ***    Brazil ranks high in UN e-government survey    Brazil is one of the fast-movers listed in the latest United Nations e\u2011government survey, along with Argentina, Chile and Costa Rica. This is the first time Brazil appears in the \"very high\" group of the report's E-Government Development Index (EGDI). Highlights outlined in the UN report include Brazil's digital governance strategy, as well as the Brazilian digital transformation strategy, which relates to the transformation of the economy. The UN report also cited Brazil's policy frameworks for digital inclusion and improved access to public data and information.    ***    Nubank announces first international M&amp;A    S\u00e3o Paulo-headquartered fintech Nubank announced the purchase of Cognitect, a North American software engineering consultancy, in its first international acquisition. The value of the transaction has not been disclosed. Cognitect has provided services to the Brazilian fintech, which will incorporate its approximately 20 employees, since 2014. This is Nubank's second acquisition - in January, the company had purchased Plataformatec, a Brazilian software consulting firm. The finch also has an engineering team in Berlin, Germany. Valued at USD 10.4 billion in 2019, Nubank has approximately 26 million customers across its operations in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42684065553</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FC-2NV1-F07F-835G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 25, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Mr Conte heads a fractious year-old populist coalition between the League and the Five Star Movement, which soured further during last month's campaigning for European parliamentary elections. The tech giant Apple has announced that its music download service, iTunes, is to be shut down. The firm announced the launch of a range of replacement music, podcast and television apps at its annual developer conference in San Jose. </p><p>iTunes has lost subscribers in recent years as listeners increasingly turn to streaming services. Our tech reporter David Lee was at that conference in San Jose, later we will be hearing from him. The share price in the so-called FAANG stocks, that's the acronym encompassing the big tech giants, have seen their share price slump in the US. That was mostly in the NASDAQ index. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google's parent company Alphabet saw $137 billion wiped off their stock market value. With me is Lawrence Gosling, editor-in-chief of What Investment. Good morning Laurence. Good morning. Why the huge sell-off? Any excuse to take profits, but why this time? We've seen a series of announcements from all of these individual companies. Google has some anti-trust issues in the US, Netflix is borrowing too much money to make too many programmes, individual problems within each company but when you put them together you are seeing something amazing. That was driving the market and people are thinking perhaps the ride is over. And with iTunes, that the latest one of these developments. There was also news that Facebook was getting ready for anti-trust sort of investigations as well. Yeah. There is a concern that Facebook, Amazon and the likes of others, they are now so huge and did that perhaps they need to be taken down a peg or two by regulators. Exactly. In the US, it's become a big part of the US presidential election, the fact that there is a feeling that they are all too big and should be broken up into little pieces because again, many of them are effectively monopolies in the space that they operate in. And you know, we as consumers, governments, like monopolies. So there is a general feeling that the great times of these big, big tech businesses might be over and we are onto the next iteration or phase of them. That makes investors nervous out there. And there are still nervous about the trade were as well. Thank you Lawrence for now. -- trade wars. So much more to come on the briefing including taking a stand: Japanese women campaign to end dress codes that demand they wear high heels to work. The Queen and her husband began their royal progress to Westminster. The moment of crowning in accordance with the order of service, by a signal given, the great guns of the Tower shall be shot off. Tributes have been paid around the world to Muhammad Ali, who has died at the age of 74. Outspoken but rarely outfought, Ali transcended the sport of boxing, of which he was three times a world champion. He was a good fighter. He fought all the way to the end, even through his illness. Yes, he did. UEFA imposes an indefinite ban on English clubs playing in Europe. Today is the 20th anniversary of the release of The Beatles LP Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, a record described as \"the album of the century.\" You're watching The Briefing. Our headlines: Sudan's military has called a snap election after its deadly crackdown on protesters, scrapping plans for a three year transition. After the pomp, comes the politics. Its Day 2 of President Trump's state visit to the UK, with talks with the Prime Minister and business leaders on the agenda. Let's stay with that now. Let's stay with that now and go back to Philippa Thomas at Buckingham Palace.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-0e2ccc6284f64a999edcdd6d5e107fa5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W88-1J41-DY08-30P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

He is even talking about perhaps other countries following the guide of the European Union with the introduction of GDP are rules, new regulations introduced last year which regulate to a great degree how data is used within Europe. What do you make of what he had to say?</p><p> On one level you can be quite sceptical about it, it is sort of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. You think of the problems which happened with Cambridge Analytica, the outrage that people's data is being used and mind. So Mark Zuckerberg has come up with a few suggestions as to how regulators might start to look at ways of managing online stuff, political advertising, privacy, data portability. What he means is people flocking your data. On the other angle, this is a new technology. This is relatively new, it has grown exponentially from somebody at University setting up a webpage. It is unsurprising regulators are playing catch up. So it is a sort of chicken and egg. He also talked about how they would assess on Facebook how various campaigns are funded and promoted on their social media site, so for example it has been seen that in the run-up to various votes in Parliament, meaningful vote one, two, three, et cetera, there has been a huge amount of money invested in various campaigns on Facebook in the run-up to these boats. Absolutely, and you look at the US, the Mueller report, and where is the funding for that? And how does that work online? This is what this regulation is seeking to manage. EFT talks about the fact it is failing to check the backlash against big tech, Facebook, Google and others. Even though there is this big backlash, their user numbers per month go up and up and up. People are still using Facebook, regardless of their feelings about it. And this is the irony, we get an amazing service, this platform where people share multiple images and communicate with people for free. There is no such thing as a free lunch, Sally. Lets have a look at the press in Slovakia, because they have a new president, a liberal woman, who surprisingly one in this election. What does this mean for Slovakia and the region? It is interesting, as you point out, regionally, where we have seen people like Viktor Orban, not particularly pro-European or pro integration, the winner is very much breaking the mould of what we have seen there. But what she will be able to achieve, Sally, remains to be seen. There is already a backlash and Viktor Orban has already attacked her. She is not inaugurated until June and there are stories the opposition will seek to stymie her liberal agenda by passing laws before that to limit things like LGBTI rights. And scooters, I went to Paris not so long ago and you see Lime scooters everywhere, listed all over the pavement. People are whizzing around the capital in them. It is a new disruptive tech in time for the summer. The regulations in the UK are not quite in place yet, an old law is being used, something about horses and carriages, but it really is a balance. You have to be balanced. And there have been huge problems with regulating Uber, and the safety record. Let's hope we can have some scootering in the sun. Thank you for joining us on the Briefing. We have heard from many of you on electric scooters, Remi says it is a great idea but they will be a death trap in cities without proper cycle path slack in the UK. Many parts of the UK and London have proper cycle path but it is a work in progress. Another viewer says cities are limiting vehicle access due to congestion. Scooters will soon join public transport and bicycles in the future. I will see you soon. Hello again. We're going to see some big changes in our weather over the next few days of this week. Not much snow on the mountains in Scotland at the moment in this Weather Watch picture,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-12ef594da2d3456480fa334fca1b5d83</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSM-2BM1-DY08-352W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

One of the main dailies in Germany, Frankfurter Allgemeine, looking at this story in detail, quite a hard article looking at Johnson and about the fact that he wants this deadline of 31 October to be met regardless, deal or no deal, do or die, et cetera. They are focusing very much on that. They are focusing very much on that, and they obviously also focus on the #39 billion, because Boris said we will just keep back the #39 billion and in good German fashion they say that is really a big concern for them. </p><p>We have a deal, and the UK now needs to pay. #39 billion which was a part of the withdrawal agreement that the UK would pay. I think that is their main concern, that they basically say how is he going to get to a negotiated deal in 99 days, and it looks like a no deal Brexit. Let's look at Boris one more time, on the Daily Mirror front page, a photograph of that moment when he met and had an audience with the Queen. She formally asked him to put together a new government. He says I don't know why anyone would want the job. It is not him, it is the queen who said that. He leaked what the Queen said, which is an absolute no-no. He broke protocol when he said she told him, I don't know why anybody would want the job. She may have a point, but when you look at what unfolded, it was a titanic shift in terms... The establishment have just become the back benches, and the back benches have become the establishment. Facebook, really quickly, a big fine, and we were expecting it to come. They probably had the money tucked away to one side. $5 billion, a pretty hefty sum of money, but for Facebook, making as much as it is on a monthly basis... When you have a $15 billion free cash flow, this $5 billion doesn't really matter. But I think your previous guest made a very good point, saying this doesn't matter, but if they look at anti-trust and they curb the way in which Facebook can do business, that will be a problem because they will have to reinvent themselves. And obviously with Libra they have met some hurdles. And your thoughts on the outlook for Facebook? Today we are talking about their stellar earnings, but they are being challenged on every side when it comes to regulators looking at every single aspect of their business. And it is not just the regulation, it is also the taxation. Let's not forget the Europeans and the G7 finance ministers were very, very clear that these big tech companies should start paying taxes where they earn them, because they put a lot of them through Ireland, for instance, a lot of the headquarters where they don't have to pay much tax. So they will be... You know, when you are too successful, people will gun for you. I have tweeted this story this morning on BBC online. How to sleep in heatwave. It has the top ten tips. No napping is the top tip evolve. I can't stick that one. Chill your socks, number five. Put your socks in the freezer and put them on. I have a much better solution. Come and do the early morning newspaper review. You don't get to sleep because you have to be in the news flow. So you don't sleep at all. How much sleep you get at night, out of interest, on a normal day? Between three and five hours. So you are a little bit like Margaret Thatcher, she only had four hours a night. I am a clinical insomniac. Let's hear from some of our viewers, who have sent their opinions and views. Eddie says we fit these into our ceilings, they have fans in the ceilings which are remote-controlled lists. Drink water, avoid alcohol in the evening, avoid eating anything heavy. I would agree with that advice. Others have said they got fans. Mr Celtic said frozen gel packs are more efficient at cooling you down if you apply them to your pulse points, wrists or neck. Lots of practical solutions. Interesting. Thank you for your time. Maybe you are also an insomniac, which is why you are watching me. I will see you soon. Bye.

It is a political diversion, but the real question is what it leads to, could it lead to regulation of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, given what we have learned about run-up to the 2016 presidential election? This is the thing about Trump, his desire to create a diversionary tactic, some of these big tech companies could be facing regulation. Whether or not a new Congress be on the November passes any of this, let's wait and see. Let's talk about the French President Emmanuel Macron has a lovely big majority in the French parliament and was swept into power, et cetera. But it would seem things are getting quite tricky for him now, his high-profile environment Minister has quit. Yeah, so this is his Energy Minister, Nicolas Hulot. It seems he has -- it seems Emmanuel Macron has die back en France's commitment to reduce emissions. It looks like Emmanuel Macron has pushed out that commitment. Reduce that? Exactly, and Hulot has rather spectacularly resigned in a television studio, it would appear. I read this book about Macron when I was on my summer holidays by the Economist's bureau chief, so it is absolutely fascinating. He is trying to reform France in a way that, because it kind of gave up after about a year and Francois Hollande, for lots of geopolitical reasons, not least the terrorist threat, was never able to do. He is trying to reform France, I think it is fascinating, the Economist of really interested in the Macron journey. And how far it will go, that is the real question, as you mentioned. Francois Hollande and also Nicolas Sarkozy before him trying to make a lot of reforms. He has got the French parliament with his people in it, that is not lost for ever in French politics. Indeed. But in France, I think you get quite good holidays, quite long holidays across Europe compared to the United States, where you don't. This story on the front page of the Times, why long holidays can add the years July. Two weeks holiday a year or more could lengthen your life. Interesting, I know in the US the average is ten days's leave a year. In Europe, it is more. Which I think is crazy, we all know, I book the end of a year. I don't know about you and I don't know about viewers, I have to have two weeks in the summer if I can and two weeks in winter. In Japan, they don't have any live, they just have lots of public holidays. Any why people get burnt out. Really, really simple stuff takes longer and longer to do. -- any leave. All this story is pointing out is that heading to the gym at 5:30am on the morning without good long holidays is probably bad for your health. But you can put The Briefing on and watch that while you are working out. That is an improvement, that has to help health I would imagine, your mental health anyway. Coming up, after your summer break, how are you feeling about this next quarter? Positive, Brexit, business, your thoughts? Just briefly. There are huge amount still on the horizon, frankly I think we have got to push on and be as positive as we can but there are lots of storm clouds on the horizon. Always, thank you. But the with us. Good to see you. Good to have you too. Stay with the BBC as we keep you up-to-date. Goodbye for now.

A resolution unveiled by Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republican majority in the Senate, could see a vote on the timetable as early as Thursday. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democratic minority in the Senate, has called the proposals a cover-up and a national disgrace. So what can we expect to happen?</p><p> The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue reports from Washington. Will all senators now stand and remain standing, and raise their right-hand. Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trail of the impeachment of Donald John Trump... Yes, these are 100 members of the United States Senate, but now they are also jurors and judges be they get to fix the rules of the trail and decide on guilt. we will be sitting there and chairs for about six hours a day starting at 1pm eastern time, six days a week, so this is going to be, I think, kind of a gruelling exercise but also one that will be public. The President faces two charges. The first is that he abused his power by pressuring the President of Ukraine to investigate one of his main democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden. The second is that he obstructed Congress by trying to stop officials giving evidence and withholding documents. There are almost no rules for a trail like this and immigrants and Republicans are completely at odds over whether to call witnesses at all. That all means this trail could last anything from 2- six weeks. Democrats want to hear from John Bolton, who reportedly likened the pressure being put on Ukraine to a drug deal. But Republicans are threatening to retaliate, by insisting Joe Biden or his son appear too. In the coming days, Senate Republicans are going to face a choice. Will they take their cues from the White House and engage in a cover-up for President Trump? Or will they, in this most sacred of undertakings prescribed by the Constitution, vote for a fair trial with witnesses? The President continues to dismiss his impeachment as a hoax, instead focusing on his achievements. And what do I get out of it? Tell me? I'd get impeached! That's what they get out of it, by these radical left lunatics, I'd get impeached. But that's OK, the farmers are sticking with Trump. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict the President and remove him from office. That is extremely unlikely, nevertheless, these coming weeks will resonate for years to come. Let's brief you on some of the other stories making the news. New figures from the UN show that nearly half a billion people work less than they want to or not at all. The International Labour Organisation also forcasts that unemployment will rise by about two and a half million this year, due to a stagnating global economy. The agency believes this has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion. Malaysia has revealed it's sent back 150 shipping containers of illegally-imported plastic waste to the developed countries it came from. Richer countries have been sending plastic to Malaysia since 2018, when China banned most waste imports. But Malaysia's government has taken a stand, saying it doesn't want to be the world's garbage dump. Canadian lawyers representing the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing have argued that the crimes the United States has accused her off would not be considered against the law in Canada. They say that Ms Meng should not be extradited to the US to face charges of fraud and violating American sanctions on Iran. More on that in Business Briefing. The head of Google has called for artificial intelligence to be regulated. Writing in the Financial Times, Sundar Pichai said it was \"too important not to\" impose regulation but argued for \"a sensible approach\". Last week it was revealed that the European Commission is considering a five-year ban on facial recognition. Priya Lakhani is the founder and CEO of Century Tech, she's with me now. It seems that the head of a big tech company, trying to seize the initiative and suggest elation before regulation is imposed.

So do screen stars have It asks that question. </p><p>in the China Daily? And then the final story Why the country's craze for cats is fuelling big business in Beijing. Thomas James Roby here, James Hughes, he says he does not like cats at all but let's not hold that against him. Let's look at the Times's front-page. They are dominating, Facebook shares hit extremely hard, no surprise really? No, on this story probably has a lot of Lex to go. There is a lot going to happen before we see the end of this. -- legs. What this story really focuses on is almost the landslide we saw when this news came out and obviously, we have these so-called stocks, Facebook, Is on, Google or Alphabet, as they are known, these companies have been so well known for so long, with very little bad press coming out about them. -- Amazon. Apart from Uber. Yeah, apart from Uber. We know that data is always a sticking point for any sort of social company, we know that when that has been compromised or used outside of anything it should be used for, there is a downside to the price. On the issue of cause for Facebook and Google, for example, in that group, and for Twitter and others, if the decision is made, they should be regulated, policed in some way, what impact will that have on the likes of Facebook? Also, some are asking the question about to what extent they want to be using these platforms at all if their data is being used, find out or sent out without their knowledge.

Yeah, and I think that is what they have said they are going to do. -- Mark Zuckerberg. All of the big tech companies will be following this story really closely, because it has a knock-on effect, all these big companies get hit when there is any news around these big tech stocks. Now, the San Francisco Chronicle looking in detail of what actually happens, this self driving taxi on the road, testing condition but actually on the real road and a woman was not down and tragically, she died. This is no fault by Uber, but this is the problem with this technology, isn't it? Is very difficult to predict human behaviour. Absolutely, and the argument behind this would save look, this is computer code we are looking out. Algorithms. These algorithms, they are not the reactions of a computer, this is Hull computer will react in the face of a situation like this. The police and the officials who run this said that it was not at fault, the driver was not at fault, this would have happened, and an interesting line in this, this would have happened... Because the lady just came out in between two vehicles. Autonomous or human driving car, the exact same situation would have happened, so these Dougherty said. I do not think it is necessarily the end of the road for this kind of tech knowledge it because this is seen as the kind of future car travel especially. -- the authorities said. It is or is different when the name Uber is involved because there is such bad press around Uber, there is such bad perception. Because bbc.co.uk is testing all this is well. The perception of which is totally different to Uber. It is totally opposite, as you say. Looking at this innovation, as it were. What do you think? Do you feel safer with self driving cars on the road or not? It is like viewers have been saying, driverless car cannot drink, take drugs or use a mobile phone when it is driving. Can't be overtired.

But actually last year it is quite interesting because a very strong proportion of what we call fixed income assets which are bonds became negative yielding and because of that gold became more interesting for investors. Let's see if that continues stopping let's move away from the Middle East and talk about tech, because the EU are proposing new rules of digital service law, but there is some resistance not surprisingly from big tech companies. There is, and probably this story will run for years. </p><p>The EU's Digital services act, the new rules will probably propose that companies are legally liable for the illegal content. And the lobbying group and Google, saying if you do that, if you make us personally liable, and this could be some executive, then actually you have created a disincentive for us to creep proactive to uncover the illegal content. They are saying yes, we do need of course to have some accountability but not necessarily personal accountability. But it is quite clear that these arguments could run, they have been running for a while. For years they have been trying to discuss this. Meanwhile, the debate rages on about more regulation, but one imagines the lobbyist are extremely powerful on this. They certainly have a lot of money behind them so from that position, yes they will be powerful. Where do you think this will go? Will there be a sorting out of this in the immediate future or is it going to be something that drags on and the big tech companies just grow in their power and strength and are able to resist it even more? I would hope that there would be some degree of compromise. Clearly the hate stuff, the child sexual content, has shocked everybody and everybody knows that there needs to be some degree of regulation, but it is very difficult to imagine that this is going to be done quickly. Let's talk about this story has. This is coming out of Las Vegas and that CES Expo, and the unveiling launch of this plant-based pork substitute by one of the leading alternative meat producers called impossible foods, and they are really hoping to take a big portion of the pork market, and pork is the most widely consumed meat in the world. It is indeed and within China it is enormous. There is a huge consumer demand for pork, and that was hit over the course of last year by swine flu which decimated huge herds of pigs in China, but it's more than that. This is to do with climate change, this is to do with demographic change. Animals increasingly in the spotlight for creating a lot of CO2 emissions, and also the cost of feeding an animal. Environmentally it would be a lot cheaper and more efficient to grow the crops and use that to feed humans, rather than go through the animal life-cycle as well. This is a story which isn't going to go away. I've recently saw a company in Israel that were 3D printing steaks out of plant-based content. That this is something that is really expanding but the interesting part of one is that they are not going to be doing sausages, which beyond meat are already doing, but they are also going to be doing aim men's cute which could be more widely incorporated. And the fact that Burger King are launching the impossible sausage next week in the US in 67 of the restaurants, it shows, I'd imagine if it catches on and a method of global change, that is going to be a test case. Absolutely, there is certainly demand but with demographic change, with the population of Africa and Asia bound to grow, we know it is going to grow very significantly, the cost of meat will be rising significantly which means for many of us, there will be no choice really apart from to use plant-based substitutes. Having tried any of these? I haven't, which is where because I don't actually like meat. I thought I would be number one on the list but I haven't yet. I'd definitely want to move more towards plant-based stuff so I will need to give these products a go. I don't know if my kids will be into it though. Thank you so much for taking us through the papers and for being with us. Stay with us here on BBC News, so much more to come. We will have more coverage of that funeral of Qasem Soleimani as well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-97c3ebbd0b9f47adac9f9f2ccdfb54e6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXJ-1M01-JBH6-C3WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

If there was another shutdown kicking off on Friday, the political damage would be huge for both parties, imagine all those hundreds of thousands of federal workers will probably still feeling the effect of the shutdown in terms of wages not paid, the impact on their households, but everybody else and their prostration, the fact that nothing is getting done.

The front page of Politico, it highlights the battle against fake news. The UK industry, the BBC is part of this as well, looking at our online as well. Give us your take on the idea that news coming through the power and I am on Facebook and Google should be regulated. Yeah, I mean I think we're going to see a lot more of this in 2019. I do not think it is going to go away and I think every week, even daily, we will see different reasons for people to call for more pressure and more scrutiny from regulators on the big tech companies in those platforms.

News it is not actually true, that is presented as real through various platforms and the impact that has. That is right and my sense is that by looking at regulating bouts, the idea is to look at opportunities to allow higher quality journalism to come through, as opposed to pieces that may not actually be accurate. It did stop short of saying that the tech giant should be funding local journalism, for example, something that has been mooted in the past. Let's move on the new tech, we have analogue TV being switched off in Hong Kong. Not to new. Is not that you and then we had this massive, massive wind farm off the coast of Yorkshire in the UK. -- too. Many would argue that it is progress, is much-needed progress with all this news coming from the UK and others about our climate getting warmer and the catastrophic implications that has. Absolutely. No, so it is brilliant at their alternative sources of energy and I think that this piece in the Guardian does talk about how this windfarm is looking to actually make up for some of the shortcomings, I guess the retraction of investment in nuclear power, so it is looking at alternative investment. It is going to be the largest windfarm in the world once it is at capacity. It is amazing to me I think that for the first turbines are going up, they are going to be taller than the Gherkin, I think is what I have read, and then by the time it is completed, the plant is going to be taller than the Shard here in London. Icy wind turbines all the time, actually they are just part of the landscape. Yeah, it is brilliant, I think this piece focused on the UK and Germany, which actually leading the way. I think they account for about 35% of your's wind generated energy. And it just goes to show you how Europe in many ways is leading on this, sustainable energy, which is something that the whole world needs to get behind. This is a developer that is based in Denmark, so it is not even a UK developer, it is a Danish developer based in the UK. It does demonstrate how Europe is leading. OK, thank you very much. The analogue TV switch in Hong Kong, we did not really talk about that story. But unfortunate, they are just going to have to switch to digital TV, I am afraid.

But once you have a referendum, you have a referendum and you have to move forward with it, whatever the result is. That is what the government are trying to do, albeit not particularly well. </p><p>This story about EU tax breaks, will it incite -- will it entice city staff? This is a story that we have seen hundreds of times since the referendum. Jobs in the UK in the finance industry are going to get paid millions and millions of pounds. How many times have we heard that story? We have no idea whether it's going to be the case or not. We know financial firms to move staff around. There is uncertainty about what it means, especially within financial regulation and financial services. There will be banks, financial service companies that are looking to move their staff elsewhere. Whether it is going to be a massive windfall for city financial workers, I wouldn't be so sure that it necessarily means that. Also if your job, free example, moved elsewhere and he wanted to keep doing that job, you would have to go with the job. It might be where the job is on offer. It might be a bonus to what happens. You do have to go where the work is. People still have to do these jobs, these jobs still need to be done. Is this something that worries you? It would be. The industries we are in are under threat that they are continuously under threat. They are under threat from Donald Trump sang whatever he likes. There is always a threat. Let us look at the Financial Times. The Premier league right story. There has been a deal to some of the TV rights and it's a lot less than last year. Still a huge amount. The figures are, we are talking to packages which haven't been sold in this. It is #4.4 billion. The total package last time was 5.1 billion. It is a significant amount of money less. It is still a significant amount of money. The people that are going to be upset this situation are the Premier league themselves. We have seen this in all the fashion or must growth in the amount of money. That seems to have stalled somewhat. It's going to be the Premier league clubs. They are paying a stomach or wages. Clubs building new stadiums. They rely on this money coming in. With that then falling back, is that going to be passed on to the fans? The cost of sport for the fans is a huge issue. Is the fact that they are going to receive less money, is that going to be passed on to the fans? That is a big issue. The Premier league was hoping that Facebook and Amazon would ramp up the competition. Why has that happened? There are still two packages left. The Premier league is saying there are a number of interested bidders. The packages that are left are bank holiday games and midweek games. What is the case here? These big tech giants would push these prices even higher. Was that story there to push these prices higher? Whether they haven't come in this time or plant in the future another big thing. That's the way people are digestive and every form of media these days. Its debris the 14th, we can't go without touching on this lovely picture here. Two Swans in the Irish Times. Very gamely creating a little hard for us. Is it something you celebrate with a loved one. It doesn't matter what you personally think a balance on state. It's what you should approach it. My husband your other half thinks. That's how whispered, happy Valentine's Day. You are so right. Thank you very much but taking us through the papers. We will see little later. In the rest of the team, it is goodbye for now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-6914473663ed4d3bb94392f902d1708f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RN0-6G11-DY08-347P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

The possibilities are hidden inside our minds, scientists claim - as long as we can develop the technology to unlock it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some of Britain's top scientists are competing against the giants of Silicon Valley to create devices that could turn the average person into a genius, let us control electronics using our minds or free people with mobility difficulties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The possibilities of mind-reading technology are endless: from personalised games and films that read your brainwaves, to helping paralysed people to move their limbs independently. The big question is who will get there first. US and EU governments are pouring hundreds of billions into efforts to map the brain.</p><p>Silicon Valley has research budgets to match. Last month, Facebook said it had developed a prototype <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/12/facebook-working-ways-read-thoughts-job-adverts-suggest/\">for a headset that can transfer a person's thoughts directly</url> onto a computer screen.</p><p>The company says the new technology could help people with paralysis communicate, although it is unclear how the invention, described by founder Mark Zuckerberg as the \"ultimate communication technology\" will make it into Facebook's services.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla founder and tech billionaire Elon Musk announced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/12/facebook-working-ways-read-thoughts-job-adverts-suggest/\">he had gone one step further</url> . His side project Neuralink unveiled plans to implant computer chips in people's brains that could treat diseases and enable superhuman intelligence.</p><p>But both these developments are still years away, and the UK tech scene's approach is far less theoretical. One East London start-up, Myndplay, has developed brainwave-reading technology that aims to create a generation of \"Jedi mind warriors\", according to founder Tre Azam.</p><p>The company has already worked with advertising giant Ogilvy to find the algorithm to measure pleasure, and has run a project with G4S to help prisoners control their tempers.</p><p>The technology, used as a headband or paired with virtual reality headsets, allows people to peek inside their own mind and watch how it reacts to external stimulus. This, Azam says, will allow people to learn more about themselves and become capable of increased levels of concentration or calm at will.</p><p>Myndplay says its technology could also be used to control devices, replacing touchscreens or voice control systems. In a prototype released last week, the company proved small objects such as a fan or a lightswitch can be controlled using the power of concentration.</p><p>Ni2o, a University of Oxford spin-off, is close to commercialising a chip that could provide a less invasive alternative to deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinson's and other diseases. It could lower the cost of treatment from $23,000 (\u00a319,000) to less than $2,000 (\u00a31,650).</p><p>The chip, smaller than a grain of rice, would be implanted in areas of the brain where clinical treatment is needed, sending tiny jolts of electrical energy to stimulate parts of the brain in response to neural impulses, allowing people to control their movements with far more ease.</p><p>\"A lot of research communities want a machine to be better than a human or augmenting a human. I saw there was a gap, and a necessity, for restoring human dignity,\" says Dr Newton Howard, a professor in Oxford's computational neuroscience lab. \"Each person we are able to treat is a success. It breaks my heart that we don't have a solution today.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/01/12/facebook-working-ways-read-thoughts-job-adverts-suggest/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>He admits the same technique could be used to stimulate the brain and turbocharge our intelligence. \"You can become a genius depending on the areas you are targeting and frequencies you operate in.\"</p><p>However just as one can turn on the genius tap, this technology could be exploited in the reverse, blocking people's thoughts and dumbing them down. We should be concerned about the ethics of this technology, he argues. Last year reports emerged of workers in China being hooked up to mindreading technology in an effort to tell whether they were feeling rage.</p><p>Researchers have also expressed concern that Big Tech could not only rewrite the way this technology is used, but scare regulators into blocking developments that would make a positive difference.</p><p>\"What keeps me awake at night is the thought that this could be developed by Musk and Zuckerberg,\" one researcher from a top UK university says. \"Their motives are weird, they know little about the topics that they jump into.\"</p><p>Dr Howard says one of his fears is Big Tech will \"turn things sour for everyone. Regulators might say 'We haven't been able to regulate you on social media, how do we trust augmenting your reign and allowing you into the human brain?' The damage is for everyone else that is well intended.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-55169616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WST-6XW1-JCJY-G045-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 11, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

For a twenty-year stretch, regardless of party control, the agency was utterly, dismally apathetic to the lack of competition in the broadband space. But under Wheeler, the FCC has not only made broadband competition a priority, but has engaged in other bizarre, uncharacteristic behaviors -- like using actual real-world data[5] to influence policy decisions.Obviously, this doesn't please incumbent telecom operators like AT...Verizonand Comcast, who grew pretty comfortable with an FCC that asked \"how high\" when commanded to jump. The reality is that this is just what it looks like when a regulator does its job and tries to fix a very broken market. </p><p>But incapable of admitting the broadband market's horribly broken, the telecom industry instead seems intent on pointing fingers elsewhere. In a strange story over at Politico[6], broadband providers blame Googlefor absolutely everything the FCC has been up to.The quest to open the set top box, the quest for more unlicensed spectrum, and the quest for better consumer privacy controls? All the fault of Alphabet and Google: The cable industry-led Future of TV Coalition earlier this year suggested Googlehad \"a sneak preview\" of the FCC's February plan to open up the set-top box market to new competitors. The move would require pay-TV companies to make their content streams available to third parties that want to build and sell their own boxes \u2014 a move that cable firms say is designed to benefit Google, which has already demonstrated a prototype cable box to regulators.AT...meanwhile, has charged that the agency is placing its \"thumb on the scale\" in favor of Googlevia Wheeler's March proposal to impose strict privacy rules on broadband companies. The plan, according to AT...nd others, would put telecom firms at a disadvantage compared with Internet companies like Google, which wouldn't fall under the FCC rules. Internet firms' privacy practices are policed by the Federal Trade Commission, which is seen as less prescriptive.On another front, the National Association of Broadcasters argued that Googleled a behind-the-scenes push at the FCC to set aside more unlicensed airwaves \u2014 something that could boost Wi-Fi networks that support the company's products and services. NAB says this FCC set-aside allows Googleto avoid having to pay for spectrum during the FCC's current incentive auction.The telecom industry taking pot shots at Googleis certainly nothing new; in fact the net neutrality debate basically began in 2005[7] when then AT...EO Ed Whitacre proudly proclaimed that Googlewouldn't be able to \"ride his pipes for free.\" Traditionally though, the telecom industry has used third-party consultants, think tanks, and other policy tendrils to hurl strange attacks[8] at Google. These new, more direct attacks are a sign of increased desperation.This desperation originates with two things, one of them being GoogleFiber. Though admittedly still limited[9] in reach, GoogleFiber has managed to light a fire under the apathetic posteriors of telecom giants that previously had little to no impetus to upgrade networks. It has managed to generate a national conversation about the sorry state of broadband competition, and even managed to illuminate the telecom sector's love of state protectionist laws[10] that prevent community broadband and even public/private partnerships. In short, the broadband industry's mostly just pissed that they're now facing some competition (which is why they've resorted to lawsuits[11] to slow GoogleFiber's expansion).The other thing on telecom executives' minds is the fact that with the broadband market saturated, they're turning to advertising and content to try and attain quarterly growth. That's why Verizon's been gobbling up companies like AOL and blowing kisses at Millennials[12] in a quest to magically become the new Facebook or Google. But these ISPs face new neutrality and privacy regulations that Googledoesn't have to worry about, solely because there's no competition in the broadband space (read: you have a choice in search engines, but often not in ISPs). This lack of competition isn't Google's fault. It's the fault of the carriers themselves and generations of lobbying.The telecom industry has invited the wrath of regulators for years with a laundry list of bad behavior. The FCC's privacy rules weren't driven by Google, they were driven by Verizon's decision to use stealth cookies[13] users couldn't opt out of to covertly track customers around the Internet. Net neutrality wasn't created by Google, it was created thanks to AT...hreatening to charge Googlea \"just because we can\" toll. And while Googlehas lobbied to open up the cable set top box to competition, this idea is actually more than a decade old, driven primarily by the fact that the industry enjoys $20 billion in captive revenue thanks to absolutely no serious cable set top hardware competition whatsoever.Yes, Googleand Alphabet have become lobbying behemoths since Googlefirst started ramping up its lobbying apparatus around 2007. And yes, like any large company, Googlespends a good amount of its time lobbying to saddle the other guy with additional regulations -- something that will only increase as the company inevitably shifts from innovation to turf protection. And we've already started to witness this turn; most notably in the way Googleturned its back on net neutrality in the States[14] and abroad[15] the last few years.A saint Googleisn't, but to suggest that the FCC is suddenly doing its job entirely because of Googlelobbying borders on the comical, especially coming from an industry that has had its lobbying talons deep in the federal government for more than a generation. It's much the same way that ISPs and their loyal politicians have taken to attacking Netflix[16] for daring to criticize usage caps and standing up for net neutrality. It's snide hubris from a sector that can't come to terms with the fact that a generation of telecom regulatory capture is finally starting to crumble. Instead of adapting to shifting markets, the telecom sector would rather blame \"big tech\" for a firestorm of regulatory activity it brought down upon itself.Permalink[17] | Comments[18] | Email This

What if the decisions that drove globalisation were not made in televised meetings between world leaders at Davos, but quietly by technical compliance officers in anonymous corporate office buildings? What if American protectionist bluster and China\u2019s steely nationalist defiance were largely a sideshow?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/eu-trade\"> The EU</url> is not generally thought of as an aggressive economic hegemon. Its main concern in the US-China conflict is to avoid being trampled. But in sector after sector, it has set the rules for the world economy. </p><p>This \u201cBrussels effect\u201d is well known in old-economy industries like chemicals and cars. Often it spreads through market forces. Companies adopt the rules as the price of participating in the huge EU market, and then impose them across their global businesses to minimise the cost of running separate compliance regimes. The rules are sometimes codified by foreign governments or through international organisations, but not necessarily.</p><p>Many EU policymakers say they export not just technical standards but also European values of consumer rights, environmental stewardship and the restraint of corporate monopoly. The EU started as a marketplace. Setting rules is central to its identity. Trade and regulation are, to a large extent, the only effective foreign policy the EU has.</p><p>Anu Bradford, a professor at Columbia University, originally coined the term \u201cBrussels effect\u201d and has been studying it for several years. Her impressive book assembles evidence going back decades, tracing its development from the \u201cReach\u201d chemicals regulation, developed in the early 2000s, to the digital age.</p><p>The same mechanisms are at work now with data regulation as previously with environment and food safety. The EU may not have much of a tech sector, but its General Data Protection Regulation is setting global standards for privacy and data governance. </p><p>Strong European public backing for consumer protection \u2014 in this case personal privacy \u2014 produced tough regulation. Apple, for example, followed the rules as the price of operating in the EU and then decided to adopt those principles globally. Other governments have increasingly drawn inspiration from the GDPR model, not least because it helps them gain the right to transfer personal data to and from Europe. </p><p>As with EU attitudes to food hygiene US policymakers have often been critical of GDPR for being heavy-handed and bureaucratic. Still, when a vacuum in governance develops, EU regulations, however imperfect, get drawn in to fill the gap. GDPR is becoming a model for some US states because the federal government has failed to create its own system. </p><p>The Brussels effect is powerful, then, but not necessarily benign. Prof Bradford admits there are fair criticisms to be made. In the case of GDPR, it tends to benefit big tech corporations like Google that have the money and capacity to comply.</p><p>It also has limitations. Where markets are what she calls \u201cdivisible\u201d and companies can maintain different standards in each, the effect is weaker. A company producing in several countries may keep the same EU environmental regulations throughout, but get away with different employment practices depending on the jurisdiction. The EU has struggled to influence labour standards abroad via trade deals. As shown by France\u2019s retreat last week on taxing tech companies, it also has difficulty exporting its tax regimes.</p><p>Prof Bradford may be a little too dismissive of the threats to Brussels\u2019 dominance from other models of regulation, particularly China. Its position as a major producer and consumer has been accompanied by an aggressive push to export standards in areas including facial recognition. Huawei\u2019s strong position in 5G technology has complicated US attempts to drive it out of tech supply chains. We cannot assume the future will look like the past.</p><p>What is incontrovertible is that the Brussels effect has dominated global economic regulation to an under-appreciated extent. This book will be the definitive reference guide for those wishing to understand.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alan Beattie is the FT\u2019s senior trade writer </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Brussels Effect.

Basking in the California sun - and the warm glow you feel when you are 27 and the firm you founded less than a decade ago is worth up to $100 billion (\u00a363 billion) and your personal stake is a not-too-shabby $28 billion - the Facebook boss said: \"There is a huge need and opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to help transform society for the future.\"</p><p>Facebook's flotation and Britain's 4G trial signal the start of something big. If you are still struggling to get your head around your smartphone, tablet computer and apps, prepare to struggle a whole lot more. Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, the four American firms that have defined the modern digital age, are about to launch new hardware, software and services in a techno-fight that will make the Mac v PC struggles of the past look like medieval jousting. Our daily lives are about to be reinvented. Again.</p><p>UNTIL recently, life in cyberspace was neat and simple. Each of the \"fab four\" US tech firms played a distinct role. Google helped us to find stuff and communicate with its search and Gmail services. Amazon sold us stuff - first books and then pretty much everything. Facebook let us find out whether our friends were :-) or :-(. Apple sold pretty devices for listening to songs and watching films. Each firm was happy doing its own thing and left the others alone.</p><p>Now those divisions are breaking down, putting the big tech firms on a cybercollision course. Thanks to new hardware - notably tablet computers and smartphones, new software and apps and a world blanketed by wi-fi and 3G (and soon 4G), we work, rest and play online more and more. We read newspapers on our iPads, listen to music on our iPods, book a restaurant table or a cinema ticket on our smartphones, watch movies on Netflix, store our photographs on Flickr and look at our personal and professional email, documents and calendars online.</p><p>As the market for digital stuff expands, doing only one thing, however well, is no longer so attractive for tech firms because it's no longer so lucrative. What Zuckerberg, the Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Larry Page want to do is to become the sole caterer to all our burgeoning digital needs - rather like the new super-utilities that give us our gas, our electricity and our water.</p><p>The more services they can offer, the more users they can attract, the more services they can sell us and the more advertising revenue they can generate. The battle to become chief executive of the web is on.</p><p>Zuckerberg's initial public offering (IPO) is a key part of his attempt to run the web. Facebook may have more than 800m users but it is small. Last year it had revenues, largely from selling ads, of $3.7 billion, as against Google's $38 billion in 2010. To expand, Zuckerberg needs cash and plenty of it. In May, after the IPO, he will have a war chest of $5 billion. That will enable him to join his rivals in the fab four as each spends big to try to digitise and revolutionise every corner of our lives, taking a slice out of each transaction that results.</p><p>How will each firm try to do this? Being successful in Silicon Valley means being good at keeping secrets, but here are some of the products that insiders say each firm has hidden up its hoodie sleeves.</p><p>Facebook will offer better social networking and communication. It has copied some of the most lauded features of Google+, the firm's new social networking service. It also promises a broader, more social email-style system that Facebookers insist will replace what they call \"old-fashioned\" Gmail. Facebook is flirting with the idea of taking on Google's core business with its own internal search service based not on results in cyberspace, however well sifted by algorithms, but on the data provided by you, me and our friends.</p><p>A Facebook phone, with photos and status updates uploaded to our Facebook page with a single click, is on the way. Facebook is joining Netflix, the music streaming service Spotify and the games maker Zynga to bring us Facebook TV, Facebook movies, Facebook music and Facebook games based on our own and our friends' recommendations.</p><p>There are even Facebook Credits - a virtual currency bought with real money that Facebookers use to play computer games. The goal is to make us live wholly inside Facebook's walled garden, a place Zuckerberg insists with boyish enthusiasm \"is going to be really, really good\".</p><p>Sadly for Zuckerberg, he has got competition from the neighbours - and they have an even bigger stash of cash. Apple, which has $98 billion to spend, almost as much ready cash as the US government, has the most popular smartphone model on the market, the iPhone, and the most popular tablet computer, the iPad.</p><p>Cook, who took over running the firm after Steve Jobs resigned from the chief executive job not long before his death last year, is determined to make them even better. He has, for example, integrated Twitter throughout Apple's line-up, enabling us to tweet from any app, a feature clearly aimed at dulling Facebook's mobile growth. Cook is also working on new iPad, iPod and iTunes services that he believes will trump Facebook's music, movies, TV and games offerings. He wants to sell us ebooks through the iBooks part of iTunes, to lure us away from Amazon. Apple's new iCloud service enables us to write and store our documents, spreadsheets, email, contacts and calendar on Apple's servers and access them on any device we want, even ones we do not own, in a direct challenge to Google's online computing services.</p><p>Cook is also readying a webenabled Apple TV. The idea is that we will buy programmes and films using iTunes. Television is the most important mass medium yet to be breached by the digital world.</p><p>Just down the road from Facebook, Google's whizzo brains have stopped lounging on beanbags and crunching granola bars while lecturing the world on the virtues of not being evil, and started knuckling down to the gritty business of grinding Zuckerberg's and Cook's noses into the techno-dirt.</p><p>Google has its own version of the iPhone. It's not a single phone but any handset that runs its Android software. Android phones comfortably outsell iPhones, accounting for almost half of all smartphones sold worldwide. Google has launched a web-based Google TV service, offering programmes streamed via the web. It is using Google+ to make its search results more social - to combat Zuckerberg's social search ambitions. It has launched Google Music, to offer songs, and it owns YouTube, where we can now watch or rent TV programmes and films.</p><p>In development in Mountain View, Google's headquarters, is Google Wallet, an online payment program that will enable us to buy stuff by waving our phone at a shop's paypad.</p><p>Google already makes mobile phones in partnership with HTC and Samsung, and recently it spent $12.5 billion snapping up Motorola's consumer division. It is readying its first own-label, Motorola-built mobile phones and tablet computers to tackle Apple head-on. It is even flirting with becoming a telephone service provider, challenging BT and all the mobile phone providers.</p><p>Gmail users in Britain last week received an email offering them the chance to make low-cost telephone calls over the internet by clicking on their Gmail contacts.</p><p>Page says: \"We're still at the very, very early stages of what technology can do. Our ultimate ambition is to transform the overall Google experience - making it beautifully simple, almost auto-magical.\"</p><p>And what of Amazon, that other West Coast behemoth that nearly doubled in size between 2008 and 2010, and hit almost $50 billion in annual revenues last year? It has new hardware, the Kindle Fire, which helpfully comes loaded with our Amazon account details, making it easier than ever to buy stuff from Amazon. The Fire also boasts social networking that connects us to other Amazon users who like the same books and films as we do - a direct challenge to Facebook.</p><p>Amazon offers a new app shop, a new online payment system, TV and movie streaming, cloud computing for individuals and businesses and, back in the physical world (remember that?), free next-day delivery of goods to your door in Britain for less than \u00a350 a year, no matter how much you buy. Bezos says: \"We're just getting started.\"</p><p>As they jostle for position, each of the tech titans is as busy talking down the opposition as it is talking itself up. Apple has vowed to \"destroy\" Google's Android mobile phone and tablet computer operating system, which senior executives dismiss as \"theft\" of Apple technology.</p><p>Apple is suing manufacturers of Android devices all over the world for patent infringement.</p><p>Google's response? \"Failing to succeed in the smartphone market, they are resorting to legal measures.\"</p><p>For its part, Facebook hired the PR firm Burson-Marsteller to plant negative stories about Google. When it got caught, it said sorry.</p><p>This is what happens when an entire industry reboots itself. The great tech war of 2012 marks the start of the third age of computing.</p><p>In the beginning, firms battled to sell us hardware. It was IBM v Apple v whatever beige box we liked the look of. Then hardware became a commodity and firms competed to sell us ever better software - Microsoft Windows vs Apple OS vs Google's online services.</p><p>Now, in the mobile internet age, firms are battling to create the best online platform, offering a vast, seamlessly connected suite of anytime, anywhere services that we use all day, every day and that become as much a part of our daily lives as the air that we breathe. Creating the dominant platform matters so much because it will give the winning firm the lion's share of the world's eyeballs. More eyeballs means more direct sales of hardware, software and services, and advertising. But eyeballs offer something even more valuable, something tech firms prize more than anything else: data.</p><p>Every time you or I go on Google, Facebook, Amazon or iTunes, we leave digital fingerprints. With our search queries, our \"likes\", the songs we listen to, the TV programmes we watch, the books we buy and our tweets, we reveal who we are. Thanks to our computer's IP address and location-based technology in mobile phones, we also disclose where we are.</p><p>This 100% accurate, real-life, realtime information is an invaluable treasury. It enables Google and Facebook to offer advertisers the chance to reach their target market and even to advertise to them at particular times of the day and in places where they are most likely to respond. Facebook, whose data is even more valuable because we tell it more about ourselves and it knows who our friends are, is desperate to start using it to ramp up its ad sales to Google-like proportions. Analysts think the digital advertising sector could be worth $200 billion by 2020.</p><p>There's a problem here, of course.</p><p>Apart from Apple's natty hardware and all the big players' software and apps, critics say the fab four create little or nothing. What they do is make all the money in the world by exploiting other people's stuff.</p><p>Most of the content we find when we do a Google search is created by others, but Google sells ads against the search. The content creators do not receive a share of the ad revenue. Google points out that its search engine sends users to the content creators' websites, where each can try to make money itself.</p><p>Amazon sells books at prices lower than publishers and booksellers say is fair. Facebook does not create the data it uses to sell advertising. We agree to hand the data over when we sign up and we do not get to opt out.</p><p>Apple pays record labels for the music it sells through iTunes but keeps a big chunk of sales revenue for itself: iTunes now in effect runs the music industry.</p><p>With an eye on the bottom line, the fab four bitterly resist any attempt to stop them exploiting one others' content. Each spends billions on lobbying politicians to drive home their case that any regulation of the internet would impinge on free speech and free trade. Who could object to freedom, right? Well, more and more of us. Newspapers, including this one, have set up paywalls to ensure readers pay for high-quality journalism rather than simply getting it free via Google. Hollywood studios, which are battling piracy, are backing the Stop Online Piracy Act in America, which aims to make internet service providers do more to respect copyright.</p><p>Facebook is facing a backlash from users over its decision to publish all their posts in a Timeline that creates a permanent online diary of its users' lives for all to see.</p><p>Critics, who call the fab four \"the four horsemen of the technoapocalypse\", warn that many of our long-cherished rights and many valuable \"real world\" industries are threatened by internet companies that are in it for the money - not to change the world, as many of them claim.</p><p>In her new book, I Know Who You Are and I Saw What You Did: Social Networks and the Death of Privacy, Lori Andrews, an American law professor, calls for a new constitution governing how web firms can exploit our data and the content generated by traditional businesses. How do the high-tech firms respond to critics? They don't care much, and since they are making more money than God, who can blame them? When pressed, they say their critics are the authors of their own demise. The fab four point out that the music industry and Hollywood and - until they started developing tablet apps - newspapers and magazines have been slow to give consumers what they want in a digital form. As Bezos puts it: \"The music industry is a great cautionary tale. Don't let that happen to you.\"</p><p>The fab four also say they create jobs and boost the economy. Facebook cites a recent study that it commissioned from Deloitte, the consultancy firm, which showed that Facebook generated (EURO)15.3 billion (\u00a312.7 billion) for the European economy and 232,000 jobs across the continent.</p><p>For now, Silicon Valley is winning the argument. Regulators show little interest in clipping tech firms' wings. Most consumers seem pretty happy, too. Polls - and sales - show that our desire for a connected future vastly outweighs any concerns we may have that we will become slaves to the machine and our affection for \"old\" industries.</p><p>Above the din of the chattering classes railing against \"Googlezilla\" or \"One Nation Under Facebook\" can be heard the tip-tap of billions of users willingly signing up to what they consider to be a benign digital dictatorship. What's a bit of privacy lost, a newspaper out of business and bookshops a thing of the past if, in return, we get magical, often free services that make life easier? WHO will win the great tech war of 2012? The early signs are that Apple has long legs in the race ahead. Its hardware is so high-tech and highspec, it can sell it at the kind of margins usually reserved for luxury goods. Some analysts estimate that it makes \u00a3230 on each iPhone. By some estimates, it is now sucking up half of all the profits in smartphones - a global market worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year. With annual revenue projected to exceed $150 billion this year, Amazon is likely to continue to dominate the business of selling stuff.</p><p>The real fight is likely to be between Google and Facebook. The two firms are battling to own and control the most valuable currency in the world: our digital identity. The more time we spend using Facebook, the more we become Facebook bunnies and the more Facebook and its chums can sell to us. But if Page succeeds in \"baking identity and sharing into all of our products\" and tempts us to disappear down Google's wormhole instead, it is Google that will own the net and control the future. Small wonder Page has tied every Google employee's bonus to Google's ability to beat Facebook.</p><p>In the end, it is you and me who will decide the victor. Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple have gone from being the dreams of the young and the obsessions of the stubborn to a place in the dictionary because almost everyone reading this article uses them. Whichever we keep logging on to will keep growing. Whichever we lose interest in won't. The choice - the click - is ours.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-56453574</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54WM-CW71-JCC9-V0XY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2871\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>February 5, 2012 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It's so remote, it doesn't even have a pub. There are no Starbucks, no shiny new mansions for freshly minted dotcom millionaires and billionaires and, at this time of year, precious little sunshine. But this corner of Cornwall and northern California have something big in common. They are the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trerice, once out of touch, is now the best connected place in Britain. It's where BT and Everything Everywhere, the name for the merged Orange and T-Mobile, are testing a 4G - fourth generation - mobile digital communications system, the licences for which will be auctioned this year for up to \u00a35 billion. Shivering on a bone-crunchingly cold morning visit, Olaf Swantee, chief executive of Everything Everywhere, says: \"It's the 21st-century digital infrastructure we need.\"</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg agrees. Basking in the California sun - and the warm glow you feel when you are 27 and the firm you founded less than a decade ago is worth up to $100 billion (\u00a363 billion) and your personal stake is a not-too-shabby $28 billion - the Facebook boss said: \"There is a huge need and opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to help transform society for the future.\"</p><p>Facebook's flotation and Britain's 4G trial signal the start of something big. If you are still struggling to get your head around your smartphone, tablet computer and apps, prepare to struggle a whole lot more. Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, the four American firms that have defined the modern digital age, are about to launch new hardware, software and services in a techno-fight that will make the Mac v PC struggles of the past look like medieval jousting. Our daily lives are about to be reinvented. Again.</p><p>UNTIL recently, life in cyberspace was neat and simple. Each of the \"fab four\" US tech firms played a distinct role. Google helped us to find stuff and communicate with its search and Gmail services. Amazon sold us stuff - first books and then pretty much everything. Facebook let us find out whether our friends were :-) or :-(. Apple sold pretty devices for listening to songs and watching films. Each firm was happy doing its own thing and left the others alone.</p><p>Now those divisions are breaking down, putting the big tech firms on a cybercollision course. Thanks to new hardware - notably tablet computers and smartphones, new software and apps and a world blanketed by wi-fi and 3G (and soon 4G), we work, rest and play online more and more. We read newspapers on our iPads, listen to music on our iPods, book a restaurant table or a cinema ticket on our smartphones, watch movies on Netflix, store our photographs on Flickr and look at our personal and professional email, documents and calendars online.</p><p>As the market for digital stuff expands, doing only one thing, however well, is no longer so attractive for tech firms because it's no longer so lucrative. What Zuckerberg, the Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Larry Page want to do is to become the sole caterer to all our burgeoning digital needs - rather like the new super-utilities that give us our gas, our electricity and our water.</p><p>The more services they can offer, the more users they can attract, the more services they can sell us and the more advertising revenue they can generate. The battle to become chief executive of the web is on.</p><p>Zuckerberg's initial public offering (IPO) is a key part of his attempt to run the web. Facebook may have more than 800m users but it is small. Last year it had revenues, largely from selling ads, of $3.7 billion, as against Google's $38 billion in 2010. To expand, Zuckerberg needs cash and plenty of it. In May, after the IPO, he will have a war chest of $5 billion. That will enable him to join his rivals in the fab four as each spends big to try to digitise and revolutionise every corner of our lives, taking a slice out of each transaction that results.</p><p>How will each firm try to do this? Being successful in Silicon Valley means being good at keeping secrets, but here are some of the products that insiders say each firm has hidden up its hoodie sleeves.</p><p>Facebook will offer better social networking and communication. It has copied some of the most lauded features of Google+, the firm's new social networking service. It also promises a broader, more social email-style system that Facebookers insist will replace what they call \"old-fashioned\" Gmail. Facebook is flirting with the idea of taking on Google's core business with its own internal search service based not on results in cyberspace, however well sifted by algorithms, but on the data provided by you, me and our friends.</p><p>A Facebook phone, with photos and status updates uploaded to our Facebook page with a single click, is on the way. Facebook is joining Netflix, the music streaming service Spotify and the games maker Zynga to bring us Facebook TV, Facebook movies, Facebook music and Facebook games based on our own and our friends' recommendations.</p><p>There are even Facebook Credits - a virtual currency bought with real money that Facebookers use to play computer games. The goal is to make us live wholly inside Facebook's walled garden, a place Zuckerberg insists with boyish enthusiasm \"is going to be really, really good\".</p><p>Sadly for Zuckerberg, he has got competition from the neighbours - and they have an even bigger stash of cash. Apple, which has $98 billion to spend, almost as much ready cash as the US government, has the most popular smartphone model on the market, the iPhone, and the most popular tablet computer, the iPad.</p><p>Cook, who took over running the firm after Steve Jobs resigned from the chief executive job not long before his death last year, is determined to make them even better. He has, for example, integrated Twitter throughout Apple's line-up, enabling us to tweet from any app, a feature clearly aimed at dulling Facebook's mobile growth. Cook is also working on new iPad, iPod and iTunes services that he believes will trump Facebook's music, movies, TV and games offerings. He wants to sell us ebooks through the iBooks part of iTunes, to lure us away from Amazon. Apple's new iCloud service enables us to write and store our documents, spreadsheets, email, contacts and calendar on Apple's servers and access them on any device we want, even ones we do not own, in a direct challenge to Google's online computing services.</p><p>Cook is also readying a webenabled Apple TV. The idea is that we will buy programmes and films using iTunes. Television is the most important mass medium yet to be breached by the digital world.</p><p>Just down the road from Facebook, Google's whizzo brains have stopped lounging on beanbags and crunching granola bars while lecturing the world on the virtues of not being evil, and started knuckling down to the gritty business of grinding Zuckerberg's and Cook's noses into the techno-dirt.</p><p>Google has its own version of the iPhone. It's not a single phone but any handset that runs its Android software. Android phones comfortably outsell iPhones, accounting for almost half of all smartphones sold worldwide. Google has launched a web-based Google TV service, offering programmes streamed via the web. It is using Google+ to make its search results more social - to combat Zuckerberg's social search ambitions. It has launched Google Music, to offer songs, and it owns YouTube, where we can now watch or rent TV programmes and films.</p><p>In development in Mountain View, Google's headquarters, is Google Wallet, an online payment program that will enable us to buy stuff by waving our phone at a shop's paypad.</p><p>Google already makes mobile phones in partnership with HTC and Samsung, and recently it spent $12.5 billion snapping up Motorola's consumer division. It is readying its first own-label, Motorola-built mobile phones and tablet computers to tackle Apple head-on. It is even flirting with becoming a telephone service provider, challenging BT and all the mobile phone providers.</p><p>Gmail users in Britain last week received an email offering them the chance to make low-cost telephone calls over the internet by clicking on their Gmail contacts.</p><p>Page says: \"We're still at the very, very early stages of what technology can do. Our ultimate ambition is to transform the overall Google experience - making it beautifully simple, almost auto-magical.\"</p><p>And what of Amazon, that other West Coast behemoth that nearly doubled in size between 2008 and 2010, and hit almost $50 billion in annual revenues last year? It has new hardware, the Kindle Fire, which helpfully comes loaded with our Amazon account details, making it easier than ever to buy stuff from Amazon. The Fire also boasts social networking that connects us to other Amazon users who like the same books and films as we do - a direct challenge to Facebook.</p><p>Amazon offers a new app shop, a new online payment system, TV and movie streaming, cloud computing for individuals and businesses and, back in the physical world (remember that?), free next-day delivery of goods to your door in Britain for less than \u00a350 a year, no matter how much you buy. Bezos says: \"We're just getting started.\"</p><p>As they jostle for position, each of the tech titans is as busy talking down the opposition as it is talking itself up. Apple has vowed to \"destroy\" Google's Android mobile phone and tablet computer operating system, which senior executives dismiss as \"theft\" of Apple technology. Apple is suing manufacturers of Android devices all over the world for patent infringement.</p><p>Google's response? \"Failing to succeed in the smartphone market, they are resorting to legal measures.\" For its part, Facebook hired the PR firm Burson-Marsteller to plant negative stories about Google. When it got caught, it said sorry.</p><p>This is what happens when an entire industry reboots itself. The great tech war of 2012 marks the start of the third age of computing.</p><p>In the beginning, firms battled to sell us hardware. It was IBM v Apple v whatever beige box we liked the look of. Then hardware became a commodity and firms competed to sell us ever better software - Microsoft Windows vs Apple OS vs Google's online services.</p><p>Now, in the mobile internet age, firms are battling to create the best online platform, offering a vast, seamlessly connected suite of anytime, anywhere services that we use all day, every day and that become as much a part of our daily lives as the air that we breathe. Creating the dominant platform matters so much because it will give the winning firm the lion's share of the world's eyeballs. More eyeballs means more direct sales of hardware, software and services, and advertising. But eyeballs offer something even more valuable, something tech firms prize more than anything else: data.</p><p>Every time you or I go on Google, Facebook, Amazon or iTunes, we leave digital fingerprints. With our sarch queries, our \"likes\", the songs we listen to, the TV programmes we watch, the books we buy and our tweets, we reveal who we are. Thanks to our computer's IP address and location-based technology in mobile phones, we also disclose where we are.</p><p>This 100% accurate, real-life, realtime information is an invaluable treasury. It enables Google and Facebook to offer advertisers the chance to reach their target market and even to advertise to them at particular times of the day and in places where they are most likely to respond. Facebook, whose data is even more valuable because we tell it more about ourselves and it knows who our friends are, is desperate to start using it to ramp up its ad sales to Google-like proportions. Analysts think the digital advertising sector could be worth $200 billion by 2020.</p><p>There's a problem here, of course. Apart from Apple's natty hardware and all the big players' software and apps, critics say the fab four create little or nothing. What they do is make all the money in the world by exploiting other people's stuff.</p><p>Most of the content we find when we do a Google search is created by others, but Google sells ads against the search. The content creators do not receive a share of the ad revenue. Google points out that its search engine sends users to the content creators' websites, where each can try to make money itself.</p><p>Amazon sells books at prices lower than publishers and booksellers say is fair. Facebook does not create the data it uses to sell advertising. We agree to hand the data over when we sign up and we do not get to opt out.</p><p>Apple pays record labels for the music it sells through iTunes but keeps a big chunk of sales revenue for itself: iTunes now in effect runs the music industry.</p><p>With an eye on the bottom line, the fab four bitterly resist any attempt to stop them exploiting one others' content. Each spends billions on lobbying politicians to drive home their case that any regulation of the internet would impinge on free speech and free trade. Who could object to freedom, right?</p><p>Well, more and more of us. Newspapers, including this one, have set up paywalls to ensure readers pay for high-quality journalism rather than simply getting it free via Google. Hollywood studios, which are battling piracy, are backing the Stop Online Piracy Act in America, which aims to make internet service providers do more to respect copyright. Facebook is facing a backlash from users over its decision to publish all their posts in a Timeline that creates a permanent online diary of its users' lives for all to see.</p><p>Critics, who call the fab four \"the four horsemen of the technoapocalypse\", warn that many of our long-cherished rights and many valuable \"real world\" industries are threatened by internet companies that are in it for the money - not to change the world, as many of them claim.</p><p>In her new book, I Know Who You Are and I Saw What You Did: Social Networks and the Death of Privacy, Lori Andrews, an American law professor, calls for a new constitution governing how web firms can exploit our data and the content generated by traditional businesses.</p><p>How do the high-tech firms respond to critics? They don't care much, and since they are making more money than God, who can blame them? When pressed, they say their critics are the authors of their own demise. The fab four point out that the music industry and Hollywood and - until they started developing tablet apps - newspapers and magazines have been slow to give consumers what they want in a digital form. As Bezos puts it: \"The music industry is a great cautionary tale. Don't let that happen to you.\"</p><p>The fab four also say they create jobs and boost the economy. Facebook cites a recent study that it commissioned from Deloitte, the consultancy firm, which showed that Facebook generated (EURO)15.3 billion (\u00a312.7 billion) for the European economy and 232,000 jobs across the continent.</p><p>For now, Silicon Valley is winning the argument. Regulators show little interest in clipping tech firms' wings. Most consumers seem pretty happy, too. Polls - and sales - show that our desire for a connected future vastly outweighs any concerns we may have that we will become slaves to the machine and our affection for \"old\" industries.</p><p>Above the din of the chattering classes railing against \"Googlezilla\" or \"One Nation Under Facebook\" can be heard the tip-tap of billions of users willingly signing up to what they consider to be a benign digital dictatorship. What's a bit of privacy lost, a newspaper out of business and bookshops a thing of the past if, in return, we get magical, often free services that make life easier?</p><p>WHO will win the great tech war of 2012? The early signs are that Apple has long legs in the race ahead. Its hardware is so high-tech and highspec, it can sell it at the kind of margins usually reserved for luxury goods. Some analysts estimate that it makes \u00a3230 on each iPhone. By some estimates, it is now sucking up half of all the profits in smartphones - a global market worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year. With annual revenue projected to exceed $150 billion this year, Amazon is likely to continue to dominate the business of selling stuff.</p><p>The real fight is likely to be between Google and Facebook. The two firms are battling to own and control the most valuable currency in the world: our digital identity. The more time we spend using Facebook, the more we become Facebook bunnies and the more Facebook and its chums can sell to us. But if Page succeeds in \"baking identity and sharing into all of our products\" and tempts us to disappear down Google's wormhole instead, it is Google that will own the net and control the future. Small wonder Page has tied every Google employee's bonus to Google's ability to beat Facebook.</p><p>In the end, it is you and me who will decide the victor. Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple have gone from being the dreams of the young and the obsessions of the stubborn to a place in the dictionary because almost everyone reading this article uses them. Whichever we keep logging on to will keep growing. Whichever we lose interest in won't. The choice - the click - is ours.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-56470352</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54WM-CW71-JCC9-V1YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>February 5, 2012 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

By doing so, Amazon will unlock at least $70 billion in shareholder value, he said. But the move could also help appease regulators looking to rein in the big-tech companies, he said. Amazon will spin off its cloud business in the near future, unlocking tens of millions \u2014 perhaps even hundreds of millions \u2014 of dollars in value, marketing guru Scott Galloway said Monday at Business Insider's IGNITION conference. </p><p>The move will also help the company placate regulators who are starting to scrutinize its anti-competitive practices, said Galloway, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. After the e-commerce giant spins it off, Amazon Web Services \"will be one of 10 most valuable companies in the world,\" he said. He continued: \"The question then becomes, what happens to the old [retail-side of] Amazon.\" Amazon will decide to split off AWS, because it makes a lot of sense, and market forces will dictate it, Galloway said. Cloud computing is one of the most important trends taking place in the technology industry, but there's no simple way for investors to profit off it, he said. The three biggest cloud services \u2014 AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google Cloud \u2014 are all part of much bigger companies whose results only partially reflect their cloud businesses. \"There's no pure way to play\" the cloud trend, Galloway said. As the biggest of the bunch, AWS would be a natural to become its own standalone business, he said. And it could be a huge windfall for Amazon shareholders. Depending on how it would be valued and the multiple to earnings that the market would assign to it, AWS by itself could be see a valuation of anywhere from $70 billion to $600 billion, he said. Read this:The cloud-computing market is set to double to $116 billion by 2021 \u2014 these 3 charts show why that's probably good news only for Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba[3] Better yet for shareholders, the combined value of a retail-focused Amazon and a newly separate AWS would likely exceed Amazon's current value, he said.Spinoffs are good for shareholdersThat's been the lesson from other spinoffs in the past, he said. Amazon's current market capitalization is around $864 billion. Right now, AWS's is being held down in part by the fact that the profits it generates subsidize other parts of Amazon's business, he said. The company's international business chronically posts losses on its operations, and its North American business generally posts only narrow operating profits. Spinoffs \"tend to be very positive for shareholders,\" Galloway said. But Amazon has another incentive to spin off AWS \u2014 regulatory scrutiny. Policymakers around the world have been increasingly focusing on the power and anti-competitive practices of the big tech companies. There are growing calls to weaken those companies and introduce more competition by breaking them up. Spinning off AWS could allow Amazon to get ahead of the regulators and split the company on its own terms, Galloway suggested. But it likely wouldn't address fully the anti-competitive concerns regarding Amazon. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and others have taken particular aim at the company's practice of both selling products directly to customers and providing a platform for other retailers to sell products online. Amazon uses data generated from those third-party sales to give its products a leg up on those companies, critics charge. Regulators \"are worried about an invasive species called Amazon,\" Galloway said. Galloway has a track record of successful forecasts concerning Amazon[4]. He predicted which cities it would choose for its second headquarters[5] and also that it would buy Whole Foods. During his talk, Galloway also focused on Facebook[6], arguing that the company should similarly spin off Instagram, saying it could be worth $100 billion to $470 billion as a standalone company. He also called on the company's board to fire CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg[7].

According to a fact sheet being circulated by the agency[2] (pdf), under the FCC's plan you'd still pay your cable company for the exact same content, cable operators would simply have to design systems -- using standards and copy protection of their choice -- that delivered this content to third-party hardware. The FCC's goal is cheaper, better hardware and a shift away from the insular gatekeeper model the cable box has long protected.Given this would obliterate a $21 billion captive market in set top box rental fees -- and likely direct consumers to more third-party streaming services -- the cable industry has been engaged in an utterly adorable new hissy fit. This breathless hysteria has primarily come in the form of an endless stream of editorials -- most of which fail utterly to disclose financial ties to cable -- claiming that the FCC's plan will boost piracy[3], hurt privacy, \"steal the future[4],\" and even harm ethnic diversity[5].And now, the industry's also threatening a lawsuit. </p><p>As the industry argued with Title II, net neutrality, and everything else, former FCC boss turned top cable lobbyist Michael Powell is arguing that the FCC has once again overstepped its regulatory authority[6]: \"\"An agency of limited jurisdiction has to act properly within that jurisdiction,\" Powell said, making it abundantly clear the NCTA does not believe the FCC has not done so in this case. He said that the statute empowers the FCC to create competition in navigation devices, not new services. \"Every problem does not empower an FCC-directed solution. The agency is not an agency with unbridled plenary power to roam around markets and decide to go fix inconveniences everywhere they find them irrespective of the bounds of their authority.\"Except unlike net neutrality, telecom policy wonks like Public Knowledge's Harold Feld (who probably spends more time wading through FCC policy and legal issues than anybody on earth) notes there's absolutely no doubt the FCC has the authority to act here:\"First, it's important to recognize that the cable folks were already in front of the D.C. Circuit three times on this issue, and lost each time. See General Instrument Corp. v. FCC, 213 F.3d 724 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Charter Communications Corp. v. FCC[7], 461 F.3d 31 (D.C. Cir. 2006); and Comcast Corp.v. FCC[8]. In each of these cases, the cable industry made similar statutory arguments about the limits of FCC authority in Section 629. On each occasion, the D.C. Cir. \u2014 which was a lot more pro-business and anti-FCC back then, rejected them.Despite being 0-3 on all challenges to the FCC's 629 rules to date, NCTA's cadre of lawyers assures us that this time will be totally different because FCC, overreach, regulation, power mad, Title II, Google too, Leonard Bernstein Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce, and Tom Wheeler END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT!![9] Or something like that.So if the cable industry's lawsuit goes nowhere, its only other hope is that it can convince the public via editorials, sockpuppetry and astroturfing[10] that the FCC's plan isn't actually about helping consumers, it's just a power-crazed attempt by \"big tech\" (read: Google, Amazon) to treat poor, under-appreciated cable companies unfairly[11]. The problem with this effort, as usual, is that the cable industry remains the least liked industry in America[12] thanks to a generation of anti-competitive behavior. Therefore the only folks likely to buy the cable industry's argument here are those with a political axe to grind (conflating government over-reach in other areas with the FCC's attempts to fix a broken telecom market), or those that tend to profit from said broken telecom and TV market.If there's any question at all about the FCC's effort, it's whether or not the agency would find its time better spent focusing its regulatory calories on shoring up broadband competition, since the rise of Internet video is inevitably destined (even though it may take another decade) to put the lame old cable box out to pasture without government intervention.Permalink[13] | Comments[14] | Email This Story[15] [ 1]: <url

In fact, some of the squillionaires supporting it make it explicit that the reason they are pumping is so they can pay people in early stage startups nothing when the might otherwise have to pay them.gahsalaries. They say it in a more coded manner but it's not hard to unpack what they mean. The flaw is that a UBI at anything approaching a living wage level would be massively inflationary. And anything below that means it would simply serve to allow employers to pay even less to get them to top up the UBI to something they could survive on. Anyone who does not understand that a UBI would be a subsidy to corporate America hasn't thought things through. By contrast, a Jobs Guarantee is explicitly designed to force businesses to raise their pay levels and workplace conditions by setting a price for labor. And it could operate on a very large scale by being designed to provide more productive capacity via needed services that are being neglected, like infrastructure repair and construction, and day and elder care. By Phil Jones, a research affiliate at Autonomy and a PHD researcher at the University of Sussex. He is currently writing a book about tasking and crowdwork. Originally published at openDemocracy[5] After many years of steamrolling workers' rights, hoovering up venture capital and diligently avoiding taxes[6], the once invincible gig economy appears to have been dealt a fatal blow. The landmark California bill, known as AB5[7], will prevent many companies from treating employees as independent contractors, after overwhelmingly passing the senate and assembly earlier this month. Recently signed into law by the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, the legislation will begin to take effect in 2020. The bill lays out a clear standard that threatens a business model designed to misclassify employees as freelance contractors. Under the so called 'ABC test', workers are employees if (a) they perform their work under a company's control, (b) their work is integral to the company's business and (c) they do not routinely engage in an independent trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed for the hiring company. Undoubtedly, drivers for Uber, Lyft and Amazon Flex will pass the 'ABC test' with flying colours. Uber, for instance, controls the workers' rate of pay, strictly regulates[8] the kinds of car its drivers can use, and is liable to 'deactivate'[9] drivers with below average ratings. Not only does the company entirely control the performance of its workers, but it relies on the fares and data collected from their 'rides' for revenue. Its venture capital flow depends on developing self-driving vehicles[10] modelled on the data sourced from its drivers. Already undergoing a long-term 'profitability'[11] crisis, the company has - somewhat unsurprisingly - threatened to ignore[12] the legislation, which would give its workers the state's minimum wage, overtime pay, worker's compensation and - perhaps most importantly - the right to unionize. But while the legislation will bring these rights to many in the 'gig economy', a large proportion of the most insecure and worst paid remain outside the bill's purview. Take Amazon Mechanical Turk, a platform which allows 'requesters' - often start-ups and big tech firms - to outsource undesirable, infinitesimally small, but nonetheless important tasks to 'microworkers'. Paid by the task - we're talking less than $1 per hour, and lacking any sense of security or work/life boundaries - these workers represent the vanguard of labour exploitation in our digitized moment. A standard day on a platform like Mechanical Turk, Figure Eight or Clickworker might involve anything from categorising images of horses, flagging up offensive content, to transcribing audio of people speaking in various Scottish accents. Having worked on a number of these platforms, I can vouch for the fact that taskers must endure mind-numbingly dull work, frequent glitches in the software that prevent task completion, and the constant anxiety of non-payment (many of these platforms give total discretion to 'requesters' and refuse to enter disputes). I myself have been denied payment for apparently 'incomplete' or 'unsatisfactory' work. For this reason, these platforms represent a grey area for the AB5 bill, which is evidently directed at companies such as Uber that, just like more typical 'employers', control the rate of pay. Crowdwork platforms fall short here because the requestersmake all the decisions regarding payment. The microworker may undertake 40 different tasks over the course of a day, each from a different requester and each at a different rate. This fundamentally does away with any clear sense of an employer/employee relationship. Another reason why the bill is unable to cover microworkers is that the 'ABC test' reinstates a somewhat out-of-date definition of 'employee' by conflating it with a stable occupation. Unlike an Uber driver, who has a very specific role, the tasker is eminently flexible, taking on the guise of many diverse occupations to serve a variety of requesters. This allows crowdwork platforms to reasonably claim that 'taskers' do not have a role and are therefore not employees. Granting 'employee' status in a period when the very categories of work are breaking down is not enough. At least in part because there are new, more precarious, and conceptually slippery forms of work emerging all the time. Due to this reality, the bill may have some perverse consequences, potentially pushing 'independent contractors' into the sharp end of the 'gig economy'. If Uber and Lyft decide to take their business out of California, a very real possibility, it is far from inevitable that their workforce will find better, more stable jobs elsewhere. More likely, they will have to seek out even more precarious work like microlabour, a possibility backed by a Pew survey[13] that reveals 25% of workers accessed labour platforms because there was no other work in their area. To protect the most vulnerable workers, a group that many of us are at risk of becoming part of, we need to deal with the real crisis that drives workers into the arms of platforms. Here in the UK, we are facing an underemployment[14] epidemic, which between 2008 and 2018 doubled from 2million to 4million. Perhaps not surprisingly, between 2016 and the present, the number of people accessing online labour platforms at least once a week has also doubled from 4.7% of the adult population to 9.6%, as found by a recent report[15] by the TUC and the University of Hertfordshire. The correlative rise in platform use and underemployment figures is backed by the report's finding that most workers accessed online labour to top up a shortfall in their income. While legislation such as the AB5 bill should be commended for offering a portion of the workforce better rights, it does not address an economic context that makes insecure and terribly paid work a reality. That is why I believe the time for a Universal Basic Income (UBI) has arrived. Underemployment, and increasingly unemployment, are set to intensify as automation advances. A UBI would allow us to enjoy some of the benefits of this advance, as well as giving us the security required to resist the companies like Amazon and Uber that use automation to drive down pay and rights. As a recent briefing[16] for the thinktank, Autonomy, suggests, an ideal UBI would free us from the insecurities that force us into lousy, low-paid jobs. What we need are radical policies alongside legislation such as the California bill. Only then will we get the economic future we deserve.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/10/the-california-workers-rights-bill-is-a-start-but-we-need-a-more-radical-approach-to-the-gig-economy.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/10/the-california-workers-rights-bill-is-a-start-but-we-need-a-more-radical-approach-to-the-gig-economy.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Free markets and their discontents[17], Guest Post[18], Income disparity[19], Legal[20], Social policy[21], Technology and innovation[22], The destruction of the middle class[23] on October 7, 2019[24] by Yves Smith[25].

One of her last missteps was in the revelation from her director of public policy, Katie Horbath, that the social network would not delete campaign videos with false information.</p><p><br/>The U.S. Democratic Primary Candidate, Elizabeth Warren, responded to this refusal by posting a fake facebook story herself: \"Last minute: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook have just supported Donald Trump in his re-election campaign,\" the publication began, clarifying below: \"... you must be thinking, 'How can it be true?' ... The truth is, it's not (sorry.) But what Zuckerberg has done is give Donald Trump the free rein to lie on his platform - and thus pay Facebook piles of money to lie to American voters.\"<br/>Since the Cambridge Analytica episode revealed that Facebook allowed personal data to be stolen for the benefit of Donald Trump and Brexit's campaigns, criticism of the social network has been steadily increasing.<br/>This episode has already cost Facebook a $5 billion fine imposed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Now, the same body has launched another investigation into the owner of WhatsApp and Instagram for alleged monopoly practices, also linked to their use of data.<br/>This does not stop the tech giant's ambition, however, as the launch of its first cryptocurrency in 2020, Libra, approaches.<br/>Progressive pigtail<br/>This is where Break Up Big Tech comes in: a call to separate companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon into smaller companies, with less power in the market.<br/>This is not the first time this action has been called in the history of the American country. The Department of Justice sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for monopoly practices, accusing Bill Gates's company of using its control over the computer market to force the exit of competing operating systems. In the end, Microsoft lost the case and was forced to separate. This mandate was annulled and replaced by a more limited agreement in which the company would erect some barriers for external software on Windows.<br/>The most media voices that have joined this slogan are those of the progressive candidates for the next Democratic Party primary election slashes in the US: Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Taking second place in the polls, just behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Warren appears to be a plausible threat to the owners of the big tech companies.<br/>Zuckerberg has not stood by in front of this slogan, much less in front of Warren. In a leaked audio in which she discussed various topics with collaborators, the 35-year-old CEO referred to it as an existential threat and commented that \"if she comes elected president, I'm sure we'll have a legal challenge and I'm sure we'll win that challenge gal.\"<br/>What is Warren's plan to separate companies like Facebook?<br/>The plan would prohibit companies with global profits of $25 billion or more from owning online platforms where third parties (social networks, digital markets, etc.) connect. They would also be banned from participating in these platforms.<br/>Today, Facebook's market value is $530 billion, Amazon's $869 billion, and Google-owning Alphabet is $863 billion.<br/>\"Amazon destroys small businesses by copying the goods they sell to the Amazon Marketplace, selling them under their own brand (Amazon Basic),\" Warren explains in his plan.If this runs, Jeff Bezos' company would no longer be able to offer this brand of products on its Marketplace platform. Apple, for example, also wouldn't be able to compete against other apps in its own App Store. In addition, Google's visa business would have to be separated from its business as a search engine.<br/>Companies with revenues of less than $25 billion are allowed to have both platforms and participants. These services, however, must meet standards of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory behavior with users.<br/>The plan also envisages the designation of regulators who would work to undo anti-competitive mergers such as Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and Zappos; Waste, Nest and DoubleClick by Google; and WhatsApp and Instagram on Facebook. According to the candidate, these mergers have made it more difficult for small and medium-sized companies to compete.<br/>The entry The Call to Separate Big Tech Companies Takes Strength in the US was first published in La Tercera.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-9628965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKT-R3M1-DY1R-B476-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

When he finally did, he did so with gusto, taking a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">new set of talking points</url> (\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you\") on a seemingly unending roadshow, from his own       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Facebook page</url> to the mainstream press to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Congress</url> and on to an oddly earnest       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">discussion series</url> he's planning to subject us to at irregular intervals for the rest of 2019.</p><p>The culmination of all that verbosity came earlier this month, when Zuck unloaded a 3,000-word <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">treatise</url> on Facebook's \"privacy-focused\" future (a phrase that somehow demands both regular quotation marks and ironic scare quotes), a missive that was perhaps best described by the Guardian's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Emily Bell</url> as \"the nightmarish college application essay of an accomplished sociopath\".</p><p>While it appears that Facebook is suddenly 'woke' to privacy issues, it's safe to assume it's business as usual there</p><p>  Ashkan Soltani, formerly of the FTC    </p><p>The so-called pivot to privacy is in many ways the logical conclusion to the earth-shaking (and market-moving) response to the Cambridge Analytica story, which plunged Facebook into the greatest crisis in its then 14-year history. After nearly a year of its critics demanding that it respect users' privacy, here was Facebook saying: \"Fine, privacy you shall have.\" (More on whether what's being offered is actually privacy later.)</p><p>But it's worth thinking back to those five days of silence, when the contours of the scandal took shape and revealed themselves with an uncanny distinction: when it came to Facebook, the Cambridge Analytica story did not uncover anything new. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">basic facts had already been reported</url>, in the same publication, 16 months previously: Facebook had allowed someone to extract vast amounts of private information about vast numbers of people from its system, and that entity had passed the data along to someone else, who had used it for political ends.</p><p>What changed was how we saw those facts. It was as if we had all gone away on a long voyage, returned home to an uneasy sense that something was different, and were not immediately able to grasp that it was ourselves who had changed and not the rooms and furnishings that surrounded us.</p><p>Facebook's PR machine spent much of the first 24 hours after the story broke engaged in a pedantic and self-defeating argument over whether or not what had occurred constituted a \"data breach\". By information security standards, Facebook was correct that what occurred was not a \"data breach\" - as representatives <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">wrote</url>, \"no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked\".</p><p>But a year later, and in the aftermath of an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">actual,</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">vast data breach in October</url>, it is apparent that a data breach would have been easier for Facebook's reputation to weather. Almost every company has suffered a big data breach at this point; only Facebook has endured such an existential reckoning. That's because what happened with Cambridge Analytica was not a matter of Facebook's systems being infiltrated, but of Facebook's systems working as designed: data was amassed, data was extracted, and data was exploited.</p><p>At the end of 2018, Zuck debuted a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">new talking point</url>, asserting that in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook had \"fundamentally altered [its] DNA\".</p><p>Whether Zuckerberg actually believes that is an open question, but it's clear that few outside Facebook do. \"While it appears that Facebook is suddenly 'woke' to privacy issues, it's safe to assume it's business as usual there,\" said Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>\"They keep actually putting growth and profits above designing a platform that's predicated on the needs of its users,\" said Lindsey Barrett, a teaching fellow and staff attorney at Georgetown's Communications and Technology Clinic. As a particularly blatant example of this mindset, Barrett cited Facebook's insistence on using <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">phone numbers that users provided</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">for security reasons</url> for non-security purposes.</p><p>Zuckerberg did make a number of specific promises after the Cambridge Analytica story broke. I asked the company for an update on a number of these, and can only offer the Harvard dropout an \"incomplete\".</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>On 19 March 2018, Facebook said it was pursuing a forensic audit of Cambridge Analytica and other parties involved in the data misuse, but it stood down after the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) began its own investigation. A Facebook spokeswoman said on 13 March that the company was still waiting for approval from the ICO to perform any such audit.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>On 21 March 2018, Zuckerberg promised that Facebook would investigate \"all apps that had access to large amounts of information\" through the platform before 2014, audit any app with suspicious activity and ban any developer who misused personally identifiable information. Facebook provided regular updates on this investigation until 22 August 2018, when the company revealed in a blogpost that it had investigated thousands of third-party apps and suspended \"more than 400\". Seven months later, a spokeswoman said that the investigation was continuing, but provided the same numbers: thousands investigated, more than 400 banned.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>On 1 May, Facebook made its most ambitious promise - the creation of a \" clear history \" tool that would allow users to force Facebook to delete all the information it gathers about users as they browse the web. At the time, Facebook said the tool would \"take a few months to build\". As BuzzFeed News pointed out in February, it's been more than a few months. A Facebook spokeswoman did not provide a timeline for when the tool might actually be available, saying that it was taking time to get the tool right.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The other major promise - the big one - is the pivot to \"privacy\" announced this month. The actual details of this plan are much more mundane, and involve much less actual privacy, than Zuckerberg's manifesto would like us to believe. The CEO is planning to integrate all three of his company's messaging platforms - WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger - into one, which will have end-to-end encryption.</p><p>The overwhelming consensus from privacy experts is that this plan has little to do with protecting privacy and everything to do with protecting market share. \"They are incredibly adept at strategically using privacy as a justification for an anticompetitive strategy - and the shift to encrypted-messaging or 'delete history' makes sense when you consider the impending regulatory pressures around interoperability and data-portability,\" said Soltani.</p><p>The most obvious of those impending pressures is the increasingly popular idea of taking anti-trust action against Facebook, an idea that has gone from the fringes of the thinktank world to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">center of a major 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's agenda</url> with dramatic speed.</p><p>\"Once the integration of those three messaging platforms happens, it will be almost technically impossible to break Facebook up,\" said Jonathan Albright, director of the Digital Forensics Initiative at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. \"It won't happen. You can't do it. And that's exactly why they're moving so quickly to do it.\"</p><p>That \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">Break Up Big Tech</url> \" would be a 2020 campaign slogan was unimaginable just two years ago. Zuckerberg, lest we forget, spent much of 2017 cosplaying a politician on his very own whistlestop tour around the country.</p><p>And yet, here we are. The Cambridge Analytica revelations may not have changed Facebook, but they did change us. Our eyes are now open. The question is what we will do.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52638097</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNM-MN61-JCJY-G0PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1360\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The vast majority of internet searches in the United States, over 88%, begin on Goggle's website. Millions of us wake up and check our social media platforms, like Twitter or Facebook, to see what happened while we were sleeping. One of the reasons these companies have been able to rise to their meteoric heights is because of protections extended through Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The section essentially states that these companies cannot be held responsible for the content of others on their platforms. It was intended to keep the internet free and open, but it is being abused by these companies to limit free speech and control what we do and don't see on the internet.</p><p> Earlier this week, it was reported that Google planned to ban The Federalist, a conservative publication, over readers' comments left on their website. Google said it would no longer run ads on their website. This decision shows not only the sheer power Google wields online, but also the raw hypocrisy that exists in Silicon Valley. Apparently, Google is not okay with websites like The Federalist and their conservative readers sharing their perspectives, but their left-leaning employees have no problem protecting free speech they agree with. Sadly, this selective enforcement is not limited to just Google.</p><p>Twitter has, on several occasions, hid or flagged tweets made by President Trump for rhetoric they simply don't agree with. However, those regulating free speech at Twitter have made no effort to silence any other world leader on its platform, like Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran. These tech companies are widely inconsistent about how and when they enforce their policies. They must be held accountable for consistently taken disproportionate action to silence conservative voices they disagree with.</p><p> In Missouri, we know that these massive companies cannot continue to violate our Constitutional rights. To ensure they don't, Senator Josh Hawley recently introduced the Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act. This bill prevents the Section 230 protections from being provided to online companies unless they clearly detail their content moderation policies and pledge to enforce them in good faith. Under this legislation, when Americans feel these companies are not living up to their end of the deal, they can sue for $5,000 and attorney's fees. Silencing free speech is illegal in the United States, and it is something the American people will never accept. Google, Twitter, Facebook, and others, must understand that they are not too big to be held accountable.</p><p> The past few weeks have shown just how powerful these massive tech companies have become. Yet, the threat towards the free speech of conservative voices is not only a fight playing out online but also in newsrooms at some of the largest and oldest publications in this country. After having published an op-ed written by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, The New York Times faced a firestorm of liberal criticism. The paper's own staff were not prepared to read a viewpoint with which they did not agree. So, rather than engage in debate on the ideas, they complained that the opinions expressed by Senator Cotton amounted to violence. Words are not violence, and the views expressed by Senator Cotton on the looting and rioting are held by many Americans. Yet after initially supporting the piece's publication, the publisher of the New York Times later bowed down before the mob and fired the Head of the Opinion desk who allowed the opinion piece to be published.</p><p> We are entering a dangerous time in America. We used to believe that the best medicine for bad free speech was more free speech. Yet today, it seems that the liberal mob wants to burn books and silence voices. The day our voices become silenced; is the day we stop being Americans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMO-bbac9c8d176b43a9319d76fe4cf8ef68cf886831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CC559F89BDD NWBKMO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606W-74Y1-JBCN-42BS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401953</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Daily Journal Online, 1513 St. Joe Drive Park Hills MO<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The vast majority of internet searches in the United States, over 88%, begin on Goggle's website. Millions of us wake up and check our social media platforms, like Twitter or Facebook, to see what happened while we were sleeping. One of the reasons these companies have been able to rise to their meteoric heights is because of protections extended through Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The section essentially states that these companies cannot be held responsible for the content of others on their platforms. It was intended to keep the internet free and open, but it is being abused by these companies to limit free speech and control what we do and don't see on the internet.</p><p> Earlier this week, it was reported that Google planned to ban The Federalist, a conservative publication, over readers' comments left on their website. Google said it would no longer run ads on their website. This decision shows not only the sheer power Google wields online, but also the raw hypocrisy that exists in Silicon Valley. Apparently, Google is not okay with websites like The Federalist and their conservative readers sharing their perspectives, but their left-leaning employees have no problem protecting free speech they agree with. Sadly, this selective enforcement is not limited to just Google.</p><p>Twitter has, on several occasions, hid or flagged tweets made by President Trump for rhetoric they simply don't agree with. However, those regulating free speech at Twitter have made no effort to silence any other world leader on its platform, like Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran. These tech companies are widely inconsistent about how and when they enforce their policies. They must be held accountable for consistently taken disproportionate action to silence conservative voices they disagree with.</p><p> In Missouri, we know that these massive companies cannot continue to violate our Constitutional rights. To ensure they don't, Senator Josh Hawley recently introduced the Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act. This bill prevents the Section 230 protections from being provided to online companies unless they clearly detail their content moderation policies and pledge to enforce them in good faith. Under this legislation, when Americans feel these companies are not living up to their end of the deal, they can sue for $5,000 and attorney's fees. Silencing free speech is illegal in the United States, and it is something the American people will never accept. Google, Twitter, Facebook, and others, must understand that they are not too big to be held accountable.</p><p> The past few weeks have shown just how powerful these massive tech companies have become. Yet, the threat towards the free speech of conservative voices is not only a fight playing out online but also in newsrooms at some of the largest and oldest publications in this country. After having published an op-ed written by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, The New York Times faced a firestorm of liberal criticism. The paper's own staff were not prepared to read a viewpoint with which they did not agree. So, rather than engage in debate on the ideas, they complained that the opinions expressed by Senator Cotton amounted to violence. Words are not violence, and the views expressed by Senator Cotton on the looting and rioting are held by many Americans. Yet after initially supporting the piece's publication, the publisher of the New York Times later bowed down before the mob and fired the Head of the Opinion desk who allowed the opinion piece to be published.</p><p> We are entering a dangerous time in America. We used to believe that the best medicine for bad free speech was more free speech. Yet today, it seems that the liberal mob wants to burn books and silence voices. The day our voices become silenced; is the day we stop being Americans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMO-1f7e3094bb22a3216087de8b2b1d6f55b9de2ff</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CC513E7DA47 NWBKMO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606W-74Y1-JBCN-422R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401953</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Daily Journal Online, 1513 St. Joe Drive Park Hills MO<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.
