America big four tech companies \u2013 including Facebook Inc., Amazon Inc., Google by Alphabet, and Apple Inc. \u2013 have collectively been accused of crushing rivals to boost profits.      The four were accused of abusing their market power by Congress in a video conference hearing that put CEOs of America\u2019s big four tech companies in the hot seat.    A notable exchange in the hearing was when Facebook Inc\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg was asked if they have ever copied rivals . Zuckerberg admitted the allegation by saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly adapted features that others have led in.\u201d    Of course, that is true. Facebook has been seen copying features from popular apps on the market.  He, however, denied that copying features from rival apps were meant to stifle competition.    Additionally, Zuckerberg was questioned on the number of rival apps they have copied features from.    \u201cHow many companies did Facebook end up copying?\u201d asked Representative Pramila Jayapal. \u201cIs it less than five? Less than 50?\u201d    \u201cCongresswoman, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.    He was also questioned about whether Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram in 2012. Whether the company purchased Instagram for fear of it being a threat, with the Congress quoting emails from 2012 .    Zuckerberg denied the allegation, arguing the photo and video sharing app was, at the time, tiny.    However, in an email conversation uncovered in 2012, Zuckerberg writes \u201cI just need to decide if we\u2019re buying Instagram,\u201d because \u201cInstagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business.\u201d    Buying the competition even if small at the time was a move to prevent them from being \u201cvery disruptive\u201d to Facebook\u2019s business said Zuckerberg in an email to his chief financial officer, David Ebersman .   Amazon, Apple, and GoogleAmazon\u2019s CEO was questioned on whether it used data from third-party sellers in its sales decisions which he denied. Google was accused of stealing content from honest businesses while Apple\u2019s questions lied in its 30 percent App Store commission charges to developers.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will continue in the top position.<br/> Reuters reported that the world's largest social media network is facing growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States about a whistleblower's allegations that London-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed user information to build profiles on American voters which were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.<br/> Zuckerberg, in his first public comments since the scandal erupted at the weekend, said in a post on Facebook that the company \"made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.\"<br/> He did not elaborate on what the mistakes were, but he said the global social network plans to conduct an investigation of apps on its platform, restrict developer access to data, and give members a tool that lets them more disable access to their Facebook data.<br/> He did not explicitly apologize for the improper use of data, and his plans did not represent a big reduction of advertisers' ability to use Facebook data, which is the company's lifeblood.<br/> The company has lost more than $45 billion of its stock market value over the past three days on investor fears that any failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation.<br/> Many analysts have now raised concerns that the incident will have a negative impact on user engagement with Facebook, potentially reducing its clout with advertisers. Three Wall Street brokerages cut their price targets.<br/> \"Investors now have to consider whether or not the company will conclude that it has grown in a manner that has proven to be untenable or whether it needs to significantly improve how it is managed,\" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INFOTC-n10432804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INFOTC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXW-J6B1-DYDW-7205-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423499</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"340\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Infotechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The Verge first posted the text along audio files from this internal Q&amp;A and has followed it up with a full transcript of the same.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Interestingly, Zuckerberg has also shared link to the full transcript on his personal Facebook page, noting that \"even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it's out there, you can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees\" The transcript has full details of Zuckerberg's views on Libra, rivals like TikTok, the topic of breaking up big tech companies- an idea floated by US Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren- among other topics.</p><p>When it comes to TikTok, Zuckerberg acknowledged that it is growing really quickly in India and starting to do well in US as well, adding, \"I think it's past Instagram now in India in terms of scale. So yeah, it's a very interesting phenomenon.\"</p><p>He then went on to compare TikTok to the Explore Tab on Instagram and said it was like \"Explore for stories, and that were the whole app.\" In response to TikTok, Zuckerberg said Facebook has an app called Lasso which is going to countries like Mexico first, and they would also try to see if Lasso can compete against TikTok in countries where the app has already become big.</p><p>In India, Tik Tok claims to have 120 million monthly active customers, going by a last public statement from the Byte-dance owned company. In comparison, Instagram is believed to have 70 million users in India, though Facebook has not specified the exact number.</p><p>Zuckerberg also spoke about the changes to Instagram in order to help it compete with TikTok. It should be remembered Facebook copies Snapchat's popular Stories format starting with Instagram, and later rolled this out to Messenger, Facebook and WhatsApp as well.</p><p>\"We're taking a number of approaches with Instagram, including making it so that Explore is more focused on stories, which is increasingly becoming the primary way that people consume content on Instagram, as well as a couple of other things there,\" he said.</p><p>But Zuckerberg has admitted that \"have time to learn and understand and get ahead of the trend,\" when it comes to TikTok, adding that \"their retention is actually not that strong after they stop advertising.\"</p><p>The Facebook CEO also spoke about Libra, which is the company's crypto-currency that they plan to launch by 2020. He also mentioned that WhatsApp payments testing in India, which has been going on for some time, though it is unclear when the service will full roll out.</p><p>\"Finance is a very heavily regulated space. There's a lot of important issues that need to be dealt with in preventing money laundering, preventing financing of terrorists and people who the different governments say you can't do business with. There are a lot of requirements on knowing who your customers are,\" Zuckerberg said.</p><p>He said Facebook wants to address all the concerns and get this right, and adding that the company will also work on private engagements with regulators around the world. He also said these engagements will be \"substantive and less dramatic,\" than public hearing.</p><p>He also admitted Facebook will face similar pushback on other topics like its move toward more encryption across messaging apps. \"That will, over time, be very sensitive when we get closer to rolling it out. Law enforcement, obviously, is not going to be psyched about that. But we think it's the right thing to protect people's privacy more, so we'll go defend that when the time is right,\" he said.</p><p>Regarding the breakup of big tech, he admitted this will be a legal challenge if Warren gets elected, though he said he was confident they would \"win the legal challenge.\"</p><p>\"I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that's not the position that you want to be in when you're if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,\" he said in the meeting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0049762945</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5X-S2X1-JB5M-W4NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In addition, Zuckerberg's wife Priscilla Chan, 'also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.' The two individuals hired were Eric Mayefsky and Nina Wornhoff, senior digital analytics adviser and organizing data manager respectively.Contact with Buttigieg's campaign was initiated by Zuckerberg and his wife, 'shortly after Buttigieg officially launched his campaign in mid-April,' according to Meagher.Afamily spokesman told Bloomberg News that the employees in question 'asked the tech mogul and Chan to recommend them': 'Having seen Mark's visit to South Bend in 2017 and Facebook Live with Mayor Buttigieg, colleagues later asked Mark and Priscilla to connect them with the Buttigieg campaign as they were interested in joining,' spokesman Ben LaBolt said in a statement. </p><p>Zuckerberg visited South Bend, Indiana, in April 2017 as part of his philanthropic work and got a tour from Buttigieg, that Zuckerberg live-streamed.' He later added that 'Mark and Priscilla have not decided who to support for President.'Contact between Zuckerberg and Buttigieg traveled in similar circles going back to their youth. They reportedly 'overlapped at Harvard, and Buttigieg was friends with two of Zuckerberg's roommates.' In addition, Buttigieg was also 'one of Facebook's first 300 users.'Bloomberg claimed these staff recommendations by Zuckerberg are the first examples of him assisting a presidential campaign yet known. Though the candidate appears to be a favorite at the office, as '[a] number of other high-ranking Facebook executives, including David Marcus, the executive leading Facebook's cryptocurrency efforts, Naomi Gleit, one of Facebook's longest-tenured executives, and Chris Cox, former chief product officer who is close friends with Zuckerberg, have donated to Buttigieg.'Buttigieg has 'become somewhat of a darling of Silicon Valley Democrats,' to the point that he has been 'repeatedly returning to San Francisco for high-dollar fundraisers,' noted Bloomberg.While he has 'raised concerns about tech companies having too much power and has floated regulation, including fines and the blocking of new mergers,' he has also 'been more apprehensive about breaking up big tech companies than some of his Democratic counterparts, saying the issue of monopolies extends beyond tech.'The article also made note of how 'Republicans have accused Zuckerberg and Facebook of bias against conservative viewpoints, claiming that Facebook and other social media platforms unfairly suppress their views.' Zuckerberg had recently held private meetings with conservative leaders to address their concerns.But now 'Facebook is under unprecedented attack' from the left, and Zuckerberg needs friends in Washington.' In recent weeks, Warren's campaign has bought ads on Facebook claiming Zuckerberg endorsed Trump, a deliberate falsehood that she used to draw attention to Facebook's policies exempting politicians from fact-checking ads, and corrected later in the advertisement.'

As Facebook faces mounting antitrust scrutiny, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly asserted that the company faces intense competition and is not a monopoly.But eight years ago, the company was telling a very different story.In a marketing presentation from 2012, Facebook boasted about its market dominance \u2014 claiming to make up \"95%\" of total social media in the United States.The claim was made in a chart that compared Facebook's market share to those of rivals including Tumblr, Twitter, and MySpace for a presentation to telecoms firm Vodafone's board of directors, which was obtained by the US House Judiciary Committee as part of a year-long investigation into big tech antitrust issues and made public on Wednesday.The document is a striking illustration of how Facebook has historically emphasised its size and power as a marketing tool, and how drastically the company has changed its approach now it is the subject of growing political scrutiny and anti-monopoly investigations.CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Committee on Wednesday, and he used his opening remarks to assert that Facebook is still fighting considerable competitors[2]. \"The most popular messaging service in the US is iMessage,\" he said. </p><p>\"The fastest-growing app is TikTok. The most popular app for video is YouTube. The fastest growing ads platform is Amazon. The largest ads platform is Google. And for every dollar spent on advertising in the US, less than 10 cents is spent with us.\"The House Committee obtained large numbers of documents from Facebook and others companies in its investigation. In another exchange between Zuckerberg and top executives in 2012, the CEO said that he viewed Instagram as a significant threat to Facebook's business before acquiring it[3].Facebook has long aggressively bought up competing businesses. Many of its core products, from Instagram to WhatsApp and Oculus started life as independent companies before being acquired. Regulators and politicians are now scrutinizing whether Facebook's acquisitions constitute anti-competitive behaviour.Got a tip?

The meetings were structured as Q&amp;A sessions with employees and were meant to provide deeper insight into Zuckerberg s thoughts on issues facing his company. The meetings were held shortly after the Federal Trade Commission s record-setting<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>$5 billion settlement</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>with Facebook.</p><p>In the recordings, Zuckerberg says he is prepared to sue the federal government or any other U.S. regulators that try to break up Facebook.

And does that still suck for us? Yeah.

They ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation. </p><p>Zuckerberg argues later in the Q&amp;A that large tech corporations are in a unique position to help remedy some of the nefarious behavior on their networks.  It s just that breaking up these companies, whether it s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues,  he says.  And, you know, it doesn t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can t coordinate and work together. </p><p>The Verge has published several<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>snippets of audio</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>if you want to hear Zuckerberg explain in his own words. The 35-year-old billionaire also answered questions about looming competition from TikTok and why he believes Twitter can t do as good a job as Facebook when it comes to solving big societal issues.

Facebook's appeal is still pending, and it said in response to the ruling that there was no antitrust abuse.Go deeper: Exclusive poll reveals Americans' data privacy frustrations[5]Editor's note: This story has been corrected to show that Germany's antitrust regulator brought a case on data collection against Facebook, not the country's top court.

It goes from bad to worse at Facebook. </p><p> We dig in to the stunning new allegations out of the U.K. based on Facebook  e-mails the U.K. had seized. That Facebook was warned about Russians  trolling through Facebook, harvesting your information much earlier than  realized starting way back in 2014. Up to three billion data points a day. </p><p> This as U.S. senators here in this country warn Facebook may have broken  the law. We explain. </p><p> Also coming up, Google now under fire by seven countries in Europe who now  say Google is still secretly tracking you even after you turn it off. And  that Google tricks you into giving it much more information about yourself  and your families, more than you realize all without your consent. </p><p> This as Google workers now demand Google must stop building a censored  search engine for China that that China can use to attract and arrest  citizens that commit human rights violations. Protests worldwide on that,  we're on it. </p><p> Also coming up to Capitol Hill, high-level meetings over the border wall  funding. Will President Trump get what he wants, and wat is that poison  pill that will cause Republican conservatives to defeat it? </p><p> Plus, details tonight on the new Republican push for results from that  Justice Department probe into the Clinton Foundation. New details showing  donations plummeting after Hillary lost the election. Republicans say  that's proof that the Clintons engaged in pay to play. </p><p> Well, thank you so much for joining us, thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth  MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p> Welcome to the show. You're watching the Fox Business Network. </p><p> Over 100 Google workers publishing an open letter today, slamming Google,  demanding it stop building a censored search engine for China. It's  designed to possibly blacklist words like human rights or student protests.  Fear is that China will use that Google search engine to arrest its own  citizens and commit even more human rights violations. </p><p> Hillary Vaughn has the details. Hillary? </p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Liz. Well, these Google  engineers really are teaming up to take on Google, trying to get them to  shut down the development of this dragonfly search engine. The Googlers  pending a public letter. The list of signatories has been growing  throughout the day. </p><p> The letter calling out Google for putting what they call profits over their  own company's values that are supposed to include basic human rights. </p><p> The letter writing, quote, \"Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous  precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for  Google to deny other countries similar concessions, providing the Chinese  government with ready access to user data as required by Chinese law would  make Google complicit in oppression and human rights abuses.\" </p><p> This is not the first time Googlers have sounded off about this product.  The letter says thousands internally at Google have protested the tools.  Many of these people that signed on to this letter are engineers, and they  say they should have a say how the tools that they are building are being  used and by who is using them. </p><p> Dragonfly would ramp up surveillance of Chinese citizens, sparking concerns  that the government would use Google's data to silence dissenters, censor  unpopular points of view, these are concerns that -- or there are concerns  that the data would also make Chinese citizens less safe.</p><p> So, Google's been dealing with a lot of backlash about this not internally  but also publicly too. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, even vice President Mike  pence calling for Google to stop the development of this product. </p><p> But each time Google has offered this same very statement that they wrote  months ago, even though the letter today was published this morning, saying  that their work on search in China is just exploratory, and they're not  ready to launch anything soon, so we'll have to wait and see if Google  decides to address publicly some of these concerns by their own employees.</p><p> But they're not the only tech company in the spotlight here. Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg got shamed on Twitter after he failed to show up before  lawmakers in the U.K. that were demanding answers over Russian activity on  their platform after reports revealed that they could have been mining  three billion bits of data from the site a day. </p><p> So, he didn't show up. Instead, he sent someone else. So, Britain's  department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport tweeted a photo of an empty  chair with a name placard for Zuckerberg writing, \"where is Mark  Zuckerberg?\" </p><p> Facebook sent their V.P. of policy solutions Richard Allan to answer  questions from lawmakers that then grilled him over this and also the  disappear -- or the absence of Facebook's CEO.</p><p> Zuckerberg has faced scrutiny in the U.K. for not facing lawmakers there  after he faced Congress here in the U.S. They, of course, have a lot of  questions that are very similar to a lot of the questions that lawmakers  here on Capitol Hill had as well. Liz? </p><p> MACDONALD:  Hillary Vaughn, great reporting. Thank you so much. And more  trouble for Google.</p><p> VAUGHN:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Consumer groups and seven countries accusing Google of secretly  tracking users' locations even after they turn off Google's locations  settings, also letting Google is secretly building detailed profiles of  users without our consent. </p><p> And to the new Facebook bombshell we are just talking about. Zuckerberg and  those Facebook e-mails seized by the U.K. parliament that Facebook was  warned that Russians were trolling through our data, harvesting way back  starting in 2014, earlier than realized.</p><p> Again, you heard it, three billion data points a day, that's what the U.K.  is saying. </p><p> Let's bring in Republican Florida Congressman Francis Rooney. Great to see  you, sir. </p><p> REP. FRANCIS ROONEY, (R) FLORIDA:  Thanks for having me on. </p><p> MACDONALD:  What's your reaction to all of this? </p><p> ROONEY:  Well, I think Facebook and Google are showing some of the abusive  behavior that a dominant competitor can do, and I think we need to take  seriously how we're going to deal with it. </p><p> I mean, this business of Google doing the things you just talked about,  Facebook censoring conservative posts and sources, we can't allow them in a  free society with a First Amendment to operate that way. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Is there a growing consensus that Congress will try to regulate  Facebook and social media? Because here we've got the U.S. Senator Amy  Klobuchar saying Facebook may have broken a law by hiring a P.R. from to  smear critics. She's worried that Facebook may be illegally using its  mountain of data against government officials scrutinizing it including on  the intelligence committees. Is there a push in Congress now to regulate  these guys? </p><p> ROONEY:  Well, we'll see what the incoming Democrat majority in the House  wants to do. I've been pushing for two years that we follow the Europeans'  attitude of bringing antitrust actions against Facebook and Google for  their abusive market share and that we hold them accountable for data  breaches. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Are you going to hold hearings on it? </p><p> ROONEY:  I hope they do. I mean, I think the things you just talked about,  about Google keeping that information and discreetly and clandestinely  keeping it and then with Facebook admitting that they've censored  conservative sources in violation of the First Amendment are serious  problems for me. </p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, and, sir, also, U.K. politicians saying Facebook  purposefully and knowingly set up a back door for companies like Cambridge  Analytica to get in and take our information, also reading - reading our  Facebook messages. We don't know who else is reading our Facebook messages,  in effect saying, basically Facebook created, knowingly created a loophole  and sold it. What do you think of that? </p><p> ROONEY:  I think it's a total derogation of First Amendment and privacy  rights, and we need to dig into it and address it. Just like this behavior  in China. You know, Facebook wants to be protected by the power of the  United States when they're threatened, but they're going to go in there and  conspire with China? </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, that's Google. </p><p> ROONEY:  Google, yes. I mean.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  That's Google. </p><p> ROONEY:  We're -- you know, Lenin used to say the capitalists will sell us  the ropes we'll use to hang them with. It sounds like Google is doing that. </p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Congressman Rooney, you're terrific. Will you come  back on the show? We're going to stay on the story. We are going to need  congressman like you on it. Can you come back on in the future? </p><p> ROONEY:  I love to do it anytime. Thank you very much. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you, sir. Good to see you. </p><p> Now we've got to keep an eye on Amazon, too. The Wall Street Journal  reporting Amazon is stepping into our health data. Amazon is planning to  sell software to doctors and hospitals to mine our medical records all in  an attempt for better patient service. But you know what happens there,  we're always worried about that. </p><p> Joining me now, Republican strategist Ford O'Connell and Democrat  strategist, Kevin Walling. Ford, you heard -- Ford and Kevin. First to you,  Ford. You heard our conversation just now on all of this. What's your  reaction to all of this, Ford? </p><p> FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, look, I think that big tech  is like the Wild West. There are no rules and, essentially, collectively  they wield more power than big brother. And with Democrats taking back the  House and with folks like Elizabeth Warren running for president, there are  going to be regulations, the only question is when. Even Apple's Tim Cook  admits as much.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. Kevin, here's the thing, these guys act very  altruistic in public. They act like, you know, we're sorry, we're  altruistic, but then we're going to get your permission, we're going to get  your consent later after we push it, after we take your stuff. What's your  reaction to all of this, Kevin? </p><p> KEVIN WALLING, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Sure, Liz. I'm so happy we're  shining a light on this. And I couldn't agree with Ford more that it's the  Wild West. </p><p> You know, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress last April. It's clear  we need him back as soon as possible to answer some of these questions. If  not, Congress you're also seeing a dip in terms of their stock value, down  20 percent. </p><p> So clearly, consumers are concerned about privacy issues, about regulatory  issues regarding Facebook. So, if Congress doesn't get them to the table,  hopefully consumers will push them to become better citizens when it comes  to these issues. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, you know, Kevin makes an important point, Ford, because --  let me back up. Facebook also let Cambridge Analytica read our Facebook  messages. We don't know who else is reading our messages. This is really  bad. Will the market fix it, or should government fix it? </p><p> O'CONNELL:  Well, I don't know that the market is going to fix it, and I  think that you're also raising another question, Liz, and that's very  simple. And that is that, basically, data privacy is seen in America among  voters on a bipartisan scale on both size of the aisle like pre-existing  conditions. </p><p> And when we look over to the E.A. and what they're doing with data privacy,  I think that's going to be a guide going forward. But remember, President  Trump is not very big on regulation, and he wants to avoid the headaches of  a monstrous piece of legislation like Dodd-Frank and its unintended  consequences. </p><p> I see something very narrowly tailored working towards data privacy, and if  that doesn't work, then you may have more government regulation. The idea  is to put some brakes on big tech but not to clamp them down. Because,  remember, Liz, they're also a big part of driving our economy and our jobs. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, that's an important point too. That Silicon Valley is a  big economic growth driver. Kevin, you know, the level of debate is so  impoverished in this country, that's what critics have been saying. The  fact that big tech has been censoring conservative thought and discussions  on policy, on economic policy when way back in the day we saw Ted Kennedy - - I will always say that Ted Kennedy and Chuck Schumer voted for the tax  cuts. </p><p> We don't see those debates happening on Facebook or Google's social media.  I mean, what is going on here with these algorithms built by liberal  Silicon Valley, they're basically censoring conservative debate? It is  ruining debate and ruining this democracy, that's what the polls are  showing. </p><p> WALLING:  Liz, I couldn't agree with you more. Listen, I'm a die-hard  Democrat, that's why I come on this show, because I really love how you  host it and give a voice to both sides where we can have a debate, where we  can move forward as a country. Because I think that's where the majority of  Americans are. </p><p> And it really should give us pause if there is that kind of censorship  going which is why I support bipartisan efforts. You mentioned Senator  Klobuchar and Senator Kennedy from Louisiana that are pushing forward with  that very thing in the United States Senate. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, this story is not going to go away. We're going to stay  on it. Kevin and Ford, we're going to have you back on to debate it and  talk about it. Thank you so much--</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WALLING:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p> O'CONNELL:  Thank you, E-Mac.</p><p> MACDONALD:  -- for your analysis and insights tonight. Good to see you,  guys. </p><p> Now to the border and the latest on the caravan. Jeff Paul is there  reporting live on the ground in Tijuana, Mexico. Jeff? </p><p> JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Elizabeth. A press  conference just wrapped up with some members of that migrant caravan just a  few moments ago, and they put out a list of things they'd like to see  moving forward. </p><p> The one -- the two that stick out to me, one, an end to unjust  deportations, the other being that they want an acceleration of the process  of applying for asylum into the United States. </p><p> Now we've spent some time today talking with all sorts of different  migrants who are out here, and we're getting mixed reactions from both.  Some feel what happened on Sunday, that clash with border patrol, only  makes the whole group look bad while others who were part of that march and  part of that demonstration say that they're going to stick it out, and  they're hoping to still maybe one day get into the United States. Take a  listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I'm going to cross the United  States whatever it is with these crutches. These crutches will not stop me  from crossing that fence illegally or legally. But I do not intend to cross  illegally if I am hopeful that they will give me the papers. Because the  first thing is to ask for political asylum in the United States to enter  legally.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> PAUL:  Now, for the migrants out here, they can kind of play a couple  different ways. One of the options is to stay here which has probably more  than 5,000 people with overcrowding out into the street while they wait for  a possible chance for asylum in the United States, but they are only  accepting -- not processing -- a hundred applications a day, if that. </p><p> The other is to stay in Tijuana and possibly to try to get a work visa  here. Or the third option is to head back to Central America which we are  starting to see more people look into that, and we saw our first van head  down there today with a few people who had just given up and saying they're  going back home. Elizabeth? </p><p> MACDONALD:  Jeff Paul in Tijuana, Mexico. Thank you so much for your  reporting, sir. Great reporting there. Good to see you. </p><p> Later in the show we will bring on Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton who  will join us to talk about the battle in D.C. over funding the border wall  the president wants, and also the government data showing the Obama  administration used tear gas and pepper spray numerous times at the border.  The debate on the media cover coverage of that coming up. </p><p> Also, this and other headlines, new information coming out of that black  box from that Lion Air jet that crashed off of Indonesia last month. It  reveals the airplane's pilots heroically fought to regain control of the  plane 24 times in a short 11-minute period. </p><p> The pilots were fighting anti-stall software made by Boeing. That software  pushed the Boeing jets nose of the plane down about two dozen times. The  pilots fought to bring it back up, and that plane crash killed 189 people.  We're staying on that story for you. </p><p> And look at this stunning footage. A sand wall 100 meters high overtook  China's Zhangye City. It's a crazy video. Sandstorms are common in China,  but local areas say they've never seen anything like this or this big. </p><p> Plus, look at this life-size model of Noah's Ark. The architect, Johan  Huibers, he wants to sell that boat, that Noah's Ark, basically, type  vessel to Israel. He believes God's ship should be on God's land. We're  staying on that story for you. Fun stuff there. </p><p> Coming up, the Russia/Ukraine crisis now escalating. We'll have more on  this later in the show with retired general Robert Scales. </p><p> But first, President Trump firing back at G.M. for planning to close  multiple factories. The president saying, G.M., you better shape up or face  financial pain, you may lose your federal government subsidies. We're going  to deal with that next. And debate on whether Trump is now putting a stop  to crony capitalism once and for all. Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. We're almost coming into the bottom of the hour.  President Trump now threatening to cut all federal subsidies to General  Motors including for G.M.'s electric cars after G.M. announced it will lay  about, plans to lay off about 14,800 of its workers and shutter five  factories in North America. </p><p> Deirdre Bolton has the latest. Deirdre? </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Liz. So, if we take a look at  what the president tweeted out earlier, we will see his frustration. We're  going to show it on the screen. \"Very disappointed in G.M., very  disappointed in the CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan,  and Maryland.\"</p><p> So, it is unclear, you mentioned this cessation of benefits, but it's  unclear just how much G.M. benefits from federal government subsidies. It  is also, quite frankly, unclear how the administration could restrict  credit. </p><p> But the tweet does escalate the president's public threats against G.M. as  he pushes this company to keep the facilities open in Ohio in Michigan and  Maryland. He has repeatedly pressured American companies, we remember  Harley Davidson who considered shutting down facilities or moving  operations overseas after he pledged on the campaign trail to revive U.S.  manufacturing. </p><p> Now, G.M. did put out its own statement, we're going to put that on the  screen as well so you can follow. I'll just read part of it. But G.M. is  committed to maintaining a strong manufacturing presence in the U.S. as  evidenced by our more than $22 billion worth of investment in U.S.  operations since 2009. </p><p> The company also talks about adding technical and engineering jobs, saying  it appreciates the support it has from this administration. But I think,  Liz, it's worth pointing out that G.M. is no longer only competing with a  traditional carmaker such as Ford. </p><p> The company is facing pressure from a lot of the Silicon Valley upstarts,  from Tesla, from Uber, from Apple, from Google. All of those companies want  to make self-driving cars, all of those companies want to make electric  cars. And I guess the sum total, self-driving electric ones. </p><p> So, G.M. does have a lot of pressure, and Mary Barra, the CEO, saying these  moves are made to reinvent the company and keep it alive. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Great reporting, Deirdre. We love having you on. Come back  soon. </p><p> Let's bring in an expert. Her name is Veronique de Rugy. She's brilliant,  she's at the Mercatus Center, she's also a syndicated columnist. We --  Veronique de Rugy there. There you are. Veronique, we don't know what  federal subsidies the White House is talking about. There's a plug-in tax  credit that goes to consumers for electric cars, but I want to -- I want to  have this conversation with you, Veronique. </p><p> We know that G.M. got, you know, billions, tens of billions of dollars in  bailout money. Why can't these automakers retool their factories to build  either small cars or big cars like trucks and SUVs? </p><p> VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY MERCATUS  CENTER:  Well, I mean, you know me, I'm against those bailouts that G.M.  and other automakers got, and I think it's not the role of the government  to interfere in the production lines or the behavior and whatever  production decision companies are making. </p><p> And they should be -- and it's actually good practice, it seems to me that  G.M. is actually doing the right thing which is looking at the market of  your future in cars and saying this is what we need to do. And, obviously,  they should be doing it without subsidies. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes, that's the point. Because you can, you know, people can  understand the president's frustration here. Let me back up. U.S. taxpayers  lost $11 billion on the 2008 bailout of G.M., and you know what happened  then was that oil prices spiked up, and nobody wanted G.M.'s big cars and  trucks at that time. </p><p> Oil prices and gas prices go down, now people want the big cars, they can  afford it. They don't want the littler cars. So why can't G.M. and the  carmakers get a grip on where gas prices are going? I think the president  is frustrated because he knows that carmakers can come with their tin cups  to federal taxpayers and get bailouts. He doesn't want it anymore. </p><p> DE RUGY:  Well, I mean, government intervention into private businesses  create massive distortions. It's bad for everyone, and consumers and  taxpayers obviously, but it's also never quite great for the companies  getting them because it actually push them -- pushes them into behaviors  that are actually not necessarily efficient, and they're just out to seek - - to seek subsidies. </p><p> That being said, I would welcome the president cutting all subsidies to all  companies, but I don't think this is what he is trying to do right now.  He's frustrated, and he's using the threat of removing subsidies for this  particular company as a threat against it. </p><p> And I think that has really just not proper for a president to do this. </p><p> MACDONALD:  I hear -- no, I hear what you're saying, and let's do the back  story here. We know that the bailout of the carmakers is often a bailout of  the unions. We understand that.</p><p> DE RUGY:  Yes, of course. </p><p> MACDONALD:  We get that. And we know that these, you know, carmakers  operate in important swing states for elections. </p><p> DE RUGY:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That's the back story too. The question is, are the carmakers  getting too lazy in fixing their own operations because they know they can  come to the federal taxpayer? In other words, build factories you can  immediately retool to build the cars that are in accordance--</p><p> DE RUGY:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  -- with gas prices going up or down. </p><p> DE RUGY:  I completely agree with you. And the problem is a lot of these  subsidies actually lead to what we call mal investment. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, that's it. </p><p> DE RUGY:  basically, you spend a lot of time going after subsidies and  investing money because you want the subsidies as opposed to actually  really thinking about what's best for your company. </p><p> And it does seem though -- and, obviously, the bailout was part of this,  I'm sorry. It is not the role of a government at the federal level or at  the state level to go and bail out companies if they're not selling  products that consumers want to buy. They shouldn't be bailed out. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> DE RUGY:  They should go under, and, or they should revamp their model, you  know? They will have a dry patch or whatever, but this practice is not  productive, it doesn't lead to an auto sector that is actually productive-- </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. </p><p> DE RUGY:  -- and competitive. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p> DE RUGY:  And that is one of the problems. </p><p> MACDONALD:  Veronique, you're great. All of a sudden G.M. says it can move  workers that are going to be lay off to other factories. I don't understand  how Mercedes can suddenly retool it existing car plants to make electric  vehicles. If they can do it, well, why can't the other carmakers?  Veronique, you're great. Great to see you. Come back soon, we love having  you on. </p><p> DE RUGY:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up, we've got details on how the media botched the  coverage of the tear gas used at the border. They didn't cover its use  under the Obama administration. We've got the numbers coming up. </p><p> Plus, a new House hearing is expected in a couple of weeks on the Justice  Department's probe into pay to play at the Clinton Foundation after new  data shows donations there are plummeting after Hillary lost. </p><p> And the CDC now confirming 116 cases of polio-like paralysis in the United  States. More on that with Doc Siegel coming up next. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. A mysterious polio-like disease that causes  paralysis is now spreading to 31 states, sickening at least 116 children.  With me now is Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel. Doctor, flu- like symptoms, what is causing this disease and how can you stop it?</p><p> MARC SIEGEL, MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  I think it's a virus, and  CDC thinks it's a virus, but it may be more than one strain of a virus  called an enterovirus which is -- polio is an enterovirus, but it's not  polio. It's a different kind of enterovirus, not polio. Polio-like.</p><p> Now, how could it be a virus and not spread from you to me? Let me tell you  how. It's a very common virus, but it only causes this problem a very small  amount of the time.</p><p> MACDONALD:  How do you get it?</p><p> SIEGEL:  Well, it goes around like wildfire --</p><p> MACDONALD:  How would I get it?</p><p> SIEGEL:  You'll get this virus just by sneezing, coughing, touching things.  There are thousands and thousands of cases around the United States of the  virus. But then this complication, again, only 117 cases and probably total  almost 300 cases by the time --</p><p> MACDONALD:  A lot of children are getting it.</p><p> SIEGEL:  That's right. So 90 percent of the time, it's under the age of 18.  The average age is four years old.</p><p> MACDONALD:  How terrifying.</p><p> SIEGEL:  I can't make light of something that affects 200 --</p><p> MACDONALD:  No, we're not making light. Is there a vaccine for this? I  mean, how do you stop it?</p><p> SIEGEL:  Great question, Liz. If we knew which strain of enterovirus it  was, we could do a vaccine. They have a vaccine, EV-68, which is one of the  possible causes. But it's like the breadcrumbs. You see the breadcrumbs,  you see the trail, but you're not exactly able to prove it. By the time  they find this condition, evidence of the virus is already gone. So they  can't prove it, so they don't want to --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Understood. OK. Because Colorado is getting hit hard and Texas  is getting hit hard, and there's been more than three and a half times the  number of cases this year as last year, I mean, so, what would you advise  parents out there to do?</p><p> SIEGEL:  Well, I always want to decrease the fear quotient. I want to tell  parents it's not contagious. I want to tell parents it's still one in a  million cases --</p><p> MACDONALD:  But we still don't know how you get it.</p><p> SIEGEL:  No, we do know how you get it. You get it because you had a  respiratory virus. So if your kid is coughing and sneezing, a few days  later, they suddenly end up weak, you should be on the lookout for that. So  do you should look for signs of weakness following a respiratory infection  --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Like flu-like symptoms.</p><p> SIEGEL:  Right. You get flu-like symptoms, you get muscle aches, you get   respiratory congestion, you get fever and then, bam, you're weak, upper or  lower body weakness. Very tragic but still rare.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I want to switch to this report. This is astonishing. Sleep  apnea devices that people wear at night to help them sleep, millions of  people wear it. Well, apparently these devices, doctor, are secretly spying  on people. Can you explain this one?</p><p> SIEGEL:  This is really horrifying. First of all, I want to tell you that,  as you say, millions have this condition, and I want to tell you it can  lead to strokes, it can lead to heart attacks, it can lead to diabetes --</p><p> MACDONALD:  So the device.</p><p> SIEGEL:  This is a really scary disease. You have to wear the machines.  They reverse it. They're really important. But guess what, the machine can  see how long you've been wearing it. The machine has a way of seeing  whether you have the device on or not.</p><p> It monitors the number of hours you have it on. And guess what's happening,  insurers are looking to see whether you're wearing it or not. And if you're  not wearing, they're cutting off the reimbursement --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Wait, wait, wait. The device is transmitting the information to  the device maker, the medical supplier and the insurer to see if you're  wearing the device or not?</p><p> SIEGEL:  Wirelessly.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Wow! So you're wearing it at night and you don't even know that  this company, the insurer is looking at you to see if you're wearing it to  cut up your coverage, is that the story?</p><p> SIEGEL:  They're monitoring you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Even in your sleep.</p><p> SIEGAL:  And what are they going to monitor next? Look at those brain  waves. I mean, this is big brother. I think that -- my strong view is this  goes too far. I'm OK with your doctor having this information, but I don't  want your insurer having this. An invasion of the home. You can't even  sleep anymore!</p><p> MACDONALD:  I know.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good god. I mean, now -- I can't believe that they've gone that  far. Can you believe that? I was shocked.</p><p> SIEGEL:  I think they should be illegal. I don't think they should be able  to cut off your coverage by saying you didn't wear the machine. The  machines are extremely important medically.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> SIEGEL:  They should be worn. Insurers, stay out of the bedroom.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Oh, my god. No kidding.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  And the government too. Thank you, Doc Siegel. Good to see you.  Great stuff.</p><p> Coming up, will President Trump get his $5 billion for his border wall?  Big, high-level meetings in Washington today. A government shutdown looms  less than two weeks away possibly. We're on it.</p><p> But first, Russia and the Ukraine clashing at sea. The stakes are high.  What will President Trump do? How will Russian President Vladimir Putin  react? We're bringing in retired Army Major General Robert Scales. He joins  me next. Stay there. Back in two.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Tensions between Russia and the Ukraine reaching a boiling  point. Three captured Ukrainian sailors forced to make statements on  Russian state TV after Russian forces shot at and seized three Ukrainian  naval ships over the weekend.</p><p> And this just in, breaking news, in an interview with The Washington Post,  President Trump is now threatening to cancel his scheduled meeting with  Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit coming up because of  Russia's clash at sea with the Ukraine.</p><p> Let's take it up with retired Major General Robert Scales. He's a Fox News  contributor. Great to see you, general.</p><p> ROBERT SCALES, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS:  Hi, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What's your take on all of this?</p><p> SCALES:  Well, it's just Vladimir Putin being Vladimir Putin, Liz. Although  it didn't make the news, it's important to understand this is the fourth  provocation by Putin this year. One over Finnish airspace (ph), one in the  Baltic states where sea maneuvers (ph) were suspended, and of course we  have the gas attack in Great Britain.</p><p> So this is Vladimir Putin trying to poke at the west. He hates the west, he  hates the United States in particular. You know, there's an old staying,  Lenin once said if you probe with a bayonet and you hit steel, stop. If you  probe with a bayonet and hit mush, continue. Frankly, all Vladimir Putin's  hits since the invasion of Georgia in 2008 is mush.</p><p> It's time for the president to take -- to take action, to push back against  Putin. Otherwise, his brash acts will continue for as long as he's in  office, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  So, what will President Trump do? Because we know President  Vladimir Putin is probably watching Trump's response closely.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  So, what makes this risky for the U.S.? What do you think Trump  should do?</p><p> SCALES:  Several things. First of all, he's got to call out Putin  personally. This isn't the Russian state doing this, this isn't their  ministry of information doing it, it's Putin. It's very personal.</p><p> Number two, you have to hit back at Putin with acts that affect him  personally. What does that include? Well, it includes anything that demeans  him in the eyes of his own people. What would that be? Well, OK, how about  increasing sanctions against Putin's inner circle? How about maneuvers with  the Ukrainian army in the Ukraine by NATO forces?</p><p> That would send a terrific signal to Russia that the United States won't  stand up for this. And if everything continues to fall apart in the Black  Sea, perhaps even the entry of the Black Sea with American naval forces  sometime in the future. Those are just a few things, active things that  need to be done to stop this.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah. We've had General Jack Keane on, he would agree with you.  He's also saying the media is not reporting that Trump is acting with a  spine of steel against Russia with sanctions and the like, that the  president has been tough on Russia.</p><p> Here's the thing, Russia just finished in the spring building this bridge  connecting it, Russia to Crimea, so it controls the Kerch Strait and also  the trade that's going on between the Black Sea and Azov Sea. I mean,  Russia is full on threatening Ukraine right now. Is there a threat of full- out war between Russian and Ukraine right now?</p><p> SCALES:  No.</p><p> MACDONALD:  No?</p><p> SCALES:  No, no, no. The Russian Black Sea fleet is a joke. It's -- what do  they have? They have seven surface vessels and six conventional submarines.  They have no naval power in the Black Sea. And if we were to float an  amphibious ready group into the Black Sea full of marines and surface  ships, it would embarrass Putin enormously because there is nothing he  could do about it.</p><p> No, this is not about war, this is about information warfare and the use of  the social media by a weak Russian military to face off against the United  States. After all, Liz, Russia's got, what, it's got a GDP of, what, Texas?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SCALES:  And yet in the eyes of the world, the Russians are portraying  themselves as a superpower equal to the United States --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, yeah.</p><p> SCALES:  It's time for us to stand up militarily and humiliate Putin where  he's weakest, and that's in the world of public opinion.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It's a great point, general. I think the entire market value of  Russia's stock market is equal to the market value of one company and that  would be Apple. General, we'd love to have you back on, and we want to  thank you for coming on the show. Thank you for your service to our  country, sir. You brought great insight there and perspective. Good to see  you.</p><p> SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up, we'll ask Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton all  about that funding fight happening now over the border wall. A government  shutdown looms over it. Attorney General Paxton has a better read on the  situation than just about anybody.</p><p> And we've got details on how the media botched the coverage of the tear gas  at the border. Under the Obama administration, tear gas was used at least  27 times, pepper spray at least 434 times at the border. That's according  to government data.</p><p> Plus, a new House hearing coming in a couple weeks on the Justice  Department probe into pay to play at the Clinton Foundation. New details  showing donations plummeting after Hillary lost. What took the Republicans  so long on this? All of that's coming up. Back in two. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  House Republican leaders sitting down with President Trump  today to talk government shutdown over the border wall. Let's take it up  with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Great to see you, sir.</p><p> KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Thanks for having me on.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Quickly, I want your take, first, on the use of tear gas at the  border. Under the Obama administration, tear gas was used at least 27  times, pepper spray used at least 434 times under Obama. That's according  to government data. What's your take on the media coverage of the tear gas  at the border as it relates to Obama's use of it?</p><p> PAXTON:  I'm not surprised that they are covering it now. It's a legitimate  use of tear gas to protect our border, and as long as they use it  appropriately, I don't have a problem with it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, let's get back to the border wall funding. What number will  President Trump be happy with? It's somewhere between $5 billion now and  $1.6 billion. That's the Senate's number.</p><p> PAXTON:  Yeah. And I don't know what his exact number is. I just know that  his goal is to get the job done to make sure that we have a border wall  that protects our country.</p><p> You know, even just starting off at the lower number, I think we're making  progress. Hopefully, it's somewhere between the low number and the top   number. In Texas, obviously, it's a huge issue for us and has been for  years.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know conservatives have been blocking the border wall  funding, saying DACA recipient -- citizenship is amnesty. Here's the other  thing, sir, let's get to the migrants making a big mistake. Even though  they're trying to seek asylum in the U.S., this migrants out of \"credible  fear,\" the migrants have to explain why they did not accept asylum in  Mexico if it's really about credible fear. Why didn't they apply for asylum  in Mexico?</p><p> PAXTON:  You know, you're asking a really good question that I don't think  I have the answer to other than that may not be the reason they're actually  seeking asylum. Obviously, if you have a credible fear and you are at risk  of being hurt in your own country, it would seem that you would take asylum  from any country that would offer it. So it is a good question, and I don't  think we actually know the answer.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. MSNBC host Chris Matthews saying most caravan migrants are  not eligible for asylum. Let's watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, MSNBC:  So, how do we regulate -- regulate, honestly,  in an American way, acceptance of asylum seekers? How do we develop a  profound, comprehensive immigration policy that we are proud of as  Americans to enforce? At some point, there's going to have to be  enforcement.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are people looking for jobs. That's not a basis  to seek political asylum --</p><p> MATTHEWS:  I know that.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's the law.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  That is a law, OK. And another MSNBC reporter, Mr. Paxton,  basically saying the same thing, you can't come here looking for jobs under  the asylum laws. Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Give us a profile of who is there mostly.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The majority of them are men.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MACDONALD:  They're men seeking jobs. We had to cut that sound bite.  Finally, liberal media getting up to date and that is the speed on the  asylum laws? Your take on that, sir.</p><p> PAXTON:  No, it's actually kind of nice to hear. That's the reality. Asylum  is for a very special class of people, people who are endangered in their  own countries who are being persecuted, not for people looking for better  economic opportunities. That process is the normal immigration process that  these people should be following. Obviously, many of them have heard about  this loophole, and they're taking advantage of it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All right. We're sorry we had to cut that second MSNBC sound  bite.</p><p> PAXTON:  No problem.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We're going to try to show it to you in full tomorrow night.  They were talking about the asylum laws covering -- not covering economic  reasons, meaning job seekers. Thank you Attorney General Ken Paxton. We  want to have you back on, sir. Great to see you.</p><p> PAXTON:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up, the details on the democrat ballot plan against  President Trump. Once Nancy Pelosi gavels in, that caucus vote coming  tomorrow.</p><p> Also, we're going to stay on the story of the tear gas use at the border  and how the media botched it. Again, dozens of times, tear gas used under  the Obama administration. Pepper spray, hundreds of times. That's a  government data.</p><p> We're also going to get into the Clinton pay to play probe at the Justice  Department. That hearing is coming up in the House. We got that story,  next. Stay there. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   A lot of Americans do not have the slightest idea who the Democrats really  are. They still think the Democrats are the ones with compassion and  tolerance and understanding. They still think the Democrats are the ones  that care about the little guy and the downtrodden.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, the Democrat caucus vote for House speaker is tomorrow.  Pelosi will likely be the winner. You can expect Pelosi then to go push  full on government entitlements like Medicare and ignore everything that  Trump asked for. Don't let Trump dominate the conversation. Ignore him.  Also try to impeach him.</p><p> Let's ask Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz on all of that. Your take on  that, Jason. Great to see you.</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS:  I think you're right on the policy  side. This vote is fascinating because what they should do is publicly  release how many people actually voted for her and then they've got to  inquire and figure out who those people are. She'll undoubtedly win the  majority but you have to have 218 votes on the floor of the House, not just  behind closed doors.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to that border fight over the use of tear gas. I'm  staying on this one. Because under the Obama administration, tear gas was  used at least 27 times. It was used 27 times in 2012 and 1016. Pepper spray  used 432 times during that time period. What's your take on the media  coverage of that?</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  I would pose the question to the Democrats saying what do you  propose? People are crashing our borders, they're throwing rocks, they're  waving the flags of the countries they came from. These are not the people  that are truly trying to seek asylum. They don't meet any of those  qualifications.</p><p> So if you're going to be overrun, the most humane thing to do is to use the  tear gas. And these people made a conscious decision as to whether or not  they were going to have this type of response from the United States. We're  not supposed to roll over that, but the media, so irresponsible to just  blame it and try to make Trump look like the bad guy that they want him to  be. He's not. He's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing, enforcing  the border.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And no hollering when the President Obama administration did  it. I want your take on the Clinton Foundation donation, nearly 63 million  suddenly plummeting to less than $27 million a year later in 2017. Mark  Meadows, chair of the Oversight Committee, he wants hearings on this.  What's taken Republicans to long to get a hearing on the pay to play  allegations at the Clinton Foundation? We got the U.S. attorney looking  into it at Justice Department.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  You need the Department of Justice to provide Mark Meadows and  the Oversight Committee, a committee I used to chair, they got to provide  him the documents. Where has been this investigation? Where are these  documents from the Department of Justice?</p><p> It's really hard to do a proper hearing without that document. And no  matter who is the president, it's really hard to get the deep state folks  there at the Department of Justice to cough up these documents.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Your quick take on the Clinton Foundation donations plummeting  after Hillary lost.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Come on, she is no longer going to be a viable political figure.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there was a lot of  pay to play there. They were trying to (INAUDIBLE) themselves to Hillary  Clinton, and now she is a book author and not much else to do.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Jason Chaffetz, we love having you on. Sir, come back soon.</p><p> CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, it was a jam-packed hour. Thank you so much for watching.  Thank you for having us in your homes. We've got \"LOU DOBBS\" next right  here on the Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It goes from bad to worse at Facebook.</p><p>We dig in to the stunning new allegations out of the U.K. based on Facebook e-mails the U.K. had seized. That Facebook was warned about Russians trolling through Facebook, harvesting your information much earlier than realized starting way back in 2014. Up to three billion data points a day.</p><p>This as U.S. senators here in this country warn Facebook may have broken the law. We explain.</p><p>Also coming up, Google now under fire by seven countries in Europe who now say Google is still secretly tracking you even after you turn it off.

New details showing donations plummeting after Hillary lost the election. Republicans say that's proof that the Clintons engaged in pay to play.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us, thank you for watching. Money, politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now.</p><p>Welcome to the show. You're watching the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Over 100 Google workers publishing an open letter today, slamming Google, demanding it stop building a censored search engine for China. It's designed to possibly blacklist words like human rights or student protests. Fear is that China will use that Google search engine to arrest its own citizens and commit even more human rights violations.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn has the details. Hillary?</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Liz. Well, these Google engineers really are teaming up to take on Google, trying to get them to shut down the development of this dragonfly search engine. The Googlers pending a public letter. The list of signatories has been growing throughout the day.</p><p>The letter calling out Google for putting what they call profits over their own company's values that are supposed to include basic human rights.</p><p>The letter writing, quote, \"Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for Google to deny other countries similar concessions, providing the Chinese government with ready access to user data as required by Chinese law would make Google complicit in oppression and human rights abuses.\"</p><p>This is not the first time Googlers have sounded off about this product. The letter says thousands internally at Google have protested the tools. Many of these people that signed on to this letter are engineers, and they say they should have a say how the tools that they are building are being used and by who is using them.</p><p>Dragonfly would ramp up surveillance of Chinese citizens, sparking concerns that the government would use Google's data to silence dissenters, censor unpopular points of view, these are concerns that -- or there are concerns that the data would also make Chinese citizens less safe.</p><p>So, Google's been dealing with a lot of backlash about this not internally but also publicly too. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, even vice President Mike pence calling for Google to stop the development of this product.</p><p>But each time Google has offered this same very statement that they wrote months ago, even though the letter today was published this morning, saying that their work on search in China is just exploratory, and they're not ready to launch anything soon, so we'll have to wait and see if Google decides to address publicly some of these concerns by their own employees.</p><p>But they're not the only tech company in the spotlight here. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg got shamed on Twitter after he failed to show up before lawmakers in the U.K. that were demanding answers over Russian activity on their platform after reports revealed that they could have been mining three billion bits of data from the site a day.</p><p>So, he didn't show up. Instead, he sent someone else. So, Britain's department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport tweeted a photo of an empty chair with a name placard for Zuckerberg writing, \"where is Mark Zuckerberg?\"</p><p>Facebook sent their V.P. of policy solutions Richard Allan to answer questions from lawmakers that then grilled him over this and also the disappear -- or the absence of Facebook's CEO.</p><p>Zuckerberg has faced scrutiny in the U.K. for not facing lawmakers there after he faced Congress here in the U.S. They, of course, have a lot of questions that are very similar to a lot of the questions that lawmakers here on Capitol Hill had as well. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD: Hillary Vaughn, great reporting. Thank you so much. And more trouble for Google.</p><p>VAUGHN: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Consumer groups and seven countries accusing Google of secretly tracking users' locations even after they turn off Google's locations settings, also letting Google is secretly building detailed profiles of users without our consent.</p><p>And to the new Facebook bombshell we are just talking about. Zuckerberg and those Facebook e-mails seized by the U.K. parliament that Facebook was warned that Russians were trolling through our data, harvesting way back starting in 2014, earlier than realized.</p><p>Again, you heard it, three billion data points a day, that's what the U.K. is saying.</p><p>Let's bring in Republican Florida Congressman Francis Rooney. Great to see you, sir.</p><p>REP. FRANCIS ROONEY, (R) FLORIDA: Thanks for having me on.</p><p>MACDONALD: What's your reaction to all of this?</p><p>ROONEY: Well, I think Facebook and Google are showing some of the abusive behavior that a dominant competitor can do, and I think we need to take seriously how we're going to deal with it.</p><p>I mean, this business of Google doing the things you just talked about, Facebook censoring conservative posts and sources, we can't allow them in a free society with a First Amendment to operate that way.</p><p>MACDONALD: Is there a growing consensus that Congress will try to regulate Facebook and social media? Because here we've got the U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar saying Facebook may have broken a law by hiring a P.R. from to smear critics. She's worried that Facebook may be illegally using its mountain of data against government officials scrutinizing it including on the intelligence committees. Is there a push in Congress now to regulate these guys?</p><p>ROONEY: Well, we'll see what the incoming Democrat majority in the House wants to do. I've been pushing for two years that we follow the Europeans' attitude of bringing antitrust actions against Facebook and Google for their abusive market share and that we hold them accountable for data breaches.</p><p>MACDONALD: Are you going to hold hearings on it?</p><p>ROONEY: I hope they do. I mean, I think the things you just talked about, about Google keeping that information and discreetly and clandestinely keeping it and then with Facebook admitting that they've censored conservative sources in violation of the First Amendment are serious problems for me.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, and, sir, also, U.K. politicians saying Facebook purposefully and knowingly set up a back door for companies like Cambridge Analytica to get in and take our information, also reading - reading our Facebook messages. We don't know who else is reading our Facebook messages, in effect saying, basically Facebook created, knowingly created a loophole and sold it. What do you think of that?</p><p>ROONEY: I think it's a total derogation of First Amendment and privacy rights, and we need to dig into it and address it. Just like this behavior in China. You know, Facebook wants to be protected by the power of the United States when they're threatened, but they're going to go in there and conspire with China?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's Google.</p><p>ROONEY: Google, yes. I mean.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: That's Google.</p><p>ROONEY: We're -- you know, Lenin used to say the capitalists will sell us the ropes we'll use to hang them with. It sounds like Google is doing that.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Congressman Rooney, you're terrific. Will you come back on the show? We're going to stay on the story. We are going to need congressman like you on it. Can you come back on in the future?</p><p>ROONEY: I love to do it anytime. Thank you very much.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, sir. Good to see you.</p><p>Now we've got to keep an eye on Amazon, too. The Wall Street Journal reporting Amazon is stepping into our health data. Amazon is planning to sell software to doctors and hospitals to mine our medical records all in an attempt for better patient service. But you know what happens there, we're always worried about that.</p><p>Joining me now, Republican strategist Ford O'Connell and Democrat strategist, Kevin Walling. Ford, you heard -- Ford and Kevin. First to you, Ford. You heard our conversation just now on all of this. What's your reaction to all of this, Ford?</p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, look, I think that big tech is like the Wild West. There are no rules and, essentially, collectively they wield more power than big brother. And with Democrats taking back the House and with folks like Elizabeth Warren running for president, there are going to be regulations, the only question is when. Even Apple's Tim Cook admits as much.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Kevin, here's the thing, these guys act very altruistic in public. They act like, you know, we're sorry, we're altruistic, but then we're going to get your permission, we're going to get your consent later after we push it, after we take your stuff. What's your reaction to all of this, Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN WALLING, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Sure, Liz. I'm so happy we're shining a light on this. And I couldn't agree with Ford more that it's the Wild West.</p><p>You know, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress last April. It's clear we need him back as soon as possible to answer some of these questions. If not, Congress you're also seeing a dip in terms of their stock value, down 20 percent.</p><p>So clearly, consumers are concerned about privacy issues, about regulatory issues regarding Facebook. So, if Congress doesn't get them to the table, hopefully consumers will push them to become better citizens when it comes to these issues.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, you know, Kevin makes an important point, Ford, because -- let me back up. Facebook also let Cambridge Analytica read our Facebook messages. We don't know who else is reading our messages. This is really bad. Will the market fix it, or should government fix it?</p><p>O'CONNELL: Well, I don't know that the market is going to fix it, and I think that you're also raising another question, Liz, and that's very simple. And that is that, basically, data privacy is seen in America among voters on a bipartisan scale on both size of the aisle like pre-existing conditions.</p><p>And when we look over to the E.A. and what they're doing with data privacy, I think that's going to be a guide going forward. But remember, President Trump is not very big on regulation, and he wants to avoid the headaches of a monstrous piece of legislation like Dodd-Frank and its unintended consequences.</p><p>I see something very narrowly tailored working towards data privacy, and if that doesn't work, then you may have more government regulation. The idea is to put some brakes on big tech but not to clamp them down. Because, remember, Liz, they're also a big part of driving our economy and our jobs.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's an important point too. That Silicon Valley is a big economic growth driver. Kevin, you know, the level of debate is so impoverished in this country, that's what critics have been saying. The fact that big tech has been censoring conservative thought and discussions on policy, on economic policy when way back in the day we saw Ted Kennedy - - I will always say that Ted Kennedy and Chuck Schumer voted for the tax cuts.</p><p>We don't see those debates happening on Facebook or Google's social media. I mean, what is going on here with these algorithms built by liberal Silicon Valley, they're basically censoring conservative debate? It is ruining debate and ruining this democracy, that's what the polls are showing.</p><p>WALLING: Liz, I couldn't agree with you more. Listen, I'm a die-hard Democrat, that's why I come on this show, because I really love how you host it and give a voice to both sides where we can have a debate, where we can move forward as a country. Because I think that's where the majority of Americans are.</p><p>And it really should give us pause if there is that kind of censorship going which is why I support bipartisan efforts. You mentioned Senator Klobuchar and Senator Kennedy from Louisiana that are pushing forward with that very thing in the United States Senate.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, this story is not going to go away. We're going to stay on it. Kevin and Ford, we're going to have you back on to debate it and talk about it. Thank you so much--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLING: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>O'CONNELL: Thank you, E-Mac.</p><p>MACDONALD: -- for your analysis and insights tonight. Good to see you, guys.</p><p>Now to the border and the latest on the caravan. Jeff Paul is there reporting live on the ground in Tijuana, Mexico. Jeff?</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Elizabeth. A press conference just wrapped up with some members of that migrant caravan just a few moments ago, and they put out a list of things they'd like to see moving forward.</p><p>The one -- the two that stick out to me, one, an end to unjust deportations, the other being that they want an acceleration of the process of applying for asylum into the United States.</p><p>Now we've spent some time today talking with all sorts of different migrants who are out here, and we're getting mixed reactions from both. Some feel what happened on Sunday, that clash with border patrol, only makes the whole group look bad while others who were part of that march and part of that demonstration say that they're going to stick it out, and they're hoping to still maybe one day get into the United States. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I'm going to cross the United States whatever it is with these crutches. These crutches will not stop me from crossing that fence illegally or legally. But I do not intend to cross illegally if I am hopeful that they will give me the papers. Because the first thing is to ask for political asylum in the United States to enter legally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL: Now, for the migrants out here, they can kind of play a couple different ways. One of the options is to stay here which has probably more than 5,000 people with overcrowding out into the street while they wait for a possible chance for asylum in the United States, but they are only accepting -- not processing -- a hundred applications a day, if that.</p><p>The other is to stay in Tijuana and possibly to try to get a work visa here. Or the third option is to head back to Central America which we are starting to see more people look into that, and we saw our first van head down there today with a few people who had just given up and saying they're going back home. Elizabeth?</p><p>MACDONALD: Jeff Paul in Tijuana, Mexico. Thank you so much for your reporting, sir. Great reporting there. Good to see you.</p><p>Later in the show we will bring on Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton who will join us to talk about the battle in D.C. over funding the border wall the president wants, and also the government data showing the Obama administration used tear gas and pepper spray numerous times at the border. The debate on the media cover coverage of that coming up.</p><p>Also, this and other headlines, new information coming out of that black box from that Lion Air jet that crashed off of Indonesia last month. It reveals the airplane's pilots heroically fought to regain control of the plane 24 times in a short 11-minute period.</p><p>The pilots were fighting anti-stall software made by Boeing. That software pushed the Boeing jets nose of the plane down about two dozen times. The pilots fought to bring it back up, and that plane crash killed 189 people. We're staying on that story for you.</p><p>And look at this stunning footage. A sand wall 100 meters high overtook China's Zhangye City. It's a crazy video. Sandstorms are common in China, but local areas say they've never seen anything like this or this big.</p><p>Plus, look at this life-size model of Noah's Ark. The architect, Johan Huibers, he wants to sell that boat, that Noah's Ark, basically, type vessel to Israel. He believes God's ship should be on God's land. We're staying on that story for you. Fun stuff there.</p><p>Coming up, the Russia/Ukraine crisis now escalating. We'll have more on this later in the show with retired general Robert Scales.</p><p>But first, President Trump firing back at G.M. for planning to close multiple factories. The president saying, G.M., you better shape up or face financial pain, you may lose your federal government subsidies. We're going to deal with that next. And debate on whether Trump is now putting a stop to crony capitalism once and for all. Stay with us.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. We're almost coming into the bottom of the hour. President Trump now threatening to cut all federal subsidies to General Motors including for G.M.'s electric cars after G.M. announced it will lay about, plans to lay off about 14,800 of its workers and shutter five factories in North America.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton has the latest. Deirdre?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Liz. So, if we take a look at what the president tweeted out earlier, we will see his frustration. We're going to show it on the screen. \"Very disappointed in G.M., very disappointed in the CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan, and Maryland.\"</p><p>So, it is unclear, you mentioned this cessation of benefits, but it's unclear just how much G.M. benefits from federal government subsidies. It is also, quite frankly, unclear how the administration could restrict credit.</p><p>But the tweet does escalate the president's public threats against G.M. as he pushes this company to keep the facilities open in Ohio in Michigan and Maryland. He has repeatedly pressured American companies, we remember Harley Davidson who considered shutting down facilities or moving operations overseas after he pledged on the campaign trail to revive U.S. manufacturing.</p><p>Now, G.M. did put out its own statement, we're going to put that on the screen as well so you can follow. I'll just read part of it. But G.M. is committed to maintaining a strong manufacturing presence in the U.S. as evidenced by our more than $22 billion worth of investment in U.S. operations since 2009.</p><p>The company also talks about adding technical and engineering jobs, saying it appreciates the support it has from this administration. But I think, Liz, it's worth pointing out that G.M. is no longer only competing with a traditional carmaker such as Ford.</p><p>The company is facing pressure from a lot of the Silicon Valley upstarts, from Tesla, from Uber, from Apple, from Google. All of those companies want to make self-driving cars, all of those companies want to make electric cars. And I guess the sum total, self-driving electric ones.</p><p>So, G.M. does have a lot of pressure, and Mary Barra, the CEO, saying these moves are made to reinvent the company and keep it alive.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great reporting, Deirdre. We love having you on. Come back soon.</p><p>Let's bring in an expert. Her name is Veronique de Rugy. She's brilliant, she's at the Mercatus Center, she's also a syndicated columnist. We -- Veronique de Rugy there. There you are. Veronique, we don't know what federal subsidies the White House is talking about. There's a plug-in tax credit that goes to consumers for electric cars, but I want to -- I want to have this conversation with you, Veronique.</p><p>We know that G.M. got, you know, billions, tens of billions of dollars in bailout money. Why can't these automakers retool their factories to build either small cars or big cars like trucks and SUVs?</p><p>VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY MERCATUS CENTER: Well, I mean, you know me, I'm against those bailouts that G.M. and other automakers got, and I think it's not the role of the government to interfere in the production lines or the behavior and whatever production decision companies are making.</p><p>And they should be -- and it's actually good practice, it seems to me that G.M. is actually doing the right thing which is looking at the market of your future in cars and saying this is what we need to do. And, obviously, they should be doing it without subsidies.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's the point. Because you can, you know, people can understand the president's frustration here. Let me back up. U.S. taxpayers lost $11 billion on the 2008 bailout of G.M., and you know what happened then was that oil prices spiked up, and nobody wanted G.M.'s big cars and trucks at that time.</p><p>Oil prices and gas prices go down, now people want the big cars, they can afford it. They don't want the littler cars. So why can't G.M. and the carmakers get a grip on where gas prices are going? I think the president is frustrated because he knows that carmakers can come with their tin cups to federal taxpayers and get bailouts. He doesn't want it anymore.</p><p>DE RUGY: Well, I mean, government intervention into private businesses create massive distortions. It's bad for everyone, and consumers and taxpayers obviously, but it's also never quite great for the companies getting them because it actually push them -- pushes them into behaviors that are actually not necessarily efficient, and they're just out to seek - - to seek subsidies.</p><p>That being said, I would welcome the president cutting all subsidies to all companies, but I don't think this is what he is trying to do right now. He's frustrated, and he's using the threat of removing subsidies for this particular company as a threat against it.</p><p>And I think that has really just not proper for a president to do this.</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear -- no, I hear what you're saying, and let's do the back story here. We know that the bailout of the carmakers is often a bailout of the unions. We understand that.</p><p>DE RUGY: Yes, of course.</p><p>MACDONALD: We get that. And we know that these, you know, carmakers operate in important swing states for elections.</p><p>DE RUGY: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's the back story too. The question is, are the carmakers getting too lazy in fixing their own operations because they know they can come to the federal taxpayer? In other words, build factories you can immediately retool to build the cars that are in accordance--</p><p>DE RUGY: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: -- with gas prices going up or down.</p><p>DE RUGY: I completely agree with you. And the problem is a lot of these subsidies actually lead to what we call mal investment.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right, that's it.</p><p>DE RUGY: basically, you spend a lot of time going after subsidies and investing money because you want the subsidies as opposed to actually really thinking about what's best for your company.</p><p>And it does seem though -- and, obviously, the bailout was part of this, I'm sorry. It is not the role of a government at the federal level or at the state level to go and bail out companies if they're not selling products that consumers want to buy. They shouldn't be bailed out.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>DE RUGY: They should go under, and, or they should revamp their model, you know? They will have a dry patch or whatever, but this practice is not productive, it doesn't lead to an auto sector that is actually productive--</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>DE RUGY: -- and competitive.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>DE RUGY: And that is one of the problems.</p><p>MACDONALD: Veronique, you're great. All of a sudden G.M. says it can move workers that are going to be lay off to other factories. I don't understand how Mercedes can suddenly retool it existing car plants to make electric vehicles. If they can do it, well, why can't the other carmakers? Veronique, you're great. Great to see you. Come back soon, we love having you on.</p><p>DE RUGY: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up, we've got details on how the media botched the coverage of the tear gas used at the border. They didn't cover its use under the Obama administration. We've got the numbers coming up.</p><p>Plus, a new House hearing is expected in a couple of weeks on the Justice Department's probe into pay to play at the Clinton Foundation after new data shows donations there are plummeting after Hillary lost.</p><p>And the CDC now confirming 116 cases of polio-like paralysis in the United States. More on that with Doc Siegel coming up next. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. A mysterious polio-like disease that causes paralysis is now spreading to 31 states, sickening at least 116 children. With me now is Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel. Doctor, flu- like symptoms, what is causing this disease and how can you stop it?</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: I think it's a virus, and CDC thinks it's a virus, but it may be more than one strain of a virus called an enterovirus which is -- polio is an enterovirus, but it's not polio. It's a different kind of enterovirus, not polio. Polio-like.</p><p>Now, how could it be a virus and not spread from you to me? Let me tell you how. It's a very common virus, but it only causes this problem a very small amount of the time.</p><p>MACDONALD: How do you get it?</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, it goes around like wildfire --</p><p>MACDONALD: How would I get it?</p><p>SIEGEL: You'll get this virus just by sneezing, coughing, touching things. There are thousands and thousands of cases around the United States of the virus. But then this complication, again, only 117 cases and probably total almost 300 cases by the time --</p><p>MACDONALD: A lot of children are getting it.</p><p>SIEGEL: That's right. So 90 percent of the time, it's under the age of 18. The average age is four years old.</p><p>MACDONALD: How terrifying.</p><p>SIEGEL: I can't make light of something that affects 200 --</p><p>MACDONALD: No, we're not making light. Is there a vaccine for this? I mean, how do you stop it?</p><p>SIEGEL: Great question, Liz. If we knew which strain of enterovirus it was, we could do a vaccine. They have a vaccine, EV-68, which is one of the possible causes. But it's like the breadcrumbs. You see the breadcrumbs, you see the trail, but you're not exactly able to prove it. By the time they find this condition, evidence of the virus is already gone. So they can't prove it, so they don't want to --</p><p>MACDONALD: Understood. OK. Because Colorado is getting hit hard and Texas is getting hit hard, and there's been more than three and a half times the number of cases this year as last year, I mean, so, what would you advise parents out there to do?</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, I always want to decrease the fear quotient. I want to tell parents it's not contagious. I want to tell parents it's still one in a million cases --</p><p>MACDONALD: But we still don't know how you get it.</p><p>SIEGEL: No, we do know how you get it. You get it because you had a respiratory virus. So if your kid is coughing and sneezing, a few days later, they suddenly end up weak, you should be on the lookout for that. So do you should look for signs of weakness following a respiratory infection --</p><p>MACDONALD: Like flu-like symptoms.</p><p>SIEGEL: Right. You get flu-like symptoms, you get muscle aches, you get respiratory congestion, you get fever and then, bam, you're weak, upper or lower body weakness. Very tragic but still rare.</p><p>MACDONALD: I want to switch to this report. This is astonishing. Sleep apnea devices that people wear at night to help them sleep, millions of people wear it. Well, apparently these devices, doctor, are secretly spying on people. Can you explain this one?</p><p>SIEGEL: This is really horrifying. First of all, I want to tell you that, as you say, millions have this condition, and I want to tell you it can lead to strokes, it can lead to heart attacks, it can lead to diabetes --</p><p>MACDONALD: So the device.</p><p>SIEGEL: This is a really scary disease. You have to wear the machines. They reverse it. They're really important. But guess what, the machine can see how long you've been wearing it. The machine has a way of seeing whether you have the device on or not.</p><p>It monitors the number of hours you have it on. And guess what's happening, insurers are looking to see whether you're wearing it or not. And if you're not wearing, they're cutting off the reimbursement --</p><p>MACDONALD: Wait, wait, wait. The device is transmitting the information to the device maker, the medical supplier and the insurer to see if you're wearing the device or not?</p><p>SIEGEL: Wirelessly.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow! So you're wearing it at night and you don't even know that this company, the insurer is looking at you to see if you're wearing it to cut up your coverage, is that the story?</p><p>SIEGEL: They're monitoring you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Even in your sleep.</p><p>SIEGAL: And what are they going to monitor next? Look at those brain waves. I mean, this is big brother. I think that -- my strong view is this goes too far. I'm OK with your doctor having this information, but I don't want your insurer having this. An invasion of the home. You can't even sleep anymore!</p><p>MACDONALD: I know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD: Good god. I mean, now -- I can't believe that they've gone that far. Can you believe that? I was shocked.</p><p>SIEGEL: I think they should be illegal. I don't think they should be able to cut off your coverage by saying you didn't wear the machine. The machines are extremely important medically.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>SIEGEL: They should be worn. Insurers, stay out of the bedroom.</p><p>MACDONALD: Oh, my god. No kidding.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD: And the government too. Thank you, Doc Siegel. Good to see you. Great stuff.</p><p>Coming up, will President Trump get his $5 billion for his border wall? Big, high-level meetings in Washington today. A government shutdown looms less than two weeks away possibly. We're on it.</p><p>But first, Russia and the Ukraine clashing at sea. The stakes are high. What will President Trump do? How will Russian President Vladimir Putin react? We're bringing in retired Army Major General Robert Scales. He joins me next. Stay there. Back in two.</p><p>MACDONALD: Tensions between Russia and the Ukraine reaching a boiling point. Three captured Ukrainian sailors forced to make statements on Russian state TV after Russian forces shot at and seized three Ukrainian naval ships over the weekend.</p><p>And this just in, breaking news, in an interview with The Washington Post, President Trump is now threatening to cancel his scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit coming up because of Russia's clash at sea with the Ukraine.</p><p>Let's take it up with retired Major General Robert Scales. He's a Fox News contributor. Great to see you, general.</p><p>ROBERT SCALES, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS: Hi, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: What's your take on all of this?</p><p>SCALES: Well, it's just Vladimir Putin being Vladimir Putin, Liz. Although it didn't make the news, it's important to understand this is the fourth provocation by Putin this year. One over Finnish airspace (ph), one in the Baltic states where sea maneuvers (ph) were suspended, and of course we have the gas attack in Great Britain.</p><p>So this is Vladimir Putin trying to poke at the west. He hates the west, he hates the United States in particular. You know, there's an old staying, Lenin once said if you probe with a bayonet and you hit steel, stop. If you probe with a bayonet and hit mush, continue. Frankly, all Vladimir Putin's hits since the invasion of Georgia in 2008 is mush.</p><p>It's time for the president to take -- to take action, to push back against Putin. Otherwise, his brash acts will continue for as long as he's in office, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, what will President Trump do? Because we know President Vladimir Putin is probably watching Trump's response closely.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD: So, what makes this risky for the U.S.? What do you think Trump should do?</p><p>SCALES: Several things. First of all, he's got to call out Putin personally. This isn't the Russian state doing this, this isn't their ministry of information doing it, it's Putin. It's very personal.</p><p>Number two, you have to hit back at Putin with acts that affect him personally. What does that include? Well, it includes anything that demeans him in the eyes of his own people. What would that be? Well, OK, how about increasing sanctions against Putin's inner circle? How about maneuvers with the Ukrainian army in the Ukraine by NATO forces?</p><p>That would send a terrific signal to Russia that the United States won't stand up for this. And if everything continues to fall apart in the Black Sea, perhaps even the entry of the Black Sea with American naval forces sometime in the future. Those are just a few things, active things that need to be done to stop this.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah. We've had General Jack Keane on, he would agree with you. He's also saying the media is not reporting that Trump is acting with a spine of steel against Russia with sanctions and the like, that the president has been tough on Russia.</p><p>Here's the thing, Russia just finished in the spring building this bridge connecting it, Russia to Crimea, so it controls the Kerch Strait and also the trade that's going on between the Black Sea and Azov Sea. I mean, Russia is full on threatening Ukraine right now. Is there a threat of full- out war between Russian and Ukraine right now?</p><p>SCALES: No.</p><p>MACDONALD: No?</p><p>SCALES: No, no, no. The Russian Black Sea fleet is a joke. It's -- what do they have? They have seven surface vessels and six conventional submarines. They have no naval power in the Black Sea. And if we were to float an amphibious ready group into the Black Sea full of marines and surface ships, it would embarrass Putin enormously because there is nothing he could do about it.</p><p>No, this is not about war, this is about information warfare and the use of the social media by a weak Russian military to face off against the United States. After all, Liz, Russia's got, what, it's got a GDP of, what, Texas?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SCALES: And yet in the eyes of the world, the Russians are portraying themselves as a superpower equal to the United States --</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, yeah.</p><p>SCALES: It's time for us to stand up militarily and humiliate Putin where he's weakest, and that's in the world of public opinion.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's a great point, general. I think the entire market value of Russia's stock market is equal to the market value of one company and that would be Apple. General, we'd love to have you back on, and we want to thank you for coming on the show. Thank you for your service to our country, sir. You brought great insight there and perspective. Good to see you.</p><p>SCALES: Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up, we'll ask Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton all about that funding fight happening now over the border wall. A government shutdown looms over it. Attorney General Paxton has a better read on the situation than just about anybody.</p><p>And we've got details on how the media botched the coverage of the tear gas at the border. Under the Obama administration, tear gas was used at least 27 times, pepper spray at least 434 times at the border. That's according to government data.</p><p>Plus, a new House hearing coming in a couple weeks on the Justice Department probe into pay to play at the Clinton Foundation. New details showing donations plummeting after Hillary lost. What took the Republicans so long on this? All of that's coming up. Back in two. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: House Republican leaders sitting down with President Trump today to talk government shutdown over the border wall. Let's take it up with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Great to see you, sir.</p><p>KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL: Thanks for having me on.</p><p>MACDONALD: Quickly, I want your take, first, on the use of tear gas at the border. Under the Obama administration, tear gas was used at least 27 times, pepper spray used at least 434 times under Obama. That's according to government data. What's your take on the media coverage of the tear gas at the border as it relates to Obama's use of it?</p><p>PAXTON: I'm not surprised that they are covering it now. It's a legitimate use of tear gas to protect our border, and as long as they use it appropriately, I don't have a problem with it.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, let's get back to the border wall funding. What number will President Trump be happy with? It's somewhere between $5 billion now and $1.6 billion. That's the Senate's number.</p><p>PAXTON: Yeah. And I don't know what his exact number is. I just know that his goal is to get the job done to make sure that we have a border wall that protects our country.</p><p>You know, even just starting off at the lower number, I think we're making progress. Hopefully, it's somewhere between the low number and the top number. In Texas, obviously, it's a huge issue for us and has been for years.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know conservatives have been blocking the border wall funding, saying DACA recipient -- citizenship is amnesty. Here's the other thing, sir, let's get to the migrants making a big mistake. Even though they're trying to seek asylum in the U.S., this migrants out of \"credible fear,\" the migrants have to explain why they did not accept asylum in Mexico if it's really about credible fear. Why didn't they apply for asylum in Mexico?</p><p>PAXTON: You know, you're asking a really good question that I don't think I have the answer to other than that may not be the reason they're actually seeking asylum. Obviously, if you have a credible fear and you are at risk of being hurt in your own country, it would seem that you would take asylum from any country that would offer it. So it is a good question, and I don't think we actually know the answer.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. MSNBC host Chris Matthews saying most caravan migrants are not eligible for asylum. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, MSNBC: So, how do we regulate -- regulate, honestly, in an American way, acceptance of asylum seekers? How do we develop a profound, comprehensive immigration policy that we are proud of as Americans to enforce? At some point, there's going to have to be enforcement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are people looking for jobs. That's not a basis to seek political asylum --</p><p>MATTHEWS: I know that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: That is a law, OK. And another MSNBC reporter, Mr. Paxton, basically saying the same thing, you can't come here looking for jobs under the asylum laws. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Give us a profile of who is there mostly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The majority of them are men.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: They're men seeking jobs. We had to cut that sound bite. Finally, liberal media getting up to date and that is the speed on the asylum laws? Your take on that, sir.</p><p>PAXTON: No, it's actually kind of nice to hear. That's the reality. Asylum is for a very special class of people, people who are endangered in their own countries who are being persecuted, not for people looking for better economic opportunities. That process is the normal immigration process that these people should be following. Obviously, many of them have heard about this loophole, and they're taking advantage of it.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. We're sorry we had to cut that second MSNBC sound bite.</p><p>PAXTON: No problem.</p><p>MACDONALD: We're going to try to show it to you in full tomorrow night. They were talking about the asylum laws covering -- not covering economic reasons, meaning job seekers. Thank you Attorney General Ken Paxton. We want to have you back on, sir. Great to see you.</p><p>PAXTON: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up, the details on the democrat ballot plan against President Trump. Once Nancy Pelosi gavels in, that caucus vote coming tomorrow.</p><p>Also, we're going to stay on the story of the tear gas use at the border and how the media botched it. Again, dozens of times, tear gas used under the Obama administration. Pepper spray, hundreds of times. That's a government data.</p><p>We're also going to get into the Clinton pay to play probe at the Justice Department. That hearing is coming up in the House. We got that story, next. Stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: A lot of Americans do not have the slightest idea who the Democrats really are. They still think the Democrats are the ones with compassion and tolerance and understanding. They still think the Democrats are the ones that care about the little guy and the downtrodden.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, the Democrat caucus vote for House speaker is tomorrow. Pelosi will likely be the winner. You can expect Pelosi then to go push full on government entitlements like Medicare and ignore everything that Trump asked for. Don't let Trump dominate the conversation. Ignore him. Also try to impeach him.</p><p>Let's ask Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz on all of that. Your take on that, Jason. Great to see you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS: I think you're right on the policy side. This vote is fascinating because what they should do is publicly release how many people actually voted for her and then they've got to inquire and figure out who those people are. She'll undoubtedly win the majority but you have to have 218 votes on the floor of the House, not just behind closed doors.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to that border fight over the use of tear gas. I'm staying on this one. Because under the Obama administration, tear gas was used at least 27 times. It was used 27 times in 2012 and 1016. Pepper spray used 432 times during that time period. What's your take on the media coverage of that?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I would pose the question to the Democrats saying what do you propose? People are crashing our borders, they're throwing rocks, they're waving the flags of the countries they came from. These are not the people that are truly trying to seek asylum. They don't meet any of those qualifications.</p><p>So if you're going to be overrun, the most humane thing to do is to use the tear gas. And these people made a conscious decision as to whether or not they were going to have this type of response from the United States. We're not supposed to roll over that, but the media, so irresponsible to just blame it and try to make Trump look like the bad guy that they want him to be. He's not. He's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing, enforcing the border.</p><p>MACDONALD: And no hollering when the President Obama administration did it. I want your take on the Clinton Foundation donation, nearly 63 million suddenly plummeting to less than $27 million a year later in 2017. Mark Meadows, chair of the Oversight Committee, he wants hearings on this. What's taken Republicans to long to get a hearing on the pay to play allegations at the Clinton Foundation? We got the U.S. attorney looking into it at Justice Department.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You need the Department of Justice to provide Mark Meadows and the Oversight Committee, a committee I used to chair, they got to provide him the documents.

It goes from bad to worse at Facebook. </p><p>We dig in to the stunning new allegations out of the U.K. based on Facebook  e-mails the U.K. had seized. That Facebook was warned about Russians  trolling through Facebook, harvesting your information much earlier than  realized starting way back in 2014. Up to three billion data points a day. </p><p>This as U.S. senators here in this country warn Facebook may have broken  the law. We explain. </p><p>Also coming up, Google now under fire by seven countries in Europe who now  say Google is still secretly tracking you even after you turn it off. And  that Google tricks you into giving it much more information about yourself  and your families, more than you realize all without your consent. </p><p>This as Google workers now demand Google must stop building a censored  search engine for China that that China can use to attract and arrest  citizens that commit human rights violations. Protests worldwide on that,  we're on it. </p><p>Also coming up to Capitol Hill, high-level meetings over the border wall  funding. Will President Trump get what he wants, and wat is that poison  pill that will cause Republican conservatives to defeat it? </p><p>Plus, details tonight on the new Republican push for results from that  Justice Department probe into the Clinton Foundation. New details showing  donations plummeting after Hillary lost the election. Republicans say  that's proof that the Clintons engaged in pay to play. </p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us, thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth  MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p>Welcome to the show. You're watching the Fox Business Network. </p><p>Over 100 Google workers publishing an open letter today, slamming Google,  demanding it stop building a censored search engine for China. It's  designed to possibly blacklist words like human rights or student protests.  Fear is that China will use that Google search engine to arrest its own  citizens and commit even more human rights violations. </p><p>Hillary Vaughn has the details. Hillary? </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Liz. Well, these Google  engineers really are teaming up to take on Google, trying to get them to  shut down the development of this dragonfly search engine. The Googlers  pending a public letter. The list of signatories has been growing  throughout the day. </p><p>The letter calling out Google for putting what they call profits over their  own company's values that are supposed to include basic human rights. </p><p>The letter writing, quote, \"Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous  precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for  Google to deny other countries similar concessions, providing the Chinese  government with ready access to user data as required by Chinese law would  make Google complicit in oppression and human rights abuses.\" </p><p>This is not the first time Googlers have sounded off about this product.  The letter says thousands internally at Google have protested the tools.  Many of these people that signed on to this letter are engineers, and they  say they should have a say how the tools that they are building are being  used and by who is using them. </p><p>Dragonfly would ramp up surveillance of Chinese citizens, sparking concerns  that the government would use Google's data to silence dissenters, censor  unpopular points of view, these are concerns that -- or there are concerns  that the data would also make Chinese citizens less safe.</p><p>So, Google's been dealing with a lot of backlash about this not internally  but also publicly too. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, even vice President Mike  pence calling for Google to stop the development of this product. </p><p>But each time Google has offered this same very statement that they wrote  months ago, even though the letter today was published this morning, saying  that their work on search in China is just exploratory, and they're not  ready to launch anything soon, so we'll have to wait and see if Google  decides to address publicly some of these concerns by their own employees.</p><p>But they're not the only tech company in the spotlight here. Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg got shamed on Twitter after he failed to show up before  lawmakers in the U.K. that were demanding answers over Russian activity on  their platform after reports revealed that they could have been mining  three billion bits of data from the site a day. </p><p>So, he didn't show up. Instead, he sent someone else. So, Britain's  department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport tweeted a photo of an empty  chair with a name placard for Zuckerberg writing, \"where is Mark  Zuckerberg?\" </p><p>Facebook sent their V.P. of policy solutions Richard Allan to answer  questions from lawmakers that then grilled him over this and also the  disappear -- or the absence of Facebook's CEO.</p><p>Zuckerberg has faced scrutiny in the U.K. for not facing lawmakers there  after he faced Congress here in the U.S. They, of course, have a lot of  questions that are very similar to a lot of the questions that lawmakers  here on Capitol Hill had as well. Liz? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Hillary Vaughn, great reporting. Thank you so much. And more  trouble for Google.</p><p>VAUGHN:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Consumer groups and seven countries accusing Google of secretly  tracking users' locations even after they turn off Google's locations  settings, also letting Google is secretly building detailed profiles of  users without our consent. </p><p>And to the new Facebook bombshell we are just talking about. Zuckerberg and  those Facebook e-mails seized by the U.K. parliament that Facebook was  warned that Russians were trolling through our data, harvesting way back  starting in 2014, earlier than realized.</p><p>Again, you heard it, three billion data points a day, that's what the U.K.  is saying. </p><p>Let's bring in Republican Florida Congressman Francis Rooney. Great to see  you, sir. </p><p>REP. FRANCIS ROONEY, (R) FLORIDA:  Thanks for having me on. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What's your reaction to all of this? </p><p>ROONEY:  Well, I think Facebook and Google are showing some of the abusive  behavior that a dominant competitor can do, and I think we need to take  seriously how we're going to deal with it. </p><p>I mean, this business of Google doing the things you just talked about,  Facebook censoring conservative posts and sources, we can't allow them in a  free society with a First Amendment to operate that way. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Is there a growing consensus that Congress will try to regulate  Facebook and social media? Because here we've got the U.S. Senator Amy  Klobuchar saying Facebook may have broken a law by hiring a P.R. from to  smear critics. She's worried that Facebook may be illegally using its  mountain of data against government officials scrutinizing it including on  the intelligence committees. Is there a push in Congress now to regulate  these guys? </p><p>ROONEY:  Well, we'll see what the incoming Democrat majority in the House  wants to do. I've been pushing for two years that we follow the Europeans'  attitude of bringing antitrust actions against Facebook and Google for  their abusive market share and that we hold them accountable for data  breaches. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Are you going to hold hearings on it? </p><p>ROONEY:  I hope they do. I mean, I think the things you just talked about,  about Google keeping that information and discreetly and clandestinely  keeping it and then with Facebook admitting that they've censored  conservative sources in violation of the First Amendment are serious  problems for me. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, and, sir, also, U.K. politicians saying Facebook  purposefully and knowingly set up a back door for companies like Cambridge  Analytica to get in and take our information, also reading - reading our  Facebook messages. We don't know who else is reading our Facebook messages,  in effect saying, basically Facebook created, knowingly created a loophole  and sold it. What do you think of that? </p><p>ROONEY:  I think it's a total derogation of First Amendment and privacy  rights, and we need to dig into it and address it. Just like this behavior  in China. You know, Facebook wants to be protected by the power of the  United States when they're threatened, but they're going to go in there and  conspire with China? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's Google. </p><p>ROONEY:  Google, yes. I mean.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's Google. </p><p>ROONEY:  We're -- you know, Lenin used to say the capitalists will sell us  the ropes we'll use to hang them with. It sounds like Google is doing that. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Congressman Rooney, you're terrific. Will you come  back on the show? We're going to stay on the story. We are going to need  congressman like you on it. Can you come back on in the future? </p><p>ROONEY:  I love to do it anytime. Thank you very much. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, sir. Good to see you. </p><p>Now we've got to keep an eye on Amazon, too. The Wall Street Journal  reporting Amazon is stepping into our health data. Amazon is planning to  sell software to doctors and hospitals to mine our medical records all in  an attempt for better patient service. But you know what happens there,  we're always worried about that. </p><p>Joining me now, Republican strategist Ford O'Connell and Democrat  strategist, Kevin Walling. Ford, you heard -- Ford and Kevin. First to you,  Ford. You heard our conversation just now on all of this. What's your  reaction to all of this, Ford? </p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, look, I think that big tech  is like the Wild West. There are no rules and, essentially, collectively  they wield more power than big brother. And with Democrats taking back the  House and with folks like Elizabeth Warren running for president, there are  going to be regulations, the only question is when. Even Apple's Tim Cook  admits as much.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Kevin, here's the thing, these guys act very  altruistic in public. They act like, you know, we're sorry, we're  altruistic, but then we're going to get your permission, we're going to get  your consent later after we push it, after we take your stuff. What's your  reaction to all of this, Kevin? </p><p>KEVIN WALLING, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Sure, Liz. I'm so happy we're  shining a light on this. And I couldn't agree with Ford more that it's the  Wild West. </p><p>You know, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress last April. It's clear  we need him back as soon as possible to answer some of these questions. If  not, Congress you're also seeing a dip in terms of their stock value, down  20 percent. </p><p>So clearly, consumers are concerned about privacy issues, about regulatory  issues regarding Facebook. So, if Congress doesn't get them to the table,  hopefully consumers will push them to become better citizens when it comes  to these issues. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, you know, Kevin makes an important point, Ford, because --  let me back up. Facebook also let Cambridge Analytica read our Facebook  messages. We don't know who else is reading our messages. This is really  bad. Will the market fix it, or should government fix it? </p><p>O'CONNELL:  Well, I don't know that the market is going to fix it, and I  think that you're also raising another question, Liz, and that's very  simple. And that is that, basically, data privacy is seen in America among  voters on a bipartisan scale on both size of the aisle like pre-existing  conditions. </p><p>And when we look over to the E.A. and what they're doing with data privacy,  I think that's going to be a guide going forward. But remember, President  Trump is not very big on regulation, and he wants to avoid the headaches of  a monstrous piece of legislation like Dodd-Frank and its unintended  consequences. </p><p>I see something very narrowly tailored working towards data privacy, and if  that doesn't work, then you may have more government regulation. The idea  is to put some brakes on big tech but not to clamp them down. Because,  remember, Liz, they're also a big part of driving our economy and our jobs. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's an important point too. That Silicon Valley is a  big economic growth driver. Kevin, you know, the level of debate is so  impoverished in this country, that's what critics have been saying. The  fact that big tech has been censoring conservative thought and discussions  on policy, on economic policy when way back in the day we saw Ted Kennedy - - I will always say that Ted Kennedy and Chuck Schumer voted for the tax  cuts. </p><p>We don't see those debates happening on Facebook or Google's social media.  I mean, what is going on here with these algorithms built by liberal  Silicon Valley, they're basically censoring conservative debate? It is  ruining debate and ruining this democracy, that's what the polls are  showing. </p><p>WALLING:  Liz, I couldn't agree with you more. Listen, I'm a die-hard  Democrat, that's why I come on this show, because I really love how you  host it and give a voice to both sides where we can have a debate, where we  can move forward as a country. Because I think that's where the majority of  Americans are. </p><p>And it really should give us pause if there is that kind of censorship  going which is why I support bipartisan efforts. You mentioned Senator  Klobuchar and Senator Kennedy from Louisiana that are pushing forward with  that very thing in the United States Senate. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, this story is not going to go away. We're going to stay  on it. Kevin and Ford, we're going to have you back on to debate it and  talk about it. Thank you so much--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLING:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Thank you, E-Mac.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- for your analysis and insights tonight. Good to see you,  guys. </p><p>Now to the border and the latest on the caravan. Jeff Paul is there  reporting live on the ground in Tijuana, Mexico. Jeff? </p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Elizabeth. A press  conference just wrapped up with some members of that migrant caravan just a  few moments ago, and they put out a list of things they'd like to see  moving forward. </p><p>The one -- the two that stick out to me, one, an end to unjust  deportations, the other being that they want an acceleration of the process  of applying for asylum into the United States. </p><p>Now we've spent some time today talking with all sorts of different  migrants who are out here, and we're getting mixed reactions from both.  Some feel what happened on Sunday, that clash with border patrol, only  makes the whole group look bad while others who were part of that march and  part of that demonstration say that they're going to stick it out, and  they're hoping to still maybe one day get into the United States. Take a  listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I'm going to cross the United  States whatever it is with these crutches. These crutches will not stop me  from crossing that fence illegally or legally. But I do not intend to cross  illegally if I am hopeful that they will give me the papers. Because the  first thing is to ask for political asylum in the United States to enter  legally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PAUL:  Now, for the migrants out here, they can kind of play a couple  different ways. One of the options is to stay here which has probably more  than 5,000 people with overcrowding out into the street while they wait for  a possible chance for asylum in the United States, but they are only  accepting -- not processing -- a hundred applications a day, if that. </p><p>The other is to stay in Tijuana and possibly to try to get a work visa  here. Or the third option is to head back to Central America which we are  starting to see more people look into that, and we saw our first van head  down there today with a few people who had just given up and saying they're  going back home. Elizabeth? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jeff Paul in Tijuana, Mexico. Thank you so much for your  reporting, sir. Great reporting there. Good to see you. </p><p>Later in the show we will bring on Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton who  will join us to talk about the battle in D.C. over funding the border wall  the president wants, and also the government data showing the Obama  administration used tear gas and pepper spray numerous times at the border.  The debate on the media cover coverage of that coming up. </p><p>Also, this and other headlines, new information coming out of that black  box from that Lion Air jet that crashed off of Indonesia last month. It  reveals the airplane's pilots heroically fought to regain control of the  plane 24 times in a short 11-minute period. </p><p>The pilots were fighting anti-stall software made by Boeing. That software  pushed the Boeing jets nose of the plane down about two dozen times. The  pilots fought to bring it back up, and that plane crash killed 189 people.  We're staying on that story for you. </p><p>And look at this stunning footage. A sand wall 100 meters high overtook  China's Zhangye City. It's a crazy video. Sandstorms are common in China,  but local areas say they've never seen anything like this or this big. </p><p>Plus, look at this life-size model of Noah's Ark. The architect, Johan  Huibers, he wants to sell that boat, that Noah's Ark, basically, type  vessel to Israel. He believes God's ship should be on God's land. We're  staying on that story for you. Fun stuff there. </p><p>Coming up, the Russia/Ukraine crisis now escalating. We'll have more on  this later in the show with retired general Robert Scales. </p><p>But first, President Trump firing back at G.M. for planning to close  multiple factories. The president saying, G.M., you better shape up or face  financial pain, you may lose your federal government subsidies. We're going  to deal with that next. And debate on whether Trump is now putting a stop  to crony capitalism once and for all. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. We're almost coming into the bottom of the hour.  President Trump now threatening to cut all federal subsidies to General  Motors including for G.M.'s electric cars after G.M. announced it will lay  about, plans to lay off about 14,800 of its workers and shutter five  factories in North America. </p><p>Deirdre Bolton has the latest. Deirdre? </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Liz. So, if we take a look at  what the president tweeted out earlier, we will see his frustration. We're  going to show it on the screen. \"Very disappointed in G.M., very  disappointed in the CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan,  and Maryland.\"</p><p>So, it is unclear, you mentioned this cessation of benefits, but it's  unclear just how much G.M. benefits from federal government subsidies. It  is also, quite frankly, unclear how the administration could restrict  credit. </p><p>But the tweet does escalate the president's public threats against G.M. as  he pushes this company to keep the facilities open in Ohio in Michigan and  Maryland. He has repeatedly pressured American companies, we remember  Harley Davidson who considered shutting down facilities or moving  operations overseas after he pledged on the campaign trail to revive U.S.  manufacturing. </p><p>Now, G.M. did put out its own statement, we're going to put that on the  screen as well so you can follow. I'll just read part of it. But G.M. is  committed to maintaining a strong manufacturing presence in the U.S. as  evidenced by our more than $22 billion worth of investment in U.S.  operations since 2009. </p><p>The company also talks about adding technical and engineering jobs, saying  it appreciates the support it has from this administration. But I think,  Liz, it's worth pointing out that G.M. is no longer only competing with a  traditional carmaker such as Ford. </p><p>The company is facing pressure from a lot of the Silicon Valley upstarts,  from Tesla, from Uber, from Apple, from Google. All of those companies want  to make self-driving cars, all of those companies want to make electric  cars. And I guess the sum total, self-driving electric ones. </p><p>So, G.M. does have a lot of pressure, and Mary Barra, the CEO, saying these  moves are made to reinvent the company and keep it alive. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Great reporting, Deirdre. We love having you on. Come back  soon. </p><p>Let's bring in an expert. Her name is Veronique de Rugy. She's brilliant,  she's at the Mercatus Center, she's also a syndicated columnist. We --  Veronique de Rugy there. There you are. Veronique, we don't know what  federal subsidies the White House is talking about. There's a plug-in tax  credit that goes to consumers for electric cars, but I want to -- I want to  have this conversation with you, Veronique. </p><p>We know that G.M. got, you know, billions, tens of billions of dollars in  bailout money. Why can't these automakers retool their factories to build  either small cars or big cars like trucks and SUVs? </p><p>VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY MERCATUS  CENTER:  Well, I mean, you know me, I'm against those bailouts that G.M.  and other automakers got, and I think it's not the role of the government  to interfere in the production lines or the behavior and whatever  production decision companies are making. </p><p>And they should be -- and it's actually good practice, it seems to me that  G.M. is actually doing the right thing which is looking at the market of  your future in cars and saying this is what we need to do. And, obviously,  they should be doing it without subsidies. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's the point. Because you can, you know, people can  understand the president's frustration here. Let me back up. U.S. taxpayers  lost $11 billion on the 2008 bailout of G.M., and you know what happened  then was that oil prices spiked up, and nobody wanted G.M.'s big cars and  trucks at that time. </p><p>Oil prices and gas prices go down, now people want the big cars, they can  afford it. They don't want the littler cars. So why can't G.M. and the  carmakers get a grip on where gas prices are going? I think the president  is frustrated because he knows that carmakers can come with their tin cups  to federal taxpayers and get bailouts. He doesn't want it anymore. </p><p>DE RUGY:  Well, I mean, government intervention into private businesses  create massive distortions. It's bad for everyone, and consumers and  taxpayers obviously, but it's also never quite great for the companies  getting them because it actually push them -- pushes them into behaviors  that are actually not necessarily efficient, and they're just out to seek - - to seek subsidies. </p><p>That being said, I would welcome the president cutting all subsidies to all  companies, but I don't think this is what he is trying to do right now.  He's frustrated, and he's using the threat of removing subsidies for this  particular company as a threat against it. </p><p>And I think that has really just not proper for a president to do this. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear -- no, I hear what you're saying, and let's do the back  story here. We know that the bailout of the carmakers is often a bailout of  the unions. We understand that.</p><p>DE RUGY:  Yes, of course. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We get that. And we know that these, you know, carmakers  operate in important swing states for elections. </p><p>DE RUGY:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's the back story too. The question is, are the carmakers  getting too lazy in fixing their own operations because they know they can  come to the federal taxpayer? In other words, build factories you can  immediately retool to build the cars that are in accordance--</p><p>DE RUGY:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- with gas prices going up or down. </p><p>DE RUGY:  I completely agree with you. And the problem is a lot of these  subsidies actually lead to what we call mal investment. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, that's it. </p><p>DE RUGY:  basically, you spend a lot of time going after subsidies and  investing money because you want the subsidies as opposed to actually  really thinking about what's best for your company. </p><p>And it does seem though -- and, obviously, the bailout was part of this,  I'm sorry. It is not the role of a government at the federal level or at  the state level to go and bail out companies if they're not selling  products that consumers want to buy. They shouldn't be bailed out. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DE RUGY:  They should go under, and, or they should revamp their model, you  know? They will have a dry patch or whatever, but this practice is not  productive, it doesn't lead to an auto sector that is actually productive-- </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. </p><p>DE RUGY:  -- and competitive. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DE RUGY:  And that is one of the problems. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Veronique, you're great. All of a sudden G.M. says it can move  workers that are going to be lay off to other factories. I don't understand  how Mercedes can suddenly retool it existing car plants to make electric  vehicles. If they can do it, well, why can't the other carmakers?  Veronique, you're great. Great to see you. Come back soon, we love having  you on. </p><p>DE RUGY:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, we've got details on how the media botched the  coverage of the tear gas used at the border. They didn't cover its use  under the Obama administration. We've got the numbers coming up. </p><p>Plus, a new House hearing is expected in a couple of weeks on the Justice  Department's probe into pay to play at the Clinton Foundation after new  data shows donations there are plummeting after Hillary lost. </p><p>And the CDC now confirming 116 cases of polio-like paralysis in the United  States. More on that with Doc Siegel coming up next. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. A mysterious polio-like disease that causes  paralysis is now spreading to 31 states, sickening at least 116 children.  With me now is Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel. Doctor, flu- like symptoms, what is causing this disease and how can you stop it?</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  I think it's a virus, and  CDC thinks it's a virus, but it may be more than one strain of a virus  called an enterovirus which is -- polio is an enterovirus, but it's not  polio. It's a different kind of enterovirus, not polio. Polio-like.</p><p>Now, how could it be a virus and not spread from you to me? Let me tell you  how. It's a very common virus, but it only causes this problem a very small  amount of the time.</p><p>MACDONALD:  How do you get it?</p><p>SIEGEL:  Well, it goes around like wildfire --</p><p>MACDONALD:  How would I get it?</p><p>SIEGEL:  You'll get this virus just by sneezing, coughing, touching things.  There are thousands and thousands of cases around the United States of the  virus. But then this complication, again, only 117 cases and probably total  almost 300 cases by the time --</p><p>MACDONALD:  A lot of children are getting it.</p><p>SIEGEL:  That's right. So 90 percent of the time, it's under the age of 18.  The average age is four years old.</p><p>MACDONALD:  How terrifying.</p><p>SIEGEL:  I can't make light of something that affects 200 --</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, we're not making light. Is there a vaccine for this? I  mean, how do you stop it?</p><p>SIEGEL:  Great question, Liz. If we knew which strain of enterovirus it  was, we could do a vaccine. They have a vaccine, EV-68, which is one of the  possible causes. But it's like the breadcrumbs. You see the breadcrumbs,  you see the trail, but you're not exactly able to prove it. By the time  they find this condition, evidence of the virus is already gone. So they  can't prove it, so they don't want to --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Understood. OK. Because Colorado is getting hit hard and Texas  is getting hit hard, and there's been more than three and a half times the  number of cases this year as last year, I mean, so, what would you advise  parents out there to do?</p><p>SIEGEL:  Well, I always want to decrease the fear quotient. I want to tell  parents it's not contagious. I want to tell parents it's still one in a  million cases --</p><p>MACDONALD:  But we still don't know how you get it.</p><p>SIEGEL:  No, we do know how you get it. You get it because you had a  respiratory virus. So if your kid is coughing and sneezing, a few days  later, they suddenly end up weak, you should be on the lookout for that. So  do you should look for signs of weakness following a respiratory infection  --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Like flu-like symptoms.</p><p>SIEGEL:  Right. You get flu-like symptoms, you get muscle aches, you get   respiratory congestion, you get fever and then, bam, you're weak, upper or  lower body weakness. Very tragic but still rare.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I want to switch to this report. This is astonishing. Sleep  apnea devices that people wear at night to help them sleep, millions of  people wear it. Well, apparently these devices, doctor, are secretly spying  on people. Can you explain this one?</p><p>SIEGEL:  This is really horrifying. First of all, I want to tell you that,  as you say, millions have this condition, and I want to tell you it can  lead to strokes, it can lead to heart attacks, it can lead to diabetes --</p><p>MACDONALD:  So the device.</p><p>SIEGEL:  This is a really scary disease. You have to wear the machines.  They reverse it. They're really important. But guess what, the machine can  see how long you've been wearing it. The machine has a way of seeing  whether you have the device on or not.</p><p>It monitors the number of hours you have it on. And guess what's happening,  insurers are looking to see whether you're wearing it or not. And if you're  not wearing, they're cutting off the reimbursement --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wait, wait, wait. The device is transmitting the information to  the device maker, the medical supplier and the insurer to see if you're  wearing the device or not?</p><p>SIEGEL:  Wirelessly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow! So you're wearing it at night and you don't even know that  this company, the insurer is looking at you to see if you're wearing it to  cut up your coverage, is that the story?</p><p>SIEGEL:  They're monitoring you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Even in your sleep.</p><p>SIEGAL:  And what are they going to monitor next? Look at those brain  waves. I mean, this is big brother. I think that -- my strong view is this  goes too far. I'm OK with your doctor having this information, but I don't  want your insurer having this. An invasion of the home. You can't even  sleep anymore!</p><p>MACDONALD:  I know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good god. I mean, now -- I can't believe that they've gone that  far. Can you believe that? I was shocked.</p><p>SIEGEL:  I think they should be illegal. I don't think they should be able  to cut off your coverage by saying you didn't wear the machine. The  machines are extremely important medically.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>SIEGEL:  They should be worn. Insurers, stay out of the bedroom.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Oh, my god. No kidding.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And the government too. Thank you, Doc Siegel. Good to see you.  Great stuff.</p><p>Coming up, will President Trump get his $5 billion for his border wall?  Big, high-level meetings in Washington today. A government shutdown looms  less than two weeks away possibly. We're on it.</p><p>But first, Russia and the Ukraine clashing at sea. The stakes are high.  What will President Trump do? How will Russian President Vladimir Putin  react? We're bringing in retired Army Major General Robert Scales. He joins  me next. Stay there. Back in two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Tensions between Russia and the Ukraine reaching a boiling  point. Three captured Ukrainian sailors forced to make statements on  Russian state TV after Russian forces shot at and seized three Ukrainian  naval ships over the weekend.</p><p>And this just in, breaking news, in an interview with The Washington Post,  President Trump is now threatening to cancel his scheduled meeting with  Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit coming up because of  Russia's clash at sea with the Ukraine.</p><p>Let's take it up with retired Major General Robert Scales. He's a Fox News  contributor. Great to see you, general.</p><p>ROBERT SCALES, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS:  Hi, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What's your take on all of this?</p><p>SCALES:  Well, it's just Vladimir Putin being Vladimir Putin, Liz. Although  it didn't make the news, it's important to understand this is the fourth  provocation by Putin this year. One over Finnish airspace (ph), one in the  Baltic states where sea maneuvers (ph) were suspended, and of course we  have the gas attack in Great Britain.</p><p>So this is Vladimir Putin trying to poke at the west. He hates the west, he  hates the United States in particular. You know, there's an old staying,  Lenin once said if you probe with a bayonet and you hit steel, stop. If you  probe with a bayonet and hit mush, continue. Frankly, all Vladimir Putin's  hits since the invasion of Georgia in 2008 is mush.</p><p>It's time for the president to take -- to take action, to push back against  Putin. Otherwise, his brash acts will continue for as long as he's in  office, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, what will President Trump do? Because we know President  Vladimir Putin is probably watching Trump's response closely.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, what makes this risky for the U.S.? What do you think Trump  should do?</p><p>SCALES:  Several things. First of all, he's got to call out Putin  personally. This isn't the Russian state doing this, this isn't their  ministry of information doing it, it's Putin. It's very personal.</p><p>Number two, you have to hit back at Putin with acts that affect him  personally. What does that include? Well, it includes anything that demeans  him in the eyes of his own people. What would that be? Well, OK, how about  increasing sanctions against Putin's inner circle? How about maneuvers with  the Ukrainian army in the Ukraine by NATO forces?</p><p>That would send a terrific signal to Russia that the United States won't  stand up for this. And if everything continues to fall apart in the Black  Sea, perhaps even the entry of the Black Sea with American naval forces  sometime in the future. Those are just a few things, active things that  need to be done to stop this.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah. We've had General Jack Keane on, he would agree with you.  He's also saying the media is not reporting that Trump is acting with a  spine of steel against Russia with sanctions and the like, that the  president has been tough on Russia.</p><p>Here's the thing, Russia just finished in the spring building this bridge  connecting it, Russia to Crimea, so it controls the Kerch Strait and also  the trade that's going on between the Black Sea and Azov Sea. I mean,  Russia is full on threatening Ukraine right now. Is there a threat of full- out war between Russian and Ukraine right now?</p><p>SCALES:  No.</p><p>MACDONALD:  No?</p><p>SCALES:  No, no, no. The Russian Black Sea fleet is a joke. It's -- what do  they have? They have seven surface vessels and six conventional submarines.  They have no naval power in the Black Sea. And if we were to float an  amphibious ready group into the Black Sea full of marines and surface  ships, it would embarrass Putin enormously because there is nothing he  could do about it.</p><p>No, this is not about war, this is about information warfare and the use of  the social media by a weak Russian military to face off against the United  States. After all, Liz, Russia's got, what, it's got a GDP of, what, Texas?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SCALES:  And yet in the eyes of the world, the Russians are portraying  themselves as a superpower equal to the United States --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, yeah.</p><p>SCALES:  It's time for us to stand up militarily and humiliate Putin where  he's weakest, and that's in the world of public opinion.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's a great point, general. I think the entire market value of  Russia's stock market is equal to the market value of one company and that  would be Apple. General, we'd love to have you back on, and we want to  thank you for coming on the show. Thank you for your service to our  country, sir. You brought great insight there and perspective. Good to see  you.</p><p>SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, we'll ask Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton all  about that funding fight happening now over the border wall. A government  shutdown looms over it. Attorney General Paxton has a better read on the  situation than just about anybody.</p><p>And we've got details on how the media botched the coverage of the tear gas  at the border. Under the Obama administration, tear gas was used at least  27 times, pepper spray at least 434 times at the border. That's according  to government data.</p><p>Plus, a new House hearing coming in a couple weeks on the Justice  Department probe into pay to play at the Clinton Foundation. New details  showing donations plummeting after Hillary lost. What took the Republicans  so long on this? All of that's coming up. Back in two. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  House Republican leaders sitting down with President Trump  today to talk government shutdown over the border wall. Let's take it up  with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Great to see you, sir.</p><p>KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Thanks for having me on.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Quickly, I want your take, first, on the use of tear gas at the  border. Under the Obama administration, tear gas was used at least 27  times, pepper spray used at least 434 times under Obama. That's according  to government data. What's your take on the media coverage of the tear gas  at the border as it relates to Obama's use of it?</p><p>PAXTON:  I'm not surprised that they are covering it now. It's a legitimate  use of tear gas to protect our border, and as long as they use it  appropriately, I don't have a problem with it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, let's get back to the border wall funding. What number will  President Trump be happy with? It's somewhere between $5 billion now and  $1.6 billion. That's the Senate's number.</p><p>PAXTON:  Yeah. And I don't know what his exact number is. I just know that  his goal is to get the job done to make sure that we have a border wall  that protects our country.</p><p>You know, even just starting off at the lower number, I think we're making  progress. Hopefully, it's somewhere between the low number and the top   number. In Texas, obviously, it's a huge issue for us and has been for  years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know conservatives have been blocking the border wall  funding, saying DACA recipient -- citizenship is amnesty. Here's the other  thing, sir, let's get to the migrants making a big mistake. Even though  they're trying to seek asylum in the U.S., this migrants out of \"credible  fear,\" the migrants have to explain why they did not accept asylum in  Mexico if it's really about credible fear. Why didn't they apply for asylum  in Mexico?</p><p>PAXTON:  You know, you're asking a really good question that I don't think  I have the answer to other than that may not be the reason they're actually  seeking asylum. Obviously, if you have a credible fear and you are at risk  of being hurt in your own country, it would seem that you would take asylum  from any country that would offer it. So it is a good question, and I don't  think we actually know the answer.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. MSNBC host Chris Matthews saying most caravan migrants are  not eligible for asylum. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, MSNBC:  So, how do we regulate -- regulate, honestly,  in an American way, acceptance of asylum seekers? How do we develop a  profound, comprehensive immigration policy that we are proud of as  Americans to enforce? At some point, there's going to have to be  enforcement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are people looking for jobs. That's not a basis  to seek political asylum --</p><p>MATTHEWS:  I know that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  That is a law, OK. And another MSNBC reporter, Mr. Paxton,  basically saying the same thing, you can't come here looking for jobs under  the asylum laws. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Give us a profile of who is there mostly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The majority of them are men.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  They're men seeking jobs. We had to cut that sound bite.  Finally, liberal media getting up to date and that is the speed on the  asylum laws? Your take on that, sir.</p><p>PAXTON:  No, it's actually kind of nice to hear. That's the reality. Asylum  is for a very special class of people, people who are endangered in their  own countries who are being persecuted, not for people looking for better  economic opportunities. That process is the normal immigration process that  these people should be following. Obviously, many of them have heard about  this loophole, and they're taking advantage of it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. We're sorry we had to cut that second MSNBC sound  bite.</p><p>PAXTON:  No problem.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We're going to try to show it to you in full tomorrow night.  They were talking about the asylum laws covering -- not covering economic  reasons, meaning job seekers. Thank you Attorney General Ken Paxton. We  want to have you back on, sir. Great to see you.</p><p>PAXTON:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, the details on the democrat ballot plan against  President Trump. Once Nancy Pelosi gavels in, that caucus vote coming  tomorrow.</p><p>Also, we're going to stay on the story of the tear gas use at the border  and how the media botched it. Again, dozens of times, tear gas used under  the Obama administration. Pepper spray, hundreds of times. That's a  government data.</p><p>We're also going to get into the Clinton pay to play probe at the Justice  Department. That hearing is coming up in the House. We got that story,  next. Stay there. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   A lot of Americans do not have the slightest idea who the Democrats really  are. They still think the Democrats are the ones with compassion and  tolerance and understanding. They still think the Democrats are the ones  that care about the little guy and the downtrodden.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, the Democrat caucus vote for House speaker is tomorrow.  Pelosi will likely be the winner. You can expect Pelosi then to go push  full on government entitlements like Medicare and ignore everything that  Trump asked for. Don't let Trump dominate the conversation. Ignore him.  Also try to impeach him.</p><p>Let's ask Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz on all of that. Your take on  that, Jason. Great to see you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS:  I think you're right on the policy  side. This vote is fascinating because what they should do is publicly  release how many people actually voted for her and then they've got to  inquire and figure out who those people are. She'll undoubtedly win the  majority but you have to have 218 votes on the floor of the House, not just  behind closed doors.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to that border fight over the use of tear gas. I'm  staying on this one. Because under the Obama administration, tear gas was  used at least 27 times. It was used 27 times in 2012 and 1016. Pepper spray  used 432 times during that time period. What's your take on the media  coverage of that?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I would pose the question to the Democrats saying what do you  propose? People are crashing our borders, they're throwing rocks, they're  waving the flags of the countries they came from. These are not the people  that are truly trying to seek asylum. They don't meet any of those  qualifications.</p><p>So if you're going to be overrun, the most humane thing to do is to use the  tear gas. And these people made a conscious decision as to whether or not  they were going to have this type of response from the United States. We're  not supposed to roll over that, but the media, so irresponsible to just  blame it and try to make Trump look like the bad guy that they want him to  be. He's not. He's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing, enforcing  the border.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And no hollering when the President Obama administration did  it. I want your take on the Clinton Foundation donation, nearly 63 million  suddenly plummeting to less than $27 million a year later in 2017. Mark  Meadows, chair of the Oversight Committee, he wants hearings on this.  What's taken Republicans to long to get a hearing on the pay to play  allegations at the Clinton Foundation? We got the U.S. attorney looking  into it at Justice Department.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You need the Department of Justice to provide Mark Meadows and  the Oversight Committee, a committee I used to chair, they got to provide  him the documents. Where has been this investigation? Where are these  documents from the Department of Justice?</p><p>It's really hard to do a proper hearing without that document. And no  matter who is the president, it's really hard to get the deep state folks  there at the Department of Justice to cough up these documents.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Your quick take on the Clinton Foundation donations plummeting  after Hillary lost.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Come on, she is no longer going to be a viable political figure.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there was a lot of  pay to play there. They were trying to (INAUDIBLE) themselves to Hillary  Clinton, and now she is a book author and not much else to do.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jason Chaffetz, we love having you on. Sir, come back soon.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, it was a jam-packed hour. Thank you so much for watching.  Thank you for having us in your homes. We've got \"LOU DOBBS\" next right  here on the Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It goes from bad to worse at Facebook. </p><p>We dig in to the stunning new allegations out of the U.K. based on Facebook  e-mails the U.K. had seized. That Facebook was warned about Russians  trolling through Facebook, harvesting your information much earlier than  realized starting way back in 2014. Up to three billion data points a day. </p><p>This as U.S. senators here in this country warn Facebook may have broken  the law. We explain. </p><p>Also coming up, Google now under fire by seven countries in Europe who now  say Google is still secretly tracking you even after you turn it off. And  that Google tricks you into giving it much more information about yourself  and your families, more than you realize all without your consent. </p><p>This as Google workers now demand Google must stop building a censored  search engine for China that that China can use to attract and arrest  citizens that commit human rights violations. Protests worldwide on that,  we're on it. </p><p>Also coming up to Capitol Hill, high-level meetings over the border wall  funding. Will President Trump get what he wants, and wat is that poison  pill that will cause Republican conservatives to defeat it? </p><p>Plus, details tonight on the new Republican push for results from that  Justice Department probe into the Clinton Foundation. New details showing  donations plummeting after Hillary lost the election. Republicans say  that's proof that the Clintons engaged in pay to play. </p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us, thank you for watching. Money,  politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth  MacDonald. THE EVENING EDIT starts right now. </p><p>Welcome to the show. You're watching the Fox Business Network. </p><p>Over 100 Google workers publishing an open letter today, slamming Google,  demanding it stop building a censored search engine for China. It's  designed to possibly blacklist words like human rights or student protests.  Fear is that China will use that Google search engine to arrest its own  citizens and commit even more human rights violations. </p><p>Hillary Vaughn has the details. Hillary? </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Liz. Well, these Google  engineers really are teaming up to take on Google, trying to get them to  shut down the development of this dragonfly search engine. The Googlers  pending a public letter. The list of signatories has been growing  throughout the day. </p><p>The letter calling out Google for putting what they call profits over their  own company's values that are supposed to include basic human rights. </p><p>The letter writing, quote, \"Dragonfly in China would establish a dangerous  precedent at a volatile political moment, one that would make it harder for  Google to deny other countries similar concessions, providing the Chinese  government with ready access to user data as required by Chinese law would  make Google complicit in oppression and human rights abuses.\" </p><p>This is not the first time Googlers have sounded off about this product.  The letter says thousands internally at Google have protested the tools.  Many of these people that signed on to this letter are engineers, and they  say they should have a say how the tools that they are building are being  used and by who is using them. </p><p>Dragonfly would ramp up surveillance of Chinese citizens, sparking concerns  that the government would use Google's data to silence dissenters, censor  unpopular points of view, these are concerns that -- or there are concerns  that the data would also make Chinese citizens less safe.</p><p>So, Google's been dealing with a lot of backlash about this not internally  but also publicly too. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, even vice President Mike  pence calling for Google to stop the development of this product. </p><p>But each time Google has offered this same very statement that they wrote  months ago, even though the letter today was published this morning, saying  that their work on search in China is just exploratory, and they're not  ready to launch anything soon, so we'll have to wait and see if Google  decides to address publicly some of these concerns by their own employees.</p><p>But they're not the only tech company in the spotlight here. Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg got shamed on Twitter after he failed to show up before  lawmakers in the U.K. that were demanding answers over Russian activity on  their platform after reports revealed that they could have been mining  three billion bits of data from the site a day. </p><p>So, he didn't show up. Instead, he sent someone else. So, Britain's  department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport tweeted a photo of an empty  chair with a name placard for Zuckerberg writing, \"where is Mark  Zuckerberg?\" </p><p>Facebook sent their V.P. of policy solutions Richard Allan to answer  questions from lawmakers that then grilled him over this and also the  disappear -- or the absence of Facebook's CEO.</p><p>Zuckerberg has faced scrutiny in the U.K. for not facing lawmakers there  after he faced Congress here in the U.S. They, of course, have a lot of  questions that are very similar to a lot of the questions that lawmakers  here on Capitol Hill had as well. Liz? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Hillary Vaughn, great reporting. Thank you so much. And more  trouble for Google.</p><p>VAUGHN:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Consumer groups and seven countries accusing Google of secretly  tracking users' locations even after they turn off Google's locations  settings, also letting Google is secretly building detailed profiles of  users without our consent. </p><p>And to the new Facebook bombshell we are just talking about. Zuckerberg and  those Facebook e-mails seized by the U.K. parliament that Facebook was  warned that Russians were trolling through our data, harvesting way back  starting in 2014, earlier than realized.</p><p>Again, you heard it, three billion data points a day, that's what the U.K.  is saying. </p><p>Let's bring in Republican Florida Congressman Francis Rooney. Great to see  you, sir. </p><p>REP. FRANCIS ROONEY, (R) FLORIDA:  Thanks for having me on. </p><p>MACDONALD:  What's your reaction to all of this? </p><p>ROONEY:  Well, I think Facebook and Google are showing some of the abusive  behavior that a dominant competitor can do, and I think we need to take  seriously how we're going to deal with it. </p><p>I mean, this business of Google doing the things you just talked about,  Facebook censoring conservative posts and sources, we can't allow them in a  free society with a First Amendment to operate that way. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Is there a growing consensus that Congress will try to regulate  Facebook and social media? Because here we've got the U.S. Senator Amy  Klobuchar saying Facebook may have broken a law by hiring a P.R. from to  smear critics. She's worried that Facebook may be illegally using its  mountain of data against government officials scrutinizing it including on  the intelligence committees. Is there a push in Congress now to regulate  these guys? </p><p>ROONEY:  Well, we'll see what the incoming Democrat majority in the House  wants to do. I've been pushing for two years that we follow the Europeans'  attitude of bringing antitrust actions against Facebook and Google for  their abusive market share and that we hold them accountable for data  breaches. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Are you going to hold hearings on it? </p><p>ROONEY:  I hope they do. I mean, I think the things you just talked about,  about Google keeping that information and discreetly and clandestinely  keeping it and then with Facebook admitting that they've censored  conservative sources in violation of the First Amendment are serious  problems for me. </p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, and, sir, also, U.K. politicians saying Facebook  purposefully and knowingly set up a back door for companies like Cambridge  Analytica to get in and take our information, also reading - reading our  Facebook messages. We don't know who else is reading our Facebook messages,  in effect saying, basically Facebook created, knowingly created a loophole  and sold it. What do you think of that? </p><p>ROONEY:  I think it's a total derogation of First Amendment and privacy  rights, and we need to dig into it and address it. Just like this behavior  in China. You know, Facebook wants to be protected by the power of the  United States when they're threatened, but they're going to go in there and  conspire with China? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's Google. </p><p>ROONEY:  Google, yes. I mean.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's Google. </p><p>ROONEY:  We're -- you know, Lenin used to say the capitalists will sell us  the ropes we'll use to hang them with. It sounds like Google is doing that. </p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Congressman Rooney, you're terrific. Will you come  back on the show? We're going to stay on the story. We are going to need  congressman like you on it. Can you come back on in the future? </p><p>ROONEY:  I love to do it anytime. Thank you very much. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you, sir. Good to see you. </p><p>Now we've got to keep an eye on Amazon, too. The Wall Street Journal  reporting Amazon is stepping into our health data. Amazon is planning to  sell software to doctors and hospitals to mine our medical records all in  an attempt for better patient service. But you know what happens there,  we're always worried about that. </p><p>Joining me now, Republican strategist Ford O'Connell and Democrat  strategist, Kevin Walling. Ford, you heard -- Ford and Kevin. First to you,  Ford. You heard our conversation just now on all of this. What's your  reaction to all of this, Ford? </p><p>FORD O'CONNELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, look, I think that big tech  is like the Wild West. There are no rules and, essentially, collectively  they wield more power than big brother. And with Democrats taking back the  House and with folks like Elizabeth Warren running for president, there are  going to be regulations, the only question is when. Even Apple's Tim Cook  admits as much.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. Kevin, here's the thing, these guys act very  altruistic in public. They act like, you know, we're sorry, we're  altruistic, but then we're going to get your permission, we're going to get  your consent later after we push it, after we take your stuff. What's your  reaction to all of this, Kevin? </p><p>KEVIN WALLING, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Sure, Liz. I'm so happy we're  shining a light on this. And I couldn't agree with Ford more that it's the  Wild West. </p><p>You know, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress last April. It's clear  we need him back as soon as possible to answer some of these questions. If  not, Congress you're also seeing a dip in terms of their stock value, down  20 percent. </p><p>So clearly, consumers are concerned about privacy issues, about regulatory  issues regarding Facebook. So, if Congress doesn't get them to the table,  hopefully consumers will push them to become better citizens when it comes  to these issues. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, you know, Kevin makes an important point, Ford, because --  let me back up. Facebook also let Cambridge Analytica read our Facebook  messages. We don't know who else is reading our messages. This is really  bad. Will the market fix it, or should government fix it? </p><p>O'CONNELL:  Well, I don't know that the market is going to fix it, and I  think that you're also raising another question, Liz, and that's very  simple. And that is that, basically, data privacy is seen in America among  voters on a bipartisan scale on both size of the aisle like pre-existing  conditions. </p><p>And when we look over to the E.A. and what they're doing with data privacy,  I think that's going to be a guide going forward. But remember, President  Trump is not very big on regulation, and he wants to avoid the headaches of  a monstrous piece of legislation like Dodd-Frank and its unintended  consequences. </p><p>I see something very narrowly tailored working towards data privacy, and if  that doesn't work, then you may have more government regulation. The idea  is to put some brakes on big tech but not to clamp them down. Because,  remember, Liz, they're also a big part of driving our economy and our jobs. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's an important point too. That Silicon Valley is a  big economic growth driver. Kevin, you know, the level of debate is so  impoverished in this country, that's what critics have been saying. The  fact that big tech has been censoring conservative thought and discussions  on policy, on economic policy when way back in the day we saw Ted Kennedy - - I will always say that Ted Kennedy and Chuck Schumer voted for the tax  cuts. </p><p>We don't see those debates happening on Facebook or Google's social media.  I mean, what is going on here with these algorithms built by liberal  Silicon Valley, they're basically censoring conservative debate? It is  ruining debate and ruining this democracy, that's what the polls are  showing. </p><p>WALLING:  Liz, I couldn't agree with you more. Listen, I'm a die-hard  Democrat, that's why I come on this show, because I really love how you  host it and give a voice to both sides where we can have a debate, where we  can move forward as a country. Because I think that's where the majority of  Americans are. </p><p>And it really should give us pause if there is that kind of censorship  going which is why I support bipartisan efforts. You mentioned Senator  Klobuchar and Senator Kennedy from Louisiana that are pushing forward with  that very thing in the United States Senate. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, this story is not going to go away. We're going to stay  on it. Kevin and Ford, we're going to have you back on to debate it and  talk about it. Thank you so much--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WALLING:  Thanks, Liz.</p><p>O'CONNELL:  Thank you, E-Mac.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- for your analysis and insights tonight. Good to see you,  guys. </p><p>Now to the border and the latest on the caravan. Jeff Paul is there  reporting live on the ground in Tijuana, Mexico. Jeff? </p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Elizabeth. A press  conference just wrapped up with some members of that migrant caravan just a  few moments ago, and they put out a list of things they'd like to see  moving forward. </p><p>The one -- the two that stick out to me, one, an end to unjust  deportations, the other being that they want an acceleration of the process  of applying for asylum into the United States. </p><p>Now we've spent some time today talking with all sorts of different  migrants who are out here, and we're getting mixed reactions from both.  Some feel what happened on Sunday, that clash with border patrol, only  makes the whole group look bad while others who were part of that march and  part of that demonstration say that they're going to stick it out, and  they're hoping to still maybe one day get into the United States. Take a  listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I'm going to cross the United  States whatever it is with these crutches. These crutches will not stop me  from crossing that fence illegally or legally. But I do not intend to cross  illegally if I am hopeful that they will give me the papers. Because the  first thing is to ask for political asylum in the United States to enter  legally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PAUL:  Now, for the migrants out here, they can kind of play a couple  different ways. One of the options is to stay here which has probably more  than 5,000 people with overcrowding out into the street while they wait for  a possible chance for asylum in the United States, but they are only  accepting -- not processing -- a hundred applications a day, if that. </p><p>The other is to stay in Tijuana and possibly to try to get a work visa  here. Or the third option is to head back to Central America which we are  starting to see more people look into that, and we saw our first van head  down there today with a few people who had just given up and saying they're  going back home. Elizabeth? </p><p>MACDONALD:  Jeff Paul in Tijuana, Mexico. Thank you so much for your  reporting, sir. Great reporting there. Good to see you. </p><p>Later in the show we will bring on Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton who  will join us to talk about the battle in D.C. over funding the border wall  the president wants, and also the government data showing the Obama  administration used tear gas and pepper spray numerous times at the border.  The debate on the media cover coverage of that coming up. </p><p>Also, this and other headlines, new information coming out of that black  box from that Lion Air jet that crashed off of Indonesia last month. It  reveals the airplane's pilots heroically fought to regain control of the  plane 24 times in a short 11-minute period. </p><p>The pilots were fighting anti-stall software made by Boeing. That software  pushed the Boeing jets nose of the plane down about two dozen times. The  pilots fought to bring it back up, and that plane crash killed 189 people.  We're staying on that story for you. </p><p>And look at this stunning footage. A sand wall 100 meters high overtook  China's Zhangye City. It's a crazy video. Sandstorms are common in China,  but local areas say they've never seen anything like this or this big. </p><p>Plus, look at this life-size model of Noah's Ark. The architect, Johan  Huibers, he wants to sell that boat, that Noah's Ark, basically, type  vessel to Israel. He believes God's ship should be on God's land. We're  staying on that story for you. Fun stuff there. </p><p>Coming up, the Russia/Ukraine crisis now escalating. We'll have more on  this later in the show with retired general Robert Scales. </p><p>But first, President Trump firing back at G.M. for planning to close  multiple factories. The president saying, G.M., you better shape up or face  financial pain, you may lose your federal government subsidies. We're going  to deal with that next. And debate on whether Trump is now putting a stop  to crony capitalism once and for all. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. We're almost coming into the bottom of the hour.  President Trump now threatening to cut all federal subsidies to General  Motors including for G.M.'s electric cars after G.M. announced it will lay  about, plans to lay off about 14,800 of its workers and shutter five  factories in North America. </p><p>Deirdre Bolton has the latest. Deirdre? </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Liz. So, if we take a look at  what the president tweeted out earlier, we will see his frustration. We're  going to show it on the screen. \"Very disappointed in G.M., very  disappointed in the CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan,  and Maryland.\"</p><p>So, it is unclear, you mentioned this cessation of benefits, but it's  unclear just how much G.M. benefits from federal government subsidies. It  is also, quite frankly, unclear how the administration could restrict  credit. </p><p>But the tweet does escalate the president's public threats against G.M. as  he pushes this company to keep the facilities open in Ohio in Michigan and  Maryland. He has repeatedly pressured American companies, we remember  Harley Davidson who considered shutting down facilities or moving  operations overseas after he pledged on the campaign trail to revive U.S.  manufacturing. </p><p>Now, G.M. did put out its own statement, we're going to put that on the  screen as well so you can follow. I'll just read part of it. But G.M. is  committed to maintaining a strong manufacturing presence in the U.S. as  evidenced by our more than $22 billion worth of investment in U.S.  operations since 2009. </p><p>The company also talks about adding technical and engineering jobs, saying  it appreciates the support it has from this administration. But I think,  Liz, it's worth pointing out that G.M. is no longer only competing with a  traditional carmaker such as Ford. </p><p>The company is facing pressure from a lot of the Silicon Valley upstarts,  from Tesla, from Uber, from Apple, from Google. All of those companies want  to make self-driving cars, all of those companies want to make electric  cars. And I guess the sum total, self-driving electric ones. </p><p>So, G.M. does have a lot of pressure, and Mary Barra, the CEO, saying these  moves are made to reinvent the company and keep it alive. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Great reporting, Deirdre. We love having you on. Come back  soon. </p><p>Let's bring in an expert. Her name is Veronique de Rugy. She's brilliant,  she's at the Mercatus Center, she's also a syndicated columnist. We --  Veronique de Rugy there. There you are. Veronique, we don't know what  federal subsidies the White House is talking about. There's a plug-in tax  credit that goes to consumers for electric cars, but I want to -- I want to  have this conversation with you, Veronique. </p><p>We know that G.M. got, you know, billions, tens of billions of dollars in  bailout money. Why can't these automakers retool their factories to build  either small cars or big cars like trucks and SUVs? </p><p>VERONIQUE DE RUGY, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY MERCATUS  CENTER:  Well, I mean, you know me, I'm against those bailouts that G.M.  and other automakers got, and I think it's not the role of the government  to interfere in the production lines or the behavior and whatever  production decision companies are making. </p><p>And they should be -- and it's actually good practice, it seems to me that  G.M. is actually doing the right thing which is looking at the market of  your future in cars and saying this is what we need to do. And, obviously,  they should be doing it without subsidies. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's the point. Because you can, you know, people can  understand the president's frustration here. Let me back up. U.S. taxpayers  lost $11 billion on the 2008 bailout of G.M., and you know what happened  then was that oil prices spiked up, and nobody wanted G.M.'s big cars and  trucks at that time. </p><p>Oil prices and gas prices go down, now people want the big cars, they can  afford it. They don't want the littler cars. So why can't G.M. and the  carmakers get a grip on where gas prices are going? I think the president  is frustrated because he knows that carmakers can come with their tin cups  to federal taxpayers and get bailouts. He doesn't want it anymore. </p><p>DE RUGY:  Well, I mean, government intervention into private businesses  create massive distortions. It's bad for everyone, and consumers and  taxpayers obviously, but it's also never quite great for the companies  getting them because it actually push them -- pushes them into behaviors  that are actually not necessarily efficient, and they're just out to seek - - to seek subsidies. </p><p>That being said, I would welcome the president cutting all subsidies to all  companies, but I don't think this is what he is trying to do right now.  He's frustrated, and he's using the threat of removing subsidies for this  particular company as a threat against it. </p><p>And I think that has really just not proper for a president to do this. </p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear -- no, I hear what you're saying, and let's do the back  story here. We know that the bailout of the carmakers is often a bailout of  the unions. We understand that.</p><p>DE RUGY:  Yes, of course. </p><p>MACDONALD:  We get that. And we know that these, you know, carmakers  operate in important swing states for elections. </p><p>DE RUGY:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That's the back story too. The question is, are the carmakers  getting too lazy in fixing their own operations because they know they can  come to the federal taxpayer? In other words, build factories you can  immediately retool to build the cars that are in accordance--</p><p>DE RUGY:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  -- with gas prices going up or down. </p><p>DE RUGY:  I completely agree with you. And the problem is a lot of these  subsidies actually lead to what we call mal investment. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, that's it. </p><p>DE RUGY:  basically, you spend a lot of time going after subsidies and  investing money because you want the subsidies as opposed to actually  really thinking about what's best for your company. </p><p>And it does seem though -- and, obviously, the bailout was part of this,  I'm sorry. It is not the role of a government at the federal level or at  the state level to go and bail out companies if they're not selling  products that consumers want to buy. They shouldn't be bailed out. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DE RUGY:  They should go under, and, or they should revamp their model, you  know? They will have a dry patch or whatever, but this practice is not  productive, it doesn't lead to an auto sector that is actually productive-- </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. </p><p>DE RUGY:  -- and competitive. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>DE RUGY:  And that is one of the problems. </p><p>MACDONALD:  Veronique, you're great. All of a sudden G.M. says it can move  workers that are going to be lay off to other factories. I don't understand  how Mercedes can suddenly retool it existing car plants to make electric  vehicles. If they can do it, well, why can't the other carmakers?  Veronique, you're great. Great to see you. Come back soon, we love having  you on. </p><p>DE RUGY:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, we've got details on how the media botched the  coverage of the tear gas used at the border. They didn't cover its use  under the Obama administration. We've got the numbers coming up. </p><p>Plus, a new House hearing is expected in a couple of weeks on the Justice  Department's probe into pay to play at the Clinton Foundation after new  data shows donations there are plummeting after Hillary lost. </p><p>And the CDC now confirming 116 cases of polio-like paralysis in the United  States. More on that with Doc Siegel coming up next. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. A mysterious polio-like disease that causes  paralysis is now spreading to 31 states, sickening at least 116 children.  With me now is Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel. Doctor, flu- like symptoms, what is causing this disease and how can you stop it?</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS:  I think it's a virus, and  CDC thinks it's a virus, but it may be more than one strain of a virus  called an enterovirus which is -- polio is an enterovirus, but it's not  polio. It's a different kind of enterovirus, not polio. Polio-like.</p><p>Now, how could it be a virus and not spread from you to me? Let me tell you  how. It's a very common virus, but it only causes this problem a very small  amount of the time.</p><p>MACDONALD:  How do you get it?</p><p>SIEGEL:  Well, it goes around like wildfire --</p><p>MACDONALD:  How would I get it?</p><p>SIEGEL:  You'll get this virus just by sneezing, coughing, touching things.  There are thousands and thousands of cases around the United States of the  virus. But then this complication, again, only 117 cases and probably total  almost 300 cases by the time --</p><p>MACDONALD:  A lot of children are getting it.</p><p>SIEGEL:  That's right. So 90 percent of the time, it's under the age of 18.  The average age is four years old.</p><p>MACDONALD:  How terrifying.</p><p>SIEGEL:  I can't make light of something that affects 200 --</p><p>MACDONALD:  No, we're not making light. Is there a vaccine for this? I  mean, how do you stop it?</p><p>SIEGEL:  Great question, Liz. If we knew which strain of enterovirus it  was, we could do a vaccine. They have a vaccine, EV-68, which is one of the  possible causes. But it's like the breadcrumbs. You see the breadcrumbs,  you see the trail, but you're not exactly able to prove it. By the time  they find this condition, evidence of the virus is already gone. So they  can't prove it, so they don't want to --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Understood. OK. Because Colorado is getting hit hard and Texas  is getting hit hard, and there's been more than three and a half times the  number of cases this year as last year, I mean, so, what would you advise  parents out there to do?</p><p>SIEGEL:  Well, I always want to decrease the fear quotient. I want to tell  parents it's not contagious. I want to tell parents it's still one in a  million cases --</p><p>MACDONALD:  But we still don't know how you get it.</p><p>SIEGEL:  No, we do know how you get it. You get it because you had a  respiratory virus. So if your kid is coughing and sneezing, a few days  later, they suddenly end up weak, you should be on the lookout for that. So  do you should look for signs of weakness following a respiratory infection  --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Like flu-like symptoms.</p><p>SIEGEL:  Right. You get flu-like symptoms, you get muscle aches, you get   respiratory congestion, you get fever and then, bam, you're weak, upper or  lower body weakness. Very tragic but still rare.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I want to switch to this report. This is astonishing. Sleep  apnea devices that people wear at night to help them sleep, millions of  people wear it. Well, apparently these devices, doctor, are secretly spying  on people. Can you explain this one?</p><p>SIEGEL:  This is really horrifying. First of all, I want to tell you that,  as you say, millions have this condition, and I want to tell you it can  lead to strokes, it can lead to heart attacks, it can lead to diabetes --</p><p>MACDONALD:  So the device.</p><p>SIEGEL:  This is a really scary disease. You have to wear the machines.  They reverse it. They're really important. But guess what, the machine can  see how long you've been wearing it. The machine has a way of seeing  whether you have the device on or not.</p><p>It monitors the number of hours you have it on. And guess what's happening,  insurers are looking to see whether you're wearing it or not. And if you're  not wearing, they're cutting off the reimbursement --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wait, wait, wait. The device is transmitting the information to  the device maker, the medical supplier and the insurer to see if you're  wearing the device or not?</p><p>SIEGEL:  Wirelessly.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Wow! So you're wearing it at night and you don't even know that  this company, the insurer is looking at you to see if you're wearing it to  cut up your coverage, is that the story?</p><p>SIEGEL:  They're monitoring you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Even in your sleep.</p><p>SIEGAL:  And what are they going to monitor next? Look at those brain  waves. I mean, this is big brother. I think that -- my strong view is this  goes too far. I'm OK with your doctor having this information, but I don't  want your insurer having this. An invasion of the home. You can't even  sleep anymore!</p><p>MACDONALD:  I know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good god. I mean, now -- I can't believe that they've gone that  far. Can you believe that? I was shocked.</p><p>SIEGEL:  I think they should be illegal. I don't think they should be able  to cut off your coverage by saying you didn't wear the machine. The  machines are extremely important medically.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>SIEGEL:  They should be worn. Insurers, stay out of the bedroom.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Oh, my god. No kidding.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  And the government too. Thank you, Doc Siegel. Good to see you.  Great stuff.</p><p>Coming up, will President Trump get his $5 billion for his border wall?  Big, high-level meetings in Washington today. A government shutdown looms  less than two weeks away possibly. We're on it.</p><p>But first, Russia and the Ukraine clashing at sea. The stakes are high.  What will President Trump do? How will Russian President Vladimir Putin  react? We're bringing in retired Army Major General Robert Scales. He joins  me next. Stay there. Back in two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Tensions between Russia and the Ukraine reaching a boiling  point. Three captured Ukrainian sailors forced to make statements on  Russian state TV after Russian forces shot at and seized three Ukrainian  naval ships over the weekend.</p><p>And this just in, breaking news, in an interview with The Washington Post,  President Trump is now threatening to cancel his scheduled meeting with  Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit coming up because of  Russia's clash at sea with the Ukraine.</p><p>Let's take it up with retired Major General Robert Scales. He's a Fox News  contributor. Great to see you, general.</p><p>ROBERT SCALES, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS:  Hi, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What's your take on all of this?</p><p>SCALES:  Well, it's just Vladimir Putin being Vladimir Putin, Liz. Although  it didn't make the news, it's important to understand this is the fourth  provocation by Putin this year. One over Finnish airspace (ph), one in the  Baltic states where sea maneuvers (ph) were suspended, and of course we  have the gas attack in Great Britain.</p><p>So this is Vladimir Putin trying to poke at the west. He hates the west, he  hates the United States in particular. You know, there's an old staying,  Lenin once said if you probe with a bayonet and you hit steel, stop. If you  probe with a bayonet and hit mush, continue. Frankly, all Vladimir Putin's  hits since the invasion of Georgia in 2008 is mush.</p><p>It's time for the president to take -- to take action, to push back against  Putin. Otherwise, his brash acts will continue for as long as he's in  office, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, what will President Trump do? Because we know President  Vladimir Putin is probably watching Trump's response closely.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  So, what makes this risky for the U.S.? What do you think Trump  should do?</p><p>SCALES:  Several things. First of all, he's got to call out Putin  personally. This isn't the Russian state doing this, this isn't their  ministry of information doing it, it's Putin. It's very personal.</p><p>Number two, you have to hit back at Putin with acts that affect him  personally. What does that include? Well, it includes anything that demeans  him in the eyes of his own people. What would that be? Well, OK, how about  increasing sanctions against Putin's inner circle? How about maneuvers with  the Ukrainian army in the Ukraine by NATO forces?</p><p>That would send a terrific signal to Russia that the United States won't  stand up for this. And if everything continues to fall apart in the Black  Sea, perhaps even the entry of the Black Sea with American naval forces  sometime in the future. Those are just a few things, active things that  need to be done to stop this.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah. We've had General Jack Keane on, he would agree with you.  He's also saying the media is not reporting that Trump is acting with a  spine of steel against Russia with sanctions and the like, that the  president has been tough on Russia.</p><p>Here's the thing, Russia just finished in the spring building this bridge  connecting it, Russia to Crimea, so it controls the Kerch Strait and also  the trade that's going on between the Black Sea and Azov Sea. I mean,  Russia is full on threatening Ukraine right now. Is there a threat of full- out war between Russian and Ukraine right now?</p><p>SCALES:  No.</p><p>MACDONALD:  No?</p><p>SCALES:  No, no, no. The Russian Black Sea fleet is a joke. It's -- what do  they have? They have seven surface vessels and six conventional submarines.  They have no naval power in the Black Sea. And if we were to float an  amphibious ready group into the Black Sea full of marines and surface  ships, it would embarrass Putin enormously because there is nothing he  could do about it.</p><p>No, this is not about war, this is about information warfare and the use of  the social media by a weak Russian military to face off against the United  States. After all, Liz, Russia's got, what, it's got a GDP of, what, Texas?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SCALES:  And yet in the eyes of the world, the Russians are portraying  themselves as a superpower equal to the United States --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, yeah.</p><p>SCALES:  It's time for us to stand up militarily and humiliate Putin where  he's weakest, and that's in the world of public opinion.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's a great point, general. I think the entire market value of  Russia's stock market is equal to the market value of one company and that  would be Apple. General, we'd love to have you back on, and we want to  thank you for coming on the show. Thank you for your service to our  country, sir. You brought great insight there and perspective. Good to see  you.</p><p>SCALES:  Thank you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, we'll ask Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton all  about that funding fight happening now over the border wall. A government  shutdown looms over it. Attorney General Paxton has a better read on the  situation than just about anybody.</p><p>And we've got details on how the media botched the coverage of the tear gas  at the border. Under the Obama administration, tear gas was used at least  27 times, pepper spray at least 434 times at the border. That's according  to government data.</p><p>Plus, a new House hearing coming in a couple weeks on the Justice  Department probe into pay to play at the Clinton Foundation. New details  showing donations plummeting after Hillary lost. What took the Republicans  so long on this? All of that's coming up. Back in two. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  House Republican leaders sitting down with President Trump  today to talk government shutdown over the border wall. Let's take it up  with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Great to see you, sir.</p><p>KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Thanks for having me on.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Quickly, I want your take, first, on the use of tear gas at the  border. Under the Obama administration, tear gas was used at least 27  times, pepper spray used at least 434 times under Obama. That's according  to government data. What's your take on the media coverage of the tear gas  at the border as it relates to Obama's use of it?</p><p>PAXTON:  I'm not surprised that they are covering it now. It's a legitimate  use of tear gas to protect our border, and as long as they use it  appropriately, I don't have a problem with it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, let's get back to the border wall funding. What number will  President Trump be happy with? It's somewhere between $5 billion now and  $1.6 billion. That's the Senate's number.</p><p>PAXTON:  Yeah. And I don't know what his exact number is. I just know that  his goal is to get the job done to make sure that we have a border wall  that protects our country.</p><p>You know, even just starting off at the lower number, I think we're making  progress. Hopefully, it's somewhere between the low number and the top   number. In Texas, obviously, it's a huge issue for us and has been for  years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know conservatives have been blocking the border wall  funding, saying DACA recipient -- citizenship is amnesty. Here's the other  thing, sir, let's get to the migrants making a big mistake. Even though  they're trying to seek asylum in the U.S., this migrants out of \"credible  fear,\" the migrants have to explain why they did not accept asylum in  Mexico if it's really about credible fear. Why didn't they apply for asylum  in Mexico?</p><p>PAXTON:  You know, you're asking a really good question that I don't think  I have the answer to other than that may not be the reason they're actually  seeking asylum. Obviously, if you have a credible fear and you are at risk  of being hurt in your own country, it would seem that you would take asylum  from any country that would offer it. So it is a good question, and I don't  think we actually know the answer.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. MSNBC host Chris Matthews saying most caravan migrants are  not eligible for asylum. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, MSNBC:  So, how do we regulate -- regulate, honestly,  in an American way, acceptance of asylum seekers? How do we develop a  profound, comprehensive immigration policy that we are proud of as  Americans to enforce? At some point, there's going to have to be  enforcement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There are people looking for jobs. That's not a basis  to seek political asylum --</p><p>MATTHEWS:  I know that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  That is a law, OK. And another MSNBC reporter, Mr. Paxton,  basically saying the same thing, you can't come here looking for jobs under  the asylum laws. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Give us a profile of who is there mostly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The majority of them are men.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD:  They're men seeking jobs. We had to cut that sound bite.  Finally, liberal media getting up to date and that is the speed on the  asylum laws? Your take on that, sir.</p><p>PAXTON:  No, it's actually kind of nice to hear. That's the reality. Asylum  is for a very special class of people, people who are endangered in their  own countries who are being persecuted, not for people looking for better  economic opportunities. That process is the normal immigration process that  these people should be following. Obviously, many of them have heard about  this loophole, and they're taking advantage of it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All right. We're sorry we had to cut that second MSNBC sound  bite.</p><p>PAXTON:  No problem.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We're going to try to show it to you in full tomorrow night.  They were talking about the asylum laws covering -- not covering economic  reasons, meaning job seekers. Thank you Attorney General Ken Paxton. We  want to have you back on, sir. Great to see you.</p><p>PAXTON:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, the details on the democrat ballot plan against  President Trump. Once Nancy Pelosi gavels in, that caucus vote coming  tomorrow.</p><p>Also, we're going to stay on the story of the tear gas use at the border  and how the media botched it. Again, dozens of times, tear gas used under  the Obama administration. Pepper spray, hundreds of times. That's a  government data.</p><p>We're also going to get into the Clinton pay to play probe at the Justice  Department. That hearing is coming up in the House. We got that story,  next. Stay there. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   A lot of Americans do not have the slightest idea who the Democrats really  are. They still think the Democrats are the ones with compassion and  tolerance and understanding. They still think the Democrats are the ones  that care about the little guy and the downtrodden.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, the Democrat caucus vote for House speaker is tomorrow.  Pelosi will likely be the winner. You can expect Pelosi then to go push  full on government entitlements like Medicare and ignore everything that  Trump asked for. Don't let Trump dominate the conversation. Ignore him.  Also try to impeach him.</p><p>Let's ask Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz on all of that. Your take on  that, Jason. Great to see you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS:  I think you're right on the policy  side. This vote is fascinating because what they should do is publicly  release how many people actually voted for her and then they've got to  inquire and figure out who those people are. She'll undoubtedly win the  majority but you have to have 218 votes on the floor of the House, not just  behind closed doors.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to that border fight over the use of tear gas. I'm  staying on this one. Because under the Obama administration, tear gas was  used at least 27 times. It was used 27 times in 2012 and 1016. Pepper spray  used 432 times during that time period. What's your take on the media  coverage of that?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I would pose the question to the Democrats saying what do you  propose? People are crashing our borders, they're throwing rocks, they're  waving the flags of the countries they came from. These are not the people  that are truly trying to seek asylum. They don't meet any of those  qualifications.</p><p>So if you're going to be overrun, the most humane thing to do is to use the  tear gas. And these people made a conscious decision as to whether or not  they were going to have this type of response from the United States. We're  not supposed to roll over that, but the media, so irresponsible to just  blame it and try to make Trump look like the bad guy that they want him to  be. He's not. He's doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing, enforcing  the border.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And no hollering when the President Obama administration did  it. I want your take on the Clinton Foundation donation, nearly 63 million  suddenly plummeting to less than $27 million a year later in 2017. Mark  Meadows, chair of the Oversight Committee, he wants hearings on this.  What's taken Republicans to long to get a hearing on the pay to play  allegations at the Clinton Foundation? We got the U.S. attorney looking  into it at Justice Department.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  You need the Department of Justice to provide Mark Meadows and  the Oversight Committee, a committee I used to chair, they got to provide  him the documents. Where has been this investigation? Where are these  documents from the Department of Justice?</p><p>It's really hard to do a proper hearing without that document. And no  matter who is the president, it's really hard to get the deep state folks  there at the Department of Justice to cough up these documents.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Your quick take on the Clinton Foundation donations plummeting  after Hillary lost.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Come on, she is no longer going to be a viable political figure.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there was a lot of  pay to play there. They were trying to (INAUDIBLE) themselves to Hillary  Clinton, and now she is a book author and not much else to do.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Jason Chaffetz, we love having you on. Sir, come back soon.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, it was a jam-packed hour. Thank you so much for watching.  Thank you for having us in your homes. We've got \"LOU DOBBS\" next right  here on the Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg's call for tougher internet regulation drew skepticism from industry experts and lawmakers who noted the company's defensive posture after a series of high-profile privacy scandals and content regulation concerns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an op-ed published March 30, Zuckerberg said regulators must take \"a more active role\" in developing laws around four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability. The company is taking public input on its plan to launch a new oversight body to assist with content moderation. But several industry experts and lawmakers said the growing threat of increased regulation coming from outside Facebook likely influenced Zuckerberg's decision to make a public call to action, including his endorsement of European-style privacy regulations.</p><p>Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, which has a focus on technology, said Zuckerberg's op-ed was a good public relations move, but it does not address larger questions regarding Facebook's role in society. Munster agreed with Zuckerberg that government should set some \"guidelines\" around how Facebook and its tech peers operate, but he said it will be challenging to determine the appropriate level of regulation.</p><p>\"These are the trees, but I think the forest question is, is the world a better place with Facebook? Do we even need Facebook?\" Munster said in an interview.</p><p>Zuckerberg's comments March 30 mark the executive's strongest to date in support of government oversight of his company. Appearing before a U.S. congressional committee in April 2018, Zuckerberg signaled some support for stronger regulations on social media, but offered few specifics.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears beforea U.S. congressional committee in April 2018.Source: Associated Press \"My position is not that there should be no regulation,\" Zuckerberg said during a hearing in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees, adding, \"I think the real question, as the internet becomes more important in people's lives, is what is the right regulation?\"</p><p>In a separate hearing in September 2018, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said the company would work with Congress to reach \"the right regulation.\"</p><p>Harmful content</p><p>Zuckerberg in his recent op-ed said that Facebook has a \"responsibility to keep people safe,\" but the company's immense scale makes it difficult to adequately address all forms of harmful content, including \"terrorist propaganda\" and \"hate speech.\" In one such example, the social media giant came under fire last month after the livestream of a gunman killing dozens of worshipers at two New Zealand mosques was uploaded on the platform before circulating throughout the wider internet.</p><p>The tech executive shared a similar message in April 2018 when he told U.S. legislators that Facebook did not take a \"broad enough view\" of its responsibility to prevent the spread of harmful content on the platform. Zuckerberg at the time also noted that Facebook had upped its defenses against such abuses, including developing more advanced artificial intelligence techniques to detect and delete fake accounts and hiring more security reviewers.</p><p>Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has drafted several proposals for regulating big tech, responded to Zuckerberg's March 30 op-ed by urging Facebook to work with Congress on developing new policy. In an April 1 tweet, Warner said Facebook and its counterparts \"are going to need to be subject to a higher level of regulation in keeping with their enormous power.\"</p><p>Regarding election integrity, Zuckerberg said March 30 that Facebook has made \"significant changes\" around political advertisements, including requiring political ad buyers to provide names and locations. Still, \"we believe legislation should be updated to reflect the reality of the threats and set standards for the whole industry,\" including addressing ad targeting questions, Zuckerberg wrote.</p><p>Concerns about the role of Facebook's platforms in spreading misinformation campaigns during the 2016 U.S. presidential election have long dogged the company. COO Sandberg acknowledged during a September 2018 hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee that her firm was \"slow to spot\" the foreign-backed misinformation campaigns during the 2016 U.S. election season.</p><p>Privacy protections</p><p>Zuckerberg said the U.S. and other countries should adopt rules similar to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, a series of privacy laws that took effect in May of 2018. GDPR requires companies to obtain unambiguous affirmative consent from a user before collecting or processing the user's personal data, among other provisions.</p><p>\"By updating the rules for the internet, we can preserve what's best about it   the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things   while also protecting society from broader harms,\" Zuckerberg wrote.</p><p>Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University who has expertise in internet law and intellectual property, said Zuckerberg's endorsement of European-style regulation is not surprising given that Facebook has robust financial resources to shoulder such requirements. Such rules would be more burdensome to smaller companies, Goldman added.</p><p>\"[Facebook executives are] really tired of being yelled at for their decisions about content, so they just want somebody else, anyone else, even the government, to tell them what to do,\" Goldman said in an interview.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who chairs the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, responded to Zuckerberg's op-ed by saying more regulation of the company was long overdue. \"[Facebook] has shown it cannot regulate itself,\" Cicilline said in a March 30 tweet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-50911451</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTG-63F1-F19Y-C564-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"973\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delivered a speech about freedom of expression in Washington, D.C., last fall, there was also another agenda: to raise the alarm about the threat from Chinese tech companies and, more specifically, the popular video-sharing app TikTok.    Tucked into the speech was a line pointing to Facebook's rising rival: Mr. Zuckerberg told Georgetown students that TikTok doesn't share Facebook's commitment to freedom of expression, and represents a risk to American values and technological supremacy.    That was a message Mr. Zuckerberg hammered behind the scenes in meetings with officials and lawmakers during the October trip and a separate visit to Washington weeks earlier, according to people familiar with the matter.    In a private dinner at the White House in late October, Mr. Zuckerberg made the case to President Trump that the rise of Chinese internet companies threatens American business, and should be a bigger concern than reining in Facebook, some of the people said.    Mr. Zuckerberg discussed TikTok specifically in meetings with several senators, according to people familiar with the meetings. In late October, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) -- who met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September -- and Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) wrote a letter to intelligence officials demanding an inquiry into TikTok. The government began a national-security review of the company soon after, and by the spring, Mr. Trump began threatening to ban the app entirely. This month he signed an executive order demanding that TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., divest itself of its U.S. operations.    Few tech companies have as much to gain as Facebook from TikTok's travails, and the social-media giant has taken an active role in raising concerns about the popular app and its Chinese owners.    In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg's personal outreach and public statements about Chinese competition, Facebook has established an advocacy group, called American Edge, that has begun running ads extolling U.S. tech companies for their contributions to American economic might, national security and cultural influence. And Facebook overall in the first half of this year spent more on lobbying than any single company, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2018, by contrast, it ranked eighth among companies, the center's data show.    It couldn't be determined exactly what role Mr. Zuckerberg's comments have played in the government's handling of TikTok. A spokeswoman for Sen. Cotton said his office doesn't comment on the senator's meetings.    Asked about the dinner, a White House spokesman said the administration \"is committed to protecting the American people from all cyber related threats to critical infrastructure, public health and safety, and our economic and national security.\"    Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said Mr. Zuckerberg has no recollection of discussing TikTok at the dinner.    The CEO's comments in Washington about the Chinese app were tied into Facebook's campaign to blunt antitrust and regulatory threats by emphasizing Facebook's importance to U.S. tech pre-eminence, he said.    \"Our view on China has been clear: we must compete,\" Mr. Stone said in a written statement. \"As Chinese companies and influence have been growing so has the risk of a global internet based on their values, as opposed to ours.\"    In an employee meeting this month, Mr. Zuckerberg called the executive order against TikTok unwelcome, because the global harm of such a move could outweigh any short-term gain to Facebook. The remarks were earlier reported by Buzzfeed News.    TikTok has gained more than 100 million U.S. users and become the biggest threat to Facebook's dominance of social media, as the app's addictive blend of dance videos and goofs has made it a sensation among young people around the world. In the first quarter of 2020, TikTok became the most-ever downloaded app in a single quarter, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Facebook, by comparison, had 256 million monthly users in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of June.    \"TikTok has gone from being next-to-nothing to quite something in major Western markets in the last two years,\" said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM, a unit of WPP PLC.    While Facebook once acquired startups such as TikTok that it viewed as potential threats, scrutiny from antitrust authorities makes those deals more fraught for big tech companies, so they might look to other defensive measures instead, Mr. Wieser said. \"You might then in fact welcome more regulation or things that would limit the opportunities for upstarts,\" he said.    Facebook's Instagram unit this month launched its own video-sharing feature, called Reels, and is trying to poach TikTok creators by paying some users if they post videos exclusively to the new service.    TikTok's fate is up in the air. With the Trump administration's deadline looming, Microsoft Corp. has said it is negotiating to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, and at least two other groups are believed to be circling, involving Twitter Inc. and Oracle Corp.    It is possible that TikTok ends up with one of those companies, immediately making the buyer a formidable U.S. rival to Facebook.    Facebook's advocacy has angered people inside TikTok, according to people familiar with the matter. Last month, CEO Kevin Mayer publicly accused Facebook of trying to unfairly quash competition.    \"At TikTok, we welcome competition,\" he said in a blog post. \"But let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor -- namely Facebook -- disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.\"    Mr. Zuckerberg's arguments about TikTok show a reversal in his stance on China.    In 2010, he said he was planning to learn Mandarin, and made several well-publicized trips to China over the years as Facebook explored the possibility of getting back into the world's most populous country, where it has been banned since 2009.    Those moves made Mr. Zuckerberg popular among many in China, but public opinion there has turned against him because of his recent comments, including at a congressional hearing about competition in July in which he said it was \"well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from U.S. companies.\"    The Global Times, a publication linked to the Chinese Communist Party, this week said Mr. Zuckerberg was previously considered \"the people's son-in-law,\" but that his recent actions suggested that he was willing \"to set aside morality for profit.\"    In the October speech in Georgetown, Mr. Zuckerberg described TikTok as at odds with American values: \"On TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of protests are censored, even in the U.S. Is that the internet we want?\" Mr. Zuckerberg said in his speech.    Days later, Mr. Zuckerberg reiterated his concerns about China during the White House dinner with Mr. Trump, the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, who has been a backer of Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the conversation.    Mr. Zuckerberg's team also reached out to members of Congress who are tough on China, according to people familiar with the meetings. He asked them why TikTok should be allowed to operate in the U.S., when many American companies, including his own, can't operate in China.    In November, Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.), who also had met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September, said in a hearing that TikTok threatens the privacy of American children. \"For Facebook, the fear is lost social-media market share,\" he said. \"For the rest of us, the fear is somewhat different.\"    Kelli Ford, a spokeswoman for Sen. Hawley said the senator's concerns about TikTok predated the meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg. \"Facebook has recently been sounding the alarm about China-based tech as a PR tactic to boost its own reputation,\" she said.    Facebook declined to comment on Ms. Ford's remark.    --Deepa Seetharaman and Michael C. Bender contributed to this article.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delivered a speech about freedom of expression in Washington, D.C., last fall, there was also another agenda: to raise the alarm about the threat from Chinese tech companies and, more specifically, the popular video-sharing app TikTok.    Tucked into the speech was a line pointing to Facebook's rising rival: Mr. Zuckerberg told Georgetown students that TikTok doesn't share Facebook's commitment to freedom of expression, and represents a risk to American values and technological supremacy.    That was a message Mr. Zuckerberg hammered behind the scenes in meetings with officials and lawmakers during the October trip and a separate visit to Washington weeks earlier, according to people familiar with the matter.    In a private dinner at the White House in late October, Mr. Zuckerberg made the case to President Trump that the rise of Chinese internet companies threatens American business, and should be a bigger concern than reining in Facebook, some of the people said.    Mr. Zuckerberg discussed TikTok specifically in meetings with several senators, according to people familiar with the meetings. In late October, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) -- who met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September -- and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) wrote a letter to intelligence officials demanding an inquiry into TikTok. The government began a national-security review of the company soon after, and by the spring, Mr. Trump began threatening to ban the app entirely. This month he signed an executive order demanding that TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., divest itself of its U.S. operations.    Few tech companies have as much to gain as Facebook from TikTok's travails, and the social-media giant has taken an active role in raising concerns about the popular app and its Chinese owners.    In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg's personal outreach and public statements about Chinese competition, Facebook has established an advocacy group, called American Edge, that has begun running ads extolling U.S. tech companies for their contributions to American economic might, national security and cultural influence. And Facebook overall in the first half of this year spent more on lobbying than any single company, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2018, by contrast, it ranked eighth among companies, the center's data show.    It couldn't be determined exactly what role Mr. Zuckerberg's comments have played in the government's handling of TikTok. A spokeswoman for Sen. Cotton said his office doesn't comment on the senator's meetings.    Asked about the dinner, a White House spokesman said the administration \"is committed to protecting the American people from all cyber related threats to critical infrastructure, public health and safety, and our economic and national security.\"    Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said Mr. Zuckerberg has no recollection of discussing TikTok at the dinner.    The CEO's comments in Washington about the Chinese app were tied into Facebook's campaign to blunt antitrust and regulatory threats by emphasizing Facebook's importance to U.S. tech pre-eminence, he said.    \"Our view on China has been clear: we must compete,\" Mr. Stone said in a written statement. \"As Chinese companies and influence have been growing so has the risk of a global internet based on their values, as opposed to ours.\"    In an employee meeting this month, Mr. Zuckerberg called the executive order against TikTok unwelcome, because the global harm of such a move could outweigh any short-term gain to Facebook. The remarks were earlier reported by BuzzFeed News.    TikTok has gained more than 100 million U.S. users and become the biggest threat to Facebook's dominance of social media, as the app's blend of dance videos and goofs has made it a sensation among young people around the world. In the first quarter of 2020, TikTok became the most downloaded app in a single quarter, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Facebook, by comparison, had 256 million monthly users in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of June.    \"TikTok has gone from being next-to-nothing to quite something in major Western markets in the last two years,\" said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM, a unit of WPP PLC.    While Facebook once acquired startups such as TikTok that it viewed as potential threats, scrutiny from antitrust authorities makes those deals more fraught for big tech companies, so they might look to other defensive measures instead, Mr. Wieser said. \"You might then in fact welcome more regulation or things that would limit the opportunities for upstarts,\" he said.    Facebook's Instagram unit this month launched its own video-sharing feature, called Reels, and is trying to poach TikTok creators by paying some users if they post videos exclusively to the new service.    TikTok's fate is up in the air. With the Trump administration's deadline looming, Microsoft Corp. has said it is negotiating to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, and at least two other groups are believed to be circling, involving Twitter Inc. and Oracle Corp.    It is possible that TikTok ends up with one of those companies, immediately making the buyer a formidable U.S. rival to Facebook.    Facebook's advocacy has angered people inside TikTok, according to people familiar with the matter. Last month, CEO Kevin Mayer publicly accused Facebook of trying to unfairly quash competition.    \"At TikTok, we welcome competition,\" he said in a blog post. \"But let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor -- namely Facebook -- disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.\"    Mr. Zuckerberg's arguments about TikTok show a reversal in his stance on China.    In 2010, he said he was planning to learn Mandarin, and made several well-publicized trips to China over the years as Facebook explored the possibility of getting back into the world's most populous country, where it has been banned since 2009.    Those moves made Mr. Zuckerberg popular among many in China, but public opinion there has turned against him because of his recent comments, including at a congressional hearing about competition in July in which he said it was \"well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from U.S. companies.\"    The Global Times, a publication linked to the Chinese Communist Party, this week said Mr. Zuckerberg was previously considered \"the people's son-in-law,\" but that his recent actions suggested that he was willing \"to set aside morality for profit.\"    Mr. Zuckerberg saw TikTok's success coming. When its predecessor app in the U.S., Musical.ly, started becoming popular among American teens in 2017, Facebook considered acquiring it, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Instead, Bytedance bought Musical.ly, and later rebranded it as TikTok.    In the October speech in Georgetown, Mr. Zuckerberg described TikTok as at odds with American values: \"On TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of protests are censored, even in the U.S. Is that the internet we want?\" Mr. Zuckerberg said in his speech.    Days later, Mr. Zuckerberg reiterated his concerns about China during the White House dinner with Mr. Trump, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, who has been a backer of Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the conversation.    Mr. Zuckerberg's team also reached out to members of Congress who are tough on China, according to people familiar with the meetings. He asked them why TikTok should be allowed to operate in the U.S., when many American companies, including his own, can't operate in China.    In November, Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.), who also had met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September, said in a hearing that TikTok threatens the privacy of American children. \"For Facebook, the fear is lost social-media market share,\" he said. \"For the rest of us, the fear is somewhat different.\"    Kelli Ford, a spokeswoman for Sen. Hawley said the senator's concerns about TikTok predated the meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg. \"Facebook has recently been sounding the alarm about China-based tech as a PR tactic to boost its own reputation,\" she said.    Facebook declined to comment on Ms. Ford's remark.    --Deepa Seetharaman and Michael C. Bender contributed to this article.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delivered a speech about freedom of expression in Washington, D.C., last fall, there was also another agenda: to raise the alarm about the threat from Chinese tech companies and, more specifically, the popular video-sharing app TikTok.    Tucked into the speech was a line pointing to Facebook's rising rival: Mr. Zuckerberg told Georgetown students that TikTok doesn't share Facebook's commitment to freedom of expression, and represents a risk to American values and technological supremacy.    That was a message Mr. Zuckerberg hammered behind the scenes in meetings with officials and lawmakers during the October trip and a separate visit to Washington weeks earlier, according to people familiar with the matter.    In a private dinner at the White House in late October, Mr. Zuckerberg made the case to President Trump that the rise of Chinese internet companies threatens American business, and should be a bigger concern than reining in Facebook, some of the people said.    Mr. Zuckerberg discussed TikTok specifically in meetings with several senators, according to people familiar with the meetings. In late October, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) -- who met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September -- and Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) wrote a letter to intelligence officials demanding an inquiry into TikTok. The government began a national-security review of the company soon after, and by the spring, Mr. Trump began threatening to ban the app entirely. This month he signed an executive order demanding that TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., divest itself of its U.S. operations.    Few tech companies have as much to gain as Facebook from TikTok's travails, and the social-media giant has taken an active role in raising concerns about the popular app and its Chinese owners.    In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg's personal outreach and public statements about Chinese competition, Facebook has established an advocacy group, called American Edge, that has begun running ads extolling U.S. tech companies for their contributions to American economic might, national security and cultural influence. And Facebook overall in the first half of this year spent more on lobbying than any single company, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2018, by contrast, it ranked eighth among companies, the center's data show.    It couldn't be determined exactly what role Mr. Zuckerberg's comments have played in the government's handling of TikTok. A spokeswoman for Sen. Cotton said his office doesn't comment on the senator's meetings.    Asked about the dinner, a White House spokesman said the administration \"is committed to protecting the American people from all cyber related threats to critical infrastructure, public health and safety, and our economic and national security.\"    Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said Mr. Zuckerberg has no recollection of discussing TikTok at the dinner.    The CEO's comments in Washington about the Chinese app were tied into Facebook's campaign to blunt antitrust and regulatory threats by emphasizing Facebook's importance to U.S. tech pre-eminence, he said.    \"Our view on China has been clear: we must compete,\" Mr. Stone said in a written statement. \"As Chinese companies and influence have been growing so has the risk of a global internet based on their values, as opposed to ours.\"    In an employee meeting this month, Mr. Zuckerberg called the executive order against TikTok unwelcome, because the global harm of such a move could outweigh any short-term gain to Facebook. The remarks were earlier reported by Buzzfeed News.    TikTok has gained more than 100 million U.S. users and become the biggest threat to Facebook's dominance of social media, as the app's addictive blend of dance videos and goofs has made it a sensation among young people around the world. In the first quarter of 2020, TikTok became the most-ever downloaded app in a single quarter, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Facebook, by comparison, had 256 million monthly users in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of June.    \"TikTok has gone from being next-to-nothing to quite something in major Western markets in the last two years,\" said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM, a unit of WPP PLC.    While Facebook once acquired startups such as TikTok that it viewed as potential threats, scrutiny from antitrust authorities makes those deals more fraught for big tech companies, so they might look to other defensive measures instead, Mr. Wieser said. \"You might then in fact welcome more regulation or things that would limit the opportunities for upstarts,\" he said.    Facebook's Instagram unit this month launched its own video-sharing feature, called Reels, and is trying to poach TikTok creators by paying some users if they post videos exclusively to the new service.    TikTok's fate is up in the air. With the Trump administration's deadline looming, Microsoft Corp. has said it is negotiating to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, and at least two other groups are believed to be circling, involving Twitter Inc. and Oracle Corp.    It is possible that TikTok ends up with one of those companies, immediately making the buyer a formidable U.S. rival to Facebook.    Facebook's advocacy has angered people inside TikTok, according to people familiar with the matter. Last month, CEO Kevin Mayer publicly accused Facebook of trying to unfairly quash competition.    \"At TikTok, we welcome competition,\" he said in a blog post. \"But let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor -- namely Facebook -- disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.\"    Mr. Zuckerberg's arguments about TikTok show a reversal in his stance on China.    In 2010, he said he was planning to learn Mandarin, and made several well-publicized trips to China over the years as Facebook explored the possibility of getting back into the world's most populous country, where it has been banned since 2009.    Those moves made Mr. Zuckerberg popular among many in China, but public opinion there has turned against him because of his recent comments, including at a congressional hearing about competition in July in which he said it was \"well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from U.S. companies.\"    The Global Times, a publication linked to the Chinese Communist Party, this week said Mr. Zuckerberg was previously considered \"the people's son-in-law,\" but that his recent actions suggested that he was willing \"to set aside morality for profit.\"    Mr. Zuckerberg saw TikTok's success coming. When its predecessor app in the U.S., Musical.ly, started becoming popular among American teens in 2017, Facebook considered acquiring it, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Instead, Bytedance bought Musical.ly, and later rebranded it as TikTok.    In the October speech in Georgetown, Mr. Zuckerberg described TikTok as at odds with American values: \"On TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of protests are censored, even in the U.S. Is that the internet we want?\" Mr. Zuckerberg said in his speech.    Days later, Mr. Zuckerberg reiterated his concerns about China during the White House dinner with Mr. Trump, the President's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, who has been a backer of Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the conversation.    Mr. Zuckerberg's team also reached out to members of Congress who are tough on China, according to people familiar with the meetings. He asked them why TikTok should be allowed to operate in the U.S., when many American companies, including his own, can't operate in China.    In November, Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.), who also had met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September, said in a hearing that TikTok threatens the privacy of American children. \"For Facebook, the fear is lost social-media market share,\" he said. \"For the rest of us, the fear is somewhat different.\"    Kelli Ford, a spokeswoman for Sen. Hawley said the senator's concerns about TikTok predated the meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg. \"Facebook has recently been sounding the alarm about China-based tech as a PR tactic to boost its own reputation,\" she said.    Facebook declined to comment on Ms. Ford's remark.    --Deepa Seetharaman and Michael C. Bender contributed to this article.

When Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delivered a speech about freedom of expression in Washington, D.C., last fall, there was also another agenda: to raise the alarm about the threat from Chinese tech companies and, more specifically, the popular video-sharing app TikTok.    Tucked into the speech was a line pointing to Facebook's rising rival: Mr. Zuckerberg told Georgetown students that TikTok doesn't share Facebook's commitment to freedom of expression, and represents a risk to American values and technological supremacy.    That was a message Mr. Zuckerberg hammered behind the scenes in meetings with officials and lawmakers during the October trip and a separate visit to Washington weeks earlier, according to people familiar with the matter.    In a private dinner at the White House in late October, Mr. Zuckerberg made the case to President Trump that the rise of Chinese internet companies threatens American business, and should be a bigger concern than reining in Facebook, some of the people said.    Mr. Zuckerberg discussed TikTok specifically in meetings with several senators, according to people familiar with the meetings. In late October, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) -- who met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September -- and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) wrote a letter to intelligence officials demanding an inquiry into TikTok. The government began a national-security review of the company soon after, and by the spring, Mr. Trump began threatening to ban the app entirely. This month he signed an executive order demanding that TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., divest itself of its U.S. operations.    Few tech companies have as much to gain as Facebook from TikTok's travails, and the social-media giant has taken an active role in raising concerns about the popular app and its Chinese owners.    In addition to Mr. Zuckerberg's personal outreach and public statements about Chinese competition, Facebook has established an advocacy group, called American Edge, that has begun running ads extolling U.S. tech companies for their contributions to American economic might, national security and cultural influence. And Facebook overall in the first half of this year spent more on lobbying than any other single company, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2018, by contrast, it ranked eighth among companies, the center's data show.    It couldn't be determined exactly what role Mr. Zuckerberg's comments have played in the government's handling of TikTok. A spokeswoman for Sen. Cotton said his office doesn't comment on the senator's meetings.    Asked about the dinner, a White House spokesman said the administration \"is committed to protecting the American people from all cyber related threats to critical infrastructure, public health and safety, and our economic and national security.\"    Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said Mr. Zuckerberg has no recollection of discussing TikTok at the dinner.    The CEO's comments in Washington about the Chinese app were tied into Facebook's campaign to blunt antitrust and regulatory threats by emphasizing Facebook's importance to U.S. tech pre-eminence, he said.    \"Our view on China has been clear: we must compete,\" Mr. Stone said in a written statement. \"As Chinese companies and influence have been growing so has the risk of a global internet based on their values, as opposed to ours.\"    In an employee meeting this month, Mr. Zuckerberg called the executive order against TikTok unwelcome, because the global harm of such a move could outweigh any short-term gain to Facebook. The remarks were earlier reported by BuzzFeed News.    TikTok has gained more than 100 million U.S. users and become the biggest threat to Facebook's dominance of social media, as the app's blend of dance videos and goofs has made it a sensation among young people around the world. In the first quarter of 2020, TikTok became the most downloaded app in a single quarter, according to research firm Sensor Tower. Facebook, by comparison, had 256 million monthly users in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of June.    \"TikTok has gone from being next-to-nothing to quite something in major Western markets in the last two years,\" said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM, a unit of WPP PLC.    While Facebook once acquired startups such as TikTok that it viewed as potential threats, scrutiny from antitrust authorities makes those deals more fraught for big tech companies, so they might look to other defensive measures instead, Mr. Wieser said. \"You might then in fact welcome more regulation or things that would limit the opportunities for upstarts,\" he said.    Facebook's Instagram unit this month launched its own video-sharing feature, called Reels, and is trying to poach TikTok creators by paying some users if they post videos exclusively to the new service.    TikTok's fate is up in the air. With the Trump administration's deadline looming, Microsoft Corp. has said it is negotiating to buy TikTok's U.S. operations, and at least two other groups are believed to be circling, involving Twitter Inc. and Oracle Corp.    It is possible that TikTok ends up with one of those companies, immediately making the buyer a formidable U.S. rival to Facebook.    Facebook's advocacy has angered people inside TikTok, according to people familiar with the matter. Last month, CEO Kevin Mayer publicly accused Facebook of trying to unfairly quash competition.    \"At TikTok, we welcome competition,\" he said in a blog post. \"But let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor -- namely Facebook -- disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.\"    Mr. Zuckerberg's arguments about TikTok show a reversal in his stance on China.    In 2010 he said he was planning to learn Mandarin, and he made several well-publicized trips to China over the years as Facebook explored the possibility of getting back into the world's most populous country, where it has been banned since 2009.    Those moves made Mr. Zuckerberg popular among many in China, but public opinion there has turned against him because of his recent comments, including at a congressional hearing about competition in July in which he said it was \"well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from U.S. companies.\"    The Global Times, a publication linked to the Chinese Communist Party, this week said Mr. Zuckerberg was previously considered \"the people's son-in-law,\" but that his recent actions suggested that he was willing \"to set aside morality for profit.\"    Mr. Zuckerberg saw TikTok's success coming. When its predecessor app in the U.S., Musical.ly, started to become popular among American teens in 2017, Facebook considered acquiring it, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Instead, Bytedance bought Musical.ly, and later rebranded it as TikTok.    In the October speech in Georgetown, Mr. Zuckerberg described TikTok as at odds with American values: \"On TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of protests are censored, even in the U.S. Is that the internet we want?\" Mr. Zuckerberg said in his speech.    Days later, Mr. Zuckerberg reiterated his concerns about China during the White House dinner with Mr. Trump, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, who has been a backer of Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the conversation.    Mr. Zuckerberg's team also reached out to members of Congress who are tough on China, according to people familiar with the meetings. He asked them why TikTok should be allowed to operate in the U.S., when many American companies, including his own, can't operate in China.    In November, Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.), who also had met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September, said in a hearing that TikTok threatens the privacy of American children. \"For Facebook, the fear is lost social-media market share,\" he said. \"For the rest of us, the fear is somewhat different.\"    Kelli Ford, a spokeswoman for Sen. Hawley said the senator's concerns about TikTok predated the meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg. \"Facebook has recently been sounding the alarm about China-based tech as a PR tactic to boost its own reputation,\" she said.    Facebook declined to comment on Ms. Ford's remark.    --Deepa Seetharaman and Michael C. Bender contributed to this article.

And if we can't do that, then we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">VAUSE:  CEO Mark Zuckerberg's apology and explanation after a data company access the personal information from millions of Facebook users without their knowledge.</p><p>Also this hour, more than 100 school girls kidnapped in Nigeria have been set free but at what price? What price did the government pay for their freedom?</p><p>And for anyone traveling to France today, pack your patience. A nationwide strike could affect trains, planes, and a whole lot more.</p><p>Great to have you with us. I'm John Vause and this is the third hour. Yes, the third hour of \"Newsroom L.A.\"</p><p>Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is speaking out for the first time and giving a rare public apology over the Cambridge Analytica scanda. Fifty million Facebook users had their personal information breached and used without their knowledge, supposedly so the data firm could build voter profiles to help Donald Trump's presidential campaign.</p><p>The full exclusive interview with Zuckerberg in a moment. First, CNN's Drew Griffin sets the stage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  The reason Facebook is under fire is the ease with which a researcher was able to use Facebook to harvest the personal information of tens of millions of Americans, then transfer all that personal information to a data analytics company that would eventually work for Donald Trump's campaign.</p><p>That firm, Cambridge Analytica, denies any of its work on the 2016 election, used the Facebook data to target voters. But Christopher Wylie, the former U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistle blower, says at the core of the company's activities was the access Facebook provided.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WYLIE, FORMER EMPLOYEE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA:  So -- we went from no data to harvesting all of this data off of Facebook and then combing it with all this, you know, the consumer data sets and voter data sets.</p><p>So, you know, we had sort of a -- you know, Steve Bannon and a billionaire breathing down our necks trying to, you know, where is the data, where is the algorithm, where is our information weapon. And -- and that's where Kogan came along, Aleksandr Kogan, the professor at Cambridge.</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice over):  Aleksandr Kogan is the Cambridge University researcher, who in 2014 developed an app, a Facebook personality test called \"This Is Your Digital Life.\" Two hundred seventy thousand people voluntarily took the personality test.</p><p>But what no one who took the test knew is that Kogan's app opened the door to all their personal information and to all of those voluntary Facebook responders' friends and their friends and so on. Tens of millions of people. Facebook says Kogan misled, that he was supposed to only use the data for research. Instead, he collected it and sold it. But Kogan doesn't believe he did anything wrong.</p><p>ALEKSANDR KOGAN, RESEARCHER, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY:  Because the reality is that our app wasn't special. It was completely commonplace. There are thousands if not tens of thousands of apps doing the exact same thing.</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice over):  Now the attorneys general of at least three states are demanding answers. Congress demanding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify. Even government officials in the U.K. want executives from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica to explain how a research app led to the exploitation of the personal data of millions.</p><p>Drew Griffin, CNN, Atlanta.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:  CNN's Laurie Segall sat down with Mark Zuckerberg for this exclusive interview. In this first excerpt, he breaks his silence on the scandal with an apology.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Let me start with just a basic question. Mark, what happened? What went wrong?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  So, this was a major breach of trust. And I'm really sorry that this happened. You know we have a basic responsibility to protect people's data and if we can't do that then we deserve to have the opportunity to serve people. So our responsibility now is to make that this doesn't happen again.</p><p>And there are a few basic things that I think we need to do to ensure that. One is making sure that developers like Aleksandr Kogan, who got access to a lot of information and then improperly used it, just don't get access to as much information going forward.</p><p>[02:04:56]  So we are doing a set of things to restrict the amount of access that -- that developers can get going forward. But the other is we need to make sure there aren't any other Cambridge Analyticas out there. Right, or folks who have improperly accessed data.</p><p>So, we're going to go now and investigate every app that has access to a large amount of information from before we locked down our platform. And if we detect any suspicious activity we're going to do a full forensic audit.</p><p>SEGALL:  Facebook has asked to us share our data, to share our lives on this platform, and wanted us to be transparent. And people don't feel like they've received that same amount of transparency. They are wondering what is happening to their data. Can they trust Facebook?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes. So, one of the most important things that I think we need to do here is make sure that we tell everyone whose data was affected by one of these rogue apps. We're going that. We're going to build a tool where anyone can go and see if their data was a part of this.</p><p>SEGALL:  The 50 million people that were impacted, they will be able to tell if they were impacted by this?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes. We're going to be even conservative on that. So, you know, we may not have all the data in our system today. So, anyone whose data might have been affected by this, we're going to make sure that we tell. And going forward when we -- when we identify apps that are doing similarly doing sketchy things, I'm going to make sure that we tell people then too.</p><p>That's definitely something that looking back on this, you know, I regret that we didn't do at the time, and I think we got that wrong and we're committed to getting that right going forward.</p><p>SEGALL:  I want to ask about that because when it came to light, you guys knew this a long time ago, that this data was out there. Why didn't you tell users? Don't you think users have the right to know that their data is being used for different purposes?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  So, yes, and let me tell you what actions we took. So in 2015, some journalists from The Guardian told us that they had seen or had some evidence that data that this app developer, Aleksandr Kogan, who built this personality quiz app and a bunch of people used it and shared data with it, had sold that data to Cambridge Analytica and a few other firms.</p><p>When we heard that -- that's against the policy. You can't share data in a way that people don't know or don't consent to. We immediately banned Kogan's app. And further, we made it so that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and the other folks with whom he shared the data, we asked for a formal certification that they had none of the data from anyone in the Faceok community, that they deleted it if they had it, and that they were not using it. And they all provided that certification. So as far as we understood around the time and that episode, there was no data out there.</p><p>SEGALL:  So why didn't Facebook follow up? You know, you say you certified it. I think -- why wasn't there more of a follow up? Why wasn't there an audit then? Why does it take a big media report to get that proactive approach?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Well, I don't know about you, but I'm used to when people legally certify that they're going to something, that they do it. But I think of this as clearly a mistake in retrospect.</p><p>SEGALL:  Was it putting too much trust in developers?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I think it did. And that's why -- you know, we need to make sure that we don't make that mistake ever again, which is why one of the things that I announced today is that we are going to do a full investigation into every app that had access to a large amount of data from around this time before we lock down the platform.</p><p>And we're now not just going to take people's word for it and want to give us a legal certification, but if we see anything suspicious, which I think that there probably were signs in this case that we could have looked into, we are going to do a full forensic audit.</p><p>SEGALL:  How do you know there aren't hundreds more companies like Cambridge Analytica that are also keeping data that violates Facebook's policies?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I think the question here is, are app developers who -- who people given access to their data, are they doing something that people don't want? Are they selling the data in a way that people don't want? Or they are giving it to someone that they don't have authorization to do? And this is something that I think we now need to go figure out, right? So, for all these apps --</p><p>SEGALL:  That's got to be a -- I got to say that's going to be a really challenging ordeal. How do you actually go do that? Because you talk about it being years ago and then you guys have made it a bit stricter for that kind of information to be shared. But backtracking on it, it's got to be really difficult to find out where that data has gone and what other companies have shady access.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes, I mean, as you say. The good news here is that we already changed the platform policies in 2014. Before that, we know what the apps were that had access to data. We know how much -- how many people were using those services. And we can look at the patterns of the data requests.</p><p>[02:09:57]  And based on that, we think we'll have a pretty clear sense of whether anyone was doing anything abnormal. And we'll be able to do a full audit of anyone who is questionable.</p><p>SEGALL:  Do you expect -- do you have any scale or any scope of what you expect to find? Anything in the scope of what happened with Cambridge Analytica where you had 50 million users?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Well, it's hard to know what we'll find, but we're going to review thousands of apps. So, this is going to be an intensive process,  but this is important. I mean this is something that in retrospect we clearly should have done, upfront, with Cambridge Analytica. We shouldn't have trusted the certification that they gave us. And we're not going to make that mistake again.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:  OK, the rest of that interview in just a moment. But right now, let's go to CNN's Anna Stewart in London. So, Anna, Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have announced a whole lot of steps the company plans to take to try and fix this mess. What are we talking about?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN PRODUCER:  Well, as you heard there from Mark, a big audit of apps. This will number into thousands of different apps that use Facebook which sounds really costly. It will be interesting to see what (INAUDIBLE). Now these will be apps that pre 2014 when Facebook made some policy changes had access to vast amounts of data.</p><p>And also apps that had been more recently that may be showing some sort of suspicious activity. Any app that says they will not submit to a star audit will just be deleted from Facebook. They will also going to limit how much data apps currently have for users. As he said, he will be testifying to Congress or would be happy to do that. So, he has made some good steps, but is it too little too late?</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes, I guess that's the question. I mean, will this be enough for not just the investors but for the users, the regulators? He has a lot of audiences to please.</p><p>STEWART:  He really does. You know, Facebook was already facing like an existential crisis. It's users in the U.S. are on the decline. Plenty of people will have hit delete on Facebook over this crisis. And perhaps a lot of investors have hit the delete button on Facebook in the portfolio. (INAUDIBLE) yesterday but it's still down eight percent on the week. It will be interesting to see how it opens today given that some of these steps will be very costly. It will take a very, very long time.</p><p>In terms of regulators, they may be pleased that he wants to now get out in front, although it has taken five days. I'm not sure whether you can really call that getting out in front. And (INAUDIBLE) of course from the U.K. parliament and the E.U. parliament who also want to speak to him about all these privacy issues surrounding Facebook. So we'll have to see whether he submits to those two.</p><p>VAUSE:  Also, it seems that Zuckerberg wanted to sort of portray Facebook as a victim here as well, a victim of this evil Cambridge Analytica doing evil things. But Facebook was told about what they were doing back in 2015. Kept it quiet and just tried to sort come up the data and move on.</p><p>STEWART:  I know. And I think this is -- I mean, he says this is one of his biggest regrets, is not doing more when he was told that there was this problem in 2015. And he says, you know, Facebook was too trusting, and users have been too trusting of Facebook frankly. This is a big problem.</p><p>And I think the biggest question (ph), why they didn't do more, as Laurie said in that interview, why they didn't do more then? Why did it take this kind of huge scandal to come out, all these news reports, and five days for Facebook to think about it before they can come up with a party line?</p><p>VAUSE:  It's always been deny, deny, deny. Yes, we did it, sorry. You will stick around because we have part two of our exclusive interview with Mark Zuckerberg. That's up next. Find out what Mark Zuckerberg thinks about Facebook's impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><p>[02:15:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE:  Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologized for not doing enough to prevent a massive operation that collected data on tens of millions of users without their knowledge. He says the company is now trying to take action to make sure it never happens again. Here is part two of his exclusive interview with CNN's Laurie Segall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  If you told me in 2004, when I was getting started with Facebook, that a big part of my responsibility today would be to help protect the integrity of elections against interference by other governments, you know, I wouldn't have really believed that that was going to be something that I will have to work on 14 years later.</p><p>SEGALL:  I'm going to challenge you.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: We're going to make sure that we do a good job.</p><p>SEGALL: Have you done a good enough job yet?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Well, I think we will see. But, I think what's clear is that in 2016, we were not as on top of a number of issues as we should have, whether it was Russian interference or fake news.</p><p>But what we have seen since then is, a number of months later there was a major French election, and there we deployed some AI tools that did a much better job of identifying Russian bots and basically Russian potential interference and weeding that out of the platform ahead of the election. And we were much happier with how that went.</p><p>In 2017, last year, during the special election, the senate seat in Alabama, we deployed some new AI tools that we built to detect fake accounts that were trying to spread false news and we found a lot of different accounts coming from Macedonia.</p><p>So, I think the reality here is that this isn't rocket science. Right? And there's a lot of hard work that we need to do to make it harder for nation-states like Russia to do election interference, to make it so that trolls and other folks can't spread fake news, but we can get in front of this.</p><p>And we have a responsibility to do this, not only for the 2018 midterms in the U.S., which are going to be a huge deal this year and that's just a huge focus for us but there's a big election in India this year, there's a big election in Brazil, there are big elections around the world, and you can bet that we are really committed to doing everything that we need to to make sure that the integrity of those elections on Facebook is secured.</p><p>SEGALL:  I can hear the commitment but since I got you here, do you think that bad actors are using Facebook at this moment to meddle with the U.S. midterm elections?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I'm sure someone is trying. Right? I'm sure that there is V2, version two of whatever the Russian effort was in 2016, I'm sure they are working on that and there are going to be some new tactics that we need to make sure that we observe and get in front of --</p><p>SEGALL:  Do you know what the -- speaking of getting in front of them, do you know what they are? Do you have any idea?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes, and I think we have some sense of the different things that we need to get in front of.</p><p>SEGALL:  Are you specifically saying bad actors try to meddle with the U.S. election now?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I'm not a hundred percent sure what that means. It's not -- I think that the candidates are going to find that.</p><p>SEGALL:  Are you seeing anything new or interesting?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  What we see are a lot of folks trying to sew division. Right? So that was a major tactic that we saw Russia try to use in the 2016 election. Actually most of what they did was not directly, as far as we can tell from the data that we've seen, was not directly about the election, but was more about just dividing people.</p><p>You know, so they'd run a group for pro-immigration reform and they'd run another group against immigration reform to just try to pit people against each other. And a lot of this was done with fake accounts that we could do a better job of tracing and using AI tools to be able to scan and observe a lot of what is going on and I'm confident that we're going to do a much better job.</p><p>SEGALL:  Lawmakers in the United States and the U.K. are asking you to testify. Everybody wants you to show up. Will you testify before Congress?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  So the short answer is I'm happy to, if it's the right thing to do. Facebook testifies in Congress regularly on a number of topics, some high profile and some not. And our objective is always to provide Congress, who does an extremely important job, to have the most information that they can.</p><p>[02:20:04]  We see a small slice of activity on Facebook, but Congress gets to have access to the information across Facebook and all other companies and the intelligence community and everything. So what we try to do is send the person at Facebook who will have the most knowledge about what Congress is trying to learn.</p><p>So if that's me, then I am happy to go. What I thin we've found so far is the typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there will be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.</p><p>SEGALL:  You are the brand of Facebook. You are the name of Facebook. People want to hear from you.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: That's why I'm doing this interview. But, you know, I think that there is -- the question in a question of congressional testimony is what is the goal, right? And that's not a media opportunity or at least it is not supposed to be. The goal there I think is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job.</p><p>And we just want to make sure that we send whoever is best informed at doing that. I agree separately that there is an element of accountability where I should be out there doing more interviews. And you know -- as uncomfortable as it is for me to do a T.V. interview, I think this is an important thing that as a discipline for what we are doing I should be out there and being asked hard questions by journalists.</p><p>SEGALL:  Knowing what you know now, do you believe Facebook impacted the results of the 2016 election?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  That's -- that is hard. You know, I think that it is -- it's really hard for me to have a full assessment of that. You know, it's -- the -- the reality is -- well, there were so many different forces at play. The organic posting that people did, the get out to vote campaigns that we ran, the pages that both candidates run, the advertising that they did, I'm sure that all of that activity had some impact.</p><p>It's hard for me to assess how much that stacked up compared to all the campaign events and advertising that was done off of Facebook and all of the other efforts. And I think it's also hard to fully assess the impact of that. That organic activity which we are actually quite proud of --</p><p>SEGALL:  And also the bad actors.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  And the bad stuff. That's something. I think it is hard to fully assess.</p><p>SEGALL:  Given the stakes here, why shouldn't Facebook be regulated?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated. You know, I think in general technology is an increasing -- increasingly important trend in the world and I actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather than \"yes or no, should it be regulated?\"</p><p>SEGALL:  What's the right regulation?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Well there's some basic things, then I think there are some big intellectual debates. On the basic side, I think there are things like ads transparency regulation that I would love to see. If you look at how much regulation there is around advertising on TV and print, it's just not clear why there should be less on the internet.</p><p>We should have the same level of transparency required. And I don't know if a bill is going to pass. I know a couple of senators are working really hard on this, but we are committed and we've actually already started rolling out ad transparency tools that accomplish most of the things that are in all the bills that people are talking about today because this is an important thing.</p><p>People should know who is buying the ads that they see on Facebook, and you should be able to go on any page and see all the ads that people are running to different audiences.</p><p>SEGALL:  How has being a father changed your commitment to users, changed your commitment to their future and what a kinder Facebook looks like?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Well, I think, having kids changes a lot. And --</p><p>SEGALL:  Like what?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Well, you know I used to think that the most important thing to me by far was, you know my having the greatest positive impact across the world that I can and, now I really just care about building something that my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for. And that's what is kind of my guiding philosophy at this point is and you know I come and work on a lot of hard things during the day and I go home and just ask will my girls be proud of what I did today?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE:  Laurie Segall joins us now from San Francisco. Laurie, congratulations. A good exclusive to get. And I guess the big headline out of this, Zuckerberg sort of all but admitting that Facebook may have influenced the outcome of the U.S. election. And then adding that maybe now is the time that regulations are needed.</p><p>SEGALL:  Yes, it's interesting to hear a tech leader say that. You know he said the right kind of regulation is important, but you know normally you don't hear them come out and say that. You have lawmakers calling for Facebook to be regulated, calling for the big tech companies to be regulated. You usually feel a lot more push back.</p><p>[02:25:01]  I think Zuckerberg said we need a more thoughtful approach, John.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes. I wonder how will this go down with the other big tech companies like Google and Twitter. How will they react to this?</p><p>SEGALL:  Look, I think it's a big moment. And I will say, you know, I think all tech companies are under a lot of pressure at this moment. We have had a year of unintended consequences. We've seen the weaponization of all these platforms.</p><p>I think we focus a lot on Facebook because Facebook is very personal to us and we have seen the Russian influence on Facebook. It has been a year for Facebook where we saw a lot of bad actors take advantage of the platform.</p><p>So I think the pressure is on. I'll tell you this, John. You know Mark doesn't like doing on camera interview because he is very nervous. He would rather be kind of behind the scenes with the engineers working on the product. But I think we kind of reach this pivotal point where we also need our tech leaders to step up and talk about some of these unintended consequences, some of the nuance behind the challenges that they are facing that come along with this really powerful technology.</p><p>VAUSE:  It's only a guess, but I'm guessing he also does not like testifying before Congress, but he said he would. But then he added, if it's the right thing to do. It's hard to imagine how it would be the wrong thing to do.</p><p>SEGALL:  Yes, you know he said it for various -- all -- very specific and he said maybe, you know, for the right thing. I wonder what that right thing is and what I said to him is, you know, you are the brand, you are the face of Facebook, in a way that's bigger than other tech founders. You know, you don't think -- when you think of Microsoft, sure some folks may know the CEO is Satya Nadella.</p><p>But when you think of Facebook, most people around the world know Mark Zuckerberg as the CEO. That's why when you see a tough year like Facebook have, when you see a tough last couple of days that Facebook has had when it comes to knowing that the data was used for nefarious purposes, I really do think that people want to see Mark. I think it's interesting and newsy that he said he could potentially will be -- for the the right reasons be willing to testify.</p><p>VAUSE:  Laurie, a good exclusive, a good get, and thank you for being with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>SEGALL:  Yes.</p><p>VAUSE:  Next here on \"Newsroom L.A.,\" the U.S. is about to fire the next shot in what could become a trade war with China. The question now is how will Beijing respond?</p><p>And back home at last. The emotional return of more than 100 school girls who were kidnapped last month in Nigeria.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE:  Thanks for staying with us. You're watching \"CNN Newsroom\" live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause. We will check the headlines this hour. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Facebook's CEO has apologized for the reported misuse of users' data, calling it a massive breach of trust.</p><p>[02:30:05]  Mark Zuckerberg said he is open to the idea of social media regulation and will testify before Congress, adding if it is the right thing to do.</p><p>Police in Austin, Texas say a serial bomber recorded a 25-minute video describing the devices he made before blowing himself up.  The time bombs killed two people and wounded five others over the past three weeks.  Police say security in front of FedEx or is crucial in tracking him down.  </p><p>For the coming hours, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announced new tariffs on Chinese imports.  It's not known what products will be targeted but their total value is expected to be around $60 billion representing more than 10 percent of Chinese imports to the U.S. last year.  All this on top of duties and steel and aluminum or aluminum depending where you live.  That goes into effect on Friday.  </p><p>Andrew Stevens is live in Hong Kong, aluminum, aluminum, you know, OK. If past is prolonged that it's a fair bet, Beijing will not be too happy about these new tariffs.</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I think it's fair to say that, John, what Beijing does, we all wait to see.  They are more than likely I suspect to launch some sort of retaliatory action even as the senior leadership said this a couple of days ago that they don't want a trade war.  It is in the interests of no one and they wanted to fight to any trade issues through multilateral organization like the World Trade Organization.  But as you say, this is -- this is potentially $50 or $60 billion worth of tariffs and from the U.S. side, from Donald Trump's side particularly what it does is, A, tackle that yawning trade deficit the U.S. has $325 billion deficit with China.  But it also punishes China about what the U.S. sees and what a lot of U.S. industry sees as theft of intellectual property, U.S. intellectual property.  When you're a U.S. company going into China, you're a high-tech company, any company, you invariably have to form a joint venture with a local partner and then there is a technology transfer.  </p><p>So the technology you have goes to China.  On top of that, there are real concerns they have there for many, many years that cyber theft by the Chinese all the U.S. trade secrets and also a more recent phenomenon, John, is the move by Chinese companies to acquire sort of sensitive industry companies in the U.S., you know, in high-tech chipmakers for example.  But that acquisition is being funded by the state.  Beijing is bankrolling some of these acquisitions and that is also a clearly worrying the U.S.  So we shouldn't be surprised the U.S. is going after this -- after this breach of intellectual property.  And in fact, it's probably getting quite a warm reception in industry in the U.S.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.  Although, the criticism is it's a sledge hammer to fix a problem when we need a pair of fine pliers or something.  I don't know much about tools.  Andrew, thank you.  Good to see you.</p><p>STEVENS:  Thanks, john.  </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  Well, most of the 110 school girls' kidnapped in Nigeria last month are back home with their families.  They were released by the terror group Boko Haram on Wednesday.  Five girls reportedly died while they were held hostage.  The Nigerian government says no ransom was paid and denies reports the military and police received warnings in the hours before the kidnapping but failed to act.  Bukky Shonibare joins us now from Abuja, Nigeria.  She's a member of the Bring Back Our Girls Movement and is the founder of the group focus of running girls access to quality education.  Bukky, thank you for taking the time to be with us.  The Nigerian government says there was no ransom was paid, nothing was given in exchange for the girls.  So why were they released by Boko Haram?  What's in it for them?  Why would they do this?  </p><p>BUKKY SHONIBARE, MEMBER OF BRING BACK OUR GIRLS MOVEMENT:  For Boko Haram to have abducted our girls in the first place means that there was an objective.  There was a motive.  There was something that they need to get out of it.  So when the federal government of Nigeria comes out to say that no ransom was paid, none of the soldiers were released, it puts to question what exactly was actually put on the table for Boko Haram to release our girls?  They wouldn't just come to that take the girls and then take them, and then after one month they think it's the best thing to do to girls bring them back.  And when you look at the issue of the Chibok girls, the federal government also at some point denied that they gave ransom.  But \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports came out just late last year showing the amount of millions of U.S. dollars paid.  Again, it's only a matter of time the truth will still come out.  But I don't think it is proper for the government of Nigeria to keep those lies on because when the truth is going to be found out, it will boost the confident and trust that we the people need to have in our government.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.  The truth always comes out.  And you know, wouldn't it be better for them to actually release the truth rather than, you know, coming out Iips and drabs.  You mention the families of the Chibok girls, that was four years ago and many of those girls are still being held today.  This must be a really difficult day for the parents of those girls who are still being held.  What have they been saying?</p><p>[02:35:12] SHONIBARE:  You know, the coincidental events that happened was Tuesday night about 30 of the parents actually arrived in Dapchi to, you know, pay condolence.  I'm sorry.  To pay solidarity visit to the parents of the Dapchi girls.  And then on Wednesday morning, the girls -- that was yesterday morning and then the Dapchi girls will go back.  So imagine them having to experience that after life where Boko Haram returned the Dapchi girls while they are still waiting for four years.  So I think it brings back the pain and the agony of their girls being missing for that long.</p><p>VAUSE:  Gosh.  It's hard to imagine what those parents must have been going through for such a long time.  </p><p>SHONIBARE:  It is.   VAUSE:  Just generally, though, you know, there are these reports which the government denies that there was apparently, you know, an attempt to tip off the military and the police in the hours before these latest kidnapping took place.  They deny that there's no any such tipoffs.  But in a general sense, how safe do girls feel when they are at school especially when they're in these areas where these abductions have occurred?</p><p>SHONIBARE:  When Chibok girls' abduction happened, one of the things we expected and we as a group called for was that there must be an extra fortification and security of schools.  And you see then that untouchable girls are best for were shut down for a certain number of months before they were reopened.  And now we have the Dapchi girls abduction happening.  So it means that the proper security that should be provided for girls has not been provided in that region.  The question then now is, now that the Dapchi girls were abducted and going back school, we're also shut down.  What is the Government of Nigeria now doing?  So again, if I'm not sure that another abduction will happen just maybe the Dapchi girls are put.  It means the central government is not securing schools.  This is a region that costs about $10.5 million out of school children and the higher percentage of those are actually girls.</p><p>One Boko Haram returned those girls yesterday, they keep telling the parents of the girls don't go back to western education, don't go back to school.  It further endanger education and if the government does not break this cycle of watching the insurgents come to take our girls, they evoke people's emotions and then get some of their men release and then come back to launch the same attack.  If we don't put a stop to that cycle, it means our girls education particularly will continue to be in danger.  So the responsibilities on the Government to Nigeria to protect schools enough, so that we can promote girls child education and education generally in that region which is not the case now.</p><p>VAUSE:  It's just a very much basic of government responsibilities and services.  Kids can go to school and they can go to school in safety everywhere.  It should be everywhere but clearly it's not but it should be.  Bukky, thank you so much.  We appreciate your time.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  Next strikes are expected in France on Thursday.  Why traveling in the country may not be the only challenge many will be facing?  We'll explain in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:40:35] VAUSE:  So apparently traveling in France will be a challenge on Thursday I supposed to every other time of the week -- any other day of the week.  Seven labor unions are vowing to walk out in a nationwide strike to protest plan to economic reform.  Among them rail works, air traffic controllers, even school, and hospital workers.  Here's Jim Bittermann reporting from Paris.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  For decades, French leaders have tried to reform the nation's economy and while they've had some successes, there have been some spectacular failures, as unions, especially in the public sector have pushed back against attempts to change workplace rules.  </p><p>In this case, the protest against Jacques Chirac's plans in 1995 went on for weeks, brought the country to a halt and contributed to the downfall of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.  There's been one attempt after another since and now French President Emmanuel Macron who was elected on a promise to enact reforms and would began the process shortly after Election Day is taking on the most difficult one yet, modifying the work rules in the public transportation sector.  For economists like Pascal Perri, it's long overdue.  If for no other reason, then France is facing a deadline at the end of the year when European Railway Systems must open up the competition, meaning that there could soon be German and Italian trains running on French tracks.</p><p>PASCAL PERRI, ECONOMIST:  It's a question of competitiveness, of, you know, profitability.  So today, the government has decided to play its role.</p><p>BITTERMANN:  Perri points out that the French Rail System runs at a loss each year and it's currently 50 billion Euros in debt.  But French railway workers, some of whom, are unemployed under work rules that go back to World War II in the days of coal-fired locomotives are resisting any attempt to tamper with their pay, pension, or benefits. Once more, they fear the government as is done in other sector is heading towards privatizing the rail system, a system some union leaders think should be entirely free.</p><p>BRUNO PONCET, GOVERNING COUNCIL, SUD RAIL (through translator):  We want to explain everyone that like medical costs, healthcare costs, and education, transportation should be free in order to have true social equality in France. </p><p>BITTERMANN:  Even among the other unions involved, not everyone would agree with that.  But the union leader says that he believes that public service employees and other sectors like the ones he mentioned will join the railway workers on Thursday for strikes that could continue well beyond this week.  </p><p>In fact, the leadership of one rail union is calling for a labor action from April through June at a pace of two strike days for every three days' work, an innovative protest that could infuriate rail users and bedevil the government.  Whatever the outcome, barring a last minute compromise, the government and passengers could be in for some trying times ahead.

Well, in recent weeks, the spotlight has well and truly fallen on the Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, for all the wrong reasons. </p><p>Just last week, United went crashing out of the Champions League at the hands of Sevilla.  And their performance at Old Trafford left much to be desired.  But afterwards, the Special One's post-game comments drew plenty of scrutiny.  He claimed United losing at home in the Champion's League was nothing new.</p><p>And then, went on to the Sevilla dressing room to congratulate them on their win, a gesture which is actually earned a round of applause from the visiting team.  But the next day, Mourinho, then went on a 12- minute rant questioning his club's recent history and heritage, and pointing to the fact rivals Manchester City have finished above United in every season since 2013.</p><p>On Saturday, United be brightened, 2-0 to book a place in the FA Cup semi-finals.  But to Mourinho, there was a very little to celebrate, he accused his side of \"A lack of personality, lack of class and lack of desire.\"  The FA Cup could be the only chance to serve well the season, as they sit 16 points behind City in English Premier League title race.</p><p>Well earlier, CNN's Amanda Davies has to speak to Jose Mourinho.  He's in Basel, Switzerland right now managing one of the teams for the Hublot Match of Friendship.  Coaching against Argentina's iconic Diego Maradona.  Both team speech of past legends of the game.  Plus one, their special guest, Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt, no less.  And Amanda started by asking Mourinho, about that lightning quick member of his team.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANDA DAVIES, CNN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you so much for your time.  Have you got any plans to make Usain Bolt, a permanent member of your team?</p><p>JOSE MOURINHO, MANAGER, PREMIER LEAGUE CLUB MANCHESTER UNITED:  No, I don't have these plans.  But was amazing to meet him and was amazing to share football celebration with so many legends, with so many players that we, we love them when they were playing, and we respect them even now because of what they did for our game.  That has a meaning as a double -- a double meaning for me is the meaning of a -- for what he represents in the history of sports and also what he represents in the history of humanity.  But has a double -- a double meaning for me is that is --- a Manchester United supporter and my feeling towards Manchester United supporters is always that feeling of gift of everything I can, everything I have to try to make them happy.</p><p>DAVIES:  You mentioned the Manchester United fans.  I, myself, I'm one who's to spend 30 ordeals going to Old Trafford supporting Manchester United.  Do you think the United fans have a realistic expectation of success at Old Trafford this days? MOURINHO:  I think, there have the passion, and everyone with passion has the biggest and the best expectations about their football clubs. And in daystar in football all around the world not just in England, you had the biggest clubs with moments of transition.  You'll have the biggest clubs with moments of continues and permanent victories.  And this are faces in the club.  And I think really in this moment looking to us in the Premier League, we have one team clearly, one club clearly better prepared than us in the past few years to be first.</p><p>And we have 18 clubs behind us.  One in front of us, 18 behind us.  Of course, in the future, we want to have 19 behind us, but this is the reality.  And the reality is for people with brain, with sense, with common sense, with knowledge of what's sports is.  We are in the moment of transition, and being in the moment of transition, hence, to manage to do what we did last season and win trophies.  And to do what we are trying to do this season which is still trying to win a trophy and try to be second.  Because in this moment is the only opposition that is possible for us to bear it as if we are in the good position -- in a good position.</p><p>DAVIES:  Do you want the team to be playing exciting football?</p><p>[02:50:00] MOURINHO:  What do you mean by that?</p><p>DAVIES:  Football that gets the Old Trafford crowd on the edge of their seat that is attacking that season going forward there and taking their opportunities.</p><p>MOURINHO:  Like we did against Chelsea and against Liverpool, do you mean that?</p><p>DAVIES:  But perhaps, not against Sevilla.</p><p>MOURINHO:  OK.  Yes, yes.  It's like then, you are right.</p><p>DAVIES:  But do you understand the criticism that you have been getting from some quarters as to why the fans have been frustrated?</p><p>MOURINHO:  No, I don't.  I understand the frustration, I understand the sadness of being knocked out in the -- in the Champions League, but I don't understand anything more than that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RILEY:  All right, thanks to Jose for his time there.  And the fastest man on the planet, Usain Bolt is also a Manchester United fan.  Went all out to impress the gaffer on the up to many.  Known for being light on his feet, and on the day he certainly was a spot actually went on to score a goal in the game which ended 11 goals to 11. Speaking after that not so surprising draw, the Jamaican said he has no regret after leaving the track.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>USAIN BOLT, EIGHT-TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST, SPRINTS:  I think, I've done everything that I want to do in sport.  Just so I just kind of trying to move on to football because it would be a new challenge, and I need something difficult for me to do, and to be challenge me.

Yes, the third hour of \"Newsroom L.A.\"</p><p>Facebookfounder and CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is speaking out for the first time and giving a rare public apology over the Cambridge Analytica scanda. Fifty million Facebookusers had their personal information breached and used without their knowledge, supposedly so the data firm could build voter profiles to help <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>presidential campaign.</p><p>The full exclusive interview with <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>in a moment. First, CNN's Drew Griffin sets the stage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The reason Facebookis under fire is the ease with which a researcher was able to use Facebookto harvest the personal information of tens of millions of Americans, then transfer all that personal information to a data analytics company that would eventually work for <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>campaign.</p><p>That firm, Cambridge Analytica, denies any of its work on the 2016 election, used the Facebookdata to target voters. But Christopher Wylie, the former U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistle blower, says at the core of the company's activities was the access Facebookprovided.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WYLIE, FORMER EMPLOYEE, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: So -- we went from no data to harvesting all of this data off of Facebookand then combing it with all this, you know, the consumer data sets and voter data sets.</p><p>So, you know, we had sort of a -- you know, <person><nameText>Steve Bannon </nameText></person>and a billionaire breathing down our necks trying to, you know, where is the data, where is the algorithm, where is our information weapon. And -- and that's where Kogan came along, Aleksandr Kogan, the professor at Cambridge.</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice over): Aleksandr Kogan is the Cambridge University researcher, who in 2014 developed an app, a Facebook personality test called \"This Is Your Digital Life.\" Two hundred seventy thousand people voluntarily took the personality test.</p><p>But what no one who took the test knew is that Kogan's app opened the door to all their personal information and to all of those voluntary Facebookresponders' friends and their friends and so on. Tens of millions of people. Facebooksays Kogan misled, that he was supposed to only use the data for research. Instead, he collected it and sold it. But Kogan doesn't believe he did anything wrong.</p><p>ALEKSANDR KOGAN, RESEARCHER, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY: Because the reality is that our app wasn't special. It was completely commonplace. There are thousands if not tens of thousands of apps doing the exact same thing.</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice over): Now the attorneys general of at least three states are demanding answers. Congress demanding FacebookCEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>testify. Even government officials in the U.K. want executives from Facebookand Cambridge Analytica to explain how a research app led to the exploitation of the personal data of millions.</p><p>Drew Griffin, CNN, Atlanta.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: CNN's Laurie Segall sat down with <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>for this exclusive interview. In this first excerpt, he breaks his silence on the scandal with an apology.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Let me start with just a basic question. Mark, what happened? What went wrong?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: So, this was a major breach of trust. And I'm really sorry that this happened. You know we have a basic responsibility to protect people's data and if we can't do that then we deserve to have the opportunity to serve people. So our responsibility now is to make that this doesn't happen again.</p><p>And there are a few basic things that I think we need to do to ensure that. One is making sure that developers like Aleksandr Kogan, who got access to a lot of information and then improperly used it, just don't get access to as much information going forward.</p><p>[02:04:56] So we are doing a set of things to restrict the amount of access that -- that developers can get going forward. But the other is we need to make sure there aren't any other Cambridge Analyticas out there. Right, or folks who have improperly accessed data.</p><p>So, we're going to go now and investigate every app that has access to a large amount of information from before we locked down our platform. And if we detect any suspicious activity we're going to do a full forensic audit.</p><p>SEGALL: Facebookhas asked to us share our data, to share our lives on this platform, and wanted us to be transparent. And people don't feel like they've received that same amount of transparency. They are wondering what is happening to their data. Can they trust Facebook?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Yes. So, one of the most important things that I think we need to do here is make sure that we tell everyone whose data was affected by one of these rogue apps. We're going that. We're going to build a tool where anyone can go and see if their data was a part of this.</p><p>SEGALL: The 50 million people that were impacted, they will be able to tell if they were impacted by this?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Yes. We're going to be even conservative on that. So, you know, we may not have all the data in our system today. So, anyone whose data might have been affected by this, we're going to make sure that we tell. And going forward when we -- when we identify apps that are doing similarly doing sketchy things, I'm going to make sure that we tell people then too.</p><p>That's definitely something that looking back on this, you know, I regret that we didn't do at the time, and I think we got that wrong and we're committed to getting that right going forward.</p><p>SEGALL: I want to ask about that because when it came to light, you guys knew this a long time ago, that this data was out there. Why didn't you tell users? Don't you think users have the right to know that their data is being used for different purposes?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: So, yes, and let me tell you what actions we took. So in 2015, some journalists from The Guardian told us that they had seen or had some evidence that data that this app developer, Aleksandr Kogan, who built this personality quiz app and a bunch of people used it and shared data with it, had sold that data to Cambridge Analytica and a few other firms.</p><p>When we heard that -- that's against the policy. You can't share data in a way that people don't know or don't consent to. We immediately banned Kogan's app. And further, we made it so that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and the other folks with whom he shared the data, we asked for a formal certification that they had none of the data from anyone in the Faceok community, that they deleted it if they had it, and that they were not using it. And they all provided that certification. So as far as we understood around the time and that episode, there was no data out there.</p><p>SEGALL: So why didn't Facebookfollow up? You know, you say you certified it. I think -- why wasn't there more of a follow up? Why wasn't there an audit then? Why does it take a big media report to get that proactive approach?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Well, I don't know about you, but I'm used to when people legally certify that they're going to something, that they do it. But I think of this as clearly a mistake in retrospect.</p><p>SEGALL: Was it putting too much trust in developers?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I think it did. And that's why -- you know, we need to make sure that we don't make that mistake ever again, which is why one of the things that I announced today is that we are going to do a full investigation into every app that had access to a large amount of data from around this time before we lock down the platform.</p><p>And we're now not just going to take people's word for it and want to give us a legal certification, but if we see anything suspicious, which I think that there probably were signs in this case that we could have looked into, we are going to do a full forensic audit.</p><p>SEGALL: How do you know there aren't hundreds more companies like Cambridge Analytica that are also keeping data that violates Facebook's policies?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I think the question here is, are app developers who -- who people given access to their data, are they doing something that people don't want? Are they selling the data in a way that people don't want? Or they are giving it to someone that they don't have authorization to do? And this is something that I think we now need to go figure out, right? So, for all these apps --</p><p>SEGALL: That's got to be a -- I got to say that's going to be a really challenging ordeal. How do you actually go do that? Because you talk about it being years ago and then you guys have made it a bit stricter for that kind of information to be shared. But backtracking on it, it's got to be really difficult to find out where that data has gone and what other companies have shady access.</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Yes, I mean, as you say. The good news here is that we already changed the platform policies in 2014. Before that, we know what the apps were that had access to data. We know how much -- how many people were using those services. And we can look at the patterns of the data requests.</p><p>[02:09:57] And based on that, we think we'll have a pretty clear sense of whether anyone was doing anything abnormal. And we'll be able to do a full audit of anyone who is questionable.</p><p>SEGALL: Do you expect -- do you have any scale or any scope of what you expect to find? Anything in the scope of what happened with Cambridge Analytica where you had 50 million users?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Well, it's hard to know what we'll find, but we're going to review thousands of apps. So, this is going to be an intensive process, but this is important. I mean this is something that in retrospect we clearly should have done, upfront, with Cambridge Analytica. We shouldn't have trusted the certification that they gave us. And we're not going to make that mistake again.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: OK, the rest of that interview in just a moment. But right now, let's go to CNN's Anna Stewart in London. So, Anna, Facebookand <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>have announced a whole lot of steps the company plans to take to try and fix this mess. What are we talking about?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN PRODUCER: Well, as you heard there from Mark, a big audit of apps. This will number into thousands of different apps that use Facebookwhich sounds really costly. It will be interesting to see what (INAUDIBLE). Now these will be apps that pre 2014 when Facebookmade some policy changes had access to vast amounts of data.</p><p>And also apps that had been more recently that may be showing some sort of suspicious activity. Any app that says they will not submit to a star audit will just be deleted from Facebook. They will also going to limit how much data apps currently have for users. As he said, he will be testifying to Congress or would be happy to do that. So, he has made some good steps, but is it too little too late?</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, I guess that's the question. I mean, will this be enough for not just the investors but for the users, the regulators? He has a lot of audiences to please.</p><p>STEWART: He really does. You know, Facebookwas already facing like an existential crisis. It's users in the U.S. are on the decline. Plenty of people will have hit delete on Facebookover this crisis. And perhaps a lot of investors have hit the delete button on Facebookin the portfolio. (INAUDIBLE) yesterday but it's still down eight percent on the week. It will be interesting to see how it opens today given that some of these steps will be very costly. It will take a very, very long time.</p><p>In terms of regulators, they may be pleased that he wants to now get out in front, although it has taken five days. I'm not sure whether you can really call that getting out in front. And (INAUDIBLE) of course from the U.K. parliament and the E.U. parliament who also want to speak to him about all these privacy issues surrounding Facebook. So we'll have to see whether he submits to those two.</p><p>VAUSE: Also, it seems that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>wanted to sort of portray Facebookas a victim here as well, a victim of this evil Cambridge Analytica doing evil things. But Facebookwas told about what they were doing back in 2015. Kept it quiet and just tried to sort come up the data and move on.</p><p>STEWART: I know. And I think this is -- I mean, he says this is one of his biggest regrets, is not doing more when he was told that there was this problem in 2015. And he says, you know, Facebookwas too trusting, and users have been too trusting of Facebookfrankly. This is a big problem.</p><p>And I think the biggest question (ph), why they didn't do more, as Laurie said in that interview, why they didn't do more then? Why did it take this kind of huge scandal to come out, all these news reports, and five days for Facebookto think about it before they can come up with a party line?</p><p>VAUSE: It's always been deny, deny, deny. Yes, we did it, sorry. You will stick around because we have part two of our exclusive interview with <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg. </nameText></person>That's up next. Find out what <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>thinks about Facebook's impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><p>[02:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE: Facebook's CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has apologized for not doing enough to prevent a massive operation that collected data on tens of millions of users without their knowledge. He says the company is now trying to take action to make sure it never happens again. Here is part two of his exclusive interview with CNN's Laurie Segall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: If you told me in 2004, when I was getting started with Facebook, that a big part of my responsibility today would be to help protect the integrity of elections against interference by other governments, you know, I wouldn't have really believed that that was going to be something that I will have to work on 14 years later.</p><p>SEGALL: I'm going to challenge you.</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: We're going to make sure that we do a good job.</p><p>SEGALL: Have you done a good enough job yet?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Well, I think we will see. But, I think what's clear is that in 2016, we were not as on top of a number of issues as we should have, whether it was Russian interference or fake news.</p><p>But what we have seen since then is, a number of months later there was a major French election, and there we deployed some AI tools that did a much better job of identifying Russian bots and basically Russian potential interference and weeding that out of the platform ahead of the election. And we were much happier with how that went.</p><p>In 2017, last year, during the special election, the senate seat in Alabama, we deployed some new AI tools that we built to detect fake accounts that were trying to spread false news and we found a lot of different accounts coming from Macedonia.</p><p>So, I think the reality here is that this isn't rocket science. Right? And there's a lot of hard work that we need to do to make it harder for nation-states like Russia to do election interference, to make it so that trolls and other folks can't spread fake news, but we can get in front of this.</p><p>And we have a responsibility to do this, not only for the 2018 midterms in the U.S., which are going to be a huge deal this year and that's just a huge focus for us but there's a big election in India this year, there's a big election in Brazil, there are big elections around the world, and you can bet that we are really committed to doing everything that we need to to make sure that the integrity of those elections on Facebookis secured.</p><p>SEGALL: I can hear the commitment but since I got you here, do you think that bad actors are using Facebookat this moment to meddle with the U.S. midterm elections?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I'm sure someone is trying. Right? I'm sure that there is V2, version two of whatever the Russian effort was in 2016, I'm sure they are working on that and there are going to be some new tactics that we need to make sure that we observe and get in front of --</p><p>SEGALL: Do you know what the -- speaking of getting in front of them, do you know what they are? Do you have any idea?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Yes, and I think we have some sense of the different things that we need to get in front of.</p><p>SEGALL: Are you specifically saying bad actors try to meddle with the U.S. election now?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I'm not a hundred percent sure what that means. It's not -- I think that the candidates are going to find that.</p><p>SEGALL: Are you seeing anything new or interesting?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: What we see are a lot of folks trying to sew division. Right? So that was a major tactic that we saw Russia try to use in the 2016 election. Actually most of what they did was not directly, as far as we can tell from the data that we've seen, was not directly about the election, but was more about just dividing people.</p><p>You know, so they'd run a group for pro-immigration reform and they'd run another group against immigration reform to just try to pit people against each other. And a lot of this was done with fake accounts that we could do a better job of tracing and using AI tools to be able to scan and observe a lot of what is going on and I'm confident that we're going to do a much better job.</p><p>SEGALL: Lawmakers in the United States and the U.K. are asking you to testify. Everybody wants you to show up. Will you testify before Congress?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: So the short answer is I'm happy to, if it's the right thing to do. Facebooktestifies in Congress regularly on a number of topics, some high profile and some not. And our objective is always to provide Congress, who does an extremely important job, to have the most information that they can.</p><p>[02:20:04] We see a small slice of activity on Facebook, but Congress gets to have access to the information across Facebookand all other companies and the intelligence community and everything. So what we try to do is send the person at Facebookwho will have the most knowledge about what Congress is trying to learn.</p><p>So if that's me, then I am happy to go. What I thin we've found so far is the typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there will be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.</p><p>SEGALL: You are the brand of Facebook. You are the name of Facebook. People want to hear from you.</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: That's why I'm doing this interview. But, you know, I think that there is -- the question in a question of congressional testimony is what is the goal, right? And that's not a media opportunity or at least it is not supposed to be. The goal there I think is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job.</p><p>And we just want to make sure that we send whoever is best informed at doing that. I agree separately that there is an element of accountability where I should be out there doing more interviews. And you know -- as uncomfortable as it is for me to do a T.V. interview, I think this is an important thing that as a discipline for what we are doing I should be out there and being asked hard questions by journalists.</p><p>SEGALL: Knowing what you know now, do you believe Facebookimpacted the results of the 2016 election?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: That's -- that is hard. You know, I think that it is -- it's really hard for me to have a full assessment of that. You know, it's -- the -- the reality is -- well, there were so many different forces at play. The organic posting that people did, the get out to vote campaigns that we ran, the pages that both candidates run, the advertising that they did, I'm sure that all of that activity had some impact.</p><p>It's hard for me to assess how much that stacked up compared to all the campaign events and advertising that was done off of Facebookand all of the other efforts. And I think it's also hard to fully assess the impact of that. That organic activity which we are actually quite proud of --</p><p>SEGALL: And also the bad actors.</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: And the bad stuff. That's something. I think it is hard to fully assess.</p><p>SEGALL: Given the stakes here, why shouldn't Facebookbe regulated?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated. You know, I think in general technology is an increasing -- increasingly important trend in the world and I actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather than \"yes or no, should it be regulated?\"</p><p>SEGALL: What's the right regulation?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Well there's some basic things, then I think there are some big intellectual debates. On the basic side, I think there are things like ads transparency regulation that I would love to see. If you look at how much regulation there is around advertising on TV and print, it's just not clear why there should be less on the internet.</p><p>We should have the same level of transparency required. And I don't know if a bill is going to pass. I know a couple of senators are working really hard on this, but we are committed and we've actually already started rolling out ad transparency tools that accomplish most of the things that are in all the bills that people are talking about today because this is an important thing.</p><p>People should know who is buying the ads that they see on Facebook, and you should be able to go on any page and see all the ads that people are running to different audiences.</p><p>SEGALL: How has being a father changed your commitment to users, changed your commitment to their future and what a kinder Facebooklooks like?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Well, I think, having kids changes a lot. And --</p><p>SEGALL: Like what?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Well, you know I used to think that the most important thing to me by far was, you know my having the greatest positive impact across the world that I can and, now I really just care about building something that my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for. And that's what is kind of my guiding philosophy at this point is and you know I come and work on a lot of hard things during the day and I go home and just ask will my girls be proud of what I did today?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Laurie Segall joins us now from San Francisco. Laurie, congratulations. A good exclusive to get. And I guess the big headline out of this, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>sort of all but admitting that Facebookmay have influenced the outcome of the U.S. election. And then adding that maybe now is the time that regulations are needed.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes, it's interesting to hear a tech leader say that. You know he said the right kind of regulation is important, but you know normally you don't hear them come out and say that. You have lawmakers calling for Facebookto be regulated, calling for the big tech companies to be regulated. You usually feel a lot more push back.</p><p>[02:25:01] I think <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said we need a more thoughtful approach, John.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. I wonder how will this go down with the other big tech companies like Google and Twitter. How will they react to this?</p><p>SEGALL: Look, I think it's a big moment. And I will say, you know, I think all tech companies are under a lot of pressure at this moment. We have had a year of unintended consequences. We've seen the weaponization of all these platforms.</p><p>I think we focus a lot on Facebookbecause Facebookis very personal to us and we have seen the Russian influence on Facebook. It has been a year for Facebookwhere we saw a lot of bad actors take advantage of the platform.</p><p>So I think the pressure is on. I'll tell you this, John. You know Mark doesn't like doing on camera interview because he is very nervous. He would rather be kind of behind the scenes with the engineers working on the product. But I think we kind of reach this pivotal point where we also need our tech leaders to step up and talk about some of these unintended consequences, some of the nuance behind the challenges that they are facing that come along with this really powerful technology.</p><p>VAUSE: It's only a guess, but I'm guessing he also does not like testifying before Congress, but he said he would. But then he added, if it's the right thing to do. It's hard to imagine how it would be the wrong thing to do.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes, you know he said it for various -- all -- very specific and he said maybe, you know, for the right thing. I wonder what that right thing is and what I said to him is, you know, you are the brand, you are the face of Facebook, in a way that's bigger than other tech founders. You know, you don't think -- when you think of Microsoft, sure some folks may know the CEO is Satya Nadella.</p><p>But when you think of Facebook, most people around the world know <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>as the CEO. That's why when you see a tough year like Facebookhave, when you see a tough last couple of days that Facebookhas had when it comes to knowing that the data was used for nefarious purposes, I really do think that people want to see Mark. I think it's interesting and newsy that he said he could potentially will be -- for the the right reasons be willing to testify.</p><p>VAUSE: Laurie, a good exclusive, a good get, and thank you for being with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: Next here on \"Newsroom L.A.,\" the U.S. is about to fire the next shot in what could become a trade war with China. The question now is how will Beijing respond?</p><p>And back home at last. The emotional return of more than 100 school girls who were kidnapped last month in Nigeria.</p><p>VAUSE: Thanks for staying with us. You're watching \"CNN Newsroom\" live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause. We will check the headlines this hour. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Facebook's CEO has apologized for the reported misuse of users' data, calling it a massive breach of trust.</p><p>[02:30:05] <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said he is open to the idea of social media regulation and will testify before Congress, adding if it is the right thing to do.</p><p>Police in Austin, Texas say a serial bomber recorded a 25-minute video describing the devices he made before blowing himself up. The time bombs killed two people and wounded five others over the past three weeks. Police say security in front of FedEx or is crucial in tracking him down.</p><p>For the coming hours, U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is expected to announced new tariffs on Chinese imports. It's not known what products will be targeted but their total value is expected to be around $60 billion representing more than 10 percent of Chinese imports to the U.S. last year. All this on top of duties and steel and aluminum or aluminum depending where you live. That goes into effect on Friday.</p><p>Andrew Stevens is live in Hong Kong, aluminum, aluminum, you know, OK. If past is prolonged that it's a fair bet, Beijing will not be too happy about these new tariffs.</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think it's fair to say that, John, what Beijing does, we all wait to see. They are more than likely I suspect to launch some sort of retaliatory action even as the senior leadership said this a couple of days ago that they don't want a trade war. It is in the interests of no one and they wanted to fight to any trade issues through multilateral organization like the World Trade Organization. But as you say, this is -- this is potentially $50 or $60 billion worth of tariffs and from the U.S. side, from <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>side particularly what it does is, A, tackle that yawning trade deficit the U.S. has $325 billion deficit with China. But it also punishes China about what the U.S. sees and what a lot of U.S. industry sees as theft of intellectual property, U.S. intellectual property. When you're a U.S. company going into China, you're a high-tech company, any company, you invariably have to form a joint venture with a local partner and then there is a technology transfer.</p><p>So the technology you have goes to China. On top of that, there are real concerns they have there for many, many years that cyber theft by the Chinese all the U.S. trade secrets and also a more recent phenomenon, John, is the move by Chinese companies to acquire sort of sensitive industry companies in the U.S., you know, in high-tech chipmakers for example. But that acquisition is being funded by the state. Beijing is bankrolling some of these acquisitions and that is also a clearly worrying the U.S. So we shouldn't be surprised the U.S. is going after this -- after this breach of intellectual property. And in fact, it's probably getting quite a warm reception in industry in the U.S.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. Although, the criticism is it's a sledge hammer to fix a problem when we need a pair of fine pliers or something. I don't know much about tools. Andrew, thank you. Good to see you.</p><p>STEVENS: Thanks, john.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Well, most of the 110 school girls' kidnapped in Nigeria last month are back home with their families. They were released by the terror group Boko Haram on Wednesday. Five girls reportedly died while they were held hostage. The Nigerian government says no ransom was paid and denies reports the military and police received warnings in the hours before the kidnapping but failed to act. Bukky Shonibare joins us now from Abuja, Nigeria. She's a member of the Bring Back Our Girls Movement and is the founder of the group focus of running girls access to quality education. Bukky, thank you for taking the time to be with us. The Nigerian government says there was no ransom was paid, nothing was given in exchange for the girls. So why were they released by Boko Haram? What's in it for them? Why would they do this?</p><p>BUKKY SHONIBARE, MEMBER OF BRING BACK OUR GIRLS MOVEMENT: For Boko Haram to have abducted our girls in the first place means that there was an objective. There was a motive. There was something that they need to get out of it. So when the federal government of Nigeria comes out to say that no ransom was paid, none of the soldiers were released, it puts to question what exactly was actually put on the table for Boko Haram to release our girls? They wouldn't just come to that take the girls and then take them, and then after one month they think it's the best thing to do to girls bring them back. And when you look at the issue of the Chibok girls, the federal government also at some point denied that they gave ransom. But \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports came out just late last year showing the amount of millions of U.S. dollars paid. Again, it's only a matter of time the truth will still come out. But I don't think it is proper for the government of Nigeria to keep those lies on because when the truth is going to be found out, it will boost the confident and trust that we the people need to have in our government.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. The truth always comes out. And you know, wouldn't it be better for them to actually release the truth rather than, you know, coming out Iips and drabs. You mention the families of the Chibok girls, that was four years ago and many of those girls are still being held today. This must be a really difficult day for the parents of those girls who are still being held. What have they been saying?</p><p>[02:35:12] SHONIBARE: You know, the coincidental events that happened was Tuesday night about 30 of the parents actually arrived in Dapchi to, you know, pay condolence. I'm sorry. To pay solidarity visit to the parents of the Dapchi girls. And then on Wednesday morning, the girls -- that was yesterday morning and then the Dapchi girls will go back. So imagine them having to experience that after life where Boko Haram returned the Dapchi girls while they are still waiting for four years. So I think it brings back the pain and the agony of their girls being missing for that long.</p><p>VAUSE: Gosh. It's hard to imagine what those parents must have been going through for such a long time.</p><p>SHONIBARE: It is. VAUSE: Just generally, though, you know, there are these reports which the government denies that there was apparently, you know, an attempt to tip off the military and the police in the hours before these latest kidnapping took place. They deny that there's no any such tipoffs. But in a general sense, how safe do girls feel when they are at school especially when they're in these areas where these abductions have occurred?</p><p>SHONIBARE: When Chibok girls' abduction happened, one of the things we expected and we as a group called for was that there must be an extra fortification and security of schools. And you see then that untouchable girls are best for were shut down for a certain number of months before they were reopened. And now we have the Dapchi girls abduction happening. So it means that the proper security that should be provided for girls has not been provided in that region. The question then now is, now that the Dapchi girls were abducted and going back school, we're also shut down. What is the Government of Nigeria now doing? So again, if I'm not sure that another abduction will happen just maybe the Dapchi girls are put. It means the central government is not securing schools. This is a region that costs about $10.5 million out of school children and the higher percentage of those are actually girls.</p><p>One Boko Haram returned those girls yesterday, they keep telling the parents of the girls don't go back to western education, don't go back to school. It further endanger education and if the government does not break this cycle of watching the insurgents come to take our girls, they evoke people's emotions and then get some of their men release and then come back to launch the same attack. If we don't put a stop to that cycle, it means our girls education particularly will continue to be in danger. So the responsibilities on the Government to Nigeria to protect schools enough, so that we can promote girls child education and education generally in that region which is not the case now.</p><p>VAUSE: It's just a very much basic of government responsibilities and services. Kids can go to school and they can go to school in safety everywhere. It should be everywhere but clearly it's not but it should be. Bukky, thank you so much. We appreciate your time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you very much.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Next strikes are expected in France on Thursday. Why traveling in the country may not be the only challenge many will be facing? We'll explain in just a moment.</p><p>[02:40:35] VAUSE: So apparently traveling in France will be a challenge on Thursday I supposed to every other time of the week -- any other day of the week. Seven labor unions are vowing to walk out in a nationwide strike to protest plan to economic reform. Among them rail works, air traffic controllers, even school, and hospital workers. Here's Jim Bittermann reporting from Paris.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: For decades, French leaders have tried to reform the nation's economy and while they've had some successes, there have been some spectacular failures, as unions, especially in the public sector have pushed back against attempts to change workplace rules.</p><p>In this case, the protest against Jacques Chirac's plans in 1995 went on for weeks, brought the country to a halt and contributed to the downfall of Prime Minister Alain Juppe. There's been one attempt after another since and now French President <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>who was elected on a promise to enact reforms and would began the process shortly after Election Day is taking on the most difficult one yet, modifying the work rules in the public transportation sector. For economists like Pascal Perri, it's long overdue. If for no other reason, then France is facing a deadline at the end of the year when European Railway Systems must open up the competition, meaning that there could soon be German and Italian trains running on French tracks.</p><p>PASCAL PERRI, ECONOMIST: It's a question of competitiveness, of, you know, profitability. So today, the government has decided to play its role.</p><p>BITTERMANN: Perri points out that the French Rail System runs at a loss each year and it's currently 50 billion Euros in debt. But French railway workers, some of whom, are unemployed under work rules that go back to World War II in the days of coal-fired locomotives are resisting any attempt to tamper with their pay, pension, or benefits. Once more, they fear the government as is done in other sector is heading towards privatizing the rail system, a system some union leaders think should be entirely free.</p><p>BRUNO PONCET, GOVERNING COUNCIL, SUD RAIL (through translator): We want to explain everyone that like medical costs, healthcare costs, and education, transportation should be free in order to have true social equality in France.</p><p>BITTERMANN: Even among the other unions involved, not everyone would agree with that. But the union leader says that he believes that public service employees and other sectors like the ones he mentioned will join the railway workers on Thursday for strikes that could continue well beyond this week.</p><p>In fact, the leadership of one rail union is calling for a labor action from April through June at a pace of two strike days for every three days' work, an innovative protest that could infuriate rail users and bedevil the government. Whatever the outcome, barring a last minute compromise, the government and passengers could be in for some trying times ahead. Jim Bittermann, CNN Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Thank you for watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause. World Sport is up next. You're watching CNN.</p><p>[02:45:12] KATE RILEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS ANCHOR: Hello and welcome along to WORLD SPORT. I'm Kate Riley at CNN Center. Well, in recent weeks, the spotlight has well and truly fallen on the Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>Just last week, United went crashing out of the Champions League at the hands of Sevilla. And their performance at Old Trafford left much to be desired. But afterwards, the Special One's post-game comments drew plenty of scrutiny. He claimed United losing at home in the Champion's League was nothing new.</p><p>And then, went on to the Sevilla dressing room to congratulate them on their win, a gesture which is actually earned a round of applause from the visiting team. But the next day, Mourinho, then went on a 12- minute rant questioning his club's recent history and heritage, and pointing to the fact rivals Manchester City have finished above United in every season since 2013.</p><p>On Saturday, United be brightened, 2-0 to book a place in the FA Cup semi-finals. But to Mourinho, there was a very little to celebrate, he accused his side of \"A lack of personality, lack of class and lack of desire.\" The FA Cup could be the only chance to serve well the season, as they sit 16 points behind City in English Premier League title race.</p><p>Well earlier, CNN's Amanda Davies has to speak to Jose Mourinho. He's in Basel, Switzerland right now managing one of the teams for the Hublot Match of Friendship. Coaching against Argentina's iconic Diego Maradona. Both team speech of past legends of the game. Plus one, their special guest, Olympic sprint champion <person><nameText>Usain Bolt, </nameText></person>no less. And Amanda started by asking Mourinho, about that lightning quick member of his team.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANDA DAVIES, CNN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Thank you so much for your time. Have you got any plans to make <person><nameText>Usain Bolt, </nameText></person>a permanent member of your team?</p><p>JOSE MOURINHO, MANAGER, PREMIER LEAGUE CLUB MANCHESTER UNITED: No, I don't have these plans. But was amazing to meet him and was amazing to share football celebration with so many legends, with so many players that we, we love them when they were playing, and we respect them even now because of what they did for our game. That has a meaning as a double -- a double meaning for me is the meaning of a -- for what he represents in the history of sports and also what he represents in the history of humanity. But has a double -- a double meaning for me is that is --- a Manchester United supporter and my feeling towards Manchester United supporters is always that feeling of gift of everything I can, everything I have to try to make them happy.</p><p>DAVIES: You mentioned the Manchester United fans. I, myself, I'm one who's to spend 30 ordeals going to Old Trafford supporting Manchester United. Do you think the United fans have a realistic expectation of success at Old Trafford this days? MOURINHO: I think, there have the passion, and everyone with passion has the biggest and the best expectations about their football clubs. And in daystar in football all around the world not just in England, you had the biggest clubs with moments of transition. You'll have the biggest clubs with moments of continues and permanent victories. And this are faces in the club. And I think really in this moment looking to us in the Premier League, we have one team clearly, one club clearly better prepared than us in the past few years to be first.</p><p>And we have 18 clubs behind us. One in front of us, 18 behind us. Of course, in the future, we want to have 19 behind us, but this is the reality. And the reality is for people with brain, with sense, with common sense, with knowledge of what's sports is. We are in the moment of transition, and being in the moment of transition, hence, to manage to do what we did last season and win trophies. And to do what we are trying to do this season which is still trying to win a trophy and try to be second. Because in this moment is the only opposition that is possible for us to bear it as if we are in the good position -- in a good position.</p><p>DAVIES: Do you want the team to be playing exciting football?</p><p>[02:50:00] MOURINHO: What do you mean by that?</p><p>DAVIES: Football that gets the Old Trafford crowd on the edge of their seat that is attacking that season going forward there and taking their opportunities.</p><p>MOURINHO: Like we did against Chelsea and against Liverpool, do you mean that?</p><p>DAVIES: But perhaps, not against Sevilla.</p><p>MOURINHO: OK. Yes, yes. It's like then, you are right.</p><p>DAVIES: But do you understand the criticism that you have been getting from some quarters as to why the fans have been frustrated?</p><p>MOURINHO: No, I don't. I understand the frustration, I understand the sadness of being knocked out in the -- in the Champions League, but I don't understand anything more than that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RILEY: All right, thanks to Jose for his time there. And the fastest man on the planet, <person><nameText>Usain Bolt </nameText></person>is also a Manchester United fan. Went all out to impress the gaffer on the up to many. Known for being light on his feet, and on the day he certainly was a spot actually went on to score a goal in the game which ended 11 goals to 11. Speaking after that not so surprising draw, the Jamaican said he has no regret after leaving the track.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>USAIN BOLT, </nameText></person>EIGHT-TIME OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST, SPRINTS: I think, I've done everything that I want to do in sport. Just so I just kind of trying to move on to football because it would be a new challenge, and I need something difficult for me to do, and to be challenge me. And just what I want on track and field that where I started out. It was very challenging, I had to work to get a great. So, for me, I want to do something else that would challenge --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RILEY: Good for him. While elsewhere in the U.K. and the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has asked for reassurances over fan's safety in Russia this summer. He is seeking promises from the authorities in Russia that found traveling to the World Cup will be safe. The comments come amid an escalating war of words between Russia and Britain. Amid the poisoning of a former Russian double agent on British soil. Earlier this month, he told members of parliament on Wednesday that 24,000 fans from the U.K. had applied for tickets for the global tournament.</p><p>Coming up, the show must go on despite heightened security. The newly revamped world Match Play golf tournament is now on the way on Austin. See how native Texan Jordan Spieth is pairing, coming up next.</p><p>RILEY: Well, that with tennis news now. Well, the most famous woman in the sport, Serena Williams, took to the court against Japan's Naomi Osaka, in the opening round at the Miami Open earlier. Osaka, of course, straight back on the court after making headlines at the weekend. Serena was one -- was once the world No. 1 when she stopped playing to have her first child.</p><p>However, she now has ranked 491st in the world as he returns to action this week. That means that Serena isn't unseeded a player here. And therefore, could be matched up with anyone and thus was matched with the Indian world winner from the week, and the often coming, Osaka.</p><p>The WTA seeding rule has been criticize by many including the Miami tournament director himself, James Blake. And it was the 20 year old Japanese star, he cruise part the 8-time champion here in straight sets. Osaka really made Serena worked hard leaving her around the court and that was a big key to this victory.</p><p>Osaka wins the first ever meeting between the two. And will now face 4th seed, and Ukrainian world No. 4, Elina Svitolina in round two. While Osaka's response may be what you'd expect from a 20 year old. Yes, you can see on Twitter there, OMG and a great picture of the two. The young sister off was that she was so nervous to play Serena because she is her all-time favorite player. But she had extra motivation as she wanted to impress her, no doubt that she did.</p><p>Well, as you been seeing in our new shows, tensions have heightened in on a roundly often Texas area after a string of package bombings left two people dead. And on through the man believed to be behind that all is dead, PGA Tour officials increased security measures as the Word Golf Championship in Austin, got underway on Wednesday. Most of the players who with expect to be in contention with the exception of Tiger Woods are an action this week. Preparing for The Masters, which begins in two weeks' time.</p><p>And it tweet the format of it's one in recent years rather than a series of one on one lookout matches. This one start of 16 groups of four players, only one of him can progress from the first round. And Texas native, Jordan Spieth is off to a sizzling start. He defeated the South African Charl Schwartzel, thanks in large part to a brilliant approach shot here on the 14th (INAUDIBLE) birdie. Spieth beat Schwartzel, two and one, to take the opening round robin.</p><p>Match his friend and rival, Justin Thomas got a 2-up victory over Luke List. But credit to list were hanging on in there after breaking his par through on the 60, and having to par with this (INAUDIBLE) more than half the round. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>All right.

And take a look here, you can actually see that it was not a drop of red, not a drop of red at all, we were firmly in the green the whole day, we ended the day up a triple digit -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Certainly, a rebound after yesterday after that Facebook data scandal we saw yesterday so a rebound, the markets are squarely focused over the next two days on what happens with the Fed and raising interest rates we'll see about that tomorrow.</p><p>Oh, and it is Tuesday, March 20th.</p><p>Tonight, lawmakers worldwide demand to grill Marc Zuckerberg; the E.U. Justice Commissioner tells us tonight a full investigation maybe next.</p><p>And social media stocks thrive as Facebook share price drop even further.</p><p>And Toyota gives a timeout to its autonomous cars after a fatal Uber crash.</p><p>Hello my friends, I'm Zain Asher and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>All right welcome everyone as the calls grow form Marc Zuckerberg to be held accountable for the Facebook data scandal tonight the E.U. is warning there could be a fraud investigation, there could be a fraud investigation because data was allegedly used without users' permissions.</p><p>So inside and outside of Facebook, inside and outside of Facebook there is growing frustrations about the fact that we really haven't heard anything from Marc Zuckerberg the CEO, complete radio silence from him however there has been plenty of noise from the E.U., the U.K., Congress and the Federal Trade Commission as well, they all want to know whether Facebook user data was improperly used.</p><p>Facebook share price still suffering, down another 2 1/2 percent around 50 billion, $50 billion has been wiped off the value of Facebook just this week, so just in the past few days.</p><p>What you won't find comments though on Marc Zuckerberg's Facebook page, lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic say it is certainly well overdue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE PARTY MP: I think the time is come where someone out the company like Marc Zuckerberg whose job it is to understand every detail of what Facebook does, they he - that he actually now takes a public position and answers questions on this because our experience of dealing with Facebook in the past is you often get you know, evasive answers, partial answers to questions, people saying they don't have the information.</p><p>But now is the time for the people who do have the information to speak.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), CHAIR, STEERING COMMITTEE: I think he should explain to the American people how this happened, how many people were hurt, and most importantly how they're going to fix it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE: I think that we ought to have the testimony not only of the Facebook CEO but I think the CEOs of other major social media platforms that the Russians exploited during the campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER SENATE COMMITTEES ON APPROPRIATIONS; BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS; BUDGET; COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY; SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP: I'd like Mr. Zuckerberg to come. Last time he sent his lawyers, I don't know what he pays, them but they did a damn good job because they didn't say anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Well you can see that, a lot of lawmakers in the United States really, really want answers from Marc Zuckerberg right now.</p><p>Earlier the European Commissioner for Justice, Vera Jourova told me she believes that Facebook broke E.U. rules.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSUMERS: In our rules already now, we have clearly stipulated that the processing of data of private date of people can be only done under the condition of the well- informed consent of each individual.</p><p>So, what's happening now or what we know about recent scandal is that millions of people and their data were processed and harvested without their content - consent and we are going to launch the investigations in several member states starting with the United Kingdom to find the facts and the information about what happened and to what extent our data protection rules have been breached.</p><p>And according to what we know about it now the rules have been breached, the United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law conditions because there might be even fraud found so they - there will be the procedure launched very soon and it will be coordinated across the whole E.U. because it must be that there is also for some other member states.</p><p>ASHER: OK but in terms of figuring out and getting to the bottom of what happened what questions would you like to see answered specifically by Marc Zuckerberg?</p><p>JOUROVA: What are - there are many questions I would like to ask Facebook how is it possible that they disappointed the trust of the people who gave them their privacy - private data and who didn't expect that the data will be [0:05:13] abused in such a way that later they will be manipulated ahead of the elections.</p><p>I think that these are very threatening facts or developments and we have very serious concerns that such practices could be detrimental to democracy and to the fundamental rights of individual people so that's why I have a lot of questions I want to ask also Facebook and I will very probably write a letter with several questions for instance why Facebook hasn't - haven't - didn't react earlier, why there was not early enough notification to the individual people.</p><p>Many other questions and of course we have the obligation to ask because we must be much better in protecting the privacy of people.</p><p>ASHER: Here's the thing, just you know, according to Facebook, this is - this is basically an honest mistake. Essentially, they trusted this academic researcher, Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan and he was the one who mishandled the data so if this is just an honest mistake, if this is just an honest mistake, should we be careful about going too far in terms of how the E.U. punishes Facebook for this?</p><p>JOUROVA: I would not call it a mistake but for sure it's going too far. I am personally very sensitive about manipulation of the - of the people and just imagine you entrust somebody you give him your data and then you find out that it has been abused and you were the object of manipulation.</p><p>We in Europe are very sensitive about that, that's why we want to have the consent of all the individuals when they are providing their data to understand what is the purpose for which the IT company asks for the data and what will be happening with the data.</p><p>And from May this year, we will have even stricter rules so which will give more rights to the individuals. And here I see the deputy in the European Union and the United States legislation because we are more careful and more sensitive and more strict on the protection of privacy of people.</p><p>ASHER: Yes, the European Union - Europeans are certainly more strict but in terms of - in terms of a solution it's not just about individuals figuring out privacy settings and that sort of thing it's also about Facebook creating new policies about how it handles third-party access to its data, that's really the key here, third-party access?</p><p>JOUROVA: It has to be the subject of investigation, what happens there. In my view Facebook should have been much more careful and keep asking about the purpose may be not believe so easily that there is the research going on and when they had the first indication that something goes wrong, they should've asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and not to use it anymore.</p><p>I think that something has been neglected or was neglected some time ago and we want to understand better what exactly happened and who should be blamed for what.</p><p>And European Union is known for imposing quite drastic sanctions in such cases and we will not hesitate to use this follow-up because this case might be also used as a deterrent case for the future possible cases.</p><p>(END AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: All right no sign of this man, you see on your screen, Facebook see of course, Marc Zuckerberg one of the most recognizable CEOs in the world.</p><p>However, Facebook tells us that it will brief, it will brief multiple congressional committees.</p><p>Right joining us now is Laurie Segall.</p><p>So, Laurie here's what I don't get, why on earth would it make sense for Marc Zuckerberg to stay silent at a time like this?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN TECH, EDITOR-AT-LARGE: I mean I think it's a question we are all asking. We as the press, we ask that question we want to hear from him, the public wants to hear from him, and what's really interesting to me is actually Facebook executives people have told me, high level executive within the company have said, we want to hear him too (ph).</p><p>ASHER: They don't get it either.</p><p>SEGALL: You know, I think this is a very protective story. There's a lot of nuance there and Marc Zuckerberg, Cheryl Sandberg these are brand names, people want to talk to them at this time and there's this feeling from a couple of folks I spoke to that he gets involved too late, he's not getting his hands dirty, he's always very involved behind the scenes.</p><p>You know, a lot of folks will say he's a very respected leader, he is in all these meetings, he is very, very, involved in these important conversations, we as the public when we look at our data when we look at what's happened, when we look at all of these challenging questions, the weaponization (ph) of Facebook over the last year for democracy, what it's doing to mental health, we [0:05:14] want the leader Facebook to step forward and I think there's growing pressure mounting not just with us here, with the public but within the company for him to speak publicly on this thing.</p><p>ASHER: And in terms of you know, you talked about Marc Zuckerberg and the Facebook team just being in crisis meetings all day, just in terms of where they go from here, their priority is not just you know, meeting with lawmakers it's also figuring out a way to regain the public trust at a time that this, how do they do that?</p><p>SEGALL: I think that it's so important, I think transparency is going to one of the biggest things you know, Marc might not like to speak what I want to remind you, this isn't self-serving, I want to remind you that I spoke to him in June and he actually was talking about his role as a leader in this moment in time, he said to me at the time, he wants to make the world a better place, take a listen?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK: I just feel like we have a responsibility to do more in the world.</p><p>Right and when you look at the world today, you know, giving people a voice and helping people connect our good and have made the world better in a lot of ways but our society still very divided right and that means that people need to work proactively to help bring people closer together, it's not just enough to help or simply connect we need to work to bring the world closer together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL: And I think you could argue that at this moment Facebook hasn't brought the world closer together and I think we are actually at this point (ph) -</p><p>ASHER: I'm - I'm going to be the opposite (ph) actually.</p><p>SEGALL - Yes, and I think we all asking these questions and what I think when you ask the question about what can they do you know, a lot of the leaders I spoke to behind closed doors say that we are having these massively important ethical questions about the future that come along with this you know, with having a platform this size, they say we want to have these conversations.</p><p>You know, one person said to me you know, cracking down on fake news is important but it can also lead to censorship of independent news, we have to have these ethical conversations; these are conversations that should be a public discussion and I think we as the public because our data is out there we are hearing more about it, we want to know and be a part of these discussions as well.</p><p>ASHER: It does feel like a watershed moment for Facebook -</p><p>SEGALL: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: - where people you know, there's a reckoning really.</p><p>Laurie Segall, live for us, thank you -</p><p>SEGALL: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: - so much, yes.</p><p>OK so meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica has suspended its chief executive after he was secretly filmed boasting, boasting about using dirty tricks to help clients.</p><p>The data firm says Alexander Nix's comments with an undercover reporter, \"Channel 4\" do not reflect the values of the company and promised a full independent investigation.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh is joining us live now from London with more on this.</p><p>So, Nick when you look at parts of this documentary, aside from talking about entrapping political opponents with bribery and sex and that sort of thing, there was one line that really caught my attention by Nix in this documentary where he talks about, he said, 'it doesn't have to be true, it just have to be believed.' It does not have to be true, it just have to be believed.</p><p>In terms of targeting voters in and around election campaign, where do you draw the line between persuasion and outright manipulation?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well I should point out too Cambridge Analytica in that same undercover filming say they are not in the business of fake news or providing false information but yes, you know, there's a lot in what they say undercover as well, I should point out, which they claim is scripted and edited to work in - against them, a lot there that doesn't necessarily make them the most trustworthy advocates.</p><p>And certainly, the company's own decision to suspend their CEO Alexander Nix certainly speaks you might say volumes to quite how they feel about the allegations being perceived and certainly they have a big struggle with their message as a messaging company over the past couple of days.</p><p>The decision to suspend Mr. Nix actually emerged minutes before \"Channel 4 News\" broadcast the third of their reports about the company's use of data and political moves there.</p><p>But your point earlier about whether the truth matters still or not is a key sensitivity here as well because they talk about yes, well you can't fight elections on facts, well you shouldn't fight elections on facts, you should fight them on emotions and I think that plays certainly to wire their story may be chimes with so many people at this stage.</p><p>After here in the United Kingdom seeing the Brexit vote go through in the favor towards leaving the European Union, some say based on many spurious promises by lead (ph) campaigners; by Donald Trump's much I think it's fair to say heralded use of falsity at times and his election as well, it may well be that social media in the eyes of many now is perhaps being viewed less as a sort of a tool, as Laurie was saying of bringing the world together, making us more closer to each other and perhaps way over sort of amplifying falsity or certain opinions that may not be necessarily given to you because they are true, may be given to you because actually they sort of play on various chords and amplifier fears and make you vote in a certain direction.</p><p>ASHER: Yes. If anything, someone argued it is actually made the world a lot more divisive. Just in terms of Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica, has it been proven that he did use all the tactics that he talked about in that \"Channel 4\" documentary or was it a mix of you know, bravado and [0:05:14] exaggeration?</p><p>PATON WALSH: I certainly have to say, when I heard him talk about the idea of using Ukrainian sex workers and undercover filming of an - of opposition politician accepting a bribe, I thought to myself, well why on earth would you need to spend millions hiring outside consultants, suggests too of a more hand-fisted way of compromising a political candidate.</p><p>So, you could perhaps argue that by suggesting those he was to somewhat degree lazy.</p><p>The other I - things suggested by his colleagues I mean that was clear to some degree that they were selling their previous products and some of the undercover filming suggested they'd massively influenced recent elections in Kenya, obviously we don't know the full extent of that there, we don't know the full extent really there.</p><p>Their influence on the U.S. election campaign, in fact indeed they say, some of the data harvested was done too late to be any use them at all in the work that they did in Donald Trump's selection in 2016 but certainly you're presented with the idea of a man who has a pretty broad moral contest to some degree in terms of what he's willing to offer although I should point out he defends himself by saying, in those circumstances he was in fact going along with a ridiculous suggestion by the undercover reporter from Sri Lanka or allegedly that \"Channel 4\" put in front of him.</p><p>So, a confused situation in terms of its context but it leaves you certainly questioning exactly what kind of role consultancies like Cambridge Analytica genuinely have in the political process and quite what's that's doing to states of democracy around the world.</p><p>Zain?</p><p>ASHER: A broad moral contest as you put it. Interesting way of putting it, OK.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh live for us there.</p><p>PATON WALSH: I'm being euphemistic. All right.</p><p>ASHER: Thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p>OK so everybody wants a moment with Mnuchin, the U.S. Treasury Secretary faces his G20 colleagues as many secret explanations and exemption from President Trump's steel tariffs, up next [0:01:56].</p><p>ASHER: A very welcome back everybody.</p><p>So, the crisis at Facebook is dragging down social media stocks across the board. Facebook and Snap, the maker of Snapchat each fell as you see there 2 1/2 percent on Tuesday and look at that, Twitter, Twitter down more than 10 percent. By the way going back to Facebook, you know, they were just down 2 1/2 percent today, so far this week over the past couple of days they have lost more than $50 billion, $50 billion in market value just this week alone.</p><p>Twitter as I mentioned down $0.10, that's a one-month low and in to a correction technically, down more than 10 percent; shares started plunging when Israel justice minister threatened legal action against the company, the minister said, \"Twitter does not do enough of a good job in terms of removing terrorist material.\"</p><p>So much to talk about, Claire Sebastian, joining us now.</p><p>So, here's the thing, it does feel Claire, especially after yesterday, it does feel that we've reached this watershed moment, right where people are just having less patience for less tolerance for these tech companies and the amount of power they wield over data, we haven't really seen investors take flight in this way before because -</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN MONEY: Right.</p><p>ASHER: - when you talk about fifty billion dollars-worth of [0:05:13] value being shed off Facebook that is no small thing.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right. And I think it is interesting you know, we saw the worst days of Facebook in four years yesterday and I saw might've thought that people might buy on the dip today and that wasn't to be.</p><p>And I think it's worth in the context of investors taking their emotion out of this issue to the extent you look at what - when Facebook and Twitter and Snap report earnings, what people are looking for is user growth and ad growth and this scandal could affect both of those.</p><p>You have the letter from the FTC today, this could affect the whole way that Facebook does business. You've got the issue of user growth and the Zeitgeist just went on the list but around social media it's - it's changing, you've got hashtag-delete-Facebook going around on Twitter, people are starting to talk more about this.</p><p>And I want to bring in Ross Gerber, he's a veteran tech investor and he says he selling out of Facebook, at least most of his holdings there, take a listen?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS GERBER, VETERAN TECH INVESTOR &amp; FACEBOOK SHAREHOLDER: I think - we're at peak social, this is the abuse of the public's trust that is beyond belief.</p><p>And when you look at the problems we've had with Brexit in England and in the United States with the divisiveness and the rise in hate, crimes and the - just the bad state of the world, we have to hold accountable that social media is not just about fun anymore, it's completely manipulated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So, you know, the sentiment around social media, his worry is that is - it's changing essentially and I think you know, he's not - he does - they're - not everyone thinks so.</p><p>Well I've spoken to another investor today, he says look, Facebook isn't just about Facebook, it also has Messenger, it also was Instagram, and it also has WhatsApp out there, there are other properties there.</p><p>Some people will be looking at the price of that stock today and thinking oh maybe this is time to come in, they are still strongly, are still making a lot of money but I think we are in a moment, and I think you should see that by the second day of fall.</p><p>ASHER: Let's talk about Twitter, down 10 percent. This is significant because in part and obviously social media is suffering right now but this is in part because Israel is threatening legal action against Twitter because Twitter isn't doing enough they say to combat you know, sort of terrorism instigation that happens on social media.</p><p>This is not the first time we've seen social media being used by you know, lone-wolf attackers for example or persuading people to join different terrorist groups but it does seem that the Israelis now certainly have a lot less patience for this?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Absolutely. And the justice minister in particular has been - has been particularly focused on this, she takes a Twitter this week and said you know, look we've - we've dealt with this in the past, with Facebook in 2016, she met with Facebook exec and they apparently complied with a lot of her requests to take down content that they felt was inciting violence.</p><p>She said they've asked Twitter to do the same, Twitter haven't responded and now she says they're threatened legal action.</p><p>But I think you can't see this separate from the rest of the context that's going on, this is the broader issue of fear among investors that platforms like Facebook, like Twitter are not in full control of their data, they don't seem to have full control over the types of content that is on their platforms.</p><p>ASHER: Incredible. Especially what Ross Gerber said about you know, we're seeing you know, pushing against not this fun, happy, place anymore you know, there is serious manipulation going on, that was quite chilling I find. OK.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p>Alright so, despite the social media rout, all three major U.S. markets ended the day in the green, let's take a look here.</p><p>OK so, at the end of the day, up 116 points, that earlier turnaround from what we saw yesterday, the Dow finished up nearly a half of a percent. All eyes now turn to the Fed which is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday, they are in a two-day meeting right now, the big question all of you will have is how frequently will we see interest rate rises this year although as I mentioned, they are expected to raise rates tomorrow.</p><p>All right, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted today that U.S. trade policy is not about protectionism but free and fair trade. Mnuchin spoke after attending 15 meetings at a summit of G20 Finance ministers in Buenos Aires.</p><p>The Treasury secretary is under pressure to explain, people want answers, he has to explain President Trump's new tariffs, a number of countries are seeking exemptions from Mnuchin are also weighing retaliate or measures at the same time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY, US: There's always a risk if we put tariffs on that other people will reciprocate and there is a risk of a trade war. As the president has said, we are not afraid of getting into a trade war given the size of our market, the size of our economy and the fact that we have a big trade deficit.</p><p>Having said that, that's not our goal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Earlier Tuesday, China's premier pledged to further open the country's economy adding he hoped that both the U.S. and China would act rationally and not be led by emotions into a trade war.</p><p>Challenging moment certainly for the U.S. Treasury secretary.</p><p>Patrick Gillespie joins us live now, so here's the thing, you and I discussed this earlier, Steve Mnuchin is a free trader, much like Gary Cohn -</p><p>PATRICK GILLESPIE, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: - how on earth did he go to a meeting with G20 and defend something [0:05:14] that deep down we all know that he doesn't really believe in?</p><p>GILLESPIE: Zain, Mnuchin is between a 'rock and a hard place' because he has to defend the White House trade policy which he has tried to steer away from the most extreme measures and sweeping tariffs, at the same time he has to assuage these concerns that the U.S. isn't about to spark a global trade war.</p><p>But as you mentioned several countries from South Korea to Argentina, to France, Germany, Italy, they are seeking exemptions at these meetings and they're not getting them.</p><p>And you know, Mnuchin tries to call the concern there by saying, 'well exemptions will come relatively quickly,' he told that to \"The New York Times\" but you're not getting any more -</p><p>ASHER: But -</p><p>GILLESPIE: - specificity.</p><p>ASHER: - you have until Friday right, so this is like three days, the tariffs are supposed to go into effect on Friday (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>GILLESPIE: The deadline -</p><p>ASHER: - three days -</p><p>GILLESPIE: - is coming up -</p><p>ASHER: - So how does he pick - if everybody -</p><p>GILLESPIE: - this is the last opportunity countries have to get a face-to- face with the U.S. administration.</p><p>ASHER: - but if everybody is begging him, you know, \"Oh, you know, Steve, can we get an exemption; can our country get an exemption?\" How does he choose who is friend and who is foe?</p><p>GILLESPIE: - Well, this is - the kind of opacity of the administration. They are not showing - they say there isn't a one-size-fits-all you know, metric or test to make country exempt and so every country is saying, you've - you've got countries like Argentina, which I would think would not be a threat to U.S. national security, saying, \"We import less than one percent of your steel. You know, we are not a risk of - we're not a national security risk to you,' and still the U.S. administration is saying, \"Will think about it.\"</p><p>ASHER: But here's - years the thing, President Trump has talked about defending national security and we can't have imports in terms of steel and aluminum because you know, we've got to defend national security. However, Mnuchin sort of change his language a little bit and talked about 'national interests' as opposed to 'national security,' why do you think he did that?</p><p>GILLESPIE: Well I think it gets to the core of that he doesn't you know, he has tried to walk back some of these most extreme trade measures Zain and so, when he adjusts the language a bit he, you know, he let - it allows him to say, 'well there is economic interest of play; there's jobs at play.' It -</p><p>ASHER: Could it be that it's quite difficult to push something you don't believe in yourself?</p><p>GILLESPIE: - OK.</p><p>ASHER: Maybe I shouldn't say that; I shouldn't say that, sorry, sorry.</p><p>GILLESPIE: I think it is difficult for him because you know, - before Gary Cohn left, it was Mnuchin and Gary Cohn who were postponing these specific tariffs, these were supposed to happen last summer Zain, and Gary Cohn and Mnuchin said, 'let's push it back for the last minute.'</p><p>Well, we are at that last-minute right now and now Mnuchin is still in the hot seat and he has to you know, be front-and-center in front of these countries saying, 'listen we are not going to start a trade war but we're not going to tell you if we're going to hit you with tariffs.'</p><p>ASHER: Oh, I do - I do not envy him at all.</p><p>OK, Patrick Gillespie, thank you.</p><p>GILLESPIE: Sure, we'll see on Friday.</p><p>ASHER: Thank you.</p><p>All right, coming up British lawmakers call for answers from Facebook, we'll hear from an MP who wants Marc Zuckerberg himself, he wants Marc Zuckerberg himself to testify at an inquiry into fake news, that's next [0:02:59].</p><p>[17:30:00] ZAIN ASHER, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello everyone, I'm Zain Asher. Coming up in the next top hour on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the head of U.K.'s parliament media committee says why it's time for Mark Zuckerberg to appear before British lawmakers.</p><p>And United Airlines ground its tech cargo business after sending too many dogs to the wrong destination. But first though, these are the top business headlines for you at this hour.</p><p>Regulators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are growing in their cause for Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg to speak about the data scandal of the social media giant. Speaking to me on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Europe's Justice Commissioner says she believes data protection rules have been broken.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, COMMISSIONER, JUSTICE, CONSUMERS &amp; GENDER EQUALITY, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: According to what we know about it now, the rules have been breached. The United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law or conditions, because of that it might be even fraud found.</p><p>So there will be a procedure launched very soon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: White House Press Secretary dodged a question Tuesday about whether the Russian election was free and fair. They came up after President Donald Trump said he congratulated Russian president Vladimir Putin on his reelection on Sunday.</p><p>That drew rebuke from Republican Senator John McCain. Mr. Trump met in the Oval Office, Tuesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and then may sat down for working lunch.</p><p>Prince Mohammed's reformist methods and the promise of Saudi investment in the U.S. have made him slightly quite popular with the Trump administration.</p><p>All right, so Toyota is pausing its driverless car testing in the wake of the fatal scandal involving an autonomous Uber car in Arizona. The car maker says Uber's incident is certainly unrelated to them, but it could certainly have an emotional effect on its drivers.</p><p>I want to bring in Samuel Burke who is following the story. So Samuel, do we expect other car companies and other tech companies to follow suit? Just so far, it's just Uber and Toyota.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: It certainly wouldn't surprise me, Zain, because I think there's an incredible amount of pressure on the people who are behind the wheel of the self-driving cars.</p><p>It sounds like a contradicting -- contradiction, but almost all of these vehicles certainly in Arizona have somebody behind the wheel. And of course, the first thing that people say when they hear this story is, if there was a driver behind the wheel during this incident in Tempe, why weren't they able to stop it?</p><p>So I actually just spoke with somebody who has one of these jobs in Arizona, and said that they feel the pressure, people don't realize how difficult it can be to be at the wheel of a car that's driving all the time.</p><p>It's easy to disengage even though it's your job when you're not actively doing it and you're passive the whole time. So they do feel this sense of pressure, so I wouldn't be surprised if other companies follow the steps that Toyota had taken.</p><p>But this is just a temporary measure, and let's be honest, this is the future of driving. We know that people will get back behind the wheel of these driverless cars, and I'm sure that Uber's program will continue much sooner than later.</p><p>ASHER: But are we going to see lease -- I mean, you mentioned, it's just temporary, fine. But are we going to see at least types of regulation in the mean time while they sort of figure this out.</p><p>Temporary regulation that block these driverless cars from testing in public streets.</p><p>BURKE: I actually just spoke to an executive at one of these companies who said that he doesn't expect that in large part, maybe some small measures here and there. Arizona, the state where this is happened, it's actually a hot bed of self-driving development.</p><p>And the state there, the governor has touted this as a real strong commerce point for Arizona, so there will likely be a pause, but they expect because this is benefitting a state like Arizona, even with this terrible strategy for it to go on.</p><p>But Zain, this is a learning moment, not just for humans, but for the actual cars. It's terrible to say this, but this is an important data point. You don't want to think of a life as a data point, but that's exactly what it has to be so that the cars can learn from this incident, see what they did wrong so that it doesn't happen again.</p><p>Remember the goal of this self-driving technology is to eliminate all of the human error that causes fatal accidents or non-fatal accidents. Of course, this time around, that's much harder to show.</p><p>[17:35:00] But it's a lot like fear of flying, everybody has it, even though statistically it's very unlikely. Yes, there's this uncomfortable sense around this tragedy, but almost all the numbers would show demonstrably that self-driving is much safer than us humans behind the wheel.</p><p>ASHER: Right, but perhaps, there should be some changes to make sure that it's easy for the drivers behind the driverless cars to actually stop it in the wake of potential accidents.</p><p>All right, Samuel Burke, live for us there, thank you so much. OK, guys, back to our top story tonight. British lawmakers want Mark Zuckerberg to testify at a parliamentary inquiry instead of fake news.</p><p>Earlier on, I spoke to the man leading those cause, conservative MP Damian Collins, and I asked him what he wants to hear from the Facebook CEO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR FOLKESTONE &amp; HYTHE: The questions that we asked when we had a policy hearing with Facebook in Washington last month which was -- we asked them about their relationship with Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>We asked what they do to keep user data safe, and also what they do to make sure they can effectively recover data if it ends up in the hands of a third party and then breach their own rules.</p><p>And it is data breach story we've been looking at. You know, we see unsatisfactory answers to all of those questions, and we certainly didn't get clear answers to those questions when we posed them last month.</p><p>They said then they would give us their written evidence to support that, they still hasn't come through. So I think the time has come where someone at the company like Mark Zuckerberg whose job it is to understand every detail of what Facebook does.</p><p>He actually now takes the public position and answers questions on this because our experience of dealing with Facebook in the past as you often get, you know, very stiff answers, partial answers to questions, people saying they don't have the information.</p><p>What now is the time for the people who do have the information to speak.</p><p>ASHER: Yes, we haven't heard from Mark Zuckerberg at all just in terms of him coming out and speaking to the public as our reporter Lori Siegel was just mentioning.</p><p>But how do you think, just in terms of the solution going forward, how do think Facebook should actually be held responsible because this is obviously beyond just being a massive crisis for the company just in terms of the data and mishandling.</p><p>I mean, this is huge. How should they be held responsible in the way that also sends messages, a strong message to other social media companies that, you know, data mishandling is quite simply non-negotiable.</p><p>COLLINS: That's right, it is non-negotiable. And for Facebook users who are following this story, their concern will be, well, you know, well, there might not be surprised, but just how much data Facebook holds on them.</p><p>But they might be even more concerned about whether Facebook can keep that data safe. So we have questions as part of our inquiry, part of our parliamentary inquiry, we want the company to answer, we want Mark Zuckerberg to answer.</p><p>But I think there's also a question of what can we do to stiffen the laws in the U.K., because no matter how big a company is, they have to comply with the laws of the country where they operate.</p><p>So we have been discussing changing the powers of the U.K. information commissioner, to give her the power, not to request data as part of investigations, but to go in and get it, if it's not forthcoming.</p><p>The moment there's a new bill before parliament which would give the information commissioner the power to have a -- but deliver heavy fines. But we think they should go beyond that, and they should have the power to get the data.</p><p>That will be our best way of knowing that the big tech companies are not just behaving in an ethical way, but they're abiding by the laws in our country to make sure they're keeping people's data safe.</p><p>ASHER: A lot of people would find that idea of, you know, the government in the U.K. being able to get data from Facebook. A lot of people will find that overly restrictive. Is it not somewhat of a concern of yours as you work to sort of figure out a potential solution to this.</p><p>COLLINS: Well, we should look at ways in other industries like tele -- you know, telecoms and in broadcasting. They have companies and it handles huge amounts of personal data, there are data protection laws to make sure that they do that probably.</p><p>But we have a regulator offcom which has oversight of those companies to make sure they're complying with the law. So these data protection issues are one -- are issues that have been resolved in many other industries, but the tech industry, it doesn't get applied.</p><p>And I think we have to say now that the tech is innovative, but it's also established. It's the dominant force in many of the markets where it operates. And it needs to be -- we need to have proper oversight of what they're doing.</p><p>Otherwise, we are in a position where we can pass all the data protection laws we like, but we're entirely dependent on the tech companies enforcing them properly and they got no means of checking. So I think it's a reserve power, and not exercise by politicians but by an independent government agency.</p><p>The ability to go in and get important data when it's part of an inquiry. I think it'll be an important reform. I think that will be our best way of ensuring that the companies comply with the law.</p><p>ASHER: OK, but beyond, you know, a controversial law like that for example, what will be the best way at this point for Facebook to gain or regain the trust of your committee?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, I think they need to explain what -- how they keep using data safe. Why they didn't investigate more rigorously the data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, why they didn't act, you know, quicker to ensure that, that data have been destroyed.</p><p>And also what can they do to ensure the use of data that is gathered from Facebook peep through people's interaction with apps and games and surveys created by other people.</p><p>[17:40:00] What do they do to make sure that data is safe too? Because of those -- it's not at all clear how about works at the moment. And we'll be holding a further hearing of a committee tomorrow afternoon in London where we will be talking to a former policy officer at Facebook who was responsible for overseeing in which their data policy works and the way data privacy rules work.</p><p>To understand more about this, it will be very interesting to hear what they have to say. But I think this is an issue of increasing concern for Facebook users.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: MP Damian Green there. OK, so here's a piece of advice for you from tech experts, not from myself. The tech experts are basically saying that now might be a good time to check what data you are sharing with third party apps on Facebook.</p><p>To find out, we're going to give instructions here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, and to find out, all you have to do is log on to Facebook and select settings -- recognize that face, that was our friend Stelter.</p><p>Then navigate to the menu bar on the left and then click on apps, you will see a list of third party apps, list of third party apps that you can get access some of your data to stop sharing all data with a specific app, click on the X, this will remove the app completely from your Facebook account.</p><p>Or click on an app to find out what exactly you are sharing in terms of data and make adjustments. Now Facebook is not the only advertising support network that sells some of your info to third parties.</p><p>Here's just a few: Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, AOL, Amazon, Twitter and Yelp all do it too. Brian Stelter, there's so much to discuss. Saw your lovely picture by the way on the screen there --</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: I don't know what I'm doing on Facebook. You know, I think all the fun from Facebook 10 or 15 years ago, and now we're finally re-evaluating our own relationship with this growing social network.</p><p>I haven't done that, that privacy check-up in years. But what you just showed makes me really want to log on and see how much I really I am sharing.</p><p>ASHER: Yes, because one of the things that I was asking you earlier is really, why is it that we feel so comfortable trusting these social media companies, these tech companies with so much personal information.</p><p>STELTER: Because we do get a lot of benefits out of Facebook and Google and other sites. Let's be honest. You know, I think there's a long overdue reckoning with some of the down sides to social media, but there are a lot of upside as well.</p><p>Whether it's baby pictures, reuniting with old friends, keeping in touch with family, we do benefit from these sites. But because they are free, it means that we are the part.</p><p>And I think that's what too many users are belatedly starting to realize. Now because it's free, advertisers are trying to reach us through this free site. We are really the ones being sold to advertisers through our data.</p><p>ASHER: This Facebook, I guess and Twitter do more to bring us together or more to tear us apart?</p><p>STELTER: It certainly feels when you're in the eco -- the eco-chamber of Facebook and Twitter, we are looking at the toxic comments they pile up on stories feels like these sites do more to divide us.</p><p>But I try to be an optimist here. We don't hear every day about the weddings and marriage proposals, all of the reunions, it happens, thanks to these social networking sites. However, there are ways to have all the good that come from social networks without so much of the toxicity, without so much of the misuse of data.</p><p>And that's when I'm starting to hear politicians say, you know, you were just talking to folks in the U.K., the politicians here in the U.S., lawmakers in the U.S., both on the Democratic and Republican sites have been saying we need to figure out a way to preserve the good from Facebook, without all this one like we're abused by the site.</p><p>ASHER: I know, but one of the things that the British lawmaker -- I was just speaking to Damian Green, did touch on earlier with this idea that, you know, maybe -- Damian Collins, my producer just corrected me, thank you so much, Tom.</p><p>He was talking about, you know, one of the main possible solutions --</p><p>STELTER: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: A possible solution --</p><p>STELTER: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: Would be for Facebook or the government rather to have access to more of Facebook's data. But the U.K. government has access to more of Facebook's data. I particularly find that price scary.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, maybe the solution not to give away for more aware, yes. Yes, Zuckerberg, Facebook talked years ago about privacy being dead. That on the internet, that's the trade off you make, that these big companies and maybe big governments are going to have access to more of your personal information.</p><p>But we are seeing a slow, but steady, resistance to that idea building. Out of it gets lawmakers, different organizations that are forming to try and say, hold on a second, we need to talk about the trade-offs we're making when we log on to these sites.</p><p>And it shouldn't be entirely a one-way thing, we're giving all of our data away when we log on.</p><p>ASHER: Is this story over the past few days big enough for ordinary people to really re-evaluate their relationship with Facebook and their privacy settings, and how much time they spend on Facebook and what information they give up.</p><p>STELTER: I think people are giving it a second look, but we all see people deleting their Facebook accounts or Instagram for that matter. You know, for the top five apps on a lot of people's phones all around the world, Facebook apps, Messenger and Instagram, not just the main Facebook.</p><p>This company has embedded itself into most internet users daily lives. And I don't see that changing. But if --</p><p>[17:45:00] ASHER: But the level of trust --</p><p>STELTER: But yes, and if you use Facebook, that's often, if you're not, sure you trust it. That does do damage to the company's bottom line. So it is in Facebook's best interest to address these problems.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Brian Stelter, Brian, thank you so much, I appreciate that. OK, so it's been described as a state of absolute panic right now in Texas. A fifth package have exploded, this time at a FedEx sorting facility, that story is next.</p><p>ASHER: Welcome back everybody. So FedEx's profit for the third quarter beat expectations on Wall Street. The logistics company says it benefitted from increased volumes at FedEx ground and freight, FedEx net profit got a billion and a half dollar boost, thanks to the new U.S. corporate tax law.</p><p>Now entirely separate, we have another story entirely separate from the company's earnings. A package exploded at a FedEx sorting center near San Antonio, Texas, on Tuesday morning. That's after by the way four explosions, two of them deadly which have rattled the city of Austin, Texas, over the past three weeks.</p><p>Cnn national correspondent Nick Walsh is in Schertz, Texas, near the FedEx facility. So Nick, based on all the explosions, what can authorities at this point, even though it's early days piece together about the suspect?</p><p>NICK WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is the main thing that they are trying to figure out. And frankly, I am not sure that they know much. They have appealed to that suspect, they have asked him or her to contact them because they do not know what the motive is here.</p><p>Now initially, the first attacks, March 2nd, March 12th, they were targeting two African-American men who were killed and a Latina woman who was injured. At that point, the police were saying to us, listen, this may be a hate crime.</p><p>Sunday night, there was a tripwire that was attached to an explosion device that injured two young white men in a different part of town. And now, we have these two packages apparently sent through FedEx, one that detonated at this FedEx sorting facility behind me.</p><p>Those appear to be indiscriminate attacks. So at this point, they are still trying to figure out what the motive is behind this, and also obviously, trying to find that bomber through forensics from the materials that he has left behind and from the sites of those detonations, those deadly detonations up in Austin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALSH (voice-over): A little after midnight, another alarming escalation. A package exploded on the conveyer belt here at this FedEx sorting facility 60 miles southwest of Austin.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One employee that was standing near the explosion later complained of ringing in the ears. She was treated and released.</p><p>WALSH: ATF, FBI and local law enforcement swarm the scene.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, that's what we're working on right now, we're trying to understand what actually happened, we're trying to surf through the evidence and let the evidence take us to where we need to go.</p><p>WALSH: The FBI says law enforcement is now looking at two packages from Tuesday.</p><p>[17:50:00] The one that exploded in Schertz and the second suspicious package found early this morning at another FedEx facility near the Austin airport.</p><p>Federal Express says the company turned over to law enforcement, extensive evidence related to these packages and the individual that shipped them, collected from our advanced technology security systems.</p><p>The FBI now telling Cnn they suspect these devices are linked to their investigation into the 18-day bombing spree in the Texas capital that has left two men dead, killed by packages left on their porches, an elderly woman badly injured by a similar device.</p><p>And two young men injured by device triggered by a tripwire across a sidewalk in a quiet neighborhood Sunday night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Before we had to look for a package, now you have to look for everywhere. I mean, it's harder to seal why your identity of the package.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you are not expecting a package, if it's something that doesn't have an official label on it, or really just not -- just the package itself, if there's anything out of the ordinary, we are asking the community to please call 911.</p><p>WALSH: This afternoon, Sarah Sanders tweeting from the White House: \"there's no apparent nexus to terrorism at this time.\" And the president making his first comments on the situation.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is obviously a very sick individual or maybe individuals. These are sick people and we will get to the bottom of it.</p><p>WALSH: Authorities have appealed to the bomber to contact them, the individual has not a motive remains unclear.</p><p>(on camera): And investigators are now appealing to an increasingly frightened public for help. The reward for information leading to an arrest say now stands at $115,000.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: Right, Nick Walsh, thank you so much, appreciate that. Right, still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, United Airlines pulled the plugs on its animals -- flying animals in the cargo hold following a series of incidents in the air. We'll have details of this coming up after the break.</p><p>ASHER: All right, welcome back everybody. After a string of mishaps, some of which actually ended in tragedy, United Airlines is suspending pet transportation in cargo hold. There were three incidents in a week including with this dog -- oh, adorable.</p><p>Which was actually loaded on the wrong flight and the plane was diverted to the dog's proper destination in Ohio as soon as the mistake was realized. So joining us live now is Rene Marsh.</p><p>So Rene, I mean, just walk us through this. I mean, why completely suspend pet transportation in cargo. Why not just direct your resources to doing a better job?</p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION &amp; TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT: Right, well, I think that they feel like they got things so wrong with these multiple situations that they need to take a pause and assess the entire situation to see what is going wrong. Now we're not talking about just one incident, we're talking about multiple incidents here.</p><p>[17:55:00] So as you mentioned, Zain, United Airlines is suspending its program that allows passengers to transport their pets in the cargo hold.</p><p>The airlines says that they're going to stop accepting new reservations, but they will honor any reservations that were made up until today. And so they -- what they're doing is they're reviewing their policy and how they handle these animals.</p><p>They said that this review should be done by May 1st, so once it is completed, then perhaps people will be allowed to carry their pets or travel with their pets in the cargo hold of the plane.</p><p>But right now, they're doing that top-to-bottom review to make sure that the animals flying in the belly of the plane are safe. But in the meantime though, if you do have a pet and you still want to carry it, it's a small pet, carry it on board in the cabin of the plane.</p><p>You can do that, it's just right now, their focus is for those animals traveling in the belly of the plane.</p><p>ASHER: And in the cargo. So just explain, why does it feel like United Airlines is having more of a problem with pet transportation compared to other airlines.</p><p>MARSH: It feels that way because they are -- I mean, you know, you had --</p><p>ASHER: Go through my head then?</p><p>MARSH: No, it's not in your head because I mean, you had an incident two occasions where a pet was placed in the cargo hold and it was being flown to the wrong destination, if you remember.</p><p>It was one dog that was sent to Japan, it was not supposed to be going to Japan, and then you had another similar case again. So clearly, there's a breakdown in the system there, and the reason why United is taking such as drastic approach here is because it's been in the headlines and it's not good, especially not good for PR, back to you.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Rene Marsh live for us there, thank you so much. And my friend, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'm Zain Asher, thank you so much for watching, I'll see you again tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018032001cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXG-B091-DXH2-642H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002DLG</classCode><className>FEDEX CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00022SO</classCode><className>UNITED AIR LINES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS492110 COURIERS &amp;

And take a look here, you can actually see that it was not a drop  of red, not a drop of red at all, we were firmly in the green the whole  day, we ended the day up a triple digit -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (APPLAUSE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Certainly, a rebound after yesterday after that Facebook data scandal we  saw yesterday so a rebound, the markets are squarely focused over the next  two days on what happens with the Fed and raising interest rates we'll see  about that tomorrow.</p><p> Oh, and it is Tuesday, March 20th.</p><p> Tonight, lawmakers worldwide demand to grill Marc Zuckerberg; the E.U.  Justice Commissioner tells us tonight a full investigation maybe next.</p><p> And social media stocks thrive as Facebook share price drop even further.</p><p> And Toyota gives a timeout to its autonomous cars after a fatal Uber crash.</p><p> Hello my friends, I'm Zain Asher and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p> All right welcome everyone as the calls grow form Marc Zuckerberg to be  held accountable for the Facebook data scandal tonight the E.U. is warning  there could be a fraud investigation, there could be a fraud investigation  because data was allegedly used without users' permissions.</p><p> So inside and outside of Facebook, inside and outside of Facebook there is  growing frustrations about the fact that we really haven't heard anything  from Marc Zuckerberg the CEO, complete radio silence from him however there  has been plenty of noise from the E.U., the U.K., Congress and the Federal  Trade Commission as well, they all want to know whether Facebook user data  was improperly used.</p><p>Facebook share price still suffering, down another 2 1/2 percent around 50  billion, $50 billion has been wiped off the value of Facebook just this  week, so just in the past few days.</p><p> What you won't find comments though on Marc Zuckerberg's Facebook page,  lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic say it is certainly well overdue.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAMIAN COLLINS, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE PARTY MP:  I think the time is come  where someone out the company like Marc Zuckerberg whose job it is to  understand every detail of what Facebook does, they he - that he actually  now takes a public position and answers questions on this because our  experience of dealing with Facebook in the past is you often get you know,  evasive answers, partial answers to questions, people saying they don't  have the information.</p><p> But now is the time for the people who do have the information to speak.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), CHAIR, STEERING COMMITTEE:  I think he should  explain to the American people how this happened, how many people were  hurt, and most importantly how they're going to fix it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE  ON INTELLIGENCE:  I think that we ought to have the testimony not only of  the Facebook CEO but I think the CEOs of other major social media platforms  that the Russians exploited during the campaign.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER SENATE COMMITTEES ON APPROPRIATIONS;  BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS; BUDGET; COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY;  SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP:  I'd like Mr. Zuckerberg to come.   Last time he sent his lawyers, I don't know what he pays, them but they did  a damn good job because they didn't say anything.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ASHER:  Well you can see that, a lot of lawmakers in the United States  really, really want answers from Marc Zuckerberg right now.</p><p> Earlier the European Commissioner for Justice, Vera Jourova told me she  believes that Facebook broke E.U. rules.</p><p> (BEGIN AUDIOTAPE)</p><p> VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSUMERS:  In our  rules already now, we have clearly stipulated that the processing of data  of private date of people can be only done under the condition of the well- informed consent of each individual.</p><p> So, what's happening now or what we know about recent scandal is that  millions of people and their data were processed and harvested without  their content - consent and we are going to launch the investigations in  several member states starting with the United Kingdom to find the facts  and the information about what happened and to what extent our data  protection rules have been breached.</p><p> And according to what we know about it now the rules have been breached,  the United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law conditions because there  might be even fraud found so they - there will be the procedure launched  very soon and it will be coordinated across the whole E.U. because it must  be that there is also for some other member states.</p><p> ASHER:  OK but in terms of figuring out and getting to the bottom of what  happened what questions would you like to see answered specifically by Marc  Zuckerberg?</p><p> JOUROVA:  What are - there are many questions I would like to ask Facebook  how is it possible that they disappointed the trust of the people who gave  them their privacy - private data and who didn't expect that the data will  be [0:05:13] abused in such a way that later they will be manipulated ahead  of the elections.</p><p> I think that these are very threatening facts or developments and we have  very serious concerns that such practices could be detrimental to democracy  and to the fundamental rights of individual people so that's why I have a  lot of questions I want to ask also Facebook and I will very probably write  a letter with several questions for instance why Facebook hasn't - haven't  - didn't react earlier, why there was not early enough notification to the  individual people.</p><p> Many other questions and of course we have the obligation to ask because we  must be much better in protecting the privacy of people.</p><p> ASHER:  Here's the thing, just you know, according to Facebook, this is -  this is basically an honest mistake.  Essentially, they trusted this  academic researcher, Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan and he was the one who  mishandled the data so if this is just an honest mistake, if this is just  an honest mistake, should we be careful about going too far in terms of how  the E.U. punishes Facebook for this?</p><p> JOUROVA:  I would not call it a mistake but for sure it's going too far.  I  am personally very sensitive about manipulation of the - of the people and  just imagine you entrust somebody you give him your data and then you find  out that it has been abused and you were the object of manipulation.</p><p> We in Europe are very sensitive about that, that's why we want to have the  consent of all the individuals when they are providing their data to  understand what is the purpose for which the IT company asks for the data  and what will be happening with the data.</p><p> And from May this year, we will have even stricter rules so which will give  more rights to the individuals. And here I see the deputy in the European Union and the United States  legislation because we are more careful and more sensitive and more strict  on the protection of privacy of people.</p><p> ASHER:  Yes, the European Union - Europeans are certainly more strict but  in terms of - in terms of a solution it's not just about individuals  figuring out privacy settings and that sort of thing it's also about  Facebook creating new policies about how it handles third-party access to  its data, that's really the key here, third-party access?</p><p> JOUROVA:  It has to be the subject of investigation, what happens there.   In my view Facebook should have been much more careful and keep asking  about the purpose may be not believe so easily that there is the research  going on and when they had the first indication that something goes wrong,  they should've asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and not to use  it anymore.</p><p> I think that something has been neglected or was neglected some time ago  and we want to understand better what exactly happened and who should be  blamed for what.</p><p> And European Union is known for imposing quite drastic sanctions in such  cases and we will not hesitate to use this follow-up because this case  might be also used as a deterrent case for the future possible cases.</p><p> (END AUDIOTAPE)</p><p> ASHER:  All right no sign of this man, you see on your screen, Facebook see  of course, Marc Zuckerberg one of the most recognizable CEOs in the world.</p><p> However, Facebook tells us that it will brief, it will brief multiple  congressional committees.</p><p> Right joining us now is Laurie Segall.</p><p> So, Laurie here's what I don't get, why on earth would it make sense for  Marc Zuckerberg to stay silent at a time like this?</p><p> LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN TECH,  EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  I mean I think it's a question we are all asking.  We as  the press, we ask that question we want to hear from him, the public wants  to hear from him, and what's really interesting to me is actually Facebook  executives people have told me, high level executive within the company  have said, we want to hear him too (ph).</p><p> ASHER:  They don't get it either.</p><p> SEGALL:  You know, I think this is a very protective story.  There's a lot  of nuance there and Marc Zuckerberg, Cheryl Sandberg these are brand names,  people want to talk to them at this time and there's this feeling from a  couple of folks I spoke to that he gets involved too late, he's not getting  his hands dirty, he's always very involved behind the scenes.</p><p> You know, a lot of folks will say he's a very respected leader, he is in  all these meetings, he is very, very, involved in these important  conversations, we as the public when we look at our data when we look at  what's happened, when we look at all of these challenging questions, the  weaponization (ph) of Facebook over the last year for democracy, what it's  doing to mental health, we [0:05:14] want the leader Facebook to step  forward and I think there's growing pressure mounting not just with us  here, with the public but within the company for him to speak publicly on  this thing.</p><p> ASHER:  And in terms of you know, you talked about Marc Zuckerberg and the  Facebook team just being in crisis meetings all day, just in terms of where  they go from here, their priority is not just you know, meeting with  lawmakers it's also figuring out a way to regain the public trust at a time  that this, how do they do that?</p><p> SEGALL:  I think that it's so important, I think transparency is going to  one of the biggest things you know, Marc might not like to speak what I  want to remind you, this isn't self-serving, I want to remind you that I  spoke to him in June and he actually was talking about his role as a leader  in this moment in time, he said to me at the time, he wants to make the  world a better place, take a listen?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARC ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK:  I just feel like we have a responsibility  to do more in the world.</p><p> Right and when you look at the world today, you know, giving people a voice  and helping people connect our good and have made the world better in a lot  of ways but our society still very divided right and that means that people  need to work proactively to help bring people closer together, it's not  just enough to help or simply connect we need to work to bring the world  closer together.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEGALL:  And I think you could argue that at this moment Facebook hasn't  brought the world closer together and I think we are actually at this point  (ph) -</p><p> ASHER:  I'm - I'm going to be the opposite (ph) actually.</p><p> SEGALL  - Yes, and I think we all asking these questions and what I think  when you ask the question about what can they do you know, a lot of the  leaders I spoke to behind closed doors say that we are having these  massively important ethical questions about the future that come along with  this you know, with having a platform this size, they say we want to have  these conversations.</p><p> You know, one person said to me you know, cracking down on fake news is  important but it can also lead to censorship of independent news, we have  to have these ethical conversations; these are conversations that should be  a public discussion and I think we as the public because our data is out  there we are hearing more about it, we want to know and be a part of these  discussions as well.</p><p> ASHER:  It does feel like a watershed moment for Facebook -</p><p> SEGALL: Yes.</p><p> ASHER:  - where people you know, there's a reckoning really.</p><p> Laurie Segall, live for us, thank you -</p><p> SEGALL:  Thank you.</p><p> ASHER:  - so much, yes.</p><p> OK so meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica has suspended its chief executive  after he was secretly filmed boasting, boasting about using dirty tricks to  help clients.</p><p> The data firm says Alexander Nix's comments with an undercover reporter,  \"Channel 4\" do not reflect the values of the company and promised a full  independent investigation.</p><p> Nick Paton Walsh is joining us live now from London with more on this.</p><p> So, Nick when you look at parts of this documentary, aside from talking  about entrapping political opponents with bribery and sex and that sort of  thing, there was one line that really caught my attention by Nix in this  documentary where he talks about, he said, 'it doesn't have to be true, it  just have to be believed.'  It does not have to be true, it just have to be  believed.</p><p> In terms of targeting voters in and around election campaign, where do you  draw the line between persuasion and outright manipulation?</p><p> NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well I should  point out too Cambridge Analytica in that same undercover filming say they  are not in the business of fake news or providing false information but  yes, you know, there's a lot in what they say undercover as well, I should  point out, which they claim is scripted and edited to work in - against  them, a lot there that doesn't necessarily make them the most trustworthy  advocates.</p><p> And certainly, the company's own decision to suspend their CEO Alexander  Nix certainly speaks you might say volumes to quite how they feel about the  allegations being perceived and certainly they have a big struggle with  their message as a messaging company over the past couple of days.</p><p> The decision to suspend Mr. Nix actually emerged minutes before \"Channel 4  News\" broadcast the third of their reports about the company's use of data  and political moves there.</p><p> But your point earlier about whether the truth matters still or not is a  key sensitivity here as well because they talk about yes, well you can't  fight elections on facts, well you shouldn't fight elections on facts, you  should fight them on emotions and I think that plays certainly to wire  their story may be chimes with so many people at this stage.</p><p> After here in the United Kingdom seeing the Brexit vote go through in the  favor towards leaving the European Union, some say based on many spurious  promises by lead (ph) campaigners; by Donald Trump's much I think it's fair  to say heralded use of falsity at times and his election as well, it may  well be that social media in the eyes of many now is perhaps being viewed  less as a sort of a tool, as Laurie was saying of bringing the world  together, making us more closer to each other and perhaps way over sort of  amplifying falsity or certain opinions that may not be necessarily given to  you because they are true, may be given to you because actually they sort  of play on various chords and amplifier fears and make you vote in a  certain direction.</p><p> ASHER:  Yes.  If anything, someone argued it is actually made the world a  lot more divisive. Just in terms of Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica, has it been proven  that he did use all the tactics that he talked about in that \"Channel 4\"  documentary or was it a mix of you know, bravado and [0:05:14]  exaggeration?</p><p> PATON WALSH:  I certainly have to say, when I heard him talk about the idea  of using Ukrainian sex workers and undercover filming of an - of opposition  politician accepting a bribe, I thought to myself, well why on earth would  you need to spend millions hiring outside consultants, suggests too of a  more hand-fisted way of compromising a political candidate.</p><p> So, you could perhaps argue that by suggesting those he was to somewhat  degree lazy.</p><p> The other I - things suggested by his colleagues I mean that was clear to  some degree that they were selling their previous products and some of the  undercover filming suggested they'd massively influenced recent elections  in Kenya, obviously we don't know the full extent of that there, we don't  know the full extent really there.</p><p> Their influence on the U.S. election campaign, in fact indeed they say,  some of the data harvested was done too late to be any use them at all in  the work that they did in Donald Trump's selection in 2016 but certainly  you're presented with the idea of a man who has a pretty broad moral  contest to some degree in terms of what he's willing to offer although I  should point out he defends himself by saying, in those circumstances he  was in fact going along with a ridiculous suggestion by the undercover  reporter from Sri Lanka or allegedly that \"Channel 4\" put in front of him.</p><p> So, a confused situation in terms of its context but it leaves you  certainly questioning exactly what kind of role consultancies like  Cambridge Analytica genuinely have in the political process and quite  what's that's doing to states of democracy around the world.</p><p> Zain?</p><p> ASHER:  A broad moral contest as you put it.  Interesting way of putting  it, OK.</p><p> Nick Paton Walsh live for us there.</p><p> PATON WALSH:  I'm being euphemistic.  All right.</p><p> ASHER:  Thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p> OK so everybody wants a moment with Mnuchin, the U.S. Treasury Secretary  faces his G20 colleagues as many secret explanations and exemption from  President Trump's steel tariffs, up next [0:01:56].</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ASHER:  A very welcome back everybody.</p><p> So, the crisis at Facebook is dragging down social media stocks across the  board.  Facebook and Snap, the maker of Snapchat each fell as you see there  2 1/2 percent on Tuesday and look at that, Twitter, Twitter down more than  10 percent.  By the way going back to Facebook, you know, they were just  down 2 1/2 percent today, so far this week over the past couple of days  they have lost more than $50 billion, $50 billion in market value just this  week alone.</p><p>Twitter as I mentioned down $0.10, that's a one-month low and in to a  correction technically, down more than 10 percent; shares started plunging  when Israel justice minister threatened legal action against the company,  the minister said, \"Twitter does not do enough of a good job in terms of  removing terrorist material.\"</p><p> So much to talk about, Claire Sebastian, joining us now.</p><p> So, here's the thing, it does feel Claire, especially after yesterday, it  does feel that we've reached this watershed moment, right where people are  just having less patience for less tolerance for these tech companies and  the amount of power they wield over data, we haven't really seen investors  take flight in this way before because -</p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN MONEY:  Right.</p><p> ASHER:  - when you talk about fifty billion dollars-worth of [0:05:13]  value being shed off Facebook that is no small thing.</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Right.  And I think it is interesting you know, we saw the  worst days of Facebook in four years yesterday and I saw might've thought  that people might buy on the dip today and that wasn't to be.</p><p> And I think it's worth in the context of investors taking their emotion out  of this issue to the extent you look at what - when Facebook and Twitter  and Snap report earnings, what people are looking for is user growth and ad  growth and this scandal could affect both of those.</p><p> You have the letter from the FTC today, this could affect the whole way  that Facebook does business.  You've got the issue of user growth and the  Zeitgeist just went on the list but around social media it's - it's  changing, you've got hashtag-delete-Facebook going around on Twitter,  people are starting to talk more about this.</p><p> And I want to bring in Ross Gerber, he's a veteran tech investor and he  says he selling out of Facebook, at least most of his holdings there, take  a listen?</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ROSS GERBER, VETERAN TECH INVESTOR &amp; FACEBOOK SHAREHOLDER:  I think - we're  at peak social, this is the abuse of the public's trust that is beyond  belief.</p><p> And when you look at the problems we've had with Brexit in England and in  the United States with the divisiveness and the rise in hate, crimes and  the - just the bad state of the world, we have to hold accountable that  social media is not just about fun anymore, it's completely manipulated.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  So, you know, the sentiment around social media, his worry is  that is - it's changing essentially and I think you know, he's not - he  does - they're - not everyone thinks so.</p><p> Well I've spoken to another investor today, he says look, Facebook isn't  just about Facebook, it also has Messenger, it also was Instagram, and it  also has WhatsApp out there, there are other properties there.</p><p> Some people will be looking at the price of that stock today and thinking  oh maybe this is time to come in, they are still strongly, are still making  a lot of money but I think we are in a moment, and I think you should see  that by the second day of fall.</p><p> ASHER:  Let's talk about Twitter, down 10 percent.  This is significant  because in part and obviously social media is suffering right now but this  is in part because Israel is threatening legal action against Twitter  because Twitter isn't doing enough they say to combat you know, sort of  terrorism instigation that happens on social media.</p><p> This is not the first time we've seen social media being used by you know,  lone-wolf attackers for example or persuading people to join different  terrorist groups but it does seem that the Israelis now certainly have a  lot less patience for this?</p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely.  And the justice minister in particular has been -  has been particularly focused on this, she takes a Twitter this week and  said you know, look we've - we've dealt with this in the past, with  Facebook in 2016, she met with Facebook exec and they apparently complied  with a lot of her requests to take down content that they felt was inciting  violence.</p><p> She said they've asked Twitter to do the same, Twitter haven't responded  and now she says they're threatened legal action.</p><p> But I think you can't see this separate from the rest of the context that's  going on, this is the broader issue of fear among investors that platforms  like Facebook, like Twitter are not in full control of their data, they  don't seem to have full control over the types of content that is on their  platforms.</p><p> ASHER:  Incredible.  Especially what Ross Gerber said about you know, we're  seeing you know, pushing against not this fun, happy, place anymore you  know, there is serious manipulation going on, that was quite chilling I  find.  OK.</p><p> Clare Sebastian, thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p> Alright so, despite the social media rout, all three major U.S. markets  ended the day in the green, let's take a look here.</p><p> OK so, at the end of the day, up 116 points, that earlier turnaround from  what we saw yesterday, the Dow finished up nearly a half of a percent.  All  eyes now turn to the Fed which is expected to raise interest rates on  Wednesday, they are in a two-day meeting right now, the big question all of  you will have is how frequently will we see interest rate rises this year  although as I mentioned, they are expected to raise rates tomorrow.</p><p> All right, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted today that U.S. trade  policy is not about protectionism but free and fair trade.  Mnuchin spoke  after attending 15 meetings at a summit of G20 Finance ministers in Buenos  Aires.</p><p> The Treasury secretary is under pressure to explain, people want answers,  he has to explain President Trump's new tariffs, a number of countries are  seeking exemptions from Mnuchin are also weighing retaliate or measures at  the same time.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY, US:  There's always a risk if we put  tariffs on that other people will reciprocate and there is a risk of a  trade war.  As the president has said, we are not afraid of getting into a  trade war given the size of our market, the size of our economy and the  fact that we have a big trade deficit.</p><p> Having said that, that's not our goal.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ASHER:  Earlier Tuesday, China's premier pledged to further open the  country's economy adding he hoped that both the U.S. and China would act  rationally and not be led by emotions into a trade war.</p><p> Challenging moment certainly for the U.S. Treasury secretary.</p><p> Patrick Gillespie joins us live now, so here's the thing, you and I  discussed this earlier, Steve Mnuchin is a free trader, much like Gary Cohn  -</p><p> PATRICK GILLESPIE, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p> ASHER:  - how on earth did he go to a meeting with G20 and defend something  [0:05:14] that deep down we all know that he doesn't really believe in?</p><p> GILLESPIE:  Zain, Mnuchin is between a 'rock and a hard place' because he  has to defend the White House trade policy which he has tried to steer away  from the most extreme measures and sweeping tariffs, at the same time he  has to assuage these concerns that the U.S. isn't about to spark a global  trade war.</p><p> But as you mentioned several countries from South Korea to Argentina, to  France, Germany, Italy, they are seeking exemptions at these meetings and  they're not getting them.</p><p> And you know, Mnuchin tries to call the concern there by saying, 'well  exemptions will come relatively quickly,' he told that to \"The New York  Times\" but you're not getting any more -</p><p> ASHER:  But -</p><p> GILLESPIE:  - specificity.</p><p> ASHER:  - you have until Friday right, so this is like three days, the  tariffs are supposed to go into effect on Friday (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p> GILLESPIE:  The deadline -</p><p> ASHER:  - three days -</p><p> GILLESPIE:  - is coming up -</p><p> ASHER:  - So how does he pick - if everybody -</p><p> GILLESPIE:  - this is the last opportunity countries have to get a face-to- face with the U.S. administration.</p><p> ASHER:  - but if everybody is begging him, you know, \"Oh, you know, Steve,  can we get an exemption; can our country get an exemption?\"  How does he  choose who is friend and who is foe?</p><p> GILLESPIE:  - Well, this is - the kind of opacity of the administration.   They are not showing - they say there isn't a one-size-fits-all you know,  metric or test to make country exempt and so every country is saying,  you've - you've got countries like Argentina, which I would think would not  be a threat to U.S. national security, saying, \"We import less than one  percent of your steel.  You know, we are not a risk of - we're not a  national security risk to you,' and still the U.S. administration is  saying, \"Will think about it.\"</p><p> ASHER:  But here's - years the thing, President Trump has talked about  defending national security and we can't have imports in terms of steel and  aluminum because you know, we've got to defend national security.  However,  Mnuchin sort of change his language a little bit and talked about 'national  interests' as opposed to 'national security,' why do you think he did that?</p><p> GILLESPIE:  Well I think it gets to the core of that he doesn't you know,  he has tried to walk back some of these most extreme trade measures Zain  and so, when he adjusts the language a bit he, you know, he let - it allows  him to say, 'well there is economic interest of play; there's jobs at  play.'  It -</p><p> ASHER:  Could it be that it's quite difficult to push something you don't  believe in yourself?</p><p> GILLESPIE:  - OK.</p><p> ASHER:  Maybe I shouldn't say that; I shouldn't say that, sorry, sorry.</p><p> GILLESPIE:  I think it is difficult for him because you know, - before Gary  Cohn left, it was Mnuchin and Gary Cohn who were postponing these specific  tariffs, these were supposed to happen last summer Zain, and Gary Cohn and  Mnuchin said, 'let's push it back for the last minute.'</p><p> Well, we are at that last-minute right now and now Mnuchin is still in the  hot seat and he has to you know, be front-and-center in front of these  countries saying, 'listen we are not going to start a trade war but we're  not going to tell you if we're going to hit you with tariffs.'</p><p> ASHER:  Oh, I do - I do not envy him at all.</p><p> OK, Patrick Gillespie, thank you.</p><p> GILLESPIE:  Sure, we'll see on Friday. </p><p> ASHER:  Thank you.</p><p> All right, coming up British lawmakers call for answers from Facebook,  we'll hear from an MP who wants Marc Zuckerberg himself, he wants Marc  Zuckerberg himself to testify at an inquiry into fake news, that's next  [0:02:59].</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  [17:30:00] ZAIN ASHER, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello everyone, I'm  Zain Asher.  Coming up in the next top hour on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the  head of U.K.'s parliament media committee says why it's time for Mark  Zuckerberg to appear before British lawmakers. </p><p> And United Airlines ground its tech cargo business after sending too many  dogs to the wrong destination.  But first though, these are the top  business headlines for you at this hour.</p><p> Regulators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are growing in their  cause for Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg to speak about the data scandal of  the social media giant.  Speaking to me on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Europe's  Justice Commissioner says she believes data protection rules have been  broken.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> VERA JOUROVA, COMMISSIONER, JUSTICE, CONSUMERS &amp; GENDER EQUALITY, EUROPEAN  COMMISSION:  According to what we know about it now, the rules have been  breached.  The United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law or  conditions, because of that it might be even fraud found.</p><p> So there will be a procedure launched very soon. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ASHER:  White House Press Secretary dodged a question Tuesday about whether  the Russian election was free and fair.  They came up after President  Donald Trump said he congratulated Russian president Vladimir Putin on his  reelection on Sunday. </p><p> That drew rebuke from Republican Senator John McCain.  Mr. Trump met in the  Oval Office, Tuesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and then  may sat down for working lunch. </p><p> Prince Mohammed's reformist methods and the promise of Saudi investment in  the U.S. have made him slightly quite popular with the Trump  administration. </p><p> All right, so Toyota is pausing its driverless car testing in the wake of  the fatal scandal involving an autonomous Uber car in Arizona.  The car  maker says Uber's incident is certainly unrelated to them, but it could  certainly have an emotional effect on its drivers.</p><p> I want to bring in Samuel Burke who is following the story.  So Samuel, do  we expect other car companies and other tech companies to follow suit? Just  so far, it's just Uber and Toyota.</p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  It certainly  wouldn't surprise me, Zain, because I think there's an incredible amount of  pressure on the people who are behind the wheel of the self-driving cars.</p><p> It sounds like a contradicting -- contradiction, but almost all of these  vehicles certainly in Arizona have somebody behind the wheel.  And of  course, the first thing that people say when they hear this story is, if  there was a driver behind the wheel during this incident in Tempe, why  weren't they able to stop it?</p><p> So I actually just spoke with somebody who has one of these jobs in  Arizona, and said that they feel the pressure, people don't realize how  difficult it can be to be at the wheel of a car that's driving all the  time.</p><p> It's easy to disengage even though it's your job when you're not actively  doing it and you're passive the whole time.  So they do feel this sense of  pressure, so I wouldn't be surprised if other companies follow the steps  that Toyota had taken.</p><p> But this is just a temporary measure, and let's be honest, this is the  future of driving.  We know that people will get back behind the wheel of  these driverless cars, and I'm sure that Uber's program will continue much  sooner than later.</p><p> ASHER:  But are we going to see lease -- I mean, you mentioned, it's just  temporary, fine.  But are we going to see at least types of regulation in  the mean time while they sort of figure this out.</p><p> Temporary regulation that block these driverless cars from testing in  public streets.</p><p> BURKE:  I actually just spoke to an executive at one of these companies who  said that he doesn't expect that in large part, maybe some small measures  here and there.  Arizona, the state where this is happened, it's actually a  hot bed of self-driving development. </p><p> And the state there, the governor has touted this as a real strong commerce  point for Arizona, so there will likely be a pause, but they expect because  this is benefitting a state like Arizona, even with this terrible strategy  for it to go on.</p><p> But Zain, this is a learning moment, not just for humans, but for the  actual cars.  It's terrible to say this, but this is an important data  point.  You don't want to think of a life as a data point, but that's  exactly what it has to be so that the cars can learn from this incident,  see what they did wrong so that it doesn't happen again.</p><p> Remember the goal of this self-driving technology is to eliminate all of  the human error that causes fatal accidents or non-fatal accidents.  Of  course, this time around, that's much harder to show.</p><p> [17:35:00] But it's a lot like fear of flying, everybody has it, even  though statistically it's very unlikely.  Yes, there's this uncomfortable  sense around this tragedy, but almost all the numbers would show  demonstrably that self-driving is much safer than us humans behind the  wheel. </p><p> ASHER:  Right, but perhaps, there should be some changes to make sure that  it's easy for the drivers behind the driverless cars to actually stop it in  the wake of potential accidents.</p><p> All right, Samuel Burke, live for us there, thank you so much.  OK, guys,  back to our top story tonight.  British lawmakers want Mark Zuckerberg to  testify at a parliamentary inquiry instead of fake news. </p><p> Earlier on, I spoke to the man leading those cause, conservative MP Damian  Collins, and I asked him what he wants to hear from the Facebook CEO.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DAMIAN COLLINS, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR FOLKESTONE &amp; HYTHE:  The questions  that we asked when we had a policy hearing with Facebook in Washington last  month which was -- we asked them about their relationship with Cambridge  Analytica. </p><p> We asked what they do to keep user data safe, and also what they do to make  sure they can effectively recover data if it ends up in the hands of a  third party and then breach their own rules.</p><p> And it is data breach story we've been looking at.  You know, we see  unsatisfactory answers to all of those questions, and we certainly didn't  get clear answers to those questions when we posed them last month. </p><p> They said then they would give us their written evidence to support that,  they still hasn't come through.  So I think the time has come where someone  at the company like Mark Zuckerberg whose job it is to understand every  detail of what Facebook does. </p><p> He actually now takes the public position and answers questions on this  because our experience of dealing with Facebook in the past as you often  get, you know, very stiff answers, partial answers to questions, people  saying they don't have the information. </p><p> What now is the time for the people who do have the information to speak. </p><p> ASHER:  Yes, we haven't heard from Mark Zuckerberg at all just in terms of  him coming out and speaking to the public as our reporter Lori Siegel was  just mentioning.</p><p> But how do you think, just in terms of the solution going forward, how do  think Facebook should actually be held responsible because this is  obviously beyond just being a massive crisis for the company just in terms  of the data and mishandling.</p><p> I mean, this is huge.  How should they be held responsible in the way that  also sends messages, a strong message to other social media companies that,  you know, data mishandling is quite simply non-negotiable.</p><p> COLLINS:  That's right, it is non-negotiable.  And for Facebook users who  are following this story, their concern will be, well, you know, well,  there might not be surprised, but just how much data Facebook holds on  them.</p><p> But they might be even more concerned about whether Facebook can keep that  data safe.  So we have questions as part of our inquiry, part of our  parliamentary inquiry, we want the company to answer, we want Mark  Zuckerberg to answer.</p><p> But I think there's also a question of what can we do to stiffen the laws  in the U.K., because no matter how big a company is, they have to comply  with the laws of the country where they operate.</p><p> So we have been discussing changing the powers of the U.K. information  commissioner, to give her the power, not to request data as part of  investigations, but to go in and get it, if it's not forthcoming.</p><p> The moment there's a new bill before parliament which would give the  information commissioner the power to have a -- but deliver heavy fines.   But we think they should go beyond that, and they should have the power to  get the data.</p><p> That will be our best way of knowing that the big tech companies are not  just behaving in an ethical way, but they're abiding by the laws in our  country to make sure they're keeping people's data safe.</p><p> ASHER:  A lot of people would find that idea of, you know, the government  in the U.K. being able to get data from Facebook.  A lot of people will  find that overly restrictive.  Is it not somewhat of a concern of yours as  you work to sort of figure out a potential solution to this.</p><p> COLLINS:  Well, we should look at ways in other industries like tele -- you  know, telecoms and in broadcasting.  They have companies and it handles  huge amounts of personal data, there are data protection laws to make sure  that they do that probably. </p><p> But we have a regulator offcom which has oversight of those companies to  make sure they're complying with the law.  So these data protection issues  are one -- are issues that have been resolved in many other industries, but  the tech industry, it doesn't get applied.</p><p> And I think we have to say now that the tech is innovative, but it's also  established.  It's the dominant force in many of the markets where it  operates.  And it needs to be -- we need to have proper oversight of what  they're doing.</p><p> Otherwise, we are in a position where we can pass all the data protection  laws we like, but we're entirely dependent on the tech companies enforcing  them properly and they got no means of checking.  So I think it's a reserve  power, and not exercise by politicians but by an independent government  agency. </p><p> The ability to go in and get important data when it's part of an inquiry.   I think it'll be an important reform.  I think that will be our best way of  ensuring that the companies comply with the law.</p><p> ASHER:  OK, but beyond, you know, a controversial law like that for  example, what will be the best way at this point for Facebook to gain or  regain the trust of your committee? </p><p> COLLINS:  Well, I think they need to explain what -- how they keep using  data safe.  Why they didn't investigate more rigorously the data breach  involving Cambridge Analytica, why they didn't act, you know, quicker to  ensure that, that data have been destroyed.</p><p> And also what can they do to ensure the use of data that is gathered from  Facebook peep through people's interaction with apps and games and surveys  created by other people.</p><p> [17:40:00] What do they do to make sure that data is safe too? Because of  those -- it's not at all clear how about works at the moment.  And we'll be  holding a further hearing of a committee tomorrow afternoon in London where  we will be talking to a former policy officer at Facebook who was  responsible for overseeing in which their data policy works and the way  data privacy rules work. </p><p> To understand more about this, it will be very interesting to hear what  they have to say.  But I think this is an issue of increasing concern for  Facebook users.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ASHER:  MP Damian Green there.  OK, so here's a piece of advice for you  from tech experts, not from myself.  The tech experts are basically saying  that now might be a good time to check what data you are sharing with third  party apps on Facebook. </p><p> To find out, we're going to give instructions here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS,  and to find out, all you have to do is log on to Facebook and select  settings -- recognize that face, that was our friend Stelter. </p><p> Then navigate to the menu bar on the left and then click on apps, you will  see a list of third party apps, list of third party apps that you can get  access some of your data to stop sharing all data with a specific app,  click on the X, this will remove the app completely from your Facebook  account.</p><p> Or click on an app to find out what exactly you are sharing in terms of  data and make adjustments.  Now Facebook is not the only advertising  support network that sells some of your info to third parties.</p><p> Here's just a few: Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, AOL, Amazon, Twitter and Yelp  all do it too.  Brian Stelter, there's so much to discuss.  Saw your lovely  picture by the way on the screen there --</p><p> BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  I don't know what I'm doing  on Facebook.  You know, I think all the fun from Facebook 10 or 15 years  ago, and now we're finally re-evaluating our own relationship with this  growing social network. </p><p> I haven't done that, that privacy check-up in years.  But what you just  showed makes me really want to log on and see how much I really I am  sharing. </p><p> ASHER:  Yes, because one of the things that I was asking you earlier is  really, why is it that we feel so comfortable trusting these social media  companies, these tech companies with so much personal information.</p><p> STELTER:  Because we do get a lot of benefits out of Facebook and Google  and other sites.  Let's be honest.  You know, I think there's a long  overdue reckoning with some of the down sides to social media, but there  are a lot of upside as well.</p><p> Whether it's baby pictures, reuniting with old friends, keeping in touch  with family, we do benefit from these sites.  But because they are free, it  means that we are the part.</p><p> And I think that's what too many users are belatedly starting to realize.   Now because it's free, advertisers are trying to reach us through this free  site.  We are really the ones being sold to advertisers through our data. </p><p> ASHER:  This Facebook, I guess and Twitter do more to bring us together or  more to tear us apart? </p><p> STELTER:  It certainly feels when you're in the eco -- the eco-chamber of  Facebook and Twitter, we are looking at the toxic comments they pile up on  stories feels like these sites do more to divide us.</p><p> But I try to be an optimist here.  We don't hear every day about the  weddings and marriage proposals, all of the reunions, it happens, thanks to  these social networking sites.  However, there are ways to have all the  good that come from social networks without so much of the toxicity,  without so much of the misuse of data.</p><p> And that's when I'm starting to hear politicians say, you know, you were  just talking to folks in the U.K., the politicians here in the U.S.,  lawmakers in the U.S., both on the Democratic and Republican sites have  been saying we need to figure out a way to preserve the good from Facebook,  without all this one like we're abused by the site.</p><p> ASHER:  I know, but one of the things that the British lawmaker -- I was  just speaking to Damian Green, did touch on earlier with this idea that,  you know, maybe -- Damian Collins, my producer just corrected me, thank you  so much, Tom.</p><p> He was talking about, you know, one of the main possible solutions -- </p><p> STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p> ASHER:  A possible solution -- </p><p> STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p> ASHER:  Would be for Facebook or the government rather to have access to  more of Facebook's data.  But the U.K. government has access to more of  Facebook's data.  I particularly find that price scary.</p><p> STELTER:  Yes, maybe the solution not to give away for more aware, yes.   Yes, Zuckerberg, Facebook talked years ago about privacy being dead.  That  on the internet, that's the trade off you make, that these big companies  and maybe big governments are going to have access to more of your personal  information.</p><p> But we are seeing a slow, but steady, resistance to that idea building.   Out of it gets lawmakers, different organizations that are forming to try  and say, hold on a second, we need to talk about the trade-offs we're  making when we log on to these sites.</p><p> And it shouldn't be entirely a one-way thing, we're giving all of our data  away when we log on.</p><p> ASHER:  Is this story over the past few days big enough for ordinary people  to really re-evaluate their relationship with Facebook and their privacy  settings, and how much time they spend on Facebook and what information  they give up. </p><p> STELTER:  I think people are giving it a second look, but we all see people  deleting their Facebook accounts or Instagram for that matter.  You know,  for the top five apps on a lot of people's phones all around the world,  Facebook apps, Messenger and Instagram, not just the main Facebook.</p><p> This company has embedded itself into most internet users daily lives.  And  I don't see that changing.  But if -- </p><p> [17:45:00] ASHER:  But the level of trust -- </p><p> STELTER:  But yes, and if you use Facebook, that's often, if you're not,  sure you trust it.  That does do damage to the company's bottom line.  So  it is in Facebook's best interest to address these problems.</p><p> ASHER:  All right, Brian Stelter, Brian, thank you so much, I appreciate  that.  OK, so it's been described as a state of absolute panic right now in  Texas.  A fifth package have exploded, this time at a FedEx sorting  facility, that story is next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> ASHER:  Welcome back everybody.  So FedEx's profit for the third quarter  beat expectations on Wall Street.  The logistics company says it benefitted  from increased volumes at FedEx ground and freight, FedEx net profit got a  billion and a half dollar boost, thanks to the new U.S. corporate tax law.</p><p> Now entirely separate, we have another story entirely separate from the  company's earnings.  A package exploded at a FedEx sorting center near San  Antonio, Texas, on Tuesday morning.  That's after by the way four  explosions, two of them deadly which have rattled the city of Austin,  Texas, over the past three weeks.</p><p>Cnn national correspondent Nick Walsh is in Schertz, Texas, near the FedEx  facility.  So Nick, based on all the explosions, what can authorities at  this point, even though it's early days piece together about the suspect? </p><p> NICK WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is the main  thing that they are trying to figure out.  And frankly, I am not sure that  they know much.  They have appealed to that suspect, they have asked him or  her to contact them because they do not know what the motive is here.</p><p> Now initially, the first attacks, March 2nd, March 12th, they were  targeting two African-American men who were killed and a Latina woman who  was injured.  At that point, the police were saying to us, listen, this may  be a hate crime.</p><p> Sunday night, there was a tripwire that was attached to an explosion device  that injured two young white men in a different part of town.  And now, we  have these two packages apparently sent through FedEx, one that detonated  at this FedEx sorting facility behind me. </p><p> Those appear to be indiscriminate attacks.  So at this point, they are  still trying to figure out what the motive is behind this, and also  obviously, trying to find that bomber through forensics from the materials  that he has left behind and from the sites of those detonations, those  deadly detonations up in Austin.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALSH (voice-over):  A little after midnight, another alarming escalation.   A package exploded on the conveyer belt here at this FedEx sorting facility  60 miles southwest of Austin. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One employee that was standing near the explosion later  complained of ringing in the ears.  She was treated and released.</p><p> WALSH:  ATF, FBI and local law enforcement swarm the scene.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, that's what we're working on right now, we're  trying to understand what actually happened, we're trying to surf through  the evidence and let the evidence take us to where we need to go.</p><p> WALSH:  The FBI says law enforcement is now looking at two packages from  Tuesday.  </p><p> [17:50:00] The one that exploded in Schertz and the second suspicious  package found early this morning at another FedEx facility near the Austin  airport.</p><p> Federal Express says the company turned over to law enforcement, extensive  evidence related to these packages and the individual that shipped them,  collected from our advanced technology security systems.</p><p> The FBI now telling Cnn they suspect these devices are linked to their  investigation into the 18-day bombing spree in the Texas capital that has  left two men dead, killed by packages left on their porches, an elderly  woman badly injured by a similar device. </p><p> And two young men injured by device triggered by a tripwire across a  sidewalk in a quiet neighborhood Sunday night.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Before we had to look for a package, now you have to  look for everywhere.  I mean, it's harder to seal why your identity of the  package. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you are not expecting a package, if it's something  that doesn't have an official label on it, or really just not -- just the  package itself, if there's anything out of the ordinary, we are asking the  community to please call 911. </p><p> WALSH:  This afternoon, Sarah Sanders tweeting from the White House:  \"there's no apparent nexus to terrorism at this time.\"  And the president  making his first comments on the situation.</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is obviously a very  sick individual or maybe individuals.  These are sick people and we will  get to the bottom of it.</p><p> WALSH:  Authorities have appealed to the bomber to contact them, the  individual has not a motive remains unclear.</p><p> (on camera):  And investigators are now appealing to an increasingly  frightened public for help.  The reward for information leading to an  arrest say now stands at $115,000. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> ASHER:  Right, Nick Walsh, thank you so much, appreciate that.  Right,  still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, United Airlines pulled the  plugs on its animals -- flying animals in the cargo hold following a series  of incidents in the air.  We'll have details of this coming up after the  break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> ASHER:  All right, welcome back everybody.  After a string of mishaps, some  of which actually ended in tragedy, United Airlines is suspending pet  transportation in cargo hold.  There were three incidents in a week  including with this dog -- oh, adorable.</p><p> Which was actually loaded on the wrong flight and the plane was diverted to  the dog's proper destination in Ohio as soon as the mistake was realized.   So joining us live now is Rene Marsh.</p><p> So Rene, I mean, just walk us through this.  I mean, why completely suspend  pet transportation in cargo.  Why not just direct your resources to doing a  better job? </p><p> RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION &amp; TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT:   Right, well, I think that they feel like they got things so wrong with  these multiple situations that they need to take a pause and assess the  entire situation to see what is going wrong.  Now we're not talking about  just one incident, we're talking about multiple incidents here.  </p><p> [17:55:00] So as you mentioned, Zain, United Airlines is suspending its  program that allows passengers to transport their pets in the cargo hold.</p><p> The airlines says that they're going to stop accepting new reservations,  but they will honor any reservations that were made up until today.  And so  they -- what they're doing is they're reviewing their policy and how they  handle these animals. </p><p> They said that this review should be done by May 1st, so once it is  completed, then perhaps people will be allowed to carry their pets or  travel with their pets in the cargo hold of the plane.</p><p> But right now, they're doing that top-to-bottom review to make sure that  the animals flying in the belly of the plane are safe.  But in the meantime  though, if you do have a pet and you still want to carry it, it's a small  pet, carry it on board in the cabin of the plane.</p><p> You can do that, it's just right now, their focus is for those animals  traveling in the belly of the plane.</p><p> ASHER:  And in the cargo.  So just explain, why does it feel like United  Airlines is having more of a problem with pet transportation compared to  other airlines.</p><p> MARSH:  It feels that way because they are -- I mean, you know, you had -- </p><p> ASHER:  Go through my head then? </p><p> MARSH:  No, it's not in your head because I mean, you had an incident two  occasions where a pet was placed in the cargo hold and it was being flown  to the wrong destination, if you remember.</p><p> It was one dog that was sent to Japan, it was not supposed to be going to  Japan, and then you had another similar case again.  So clearly, there's a  breakdown in the system there, and the reason why United is taking such as  drastic approach here is because it's been in the headlines and it's not  good, especially not good for PR, back to you.</p><p> ASHER:  All right, Rene Marsh live for us there, thank you so much.  And my  friend, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'm Zain Asher, thank you so much for  watching, I'll see you again tomorrow.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

And take a look here, you can actually see that it was not a drop  of red, not a drop of red at all, we were firmly in the green the whole  day, we ended the day up a triple digit -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Certainly, a rebound after yesterday after that Facebook data scandal we  saw yesterday so a rebound, the markets are squarely focused over the next  two days on what happens with the Fed and raising interest rates we'll see  about that tomorrow.</p><p>Oh, and it is Tuesday, March 20th.</p><p>Tonight, lawmakers worldwide demand to grill Marc Zuckerberg; the E.U.  Justice Commissioner tells us tonight a full investigation maybe next.</p><p>And social media stocks thrive as Facebook share price drop even further.</p><p>And Toyota gives a timeout to its autonomous cars after a fatal Uber crash.</p><p>Hello my friends, I'm Zain Asher and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>All right welcome everyone as the calls grow form Marc Zuckerberg to be  held accountable for the Facebook data scandal tonight the E.U. is warning  there could be a fraud investigation, there could be a fraud investigation  because data was allegedly used without users' permissions.</p><p>So inside and outside of Facebook, inside and outside of Facebook there is  growing frustrations about the fact that we really haven't heard anything  from Marc Zuckerberg the CEO, complete radio silence from him however there  has been plenty of noise from the E.U., the U.K., Congress and the Federal  Trade Commission as well, they all want to know whether Facebook user data  was improperly used.</p><p>Facebook share price still suffering, down another 2 1/2 percent around 50  billion, $50 billion has been wiped off the value of Facebook just this  week, so just in the past few days.</p><p>What you won't find comments though on Marc Zuckerberg's Facebook page,  lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic say it is certainly well overdue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE PARTY MP:  I think the time is come  where someone out the company like Marc Zuckerberg whose job it is to  understand every detail of what Facebook does, they he - that he actually  now takes a public position and answers questions on this because our  experience of dealing with Facebook in the past is you often get you know,  evasive answers, partial answers to questions, people saying they don't  have the information.</p><p>But now is the time for the people who do have the information to speak.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), CHAIR, STEERING COMMITTEE:  I think he should  explain to the American people how this happened, how many people were  hurt, and most importantly how they're going to fix it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE  ON INTELLIGENCE:  I think that we ought to have the testimony not only of  the Facebook CEO but I think the CEOs of other major social media platforms  that the Russians exploited during the campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER SENATE COMMITTEES ON APPROPRIATIONS;  BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS; BUDGET; COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY;  SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP:  I'd like Mr. Zuckerberg to come.   Last time he sent his lawyers, I don't know what he pays, them but they did  a damn good job because they didn't say anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER:  Well you can see that, a lot of lawmakers in the United States  really, really want answers from Marc Zuckerberg right now.</p><p>Earlier the European Commissioner for Justice, Vera Jourova told me she  believes that Facebook broke E.U. rules.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSUMERS:  In our  rules already now, we have clearly stipulated that the processing of data  of private date of people can be only done under the condition of the well- informed consent of each individual.</p><p>So, what's happening now or what we know about recent scandal is that  millions of people and their data were processed and harvested without  their content - consent and we are going to launch the investigations in  several member states starting with the United Kingdom to find the facts  and the information about what happened and to what extent our data  protection rules have been breached.</p><p>And according to what we know about it now the rules have been breached,  the United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law conditions because there  might be even fraud found so they - there will be the procedure launched  very soon and it will be coordinated across the whole E.U. because it must  be that there is also for some other member states.</p><p>ASHER:  OK but in terms of figuring out and getting to the bottom of what  happened what questions would you like to see answered specifically by Marc  Zuckerberg?</p><p>JOUROVA:  What are - there are many questions I would like to ask Facebook  how is it possible that they disappointed the trust of the people who gave  them their privacy - private data and who didn't expect that the data will  be [0:05:13] abused in such a way that later they will be manipulated ahead  of the elections.</p><p>I think that these are very threatening facts or developments and we have  very serious concerns that such practices could be detrimental to democracy  and to the fundamental rights of individual people so that's why I have a  lot of questions I want to ask also Facebook and I will very probably write  a letter with several questions for instance why Facebook hasn't - haven't  - didn't react earlier, why there was not early enough notification to the  individual people.</p><p>Many other questions and of course we have the obligation to ask because we  must be much better in protecting the privacy of people.</p><p>ASHER:  Here's the thing, just you know, according to Facebook, this is -  this is basically an honest mistake.  Essentially, they trusted this  academic researcher, Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan and he was the one who  mishandled the data so if this is just an honest mistake, if this is just  an honest mistake, should we be careful about going too far in terms of how  the E.U. punishes Facebook for this?</p><p>JOUROVA:  I would not call it a mistake but for sure it's going too far.  I  am personally very sensitive about manipulation of the - of the people and  just imagine you entrust somebody you give him your data and then you find  out that it has been abused and you were the object of manipulation.</p><p>We in Europe are very sensitive about that, that's why we want to have the  consent of all the individuals when they are providing their data to  understand what is the purpose for which the IT company asks for the data  and what will be happening with the data.</p><p>And from May this year, we will have even stricter rules so which will give  more rights to the individuals. And here I see the deputy in the European Union and the United States  legislation because we are more careful and more sensitive and more strict  on the protection of privacy of people.</p><p>ASHER:  Yes, the European Union - Europeans are certainly more strict but  in terms of - in terms of a solution it's not just about individuals  figuring out privacy settings and that sort of thing it's also about  Facebook creating new policies about how it handles third-party access to  its data, that's really the key here, third-party access?</p><p>JOUROVA:  It has to be the subject of investigation, what happens there.   In my view Facebook should have been much more careful and keep asking  about the purpose may be not believe so easily that there is the research  going on and when they had the first indication that something goes wrong,  they should've asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and not to use  it anymore.</p><p>I think that something has been neglected or was neglected some time ago  and we want to understand better what exactly happened and who should be  blamed for what.</p><p>And European Union is known for imposing quite drastic sanctions in such  cases and we will not hesitate to use this follow-up because this case  might be also used as a deterrent case for the future possible cases.</p><p>(END AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER:  All right no sign of this man, you see on your screen, Facebook see  of course, Marc Zuckerberg one of the most recognizable CEOs in the world.</p><p>However, Facebook tells us that it will brief, it will brief multiple  congressional committees.</p><p>Right joining us now is Laurie Segall.</p><p>So, Laurie here's what I don't get, why on earth would it make sense for  Marc Zuckerberg to stay silent at a time like this?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN TECH,  EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  I mean I think it's a question we are all asking.  We as  the press, we ask that question we want to hear from him, the public wants  to hear from him, and what's really interesting to me is actually Facebook  executives people have told me, high level executive within the company  have said, we want to hear him too (ph).</p><p>ASHER:  They don't get it either.</p><p>SEGALL:  You know, I think this is a very protective story.  There's a lot  of nuance there and Marc Zuckerberg, Cheryl Sandberg these are brand names,  people want to talk to them at this time and there's this feeling from a  couple of folks I spoke to that he gets involved too late, he's not getting  his hands dirty, he's always very involved behind the scenes.</p><p>You know, a lot of folks will say he's a very respected leader, he is in  all these meetings, he is very, very, involved in these important  conversations, we as the public when we look at our data when we look at  what's happened, when we look at all of these challenging questions, the  weaponization (ph) of Facebook over the last year for democracy, what it's  doing to mental health, we [0:05:14] want the leader Facebook to step  forward and I think there's growing pressure mounting not just with us  here, with the public but within the company for him to speak publicly on  this thing.</p><p>ASHER:  And in terms of you know, you talked about Marc Zuckerberg and the  Facebook team just being in crisis meetings all day, just in terms of where  they go from here, their priority is not just you know, meeting with  lawmakers it's also figuring out a way to regain the public trust at a time  that this, how do they do that?</p><p>SEGALL:  I think that it's so important, I think transparency is going to  one of the biggest things you know, Marc might not like to speak what I  want to remind you, this isn't self-serving, I want to remind you that I  spoke to him in June and he actually was talking about his role as a leader  in this moment in time, he said to me at the time, he wants to make the  world a better place, take a listen?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK:  I just feel like we have a responsibility  to do more in the world.</p><p>Right and when you look at the world today, you know, giving people a voice  and helping people connect our good and have made the world better in a lot  of ways but our society still very divided right and that means that people  need to work proactively to help bring people closer together, it's not  just enough to help or simply connect we need to work to bring the world  closer together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL:  And I think you could argue that at this moment Facebook hasn't  brought the world closer together and I think we are actually at this point  (ph) -</p><p>ASHER:  I'm - I'm going to be the opposite (ph) actually.</p><p>SEGALL  - Yes, and I think we all asking these questions and what I think  when you ask the question about what can they do you know, a lot of the  leaders I spoke to behind closed doors say that we are having these  massively important ethical questions about the future that come along with  this you know, with having a platform this size, they say we want to have  these conversations.</p><p>You know, one person said to me you know, cracking down on fake news is  important but it can also lead to censorship of independent news, we have  to have these ethical conversations; these are conversations that should be  a public discussion and I think we as the public because our data is out  there we are hearing more about it, we want to know and be a part of these  discussions as well.</p><p>ASHER:  It does feel like a watershed moment for Facebook -</p><p>SEGALL: Yes.</p><p>ASHER:  - where people you know, there's a reckoning really.</p><p>Laurie Segall, live for us, thank you -</p><p>SEGALL:  Thank you.</p><p>ASHER:  - so much, yes.</p><p>OK so meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica has suspended its chief executive  after he was secretly filmed boasting, boasting about using dirty tricks to  help clients.</p><p>The data firm says Alexander Nix's comments with an undercover reporter,  \"Channel 4\" do not reflect the values of the company and promised a full  independent investigation.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh is joining us live now from London with more on this.</p><p>So, Nick when you look at parts of this documentary, aside from talking  about entrapping political opponents with bribery and sex and that sort of  thing, there was one line that really caught my attention by Nix in this  documentary where he talks about, he said, 'it doesn't have to be true, it  just have to be believed.'  It does not have to be true, it just have to be  believed.</p><p>In terms of targeting voters in and around election campaign, where do you  draw the line between persuasion and outright manipulation?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well I should  point out too Cambridge Analytica in that same undercover filming say they  are not in the business of fake news or providing false information but  yes, you know, there's a lot in what they say undercover as well, I should  point out, which they claim is scripted and edited to work in - against  them, a lot there that doesn't necessarily make them the most trustworthy  advocates.</p><p>And certainly, the company's own decision to suspend their CEO Alexander  Nix certainly speaks you might say volumes to quite how they feel about the  allegations being perceived and certainly they have a big struggle with  their message as a messaging company over the past couple of days.</p><p>The decision to suspend Mr. Nix actually emerged minutes before \"Channel 4  News\" broadcast the third of their reports about the company's use of data  and political moves there.</p><p>But your point earlier about whether the truth matters still or not is a  key sensitivity here as well because they talk about yes, well you can't  fight elections on facts, well you shouldn't fight elections on facts, you  should fight them on emotions and I think that plays certainly to wire  their story may be chimes with so many people at this stage.</p><p>After here in the United Kingdom seeing the Brexit vote go through in the  favor towards leaving the European Union, some say based on many spurious  promises by lead (ph) campaigners; by Donald Trump's much I think it's fair  to say heralded use of falsity at times and his election as well, it may  well be that social media in the eyes of many now is perhaps being viewed  less as a sort of a tool, as Laurie was saying of bringing the world  together, making us more closer to each other and perhaps way over sort of  amplifying falsity or certain opinions that may not be necessarily given to  you because they are true, may be given to you because actually they sort  of play on various chords and amplifier fears and make you vote in a  certain direction.</p><p>ASHER:  Yes.  If anything, someone argued it is actually made the world a  lot more divisive. Just in terms of Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica, has it been proven  that he did use all the tactics that he talked about in that \"Channel 4\"  documentary or was it a mix of you know, bravado and [0:05:14]  exaggeration?</p><p>PATON WALSH:  I certainly have to say, when I heard him talk about the idea  of using Ukrainian sex workers and undercover filming of an - of opposition  politician accepting a bribe, I thought to myself, well why on earth would  you need to spend millions hiring outside consultants, suggests too of a  more hand-fisted way of compromising a political candidate.</p><p>So, you could perhaps argue that by suggesting those he was to somewhat  degree lazy.</p><p>The other I - things suggested by his colleagues I mean that was clear to  some degree that they were selling their previous products and some of the  undercover filming suggested they'd massively influenced recent elections  in Kenya, obviously we don't know the full extent of that there, we don't  know the full extent really there.</p><p>Their influence on the U.S. election campaign, in fact indeed they say,  some of the data harvested was done too late to be any use them at all in  the work that they did in Donald Trump's selection in 2016 but certainly  you're presented with the idea of a man who has a pretty broad moral  contest to some degree in terms of what he's willing to offer although I  should point out he defends himself by saying, in those circumstances he  was in fact going along with a ridiculous suggestion by the undercover  reporter from Sri Lanka or allegedly that \"Channel 4\" put in front of him.</p><p>So, a confused situation in terms of its context but it leaves you  certainly questioning exactly what kind of role consultancies like  Cambridge Analytica genuinely have in the political process and quite  what's that's doing to states of democracy around the world.</p><p>Zain?</p><p>ASHER:  A broad moral contest as you put it.  Interesting way of putting  it, OK.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh live for us there.</p><p>PATON WALSH:  I'm being euphemistic.  All right.</p><p>ASHER:  Thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p>OK so everybody wants a moment with Mnuchin, the U.S. Treasury Secretary  faces his G20 colleagues as many secret explanations and exemption from  President Trump's steel tariffs, up next [0:01:56].</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER:  A very welcome back everybody.</p><p>So, the crisis at Facebook is dragging down social media stocks across the  board.  Facebook and Snap, the maker of Snapchat each fell as you see there  2 1/2 percent on Tuesday and look at that, Twitter, Twitter down more than  10 percent.  By the way going back to Facebook, you know, they were just  down 2 1/2 percent today, so far this week over the past couple of days  they have lost more than $50 billion, $50 billion in market value just this  week alone.</p><p>Twitter as I mentioned down $0.10, that's a one-month low and in to a  correction technically, down more than 10 percent; shares started plunging  when Israel justice minister threatened legal action against the company,  the minister said, \"Twitter does not do enough of a good job in terms of  removing terrorist material.\"</p><p>So much to talk about, Claire Sebastian, joining us now.</p><p>So, here's the thing, it does feel Claire, especially after yesterday, it  does feel that we've reached this watershed moment, right where people are  just having less patience for less tolerance for these tech companies and  the amount of power they wield over data, we haven't really seen investors  take flight in this way before because -</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN MONEY:  Right.</p><p>ASHER:  - when you talk about fifty billion dollars-worth of [0:05:13]  value being shed off Facebook that is no small thing.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Right.  And I think it is interesting you know, we saw the  worst days of Facebook in four years yesterday and I saw might've thought  that people might buy on the dip today and that wasn't to be.</p><p>And I think it's worth in the context of investors taking their emotion out  of this issue to the extent you look at what - when Facebook and Twitter  and Snap report earnings, what people are looking for is user growth and ad  growth and this scandal could affect both of those.</p><p>You have the letter from the FTC today, this could affect the whole way  that Facebook does business.  You've got the issue of user growth and the  Zeitgeist just went on the list but around social media it's - it's  changing, you've got hashtag-delete-Facebook going around on Twitter,  people are starting to talk more about this.</p><p>And I want to bring in Ross Gerber, he's a veteran tech investor and he  says he selling out of Facebook, at least most of his holdings there, take  a listen?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS GERBER, VETERAN TECH INVESTOR &amp; FACEBOOK SHAREHOLDER:  I think - we're  at peak social, this is the abuse of the public's trust that is beyond  belief.</p><p>And when you look at the problems we've had with Brexit in England and in  the United States with the divisiveness and the rise in hate, crimes and  the - just the bad state of the world, we have to hold accountable that  social media is not just about fun anymore, it's completely manipulated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  So, you know, the sentiment around social media, his worry is  that is - it's changing essentially and I think you know, he's not - he  does - they're - not everyone thinks so.</p><p>Well I've spoken to another investor today, he says look, Facebook isn't  just about Facebook, it also has Messenger, it also was Instagram, and it  also has WhatsApp out there, there are other properties there.</p><p>Some people will be looking at the price of that stock today and thinking  oh maybe this is time to come in, they are still strongly, are still making  a lot of money but I think we are in a moment, and I think you should see  that by the second day of fall.</p><p>ASHER:  Let's talk about Twitter, down 10 percent.  This is significant  because in part and obviously social media is suffering right now but this  is in part because Israel is threatening legal action against Twitter  because Twitter isn't doing enough they say to combat you know, sort of  terrorism instigation that happens on social media.</p><p>This is not the first time we've seen social media being used by you know,  lone-wolf attackers for example or persuading people to join different  terrorist groups but it does seem that the Israelis now certainly have a  lot less patience for this?</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely.  And the justice minister in particular has been -  has been particularly focused on this, she takes a Twitter this week and  said you know, look we've - we've dealt with this in the past, with  Facebook in 2016, she met with Facebook exec and they apparently complied  with a lot of her requests to take down content that they felt was inciting  violence.</p><p>She said they've asked Twitter to do the same, Twitter haven't responded  and now she says they're threatened legal action.</p><p>But I think you can't see this separate from the rest of the context that's  going on, this is the broader issue of fear among investors that platforms  like Facebook, like Twitter are not in full control of their data, they  don't seem to have full control over the types of content that is on their  platforms.</p><p>ASHER:  Incredible.  Especially what Ross Gerber said about you know, we're  seeing you know, pushing against not this fun, happy, place anymore you  know, there is serious manipulation going on, that was quite chilling I  find.  OK.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p>Alright so, despite the social media rout, all three major U.S. markets  ended the day in the green, let's take a look here.</p><p>OK so, at the end of the day, up 116 points, that earlier turnaround from  what we saw yesterday, the Dow finished up nearly a half of a percent.  All  eyes now turn to the Fed which is expected to raise interest rates on  Wednesday, they are in a two-day meeting right now, the big question all of  you will have is how frequently will we see interest rate rises this year  although as I mentioned, they are expected to raise rates tomorrow.</p><p>All right, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted today that U.S. trade  policy is not about protectionism but free and fair trade.  Mnuchin spoke  after attending 15 meetings at a summit of G20 Finance ministers in Buenos  Aires.</p><p>The Treasury secretary is under pressure to explain, people want answers,  he has to explain President Trump's new tariffs, a number of countries are  seeking exemptions from Mnuchin are also weighing retaliate or measures at  the same time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY, US:  There's always a risk if we put  tariffs on that other people will reciprocate and there is a risk of a  trade war.  As the president has said, we are not afraid of getting into a  trade war given the size of our market, the size of our economy and the  fact that we have a big trade deficit.</p><p>Having said that, that's not our goal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER:  Earlier Tuesday, China's premier pledged to further open the  country's economy adding he hoped that both the U.S. and China would act  rationally and not be led by emotions into a trade war.</p><p>Challenging moment certainly for the U.S. Treasury secretary.</p><p>Patrick Gillespie joins us live now, so here's the thing, you and I  discussed this earlier, Steve Mnuchin is a free trader, much like Gary Cohn  -</p><p>PATRICK GILLESPIE, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>ASHER:  - how on earth did he go to a meeting with G20 and defend something  [0:05:14] that deep down we all know that he doesn't really believe in?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  Zain, Mnuchin is between a 'rock and a hard place' because he  has to defend the White House trade policy which he has tried to steer away  from the most extreme measures and sweeping tariffs, at the same time he  has to assuage these concerns that the U.S. isn't about to spark a global  trade war.</p><p>But as you mentioned several countries from South Korea to Argentina, to  France, Germany, Italy, they are seeking exemptions at these meetings and  they're not getting them.</p><p>And you know, Mnuchin tries to call the concern there by saying, 'well  exemptions will come relatively quickly,' he told that to \"The New York  Times\" but you're not getting any more -</p><p>ASHER:  But -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - specificity.</p><p>ASHER:  - you have until Friday right, so this is like three days, the  tariffs are supposed to go into effect on Friday (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  The deadline -</p><p>ASHER:  - three days -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - is coming up -</p><p>ASHER:  - So how does he pick - if everybody -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - this is the last opportunity countries have to get a face-to- face with the U.S. administration.</p><p>ASHER:  - but if everybody is begging him, you know, \"Oh, you know, Steve,  can we get an exemption; can our country get an exemption?\"  How does he  choose who is friend and who is foe?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - Well, this is - the kind of opacity of the administration.   They are not showing - they say there isn't a one-size-fits-all you know,  metric or test to make country exempt and so every country is saying,  you've - you've got countries like Argentina, which I would think would not  be a threat to U.S. national security, saying, \"We import less than one  percent of your steel.  You know, we are not a risk of - we're not a  national security risk to you,' and still the U.S. administration is  saying, \"Will think about it.\"</p><p>ASHER:  But here's - years the thing, President Trump has talked about  defending national security and we can't have imports in terms of steel and  aluminum because you know, we've got to defend national security.  However,  Mnuchin sort of change his language a little bit and talked about 'national  interests' as opposed to 'national security,' why do you think he did that?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  Well I think it gets to the core of that he doesn't you know,  he has tried to walk back some of these most extreme trade measures Zain  and so, when he adjusts the language a bit he, you know, he let - it allows  him to say, 'well there is economic interest of play; there's jobs at  play.'  It -</p><p>ASHER:  Could it be that it's quite difficult to push something you don't  believe in yourself?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - OK.</p><p>ASHER:  Maybe I shouldn't say that; I shouldn't say that, sorry, sorry.</p><p>GILLESPIE:  I think it is difficult for him because you know, - before Gary  Cohn left, it was Mnuchin and Gary Cohn who were postponing these specific  tariffs, these were supposed to happen last summer Zain, and Gary Cohn and  Mnuchin said, 'let's push it back for the last minute.'</p><p>Well, we are at that last-minute right now and now Mnuchin is still in the  hot seat and he has to you know, be front-and-center in front of these  countries saying, 'listen we are not going to start a trade war but we're  not going to tell you if we're going to hit you with tariffs.'</p><p>ASHER:  Oh, I do - I do not envy him at all.</p><p>OK, Patrick Gillespie, thank you.</p><p>GILLESPIE:  Sure, we'll see on Friday. </p><p>ASHER:  Thank you.</p><p>All right, coming up British lawmakers call for answers from Facebook,  we'll hear from an MP who wants Marc Zuckerberg himself, he wants Marc  Zuckerberg himself to testify at an inquiry into fake news, that's next  [0:02:59].</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[17:30:00] ZAIN ASHER, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello everyone, I'm  Zain Asher.  Coming up in the next top hour on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the  head of U.K.'s parliament media committee says why it's time for Mark  Zuckerberg to appear before British lawmakers. </p><p>And United Airlines ground its tech cargo business after sending too many  dogs to the wrong destination.  But first though, these are the top  business headlines for you at this hour.</p><p>Regulators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are growing in their  cause for Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg to speak about the data scandal of  the social media giant.  Speaking to me on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Europe's  Justice Commissioner says she believes data protection rules have been  broken.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VERA JOUROVA, COMMISSIONER, JUSTICE, CONSUMERS &amp; GENDER EQUALITY, EUROPEAN  COMMISSION:  According to what we know about it now, the rules have been  breached.  The United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law or  conditions, because of that it might be even fraud found.</p><p>So there will be a procedure launched very soon. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ASHER:  White House Press Secretary dodged a question Tuesday about whether  the Russian election was free and fair.  They came up after President  Donald Trump said he congratulated Russian president Vladimir Putin on his  reelection on Sunday. </p><p>That drew rebuke from Republican Senator John McCain.  Mr. Trump met in the  Oval Office, Tuesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and then  may sat down for working lunch. </p><p>Prince Mohammed's reformist methods and the promise of Saudi investment in  the U.S. have made him slightly quite popular with the Trump  administration. </p><p>All right, so Toyota is pausing its driverless car testing in the wake of  the fatal scandal involving an autonomous Uber car in Arizona.  The car  maker says Uber's incident is certainly unrelated to them, but it could  certainly have an emotional effect on its drivers.</p><p>I want to bring in Samuel Burke who is following the story.  So Samuel, do  we expect other car companies and other tech companies to follow suit? Just  so far, it's just Uber and Toyota.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  It certainly  wouldn't surprise me, Zain, because I think there's an incredible amount of  pressure on the people who are behind the wheel of the self-driving cars.</p><p>It sounds like a contradicting -- contradiction, but almost all of these  vehicles certainly in Arizona have somebody behind the wheel.  And of  course, the first thing that people say when they hear this story is, if  there was a driver behind the wheel during this incident in Tempe, why  weren't they able to stop it?</p><p>So I actually just spoke with somebody who has one of these jobs in  Arizona, and said that they feel the pressure, people don't realize how  difficult it can be to be at the wheel of a car that's driving all the  time.</p><p>It's easy to disengage even though it's your job when you're not actively  doing it and you're passive the whole time.  So they do feel this sense of  pressure, so I wouldn't be surprised if other companies follow the steps  that Toyota had taken.</p><p>But this is just a temporary measure, and let's be honest, this is the  future of driving.  We know that people will get back behind the wheel of  these driverless cars, and I'm sure that Uber's program will continue much  sooner than later.</p><p>ASHER:  But are we going to see lease -- I mean, you mentioned, it's just  temporary, fine.  But are we going to see at least types of regulation in  the mean time while they sort of figure this out.</p><p>Temporary regulation that block these driverless cars from testing in  public streets.</p><p>BURKE:  I actually just spoke to an executive at one of these companies who  said that he doesn't expect that in large part, maybe some small measures  here and there.  Arizona, the state where this is happened, it's actually a  hot bed of self-driving development. </p><p>And the state there, the governor has touted this as a real strong commerce  point for Arizona, so there will likely be a pause, but they expect because  this is benefitting a state like Arizona, even with this terrible strategy  for it to go on.</p><p>But Zain, this is a learning moment, not just for humans, but for the  actual cars.  It's terrible to say this, but this is an important data  point.  You don't want to think of a life as a data point, but that's  exactly what it has to be so that the cars can learn from this incident,  see what they did wrong so that it doesn't happen again.</p><p>Remember the goal of this self-driving technology is to eliminate all of  the human error that causes fatal accidents or non-fatal accidents.  Of  course, this time around, that's much harder to show.</p><p>[17:35:00] But it's a lot like fear of flying, everybody has it, even  though statistically it's very unlikely.  Yes, there's this uncomfortable  sense around this tragedy, but almost all the numbers would show  demonstrably that self-driving is much safer than us humans behind the  wheel. </p><p>ASHER:  Right, but perhaps, there should be some changes to make sure that  it's easy for the drivers behind the driverless cars to actually stop it in  the wake of potential accidents.</p><p>All right, Samuel Burke, live for us there, thank you so much.  OK, guys,  back to our top story tonight.  British lawmakers want Mark Zuckerberg to  testify at a parliamentary inquiry instead of fake news. </p><p>Earlier on, I spoke to the man leading those cause, conservative MP Damian  Collins, and I asked him what he wants to hear from the Facebook CEO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR FOLKESTONE &amp; HYTHE:  The questions  that we asked when we had a policy hearing with Facebook in Washington last  month which was -- we asked them about their relationship with Cambridge  Analytica. </p><p>We asked what they do to keep user data safe, and also what they do to make  sure they can effectively recover data if it ends up in the hands of a  third party and then breach their own rules.</p><p>And it is data breach story we've been looking at.  You know, we see  unsatisfactory answers to all of those questions, and we certainly didn't  get clear answers to those questions when we posed them last month. </p><p>They said then they would give us their written evidence to support that,  they still hasn't come through.  So I think the time has come where someone  at the company like Mark Zuckerberg whose job it is to understand every  detail of what Facebook does. </p><p>He actually now takes the public position and answers questions on this  because our experience of dealing with Facebook in the past as you often  get, you know, very stiff answers, partial answers to questions, people  saying they don't have the information. </p><p>What now is the time for the people who do have the information to speak. </p><p>ASHER:  Yes, we haven't heard from Mark Zuckerberg at all just in terms of  him coming out and speaking to the public as our reporter Lori Siegel was  just mentioning.</p><p>But how do you think, just in terms of the solution going forward, how do  think Facebook should actually be held responsible because this is  obviously beyond just being a massive crisis for the company just in terms  of the data and mishandling.</p><p>I mean, this is huge.  How should they be held responsible in the way that  also sends messages, a strong message to other social media companies that,  you know, data mishandling is quite simply non-negotiable.</p><p>COLLINS:  That's right, it is non-negotiable.  And for Facebook users who  are following this story, their concern will be, well, you know, well,  there might not be surprised, but just how much data Facebook holds on  them.</p><p>But they might be even more concerned about whether Facebook can keep that  data safe.  So we have questions as part of our inquiry, part of our  parliamentary inquiry, we want the company to answer, we want Mark  Zuckerberg to answer.</p><p>But I think there's also a question of what can we do to stiffen the laws  in the U.K., because no matter how big a company is, they have to comply  with the laws of the country where they operate.</p><p>So we have been discussing changing the powers of the U.K. information  commissioner, to give her the power, not to request data as part of  investigations, but to go in and get it, if it's not forthcoming.</p><p>The moment there's a new bill before parliament which would give the  information commissioner the power to have a -- but deliver heavy fines.   But we think they should go beyond that, and they should have the power to  get the data.</p><p>That will be our best way of knowing that the big tech companies are not  just behaving in an ethical way, but they're abiding by the laws in our  country to make sure they're keeping people's data safe.</p><p>ASHER:  A lot of people would find that idea of, you know, the government  in the U.K. being able to get data from Facebook.  A lot of people will  find that overly restrictive.  Is it not somewhat of a concern of yours as  you work to sort of figure out a potential solution to this.</p><p>COLLINS:  Well, we should look at ways in other industries like tele -- you  know, telecoms and in broadcasting.  They have companies and it handles  huge amounts of personal data, there are data protection laws to make sure  that they do that probably. </p><p>But we have a regulator offcom which has oversight of those companies to  make sure they're complying with the law.  So these data protection issues  are one -- are issues that have been resolved in many other industries, but  the tech industry, it doesn't get applied.</p><p>And I think we have to say now that the tech is innovative, but it's also  established.  It's the dominant force in many of the markets where it  operates.  And it needs to be -- we need to have proper oversight of what  they're doing.</p><p>Otherwise, we are in a position where we can pass all the data protection  laws we like, but we're entirely dependent on the tech companies enforcing  them properly and they got no means of checking.  So I think it's a reserve  power, and not exercise by politicians but by an independent government  agency. </p><p>The ability to go in and get important data when it's part of an inquiry.   I think it'll be an important reform.  I think that will be our best way of  ensuring that the companies comply with the law.</p><p>ASHER:  OK, but beyond, you know, a controversial law like that for  example, what will be the best way at this point for Facebook to gain or  regain the trust of your committee? </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, I think they need to explain what -- how they keep using  data safe.  Why they didn't investigate more rigorously the data breach  involving Cambridge Analytica, why they didn't act, you know, quicker to  ensure that, that data have been destroyed.</p><p>And also what can they do to ensure the use of data that is gathered from  Facebook peep through people's interaction with apps and games and surveys  created by other people.</p><p>[17:40:00] What do they do to make sure that data is safe too? Because of  those -- it's not at all clear how about works at the moment.  And we'll be  holding a further hearing of a committee tomorrow afternoon in London where  we will be talking to a former policy officer at Facebook who was  responsible for overseeing in which their data policy works and the way  data privacy rules work. </p><p>To understand more about this, it will be very interesting to hear what  they have to say.  But I think this is an issue of increasing concern for  Facebook users.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ASHER:  MP Damian Green there.  OK, so here's a piece of advice for you  from tech experts, not from myself.  The tech experts are basically saying  that now might be a good time to check what data you are sharing with third  party apps on Facebook. </p><p>To find out, we're going to give instructions here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS,  and to find out, all you have to do is log on to Facebook and select  settings -- recognize that face, that was our friend Stelter. </p><p>Then navigate to the menu bar on the left and then click on apps, you will  see a list of third party apps, list of third party apps that you can get  access some of your data to stop sharing all data with a specific app,  click on the X, this will remove the app completely from your Facebook  account.</p><p>Or click on an app to find out what exactly you are sharing in terms of  data and make adjustments.  Now Facebook is not the only advertising  support network that sells some of your info to third parties.</p><p>Here's just a few: Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, AOL, Amazon, Twitter and Yelp  all do it too.  Brian Stelter, there's so much to discuss.  Saw your lovely  picture by the way on the screen there --</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  I don't know what I'm doing  on Facebook.  You know, I think all the fun from Facebook 10 or 15 years  ago, and now we're finally re-evaluating our own relationship with this  growing social network. </p><p>I haven't done that, that privacy check-up in years.  But what you just  showed makes me really want to log on and see how much I really I am  sharing. </p><p>ASHER:  Yes, because one of the things that I was asking you earlier is  really, why is it that we feel so comfortable trusting these social media  companies, these tech companies with so much personal information.</p><p>STELTER:  Because we do get a lot of benefits out of Facebook and Google  and other sites.  Let's be honest.  You know, I think there's a long  overdue reckoning with some of the down sides to social media, but there  are a lot of upside as well.</p><p>Whether it's baby pictures, reuniting with old friends, keeping in touch  with family, we do benefit from these sites.  But because they are free, it  means that we are the part.</p><p>And I think that's what too many users are belatedly starting to realize.   Now because it's free, advertisers are trying to reach us through this free  site.  We are really the ones being sold to advertisers through our data. </p><p>ASHER:  This Facebook, I guess and Twitter do more to bring us together or  more to tear us apart? </p><p>STELTER:  It certainly feels when you're in the eco -- the eco-chamber of  Facebook and Twitter, we are looking at the toxic comments they pile up on  stories feels like these sites do more to divide us.</p><p>But I try to be an optimist here.  We don't hear every day about the  weddings and marriage proposals, all of the reunions, it happens, thanks to  these social networking sites.  However, there are ways to have all the  good that come from social networks without so much of the toxicity,  without so much of the misuse of data.</p><p>And that's when I'm starting to hear politicians say, you know, you were  just talking to folks in the U.K., the politicians here in the U.S.,  lawmakers in the U.S., both on the Democratic and Republican sites have  been saying we need to figure out a way to preserve the good from Facebook,  without all this one like we're abused by the site.</p><p>ASHER:  I know, but one of the things that the British lawmaker -- I was  just speaking to Damian Green, did touch on earlier with this idea that,  you know, maybe -- Damian Collins, my producer just corrected me, thank you  so much, Tom.</p><p>He was talking about, you know, one of the main possible solutions -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>ASHER:  A possible solution -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>ASHER:  Would be for Facebook or the government rather to have access to  more of Facebook's data.  But the U.K. government has access to more of  Facebook's data.  I particularly find that price scary.</p><p>STELTER:  Yes, maybe the solution not to give away for more aware, yes.   Yes, Zuckerberg, Facebook talked years ago about privacy being dead.  That  on the internet, that's the trade off you make, that these big companies  and maybe big governments are going to have access to more of your personal  information.</p><p>But we are seeing a slow, but steady, resistance to that idea building.   Out of it gets lawmakers, different organizations that are forming to try  and say, hold on a second, we need to talk about the trade-offs we're  making when we log on to these sites.</p><p>And it shouldn't be entirely a one-way thing, we're giving all of our data  away when we log on.</p><p>ASHER:  Is this story over the past few days big enough for ordinary people  to really re-evaluate their relationship with Facebook and their privacy  settings, and how much time they spend on Facebook and what information  they give up. </p><p>STELTER:  I think people are giving it a second look, but we all see people  deleting their Facebook accounts or Instagram for that matter.  You know,  for the top five apps on a lot of people's phones all around the world,  Facebook apps, Messenger and Instagram, not just the main Facebook.</p><p>This company has embedded itself into most internet users daily lives.  And  I don't see that changing.  But if -- </p><p>[17:45:00] ASHER:  But the level of trust -- </p><p>STELTER:  But yes, and if you use Facebook, that's often, if you're not,  sure you trust it.  That does do damage to the company's bottom line.  So  it is in Facebook's best interest to address these problems.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, Brian Stelter, Brian, thank you so much, I appreciate  that.  OK, so it's been described as a state of absolute panic right now in  Texas.  A fifth package have exploded, this time at a FedEx sorting  facility, that story is next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ASHER:  Welcome back everybody.  So FedEx's profit for the third quarter  beat expectations on Wall Street.  The logistics company says it benefitted  from increased volumes at FedEx ground and freight, FedEx net profit got a  billion and a half dollar boost, thanks to the new U.S. corporate tax law.</p><p>Now entirely separate, we have another story entirely separate from the  company's earnings.  A package exploded at a FedEx sorting center near San  Antonio, Texas, on Tuesday morning.  That's after by the way four  explosions, two of them deadly which have rattled the city of Austin,  Texas, over the past three weeks.</p><p>Cnn national correspondent Nick Walsh is in Schertz, Texas, near the FedEx  facility.  So Nick, based on all the explosions, what can authorities at  this point, even though it's early days piece together about the suspect? </p><p>NICK WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is the main  thing that they are trying to figure out.  And frankly, I am not sure that  they know much.  They have appealed to that suspect, they have asked him or  her to contact them because they do not know what the motive is here.</p><p>Now initially, the first attacks, March 2nd, March 12th, they were  targeting two African-American men who were killed and a Latina woman who  was injured.  At that point, the police were saying to us, listen, this may  be a hate crime.</p><p>Sunday night, there was a tripwire that was attached to an explosion device  that injured two young white men in a different part of town.  And now, we  have these two packages apparently sent through FedEx, one that detonated  at this FedEx sorting facility behind me. </p><p>Those appear to be indiscriminate attacks.  So at this point, they are  still trying to figure out what the motive is behind this, and also  obviously, trying to find that bomber through forensics from the materials  that he has left behind and from the sites of those detonations, those  deadly detonations up in Austin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALSH (voice-over):  A little after midnight, another alarming escalation.   A package exploded on the conveyer belt here at this FedEx sorting facility  60 miles southwest of Austin. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One employee that was standing near the explosion later  complained of ringing in the ears.  She was treated and released.</p><p>WALSH:  ATF, FBI and local law enforcement swarm the scene.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, that's what we're working on right now, we're  trying to understand what actually happened, we're trying to surf through  the evidence and let the evidence take us to where we need to go.</p><p>WALSH:  The FBI says law enforcement is now looking at two packages from  Tuesday.  </p><p>[17:50:00] The one that exploded in Schertz and the second suspicious  package found early this morning at another FedEx facility near the Austin  airport.</p><p>Federal Express says the company turned over to law enforcement, extensive  evidence related to these packages and the individual that shipped them,  collected from our advanced technology security systems.</p><p>The FBI now telling Cnn they suspect these devices are linked to their  investigation into the 18-day bombing spree in the Texas capital that has  left two men dead, killed by packages left on their porches, an elderly  woman badly injured by a similar device. </p><p>And two young men injured by device triggered by a tripwire across a  sidewalk in a quiet neighborhood Sunday night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Before we had to look for a package, now you have to  look for everywhere.  I mean, it's harder to seal why your identity of the  package. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you are not expecting a package, if it's something  that doesn't have an official label on it, or really just not -- just the  package itself, if there's anything out of the ordinary, we are asking the  community to please call 911. </p><p>WALSH:  This afternoon, Sarah Sanders tweeting from the White House:  \"there's no apparent nexus to terrorism at this time.\"  And the president  making his first comments on the situation.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is obviously a very  sick individual or maybe individuals.  These are sick people and we will  get to the bottom of it.</p><p>WALSH:  Authorities have appealed to the bomber to contact them, the  individual has not a motive remains unclear.</p><p>(on camera):  And investigators are now appealing to an increasingly  frightened public for help.  The reward for information leading to an  arrest say now stands at $115,000. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ASHER:  Right, Nick Walsh, thank you so much, appreciate that.  Right,  still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, United Airlines pulled the  plugs on its animals -- flying animals in the cargo hold following a series  of incidents in the air.  We'll have details of this coming up after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ASHER:  All right, welcome back everybody.  After a string of mishaps, some  of which actually ended in tragedy, United Airlines is suspending pet  transportation in cargo hold.  There were three incidents in a week  including with this dog -- oh, adorable.</p><p>Which was actually loaded on the wrong flight and the plane was diverted to  the dog's proper destination in Ohio as soon as the mistake was realized.   So joining us live now is Rene Marsh.</p><p>So Rene, I mean, just walk us through this.  I mean, why completely suspend  pet transportation in cargo.  Why not just direct your resources to doing a  better job? </p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION &amp; TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT:   Right, well, I think that they feel like they got things so wrong with  these multiple situations that they need to take a pause and assess the  entire situation to see what is going wrong.  Now we're not talking about  just one incident, we're talking about multiple incidents here.  </p><p>[17:55:00] So as you mentioned, Zain, United Airlines is suspending its  program that allows passengers to transport their pets in the cargo hold.</p><p>The airlines says that they're going to stop accepting new reservations,  but they will honor any reservations that were made up until today.  And so  they -- what they're doing is they're reviewing their policy and how they  handle these animals. </p><p>They said that this review should be done by May 1st, so once it is  completed, then perhaps people will be allowed to carry their pets or  travel with their pets in the cargo hold of the plane.</p><p>But right now, they're doing that top-to-bottom review to make sure that  the animals flying in the belly of the plane are safe.  But in the meantime  though, if you do have a pet and you still want to carry it, it's a small  pet, carry it on board in the cabin of the plane.</p><p>You can do that, it's just right now, their focus is for those animals  traveling in the belly of the plane.</p><p>ASHER:  And in the cargo.  So just explain, why does it feel like United  Airlines is having more of a problem with pet transportation compared to  other airlines.</p><p>MARSH:  It feels that way because they are -- I mean, you know, you had -- </p><p>ASHER:  Go through my head then? </p><p>MARSH:  No, it's not in your head because I mean, you had an incident two  occasions where a pet was placed in the cargo hold and it was being flown  to the wrong destination, if you remember.</p><p>It was one dog that was sent to Japan, it was not supposed to be going to  Japan, and then you had another similar case again.  So clearly, there's a  breakdown in the system there, and the reason why United is taking such as  drastic approach here is because it's been in the headlines and it's not  good, especially not good for PR, back to you.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, Rene Marsh live for us there, thank you so much.  And my  friend, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'm Zain Asher, thank you so much for  watching, I'll see you again tomorrow.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

And take a look here, you can actually see that it was not a drop  of red, not a drop of red at all, we were firmly in the green the whole  day, we ended the day up a triple digit -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Certainly, a rebound after yesterday after that Facebook data scandal we  saw yesterday so a rebound, the markets are squarely focused over the next  two days on what happens with the Fed and raising interest rates we'll see  about that tomorrow.</p><p>Oh, and it is Tuesday, March 20th.</p><p>Tonight, lawmakers worldwide demand to grill Marc Zuckerberg; the E.U.

AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), CHAIR, STEERING COMMITTEE:  I think he should  explain to the American people how this happened, how many people were  hurt, and most importantly how they're going to fix it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE  ON INTELLIGENCE:  I think that we ought to have the testimony not only of  the Facebook CEO but I think the CEOs of other major social media platforms  that the Russians exploited during the campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER SENATE COMMITTEES ON APPROPRIATIONS;  BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS; BUDGET; COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY;  SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP:  I'd like Mr. Zuckerberg to come.   Last time he sent his lawyers, I don't know what he pays, them but they did  a damn good job because they didn't say anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER:  Well you can see that, a lot of lawmakers in the United States  really, really want answers from Marc Zuckerberg right now.</p><p>Earlier the European Commissioner for Justice, Vera Jourova told me she  believes that Facebook broke E.U. rules.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSUMERS:  In our  rules already now, we have clearly stipulated that the processing of data  of private date of people can be only done under the condition of the well- informed consent of each individual.</p><p>So, what's happening now or what we know about recent scandal is that  millions of people and their data were processed and harvested without  their content - consent and we are going to launch the investigations in  several member states starting with the United Kingdom to find the facts  and the information about what happened and to what extent our data  protection rules have been breached.</p><p>And according to what we know about it now the rules have been breached,  the United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law conditions because there  might be even fraud found so they - there will be the procedure launched  very soon and it will be coordinated across the whole E.U. because it must  be that there is also for some other member states.</p><p>ASHER:  OK but in terms of figuring out and getting to the bottom of what  happened what questions would you like to see answered specifically by Marc  Zuckerberg?</p><p>JOUROVA:  What are - there are many questions I would like to ask Facebook  how is it possible that they disappointed the trust of the people who gave  them their privacy - private data and who didn't expect that the data will  be [0:05:13] abused in such a way that later they will be manipulated ahead  of the elections.</p><p>I think that these are very threatening facts or developments and we have  very serious concerns that such practices could be detrimental to democracy  and to the fundamental rights of individual people so that's why I have a  lot of questions I want to ask also Facebook and I will very probably write  a letter with several questions for instance why Facebook hasn't - haven't  - didn't react earlier, why there was not early enough notification to the  individual people.</p><p>Many other questions and of course we have the obligation to ask because we  must be much better in protecting the privacy of people.</p><p>ASHER:  Here's the thing, just you know, according to Facebook, this is -  this is basically an honest mistake.  Essentially, they trusted this  academic researcher, Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan and he was the one who  mishandled the data so if this is just an honest mistake, if this is just  an honest mistake, should we be careful about going too far in terms of how  the E.U. punishes Facebook for this?</p><p>JOUROVA:  I would not call it a mistake but for sure it's going too far.  I  am personally very sensitive about manipulation of the - of the people and  just imagine you entrust somebody you give him your data and then you find  out that it has been abused and you were the object of manipulation.</p><p>We in Europe are very sensitive about that, that's why we want to have the  consent of all the individuals when they are providing their data to  understand what is the purpose for which the IT company asks for the data  and what will be happening with the data.</p><p>And from May this year, we will have even stricter rules so which will give  more rights to the individuals. And here I see the deputy in the European Union and the United States  legislation because we are more careful and more sensitive and more strict  on the protection of privacy of people.</p><p>ASHER:  Yes, the European Union - Europeans are certainly more strict but  in terms of - in terms of a solution it's not just about individuals  figuring out privacy settings and that sort of thing it's also about  Facebook creating new policies about how it handles third-party access to  its data, that's really the key here, third-party access?</p><p>JOUROVA:  It has to be the subject of investigation, what happens there.   In my view Facebook should have been much more careful and keep asking  about the purpose may be not believe so easily that there is the research  going on and when they had the first indication that something goes wrong,  they should've asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and not to use  it anymore.</p><p>I think that something has been neglected or was neglected some time ago  and we want to understand better what exactly happened and who should be  blamed for what.</p><p>And European Union is known for imposing quite drastic sanctions in such  cases and we will not hesitate to use this follow-up because this case  might be also used as a deterrent case for the future possible cases.</p><p>(END AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER:  All right no sign of this man, you see on your screen, Facebook see  of course, Marc Zuckerberg one of the most recognizable CEOs in the world.</p><p>However, Facebook tells us that it will brief, it will brief multiple  congressional committees.</p><p>Right joining us now is Laurie Segall.</p><p>So, Laurie here's what I don't get, why on earth would it make sense for  Marc Zuckerberg to stay silent at a time like this?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN TECH,  EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  I mean I think it's a question we are all asking.  We as  the press, we ask that question we want to hear from him, the public wants  to hear from him, and what's really interesting to me is actually Facebook  executives people have told me, high level executive within the company  have said, we want to hear him too (ph).</p><p>ASHER:  They don't get it either.</p><p>SEGALL:  You know, I think this is a very protective story.  There's a lot  of nuance there and Marc Zuckerberg, Cheryl Sandberg these are brand names,  people want to talk to them at this time and there's this feeling from a  couple of folks I spoke to that he gets involved too late, he's not getting  his hands dirty, he's always very involved behind the scenes.</p><p>You know, a lot of folks will say he's a very respected leader, he is in  all these meetings, he is very, very, involved in these important  conversations, we as the public when we look at our data when we look at  what's happened, when we look at all of these challenging questions, the  weaponization (ph) of Facebook over the last year for democracy, what it's  doing to mental health, we [0:05:14] want the leader Facebook to step  forward and I think there's growing pressure mounting not just with us  here, with the public but within the company for him to speak publicly on  this thing.</p><p>ASHER:  And in terms of you know, you talked about Marc Zuckerberg and the  Facebook team just being in crisis meetings all day, just in terms of where  they go from here, their priority is not just you know, meeting with  lawmakers it's also figuring out a way to regain the public trust at a time  that this, how do they do that?</p><p>SEGALL:  I think that it's so important, I think transparency is going to  one of the biggest things you know, Marc might not like to speak what I  want to remind you, this isn't self-serving, I want to remind you that I  spoke to him in June and he actually was talking about his role as a leader  in this moment in time, he said to me at the time, he wants to make the  world a better place, take a listen?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK:  I just feel like we have a responsibility  to do more in the world.</p><p>Right and when you look at the world today, you know, giving people a voice  and helping people connect our good and have made the world better in a lot  of ways but our society still very divided right and that means that people  need to work proactively to help bring people closer together, it's not  just enough to help or simply connect we need to work to bring the world  closer together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL:  And I think you could argue that at this moment Facebook hasn't  brought the world closer together and I think we are actually at this point  (ph) -</p><p>ASHER:  I'm - I'm going to be the opposite (ph) actually.</p><p>SEGALL  - Yes, and I think we all asking these questions and what I think  when you ask the question about what can they do you know, a lot of the  leaders I spoke to behind closed doors say that we are having these  massively important ethical questions about the future that come along with  this you know, with having a platform this size, they say we want to have  these conversations.</p><p>You know, one person said to me you know, cracking down on fake news is  important but it can also lead to censorship of independent news, we have  to have these ethical conversations; these are conversations that should be  a public discussion and I think we as the public because our data is out  there we are hearing more about it, we want to know and be a part of these  discussions as well.</p><p>ASHER:  It does feel like a watershed moment for Facebook -</p><p>SEGALL: Yes.</p><p>ASHER:  - where people you know, there's a reckoning really.</p><p>Laurie Segall, live for us, thank you -</p><p>SEGALL:  Thank you.</p><p>ASHER:  - so much, yes.</p><p>OK so meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica has suspended its chief executive  after he was secretly filmed boasting, boasting about using dirty tricks to  help clients.</p><p>The data firm says Alexander Nix's comments with an undercover reporter,  \"Channel 4\" do not reflect the values of the company and promised a full  independent investigation.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh is joining us live now from London with more on this.</p><p>So, Nick when you look at parts of this documentary, aside from talking  about entrapping political opponents with bribery and sex and that sort of  thing, there was one line that really caught my attention by Nix in this  documentary where he talks about, he said, 'it doesn't have to be true, it  just have to be believed.'  It does not have to be true, it just have to be  believed.</p><p>In terms of targeting voters in and around election campaign, where do you  draw the line between persuasion and outright manipulation?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well I should  point out too Cambridge Analytica in that same undercover filming say they  are not in the business of fake news or providing false information but  yes, you know, there's a lot in what they say undercover as well, I should  point out, which they claim is scripted and edited to work in - against  them, a lot there that doesn't necessarily make them the most trustworthy  advocates.</p><p>And certainly, the company's own decision to suspend their CEO Alexander  Nix certainly speaks you might say volumes to quite how they feel about the  allegations being perceived and certainly they have a big struggle with  their message as a messaging company over the past couple of days.</p><p>The decision to suspend Mr. Nix actually emerged minutes before \"Channel 4  News\" broadcast the third of their reports about the company's use of data  and political moves there.</p><p>But your point earlier about whether the truth matters still or not is a  key sensitivity here as well because they talk about yes, well you can't  fight elections on facts, well you shouldn't fight elections on facts, you  should fight them on emotions and I think that plays certainly to wire  their story may be chimes with so many people at this stage.</p><p>After here in the United Kingdom seeing the Brexit vote go through in the  favor towards leaving the European Union, some say based on many spurious  promises by lead (ph) campaigners; by Donald Trump's much I think it's fair  to say heralded use of falsity at times and his election as well, it may  well be that social media in the eyes of many now is perhaps being viewed  less as a sort of a tool, as Laurie was saying of bringing the world  together, making us more closer to each other and perhaps way over sort of  amplifying falsity or certain opinions that may not be necessarily given to  you because they are true, may be given to you because actually they sort  of play on various chords and amplifier fears and make you vote in a  certain direction.</p><p>ASHER:  Yes.  If anything, someone argued it is actually made the world a  lot more divisive. Just in terms of Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica, has it been proven  that he did use all the tactics that he talked about in that \"Channel 4\"  documentary or was it a mix of you know, bravado and [0:05:14]  exaggeration?</p><p>PATON WALSH:  I certainly have to say, when I heard him talk about the idea  of using Ukrainian sex workers and undercover filming of an - of opposition  politician accepting a bribe, I thought to myself, well why on earth would  you need to spend millions hiring outside consultants, suggests too of a  more hand-fisted way of compromising a political candidate.</p><p>So, you could perhaps argue that by suggesting those he was to somewhat  degree lazy.</p><p>The other I - things suggested by his colleagues I mean that was clear to  some degree that they were selling their previous products and some of the  undercover filming suggested they'd massively influenced recent elections  in Kenya, obviously we don't know the full extent of that there, we don't  know the full extent really there.</p><p>Their influence on the U.S. election campaign, in fact indeed they say,  some of the data harvested was done too late to be any use them at all in  the work that they did in Donald Trump's selection in 2016 but certainly  you're presented with the idea of a man who has a pretty broad moral  contest to some degree in terms of what he's willing to offer although I  should point out he defends himself by saying, in those circumstances he  was in fact going along with a ridiculous suggestion by the undercover  reporter from Sri Lanka or allegedly that \"Channel 4\" put in front of him.</p><p>So, a confused situation in terms of its context but it leaves you  certainly questioning exactly what kind of role consultancies like  Cambridge Analytica genuinely have in the political process and quite  what's that's doing to states of democracy around the world.</p><p>Zain?</p><p>ASHER:  A broad moral contest as you put it.  Interesting way of putting  it, OK.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh live for us there.</p><p>PATON WALSH:  I'm being euphemistic.  All right.</p><p>ASHER:  Thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p>OK so everybody wants a moment with Mnuchin, the U.S. Treasury Secretary  faces his G20 colleagues as many secret explanations and exemption from  President Trump's steel tariffs, up next [0:01:56].</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER:  A very welcome back everybody.</p><p>So, the crisis at Facebook is dragging down social media stocks across the  board.  Facebook and Snap, the maker of Snapchat each fell as you see there  2 1/2 percent on Tuesday and look at that, Twitter, Twitter down more than  10 percent.  By the way going back to Facebook, you know, they were just  down 2 1/2 percent today, so far this week over the past couple of days  they have lost more than $50 billion, $50 billion in market value just this  week alone.</p><p>Twitter as I mentioned down $0.10, that's a one-month low and in to a  correction technically, down more than 10 percent; shares started plunging  when Israel justice minister threatened legal action against the company,  the minister said, \"Twitter does not do enough of a good job in terms of  removing terrorist material.\"</p><p>So much to talk about, Claire Sebastian, joining us now.</p><p>So, here's the thing, it does feel Claire, especially after yesterday, it  does feel that we've reached this watershed moment, right where people are  just having less patience for less tolerance for these tech companies and  the amount of power they wield over data, we haven't really seen investors  take flight in this way before because -</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN MONEY:  Right.</p><p>ASHER:  - when you talk about fifty billion dollars-worth of [0:05:13]  value being shed off Facebook that is no small thing.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Right.  And I think it is interesting you know, we saw the  worst days of Facebook in four years yesterday and I saw might've thought  that people might buy on the dip today and that wasn't to be.</p><p>And I think it's worth in the context of investors taking their emotion out  of this issue to the extent you look at what - when Facebook and Twitter  and Snap report earnings, what people are looking for is user growth and ad  growth and this scandal could affect both of those.</p><p>You have the letter from the FTC today, this could affect the whole way  that Facebook does business.  You've got the issue of user growth and the  Zeitgeist just went on the list but around social media it's - it's  changing, you've got hashtag-delete-Facebook going around on Twitter,  people are starting to talk more about this.</p><p>And I want to bring in Ross Gerber, he's a veteran tech investor and he  says he selling out of Facebook, at least most of his holdings there, take  a listen?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS GERBER, VETERAN TECH INVESTOR &amp; FACEBOOK SHAREHOLDER:  I think - we're  at peak social, this is the abuse of the public's trust that is beyond  belief.</p><p>And when you look at the problems we've had with Brexit in England and in  the United States with the divisiveness and the rise in hate, crimes and  the - just the bad state of the world, we have to hold accountable that  social media is not just about fun anymore, it's completely manipulated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  So, you know, the sentiment around social media, his worry is  that is - it's changing essentially and I think you know, he's not - he  does - they're - not everyone thinks so.</p><p>Well I've spoken to another investor today, he says look, Facebook isn't  just about Facebook, it also has Messenger, it also was Instagram, and it  also has WhatsApp out there, there are other properties there.</p><p>Some people will be looking at the price of that stock today and thinking  oh maybe this is time to come in, they are still strongly, are still making  a lot of money but I think we are in a moment, and I think you should see  that by the second day of fall.</p><p>ASHER:  Let's talk about Twitter, down 10 percent.  This is significant  because in part and obviously social media is suffering right now but this  is in part because Israel is threatening legal action against Twitter  because Twitter isn't doing enough they say to combat you know, sort of  terrorism instigation that happens on social media.</p><p>This is not the first time we've seen social media being used by you know,  lone-wolf attackers for example or persuading people to join different  terrorist groups but it does seem that the Israelis now certainly have a  lot less patience for this?</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely.  And the justice minister in particular has been -  has been particularly focused on this, she takes a Twitter this week and  said you know, look we've - we've dealt with this in the past, with  Facebook in 2016, she met with Facebook exec and they apparently complied  with a lot of her requests to take down content that they felt was inciting  violence.</p><p>She said they've asked Twitter to do the same, Twitter haven't responded  and now she says they're threatened legal action.</p><p>But I think you can't see this separate from the rest of the context that's  going on, this is the broader issue of fear among investors that platforms  like Facebook, like Twitter are not in full control of their data, they  don't seem to have full control over the types of content that is on their  platforms.</p><p>ASHER:  Incredible.  Especially what Ross Gerber said about you know, we're  seeing you know, pushing against not this fun, happy, place anymore you  know, there is serious manipulation going on, that was quite chilling I  find.  OK.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p>Alright so, despite the social media rout, all three major U.S. markets  ended the day in the green, let's take a look here.</p><p>OK so, at the end of the day, up 116 points, that earlier turnaround from  what we saw yesterday, the Dow finished up nearly a half of a percent.  All  eyes now turn to the Fed which is expected to raise interest rates on  Wednesday, they are in a two-day meeting right now, the big question all of  you will have is how frequently will we see interest rate rises this year  although as I mentioned, they are expected to raise rates tomorrow.</p><p>All right, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted today that U.S. trade  policy is not about protectionism but free and fair trade.  Mnuchin spoke  after attending 15 meetings at a summit of G20 Finance ministers in Buenos  Aires.</p><p>The Treasury secretary is under pressure to explain, people want answers,  he has to explain President Trump's new tariffs, a number of countries are  seeking exemptions from Mnuchin are also weighing retaliate or measures at  the same time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY, US:  There's always a risk if we put  tariffs on that other people will reciprocate and there is a risk of a  trade war.  As the president has said, we are not afraid of getting into a  trade war given the size of our market, the size of our economy and the  fact that we have a big trade deficit.</p><p>Having said that, that's not our goal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER:  Earlier Tuesday, China's premier pledged to further open the  country's economy adding he hoped that both the U.S. and China would act  rationally and not be led by emotions into a trade war.</p><p>Challenging moment certainly for the U.S. Treasury secretary.</p><p>Patrick Gillespie joins us live now, so here's the thing, you and I  discussed this earlier, Steve Mnuchin is a free trader, much like Gary Cohn  -</p><p>PATRICK GILLESPIE, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>ASHER:  - how on earth did he go to a meeting with G20 and defend something  [0:05:14] that deep down we all know that he doesn't really believe in?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  Zain, Mnuchin is between a 'rock and a hard place' because he  has to defend the White House trade policy which he has tried to steer away  from the most extreme measures and sweeping tariffs, at the same time he  has to assuage these concerns that the U.S. isn't about to spark a global  trade war.</p><p>But as you mentioned several countries from South Korea to Argentina, to  France, Germany, Italy, they are seeking exemptions at these meetings and  they're not getting them.</p><p>And you know, Mnuchin tries to call the concern there by saying, 'well  exemptions will come relatively quickly,' he told that to \"The New York  Times\" but you're not getting any more -</p><p>ASHER:  But -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - specificity.</p><p>ASHER:  - you have until Friday right, so this is like three days, the  tariffs are supposed to go into effect on Friday (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  The deadline -</p><p>ASHER:  - three days -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - is coming up -</p><p>ASHER:  - So how does he pick - if everybody -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - this is the last opportunity countries have to get a face-to- face with the U.S. administration.</p><p>ASHER:  - but if everybody is begging him, you know, \"Oh, you know, Steve,  can we get an exemption; can our country get an exemption?\"  How does he  choose who is friend and who is foe?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - Well, this is - the kind of opacity of the administration.   They are not showing - they say there isn't a one-size-fits-all you know,  metric or test to make country exempt and so every country is saying,  you've - you've got countries like Argentina, which I would think would not  be a threat to U.S. national security, saying, \"We import less than one  percent of your steel.  You know, we are not a risk of - we're not a  national security risk to you,' and still the U.S. administration is  saying, \"Will think about it.\"</p><p>ASHER:  But here's - years the thing, President Trump has talked about  defending national security and we can't have imports in terms of steel and  aluminum because you know, we've got to defend national security.  However,  Mnuchin sort of change his language a little bit and talked about 'national  interests' as opposed to 'national security,' why do you think he did that?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  Well I think it gets to the core of that he doesn't you know,  he has tried to walk back some of these most extreme trade measures Zain  and so, when he adjusts the language a bit he, you know, he let - it allows  him to say, 'well there is economic interest of play; there's jobs at  play.'  It -</p><p>ASHER:  Could it be that it's quite difficult to push something you don't  believe in yourself?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - OK.</p><p>ASHER:  Maybe I shouldn't say that; I shouldn't say that, sorry, sorry.</p><p>GILLESPIE:  I think it is difficult for him because you know, - before Gary  Cohn left, it was Mnuchin and Gary Cohn who were postponing these specific  tariffs, these were supposed to happen last summer Zain, and Gary Cohn and  Mnuchin said, 'let's push it back for the last minute.'</p><p>Well, we are at that last-minute right now and now Mnuchin is still in the  hot seat and he has to you know, be front-and-center in front of these  countries saying, 'listen we are not going to start a trade war but we're  not going to tell you if we're going to hit you with tariffs.'</p><p>ASHER:  Oh, I do - I do not envy him at all.</p><p>OK, Patrick Gillespie, thank you.</p><p>GILLESPIE:  Sure, we'll see on Friday. </p><p>ASHER:  Thank you.</p><p>All right, coming up British lawmakers call for answers from Facebook,  we'll hear from an MP who wants Marc Zuckerberg himself, he wants Marc  Zuckerberg himself to testify at an inquiry into fake news, that's next  [0:02:59].</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[17:30:00] ZAIN ASHER, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello everyone, I'm  Zain Asher.  Coming up in the next top hour on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the  head of U.K.'s parliament media committee says why it's time for Mark  Zuckerberg to appear before British lawmakers. </p><p>And United Airlines ground its tech cargo business after sending too many  dogs to the wrong destination.  But first though, these are the top  business headlines for you at this hour.</p><p>Regulators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are growing in their  cause for Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg to speak about the data scandal of  the social media giant.  Speaking to me on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Europe's  Justice Commissioner says she believes data protection rules have been  broken.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VERA JOUROVA, COMMISSIONER, JUSTICE, CONSUMERS &amp; GENDER EQUALITY, EUROPEAN  COMMISSION:  According to what we know about it now, the rules have been  breached.  The United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law or  conditions, because of that it might be even fraud found.</p><p>So there will be a procedure launched very soon. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ASHER:  White House Press Secretary dodged a question Tuesday about whether  the Russian election was free and fair.  They came up after President  Donald Trump said he congratulated Russian president Vladimir Putin on his  reelection on Sunday. </p><p>That drew rebuke from Republican Senator John McCain.  Mr. Trump met in the  Oval Office, Tuesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and then  may sat down for working lunch. </p><p>Prince Mohammed's reformist methods and the promise of Saudi investment in  the U.S. have made him slightly quite popular with the Trump  administration. </p><p>All right, so Toyota is pausing its driverless car testing in the wake of  the fatal scandal involving an autonomous Uber car in Arizona.  The car  maker says Uber's incident is certainly unrelated to them, but it could  certainly have an emotional effect on its drivers.</p><p>I want to bring in Samuel Burke who is following the story.  So Samuel, do  we expect other car companies and other tech companies to follow suit? Just  so far, it's just Uber and Toyota.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  It certainly  wouldn't surprise me, Zain, because I think there's an incredible amount of  pressure on the people who are behind the wheel of the self-driving cars.</p><p>It sounds like a contradicting -- contradiction, but almost all of these  vehicles certainly in Arizona have somebody behind the wheel.  And of  course, the first thing that people say when they hear this story is, if  there was a driver behind the wheel during this incident in Tempe, why  weren't they able to stop it?</p><p>So I actually just spoke with somebody who has one of these jobs in  Arizona, and said that they feel the pressure, people don't realize how  difficult it can be to be at the wheel of a car that's driving all the  time.</p><p>It's easy to disengage even though it's your job when you're not actively  doing it and you're passive the whole time.  So they do feel this sense of  pressure, so I wouldn't be surprised if other companies follow the steps  that Toyota had taken.</p><p>But this is just a temporary measure, and let's be honest, this is the  future of driving.  We know that people will get back behind the wheel of  these driverless cars, and I'm sure that Uber's program will continue much  sooner than later.</p><p>ASHER:  But are we going to see lease -- I mean, you mentioned, it's just  temporary, fine.  But are we going to see at least types of regulation in  the mean time while they sort of figure this out.</p><p>Temporary regulation that block these driverless cars from testing in  public streets.</p><p>BURKE:  I actually just spoke to an executive at one of these companies who  said that he doesn't expect that in large part, maybe some small measures  here and there.  Arizona, the state where this is happened, it's actually a  hot bed of self-driving development. </p><p>And the state there, the governor has touted this as a real strong commerce  point for Arizona, so there will likely be a pause, but they expect because  this is benefitting a state like Arizona, even with this terrible strategy  for it to go on.</p><p>But Zain, this is a learning moment, not just for humans, but for the  actual cars.  It's terrible to say this, but this is an important data  point.  You don't want to think of a life as a data point, but that's  exactly what it has to be so that the cars can learn from this incident,  see what they did wrong so that it doesn't happen again.</p><p>Remember the goal of this self-driving technology is to eliminate all of  the human error that causes fatal accidents or non-fatal accidents.  Of  course, this time around, that's much harder to show.</p><p>[17:35:00] But it's a lot like fear of flying, everybody has it, even  though statistically it's very unlikely.  Yes, there's this uncomfortable  sense around this tragedy, but almost all the numbers would show  demonstrably that self-driving is much safer than us humans behind the  wheel. </p><p>ASHER:  Right, but perhaps, there should be some changes to make sure that  it's easy for the drivers behind the driverless cars to actually stop it in  the wake of potential accidents.</p><p>All right, Samuel Burke, live for us there, thank you so much.  OK, guys,  back to our top story tonight.  British lawmakers want Mark Zuckerberg to  testify at a parliamentary inquiry instead of fake news. </p><p>Earlier on, I spoke to the man leading those cause, conservative MP Damian  Collins, and I asked him what he wants to hear from the Facebook CEO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR FOLKESTONE &amp; HYTHE:  The questions  that we asked when we had a policy hearing with Facebook in Washington last  month which was -- we asked them about their relationship with Cambridge  Analytica. </p><p>We asked what they do to keep user data safe, and also what they do to make  sure they can effectively recover data if it ends up in the hands of a  third party and then breach their own rules.</p><p>And it is data breach story we've been looking at.  You know, we see  unsatisfactory answers to all of those questions, and we certainly didn't  get clear answers to those questions when we posed them last month. </p><p>They said then they would give us their written evidence to support that,  they still hasn't come through.  So I think the time has come where someone  at the company like Mark Zuckerberg whose job it is to understand every  detail of what Facebook does. </p><p>He actually now takes the public position and answers questions on this  because our experience of dealing with Facebook in the past as you often  get, you know, very stiff answers, partial answers to questions, people  saying they don't have the information. </p><p>What now is the time for the people who do have the information to speak. </p><p>ASHER:  Yes, we haven't heard from Mark Zuckerberg at all just in terms of  him coming out and speaking to the public as our reporter Lori Siegel was  just mentioning.</p><p>But how do you think, just in terms of the solution going forward, how do  think Facebook should actually be held responsible because this is  obviously beyond just being a massive crisis for the company just in terms  of the data and mishandling.</p><p>I mean, this is huge.  How should they be held responsible in the way that  also sends messages, a strong message to other social media companies that,  you know, data mishandling is quite simply non-negotiable.</p><p>COLLINS:  That's right, it is non-negotiable.  And for Facebook users who  are following this story, their concern will be, well, you know, well,  there might not be surprised, but just how much data Facebook holds on  them.</p><p>But they might be even more concerned about whether Facebook can keep that  data safe.  So we have questions as part of our inquiry, part of our  parliamentary inquiry, we want the company to answer, we want Mark  Zuckerberg to answer.</p><p>But I think there's also a question of what can we do to stiffen the laws  in the U.K., because no matter how big a company is, they have to comply  with the laws of the country where they operate.</p><p>So we have been discussing changing the powers of the U.K. information  commissioner, to give her the power, not to request data as part of  investigations, but to go in and get it, if it's not forthcoming.</p><p>The moment there's a new bill before parliament which would give the  information commissioner the power to have a -- but deliver heavy fines.   But we think they should go beyond that, and they should have the power to  get the data.</p><p>That will be our best way of knowing that the big tech companies are not  just behaving in an ethical way, but they're abiding by the laws in our  country to make sure they're keeping people's data safe.</p><p>ASHER:  A lot of people would find that idea of, you know, the government  in the U.K. being able to get data from Facebook.  A lot of people will  find that overly restrictive.  Is it not somewhat of a concern of yours as  you work to sort of figure out a potential solution to this.</p><p>COLLINS:  Well, we should look at ways in other industries like tele -- you  know, telecoms and in broadcasting.  They have companies and it handles  huge amounts of personal data, there are data protection laws to make sure  that they do that probably. </p><p>But we have a regulator offcom which has oversight of those companies to  make sure they're complying with the law.  So these data protection issues  are one -- are issues that have been resolved in many other industries, but  the tech industry, it doesn't get applied.</p><p>And I think we have to say now that the tech is innovative, but it's also  established.  It's the dominant force in many of the markets where it  operates.  And it needs to be -- we need to have proper oversight of what  they're doing.</p><p>Otherwise, we are in a position where we can pass all the data protection  laws we like, but we're entirely dependent on the tech companies enforcing  them properly and they got no means of checking.  So I think it's a reserve  power, and not exercise by politicians but by an independent government  agency. </p><p>The ability to go in and get important data when it's part of an inquiry.   I think it'll be an important reform.  I think that will be our best way of  ensuring that the companies comply with the law.</p><p>ASHER:  OK, but beyond, you know, a controversial law like that for  example, what will be the best way at this point for Facebook to gain or  regain the trust of your committee? </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, I think they need to explain what -- how they keep using  data safe.  Why they didn't investigate more rigorously the data breach  involving Cambridge Analytica, why they didn't act, you know, quicker to  ensure that, that data have been destroyed.</p><p>And also what can they do to ensure the use of data that is gathered from  Facebook peep through people's interaction with apps and games and surveys  created by other people.</p><p>[17:40:00] What do they do to make sure that data is safe too? Because of  those -- it's not at all clear how about works at the moment.  And we'll be  holding a further hearing of a committee tomorrow afternoon in London where  we will be talking to a former policy officer at Facebook who was  responsible for overseeing in which their data policy works and the way  data privacy rules work. </p><p>To understand more about this, it will be very interesting to hear what  they have to say.  But I think this is an issue of increasing concern for  Facebook users.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ASHER:  MP Damian Green there.  OK, so here's a piece of advice for you  from tech experts, not from myself.  The tech experts are basically saying  that now might be a good time to check what data you are sharing with third  party apps on Facebook. </p><p>To find out, we're going to give instructions here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS,  and to find out, all you have to do is log on to Facebook and select  settings -- recognize that face, that was our friend Stelter. </p><p>Then navigate to the menu bar on the left and then click on apps, you will  see a list of third party apps, list of third party apps that you can get  access some of your data to stop sharing all data with a specific app,  click on the X, this will remove the app completely from your Facebook  account.</p><p>Or click on an app to find out what exactly you are sharing in terms of  data and make adjustments.  Now Facebook is not the only advertising  support network that sells some of your info to third parties.</p><p>Here's just a few: Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, AOL, Amazon, Twitter and Yelp  all do it too.  Brian Stelter, there's so much to discuss.  Saw your lovely  picture by the way on the screen there --</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  I don't know what I'm doing  on Facebook.  You know, I think all the fun from Facebook 10 or 15 years  ago, and now we're finally re-evaluating our own relationship with this  growing social network. </p><p>I haven't done that, that privacy check-up in years.  But what you just  showed makes me really want to log on and see how much I really I am  sharing. </p><p>ASHER:  Yes, because one of the things that I was asking you earlier is  really, why is it that we feel so comfortable trusting these social media  companies, these tech companies with so much personal information.</p><p>STELTER:  Because we do get a lot of benefits out of Facebook and Google  and other sites.  Let's be honest.  You know, I think there's a long  overdue reckoning with some of the down sides to social media, but there  are a lot of upside as well.</p><p>Whether it's baby pictures, reuniting with old friends, keeping in touch  with family, we do benefit from these sites.  But because they are free, it  means that we are the part.</p><p>And I think that's what too many users are belatedly starting to realize.   Now because it's free, advertisers are trying to reach us through this free  site.  We are really the ones being sold to advertisers through our data. </p><p>ASHER:  This Facebook, I guess and Twitter do more to bring us together or  more to tear us apart? </p><p>STELTER:  It certainly feels when you're in the eco -- the eco-chamber of  Facebook and Twitter, we are looking at the toxic comments they pile up on  stories feels like these sites do more to divide us.</p><p>But I try to be an optimist here.  We don't hear every day about the  weddings and marriage proposals, all of the reunions, it happens, thanks to  these social networking sites.  However, there are ways to have all the  good that come from social networks without so much of the toxicity,  without so much of the misuse of data.</p><p>And that's when I'm starting to hear politicians say, you know, you were  just talking to folks in the U.K., the politicians here in the U.S.,  lawmakers in the U.S., both on the Democratic and Republican sites have  been saying we need to figure out a way to preserve the good from Facebook,  without all this one like we're abused by the site.</p><p>ASHER:  I know, but one of the things that the British lawmaker -- I was  just speaking to Damian Green, did touch on earlier with this idea that,  you know, maybe -- Damian Collins, my producer just corrected me, thank you  so much, Tom.</p><p>He was talking about, you know, one of the main possible solutions -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>ASHER:  A possible solution -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>ASHER:  Would be for Facebook or the government rather to have access to  more of Facebook's data.  But the U.K. government has access to more of  Facebook's data.  I particularly find that price scary.</p><p>STELTER:  Yes, maybe the solution not to give away for more aware, yes.   Yes, Zuckerberg, Facebook talked years ago about privacy being dead.  That  on the internet, that's the trade off you make, that these big companies  and maybe big governments are going to have access to more of your personal  information.</p><p>But we are seeing a slow, but steady, resistance to that idea building.   Out of it gets lawmakers, different organizations that are forming to try  and say, hold on a second, we need to talk about the trade-offs we're  making when we log on to these sites.</p><p>And it shouldn't be entirely a one-way thing, we're giving all of our data  away when we log on.</p><p>ASHER:  Is this story over the past few days big enough for ordinary people  to really re-evaluate their relationship with Facebook and their privacy  settings, and how much time they spend on Facebook and what information  they give up. </p><p>STELTER:  I think people are giving it a second look, but we all see people  deleting their Facebook accounts or Instagram for that matter.  You know,  for the top five apps on a lot of people's phones all around the world,  Facebook apps, Messenger and Instagram, not just the main Facebook.</p><p>This company has embedded itself into most internet users daily lives.  And  I don't see that changing.  But if -- </p><p>[17:45:00] ASHER:  But the level of trust -- </p><p>STELTER:  But yes, and if you use Facebook, that's often, if you're not,  sure you trust it.  That does do damage to the company's bottom line.  So  it is in Facebook's best interest to address these problems.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, Brian Stelter, Brian, thank you so much, I appreciate  that.  OK, so it's been described as a state of absolute panic right now in  Texas.  A fifth package have exploded, this time at a FedEx sorting  facility, that story is next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ASHER:  Welcome back everybody.  So FedEx's profit for the third quarter  beat expectations on Wall Street.  The logistics company says it benefitted  from increased volumes at FedEx ground and freight, FedEx net profit got a  billion and a half dollar boost, thanks to the new U.S. corporate tax law.</p><p>Now entirely separate, we have another story entirely separate from the  company's earnings.  A package exploded at a FedEx sorting center near San  Antonio, Texas, on Tuesday morning.  That's after by the way four  explosions, two of them deadly which have rattled the city of Austin,  Texas, over the past three weeks.</p><p>Cnn national correspondent Nick Walsh is in Schertz, Texas, near the FedEx  facility.  So Nick, based on all the explosions, what can authorities at  this point, even though it's early days piece together about the suspect? </p><p>NICK WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is the main  thing that they are trying to figure out.  And frankly, I am not sure that  they know much.  They have appealed to that suspect, they have asked him or  her to contact them because they do not know what the motive is here.</p><p>Now initially, the first attacks, March 2nd, March 12th, they were  targeting two African-American men who were killed and a Latina woman who  was injured.  At that point, the police were saying to us, listen, this may  be a hate crime.</p><p>Sunday night, there was a tripwire that was attached to an explosion device  that injured two young white men in a different part of town.  And now, we  have these two packages apparently sent through FedEx, one that detonated  at this FedEx sorting facility behind me. </p><p>Those appear to be indiscriminate attacks.  So at this point, they are  still trying to figure out what the motive is behind this, and also  obviously, trying to find that bomber through forensics from the materials  that he has left behind and from the sites of those detonations, those  deadly detonations up in Austin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALSH (voice-over):  A little after midnight, another alarming escalation.   A package exploded on the conveyer belt here at this FedEx sorting facility  60 miles southwest of Austin. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One employee that was standing near the explosion later  complained of ringing in the ears.  She was treated and released.</p><p>WALSH:  ATF, FBI and local law enforcement swarm the scene.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, that's what we're working on right now, we're  trying to understand what actually happened, we're trying to surf through  the evidence and let the evidence take us to where we need to go.</p><p>WALSH:  The FBI says law enforcement is now looking at two packages from  Tuesday.  </p><p>[17:50:00] The one that exploded in Schertz and the second suspicious  package found early this morning at another FedEx facility near the Austin  airport.</p><p>Federal Express says the company turned over to law enforcement, extensive  evidence related to these packages and the individual that shipped them,  collected from our advanced technology security systems.</p><p>The FBI now telling Cnn they suspect these devices are linked to their  investigation into the 18-day bombing spree in the Texas capital that has  left two men dead, killed by packages left on their porches, an elderly  woman badly injured by a similar device. </p><p>And two young men injured by device triggered by a tripwire across a  sidewalk in a quiet neighborhood Sunday night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Before we had to look for a package, now you have to  look for everywhere.  I mean, it's harder to seal why your identity of the  package. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you are not expecting a package, if it's something  that doesn't have an official label on it, or really just not -- just the  package itself, if there's anything out of the ordinary, we are asking the  community to please call 911. </p><p>WALSH:  This afternoon, Sarah Sanders tweeting from the White House:  \"there's no apparent nexus to terrorism at this time.\"  And the president  making his first comments on the situation.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is obviously a very  sick individual or maybe individuals.  These are sick people and we will  get to the bottom of it.</p><p>WALSH:  Authorities have appealed to the bomber to contact them, the  individual has not a motive remains unclear.</p><p>(on camera):  And investigators are now appealing to an increasingly  frightened public for help.  The reward for information leading to an  arrest say now stands at $115,000. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ASHER:  Right, Nick Walsh, thank you so much, appreciate that.  Right,  still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, United Airlines pulled the  plugs on its animals -- flying animals in the cargo hold following a series  of incidents in the air.  We'll have details of this coming up after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ASHER:  All right, welcome back everybody.  After a string of mishaps, some  of which actually ended in tragedy, United Airlines is suspending pet  transportation in cargo hold.  There were three incidents in a week  including with this dog -- oh, adorable.</p><p>Which was actually loaded on the wrong flight and the plane was diverted to  the dog's proper destination in Ohio as soon as the mistake was realized.   So joining us live now is Rene Marsh.</p><p>So Rene, I mean, just walk us through this.  I mean, why completely suspend  pet transportation in cargo.  Why not just direct your resources to doing a  better job? </p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION &amp; TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT:   Right, well, I think that they feel like they got things so wrong with  these multiple situations that they need to take a pause and assess the  entire situation to see what is going wrong.  Now we're not talking about  just one incident, we're talking about multiple incidents here.  </p><p>[17:55:00] So as you mentioned, Zain, United Airlines is suspending its  program that allows passengers to transport their pets in the cargo hold.</p><p>The airlines says that they're going to stop accepting new reservations,  but they will honor any reservations that were made up until today.  And so  they -- what they're doing is they're reviewing their policy and how they  handle these animals. </p><p>They said that this review should be done by May 1st, so once it is  completed, then perhaps people will be allowed to carry their pets or  travel with their pets in the cargo hold of the plane.</p><p>But right now, they're doing that top-to-bottom review to make sure that  the animals flying in the belly of the plane are safe.  But in the meantime  though, if you do have a pet and you still want to carry it, it's a small  pet, carry it on board in the cabin of the plane.</p><p>You can do that, it's just right now, their focus is for those animals  traveling in the belly of the plane.</p><p>ASHER:  And in the cargo.  So just explain, why does it feel like United  Airlines is having more of a problem with pet transportation compared to  other airlines.</p><p>MARSH:  It feels that way because they are -- I mean, you know, you had -- </p><p>ASHER:  Go through my head then? </p><p>MARSH:  No, it's not in your head because I mean, you had an incident two  occasions where a pet was placed in the cargo hold and it was being flown  to the wrong destination, if you remember.</p><p>It was one dog that was sent to Japan, it was not supposed to be going to  Japan, and then you had another similar case again.  So clearly, there's a  breakdown in the system there, and the reason why United is taking such as  drastic approach here is because it's been in the headlines and it's not  good, especially not good for PR, back to you.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, Rene Marsh live for us there, thank you so much.

And take a look here, you can actually see that it was not a drop  of red, not a drop of red at all, we were firmly in the green the whole  day, we ended the day up a triple digit -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Certainly, a rebound after yesterday after that Facebook data scandal we  saw yesterday so a rebound, the markets are squarely focused over the next  two days on what happens with the Fed and raising interest rates we'll see  about that tomorrow.</p><p>Oh, and it is Tuesday, March 20th.</p><p>Tonight, lawmakers worldwide demand to grill Marc Zuckerberg; the E.U.

AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), CHAIR, STEERING COMMITTEE:  I think he should  explain to the American people how this happened, how many people were  hurt, and most importantly how they're going to fix it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE  ON INTELLIGENCE:  I think that we ought to have the testimony not only of  the Facebook CEO but I think the CEOs of other major social media platforms  that the Russians exploited during the campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA), MEMBER SENATE COMMITTEES ON APPROPRIATIONS;  BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS; BUDGET; COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY;  SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP:  I'd like Mr. Zuckerberg to come.   Last time he sent his lawyers, I don't know what he pays, them but they did  a damn good job because they didn't say anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER:  Well you can see that, a lot of lawmakers in the United States  really, really want answers from Marc Zuckerberg right now.</p><p>Earlier the European Commissioner for Justice, Vera Jourova told me she  believes that Facebook broke E.U. rules.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSUMERS:  In our  rules already now, we have clearly stipulated that the processing of data  of private date of people can be only done under the condition of the well- informed consent of each individual.</p><p>So, what's happening now or what we know about recent scandal is that  millions of people and their data were processed and harvested without  their content - consent and we are going to launch the investigations in  several member states starting with the United Kingdom to find the facts  and the information about what happened and to what extent our data  protection rules have been breached.</p><p>And according to what we know about it now the rules have been breached,  the United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law conditions because there  might be even fraud found so they - there will be the procedure launched  very soon and it will be coordinated across the whole E.U. because it must  be that there is also for some other member states.</p><p>ASHER:  OK but in terms of figuring out and getting to the bottom of what  happened what questions would you like to see answered specifically by Marc  Zuckerberg?</p><p>JOUROVA:  What are - there are many questions I would like to ask Facebook  how is it possible that they disappointed the trust of the people who gave  them their privacy - private data and who didn't expect that the data will  be [0:05:13] abused in such a way that later they will be manipulated ahead  of the elections.</p><p>I think that these are very threatening facts or developments and we have  very serious concerns that such practices could be detrimental to democracy  and to the fundamental rights of individual people so that's why I have a  lot of questions I want to ask also Facebook and I will very probably write  a letter with several questions for instance why Facebook hasn't - haven't  - didn't react earlier, why there was not early enough notification to the  individual people.</p><p>Many other questions and of course we have the obligation to ask because we  must be much better in protecting the privacy of people.</p><p>ASHER:  Here's the thing, just you know, according to Facebook, this is -  this is basically an honest mistake.  Essentially, they trusted this  academic researcher, Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan and he was the one who  mishandled the data so if this is just an honest mistake, if this is just  an honest mistake, should we be careful about going too far in terms of how  the E.U. punishes Facebook for this?</p><p>JOUROVA:  I would not call it a mistake but for sure it's going too far.  I  am personally very sensitive about manipulation of the - of the people and  just imagine you entrust somebody you give him your data and then you find  out that it has been abused and you were the object of manipulation.</p><p>We in Europe are very sensitive about that, that's why we want to have the  consent of all the individuals when they are providing their data to  understand what is the purpose for which the IT company asks for the data  and what will be happening with the data.</p><p>And from May this year, we will have even stricter rules so which will give  more rights to the individuals. And here I see the deputy in the European Union and the United States  legislation because we are more careful and more sensitive and more strict  on the protection of privacy of people.</p><p>ASHER:  Yes, the European Union - Europeans are certainly more strict but  in terms of - in terms of a solution it's not just about individuals  figuring out privacy settings and that sort of thing it's also about  Facebook creating new policies about how it handles third-party access to  its data, that's really the key here, third-party access?</p><p>JOUROVA:  It has to be the subject of investigation, what happens there.   In my view Facebook should have been much more careful and keep asking  about the purpose may be not believe so easily that there is the research  going on and when they had the first indication that something goes wrong,  they should've asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and not to use  it anymore.</p><p>I think that something has been neglected or was neglected some time ago  and we want to understand better what exactly happened and who should be  blamed for what.</p><p>And European Union is known for imposing quite drastic sanctions in such  cases and we will not hesitate to use this follow-up because this case  might be also used as a deterrent case for the future possible cases.</p><p>(END AUDIOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER:  All right no sign of this man, you see on your screen, Facebook see  of course, Marc Zuckerberg one of the most recognizable CEOs in the world.</p><p>However, Facebook tells us that it will brief, it will brief multiple  congressional committees.</p><p>Right joining us now is Laurie Segall.</p><p>So, Laurie here's what I don't get, why on earth would it make sense for  Marc Zuckerberg to stay silent at a time like this?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN MONEY SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN TECH,  EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  I mean I think it's a question we are all asking.  We as  the press, we ask that question we want to hear from him, the public wants  to hear from him, and what's really interesting to me is actually Facebook  executives people have told me, high level executive within the company  have said, we want to hear him too (ph).</p><p>ASHER:  They don't get it either.</p><p>SEGALL:  You know, I think this is a very protective story.  There's a lot  of nuance there and Marc Zuckerberg, Cheryl Sandberg these are brand names,  people want to talk to them at this time and there's this feeling from a  couple of folks I spoke to that he gets involved too late, he's not getting  his hands dirty, he's always very involved behind the scenes.</p><p>You know, a lot of folks will say he's a very respected leader, he is in  all these meetings, he is very, very, involved in these important  conversations, we as the public when we look at our data when we look at  what's happened, when we look at all of these challenging questions, the  weaponization (ph) of Facebook over the last year for democracy, what it's  doing to mental health, we [0:05:14] want the leader Facebook to step  forward and I think there's growing pressure mounting not just with us  here, with the public but within the company for him to speak publicly on  this thing.</p><p>ASHER:  And in terms of you know, you talked about Marc Zuckerberg and the  Facebook team just being in crisis meetings all day, just in terms of where  they go from here, their priority is not just you know, meeting with  lawmakers it's also figuring out a way to regain the public trust at a time  that this, how do they do that?</p><p>SEGALL:  I think that it's so important, I think transparency is going to  one of the biggest things you know, Marc might not like to speak what I  want to remind you, this isn't self-serving, I want to remind you that I  spoke to him in June and he actually was talking about his role as a leader  in this moment in time, he said to me at the time, he wants to make the  world a better place, take a listen?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK:  I just feel like we have a responsibility  to do more in the world.</p><p>Right and when you look at the world today, you know, giving people a voice  and helping people connect our good and have made the world better in a lot  of ways but our society still very divided right and that means that people  need to work proactively to help bring people closer together, it's not  just enough to help or simply connect we need to work to bring the world  closer together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL:  And I think you could argue that at this moment Facebook hasn't  brought the world closer together and I think we are actually at this point  (ph) -</p><p>ASHER:  I'm - I'm going to be the opposite (ph) actually.</p><p>SEGALL  - Yes, and I think we all asking these questions and what I think  when you ask the question about what can they do you know, a lot of the  leaders I spoke to behind closed doors say that we are having these  massively important ethical questions about the future that come along with  this you know, with having a platform this size, they say we want to have  these conversations.</p><p>You know, one person said to me you know, cracking down on fake news is  important but it can also lead to censorship of independent news, we have  to have these ethical conversations; these are conversations that should be  a public discussion and I think we as the public because our data is out  there we are hearing more about it, we want to know and be a part of these  discussions as well.</p><p>ASHER:  It does feel like a watershed moment for Facebook -</p><p>SEGALL: Yes.</p><p>ASHER:  - where people you know, there's a reckoning really.</p><p>Laurie Segall, live for us, thank you -</p><p>SEGALL:  Thank you.</p><p>ASHER:  - so much, yes.</p><p>OK so meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica has suspended its chief executive  after he was secretly filmed boasting, boasting about using dirty tricks to  help clients.</p><p>The data firm says Alexander Nix's comments with an undercover reporter,  \"Channel 4\" do not reflect the values of the company and promised a full  independent investigation.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh is joining us live now from London with more on this.</p><p>So, Nick when you look at parts of this documentary, aside from talking  about entrapping political opponents with bribery and sex and that sort of  thing, there was one line that really caught my attention by Nix in this  documentary where he talks about, he said, 'it doesn't have to be true, it  just have to be believed.'  It does not have to be true, it just have to be  believed.</p><p>In terms of targeting voters in and around election campaign, where do you  draw the line between persuasion and outright manipulation?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well I should  point out too Cambridge Analytica in that same undercover filming say they  are not in the business of fake news or providing false information but  yes, you know, there's a lot in what they say undercover as well, I should  point out, which they claim is scripted and edited to work in - against  them, a lot there that doesn't necessarily make them the most trustworthy  advocates.</p><p>And certainly, the company's own decision to suspend their CEO Alexander  Nix certainly speaks you might say volumes to quite how they feel about the  allegations being perceived and certainly they have a big struggle with  their message as a messaging company over the past couple of days.</p><p>The decision to suspend Mr. Nix actually emerged minutes before \"Channel 4  News\" broadcast the third of their reports about the company's use of data  and political moves there.</p><p>But your point earlier about whether the truth matters still or not is a  key sensitivity here as well because they talk about yes, well you can't  fight elections on facts, well you shouldn't fight elections on facts, you  should fight them on emotions and I think that plays certainly to wire  their story may be chimes with so many people at this stage.</p><p>After here in the United Kingdom seeing the Brexit vote go through in the  favor towards leaving the European Union, some say based on many spurious  promises by lead (ph) campaigners; by Donald Trump's much I think it's fair  to say heralded use of falsity at times and his election as well, it may  well be that social media in the eyes of many now is perhaps being viewed  less as a sort of a tool, as Laurie was saying of bringing the world  together, making us more closer to each other and perhaps way over sort of  amplifying falsity or certain opinions that may not be necessarily given to  you because they are true, may be given to you because actually they sort  of play on various chords and amplifier fears and make you vote in a  certain direction.</p><p>ASHER:  Yes.  If anything, someone argued it is actually made the world a  lot more divisive. Just in terms of Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica, has it been proven  that he did use all the tactics that he talked about in that \"Channel 4\"  documentary or was it a mix of you know, bravado and [0:05:14]  exaggeration?</p><p>PATON WALSH:  I certainly have to say, when I heard him talk about the idea  of using Ukrainian sex workers and undercover filming of an - of opposition  politician accepting a bribe, I thought to myself, well why on earth would  you need to spend millions hiring outside consultants, suggests too of a  more hand-fisted way of compromising a political candidate.</p><p>So, you could perhaps argue that by suggesting those he was to somewhat  degree lazy.</p><p>The other I - things suggested by his colleagues I mean that was clear to  some degree that they were selling their previous products and some of the  undercover filming suggested they'd massively influenced recent elections  in Kenya, obviously we don't know the full extent of that there, we don't  know the full extent really there.</p><p>Their influence on the U.S. election campaign, in fact indeed they say,  some of the data harvested was done too late to be any use them at all in  the work that they did in Donald Trump's selection in 2016 but certainly  you're presented with the idea of a man who has a pretty broad moral  contest to some degree in terms of what he's willing to offer although I  should point out he defends himself by saying, in those circumstances he  was in fact going along with a ridiculous suggestion by the undercover  reporter from Sri Lanka or allegedly that \"Channel 4\" put in front of him.</p><p>So, a confused situation in terms of its context but it leaves you  certainly questioning exactly what kind of role consultancies like  Cambridge Analytica genuinely have in the political process and quite  what's that's doing to states of democracy around the world.</p><p>Zain?</p><p>ASHER:  A broad moral contest as you put it.  Interesting way of putting  it, OK.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh live for us there.</p><p>PATON WALSH:  I'm being euphemistic.  All right.</p><p>ASHER:  Thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p>OK so everybody wants a moment with Mnuchin, the U.S. Treasury Secretary  faces his G20 colleagues as many secret explanations and exemption from  President Trump's steel tariffs, up next [0:01:56].</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER:  A very welcome back everybody.</p><p>So, the crisis at Facebook is dragging down social media stocks across the  board.  Facebook and Snap, the maker of Snapchat each fell as you see there  2 1/2 percent on Tuesday and look at that, Twitter, Twitter down more than  10 percent.  By the way going back to Facebook, you know, they were just  down 2 1/2 percent today, so far this week over the past couple of days  they have lost more than $50 billion, $50 billion in market value just this  week alone.</p><p>Twitter as I mentioned down $0.10, that's a one-month low and in to a  correction technically, down more than 10 percent; shares started plunging  when Israel justice minister threatened legal action against the company,  the minister said, \"Twitter does not do enough of a good job in terms of  removing terrorist material.\"</p><p>So much to talk about, Claire Sebastian, joining us now.</p><p>So, here's the thing, it does feel Claire, especially after yesterday, it  does feel that we've reached this watershed moment, right where people are  just having less patience for less tolerance for these tech companies and  the amount of power they wield over data, we haven't really seen investors  take flight in this way before because -</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT &amp; CNN MONEY:  Right.</p><p>ASHER:  - when you talk about fifty billion dollars-worth of [0:05:13]  value being shed off Facebook that is no small thing.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Right.  And I think it is interesting you know, we saw the  worst days of Facebook in four years yesterday and I saw might've thought  that people might buy on the dip today and that wasn't to be.</p><p>And I think it's worth in the context of investors taking their emotion out  of this issue to the extent you look at what - when Facebook and Twitter  and Snap report earnings, what people are looking for is user growth and ad  growth and this scandal could affect both of those.</p><p>You have the letter from the FTC today, this could affect the whole way  that Facebook does business.  You've got the issue of user growth and the  Zeitgeist just went on the list but around social media it's - it's  changing, you've got hashtag-delete-Facebook going around on Twitter,  people are starting to talk more about this.</p><p>And I want to bring in Ross Gerber, he's a veteran tech investor and he  says he selling out of Facebook, at least most of his holdings there, take  a listen?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSS GERBER, VETERAN TECH INVESTOR &amp; FACEBOOK SHAREHOLDER:  I think - we're  at peak social, this is the abuse of the public's trust that is beyond  belief.</p><p>And when you look at the problems we've had with Brexit in England and in  the United States with the divisiveness and the rise in hate, crimes and  the - just the bad state of the world, we have to hold accountable that  social media is not just about fun anymore, it's completely manipulated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  So, you know, the sentiment around social media, his worry is  that is - it's changing essentially and I think you know, he's not - he  does - they're - not everyone thinks so.</p><p>Well I've spoken to another investor today, he says look, Facebook isn't  just about Facebook, it also has Messenger, it also was Instagram, and it  also has WhatsApp out there, there are other properties there.</p><p>Some people will be looking at the price of that stock today and thinking  oh maybe this is time to come in, they are still strongly, are still making  a lot of money but I think we are in a moment, and I think you should see  that by the second day of fall.</p><p>ASHER:  Let's talk about Twitter, down 10 percent.  This is significant  because in part and obviously social media is suffering right now but this  is in part because Israel is threatening legal action against Twitter  because Twitter isn't doing enough they say to combat you know, sort of  terrorism instigation that happens on social media.</p><p>This is not the first time we've seen social media being used by you know,  lone-wolf attackers for example or persuading people to join different  terrorist groups but it does seem that the Israelis now certainly have a  lot less patience for this?</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Absolutely.  And the justice minister in particular has been -  has been particularly focused on this, she takes a Twitter this week and  said you know, look we've - we've dealt with this in the past, with  Facebook in 2016, she met with Facebook exec and they apparently complied  with a lot of her requests to take down content that they felt was inciting  violence.</p><p>She said they've asked Twitter to do the same, Twitter haven't responded  and now she says they're threatened legal action.</p><p>But I think you can't see this separate from the rest of the context that's  going on, this is the broader issue of fear among investors that platforms  like Facebook, like Twitter are not in full control of their data, they  don't seem to have full control over the types of content that is on their  platforms.</p><p>ASHER:  Incredible.  Especially what Ross Gerber said about you know, we're  seeing you know, pushing against not this fun, happy, place anymore you  know, there is serious manipulation going on, that was quite chilling I  find.  OK.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, thank you so much, appreciate that.</p><p>Alright so, despite the social media rout, all three major U.S. markets  ended the day in the green, let's take a look here.</p><p>OK so, at the end of the day, up 116 points, that earlier turnaround from  what we saw yesterday, the Dow finished up nearly a half of a percent.  All  eyes now turn to the Fed which is expected to raise interest rates on  Wednesday, they are in a two-day meeting right now, the big question all of  you will have is how frequently will we see interest rate rises this year  although as I mentioned, they are expected to raise rates tomorrow.</p><p>All right, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted today that U.S. trade  policy is not about protectionism but free and fair trade.  Mnuchin spoke  after attending 15 meetings at a summit of G20 Finance ministers in Buenos  Aires.</p><p>The Treasury secretary is under pressure to explain, people want answers,  he has to explain President Trump's new tariffs, a number of countries are  seeking exemptions from Mnuchin are also weighing retaliate or measures at  the same time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY, US:  There's always a risk if we put  tariffs on that other people will reciprocate and there is a risk of a  trade war.  As the president has said, we are not afraid of getting into a  trade war given the size of our market, the size of our economy and the  fact that we have a big trade deficit.</p><p>Having said that, that's not our goal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER:  Earlier Tuesday, China's premier pledged to further open the  country's economy adding he hoped that both the U.S. and China would act  rationally and not be led by emotions into a trade war.</p><p>Challenging moment certainly for the U.S. Treasury secretary.</p><p>Patrick Gillespie joins us live now, so here's the thing, you and I  discussed this earlier, Steve Mnuchin is a free trader, much like Gary Cohn  -</p><p>PATRICK GILLESPIE, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>ASHER:  - how on earth did he go to a meeting with G20 and defend something  [0:05:14] that deep down we all know that he doesn't really believe in?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  Zain, Mnuchin is between a 'rock and a hard place' because he  has to defend the White House trade policy which he has tried to steer away  from the most extreme measures and sweeping tariffs, at the same time he  has to assuage these concerns that the U.S. isn't about to spark a global  trade war.</p><p>But as you mentioned several countries from South Korea to Argentina, to  France, Germany, Italy, they are seeking exemptions at these meetings and  they're not getting them.</p><p>And you know, Mnuchin tries to call the concern there by saying, 'well  exemptions will come relatively quickly,' he told that to \"The New York  Times\" but you're not getting any more -</p><p>ASHER:  But -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - specificity.</p><p>ASHER:  - you have until Friday right, so this is like three days, the  tariffs are supposed to go into effect on Friday (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  The deadline -</p><p>ASHER:  - three days -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - is coming up -</p><p>ASHER:  - So how does he pick - if everybody -</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - this is the last opportunity countries have to get a face-to- face with the U.S. administration.</p><p>ASHER:  - but if everybody is begging him, you know, \"Oh, you know, Steve,  can we get an exemption; can our country get an exemption?\"  How does he  choose who is friend and who is foe?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - Well, this is - the kind of opacity of the administration.   They are not showing - they say there isn't a one-size-fits-all you know,  metric or test to make country exempt and so every country is saying,  you've - you've got countries like Argentina, which I would think would not  be a threat to U.S. national security, saying, \"We import less than one  percent of your steel.  You know, we are not a risk of - we're not a  national security risk to you,' and still the U.S. administration is  saying, \"Will think about it.\"</p><p>ASHER:  But here's - years the thing, President Trump has talked about  defending national security and we can't have imports in terms of steel and  aluminum because you know, we've got to defend national security.  However,  Mnuchin sort of change his language a little bit and talked about 'national  interests' as opposed to 'national security,' why do you think he did that?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  Well I think it gets to the core of that he doesn't you know,  he has tried to walk back some of these most extreme trade measures Zain  and so, when he adjusts the language a bit he, you know, he let - it allows  him to say, 'well there is economic interest of play; there's jobs at  play.'  It -</p><p>ASHER:  Could it be that it's quite difficult to push something you don't  believe in yourself?</p><p>GILLESPIE:  - OK.</p><p>ASHER:  Maybe I shouldn't say that; I shouldn't say that, sorry, sorry.</p><p>GILLESPIE:  I think it is difficult for him because you know, - before Gary  Cohn left, it was Mnuchin and Gary Cohn who were postponing these specific  tariffs, these were supposed to happen last summer Zain, and Gary Cohn and  Mnuchin said, 'let's push it back for the last minute.'</p><p>Well, we are at that last-minute right now and now Mnuchin is still in the  hot seat and he has to you know, be front-and-center in front of these  countries saying, 'listen we are not going to start a trade war but we're  not going to tell you if we're going to hit you with tariffs.'</p><p>ASHER:  Oh, I do - I do not envy him at all.</p><p>OK, Patrick Gillespie, thank you.</p><p>GILLESPIE:  Sure, we'll see on Friday. </p><p>ASHER:  Thank you.</p><p>All right, coming up British lawmakers call for answers from Facebook,  we'll hear from an MP who wants Marc Zuckerberg himself, he wants Marc  Zuckerberg himself to testify at an inquiry into fake news, that's next  [0:02:59].</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[17:30:00] ZAIN ASHER, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Hello everyone, I'm  Zain Asher.  Coming up in the next top hour on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the  head of U.K.'s parliament media committee says why it's time for Mark  Zuckerberg to appear before British lawmakers. </p><p>And United Airlines ground its tech cargo business after sending too many  dogs to the wrong destination.  But first though, these are the top  business headlines for you at this hour.</p><p>Regulators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are growing in their  cause for Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg to speak about the data scandal of  the social media giant.  Speaking to me on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Europe's  Justice Commissioner says she believes data protection rules have been  broken.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VERA JOUROVA, COMMISSIONER, JUSTICE, CONSUMERS &amp; GENDER EQUALITY, EUROPEAN  COMMISSION:  According to what we know about it now, the rules have been  breached.  The United Kingdom is looking also at criminal law or  conditions, because of that it might be even fraud found.</p><p>So there will be a procedure launched very soon. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ASHER:  White House Press Secretary dodged a question Tuesday about whether  the Russian election was free and fair.  They came up after President  Donald Trump said he congratulated Russian president Vladimir Putin on his  reelection on Sunday. </p><p>That drew rebuke from Republican Senator John McCain.  Mr. Trump met in the  Oval Office, Tuesday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and then  may sat down for working lunch. </p><p>Prince Mohammed's reformist methods and the promise of Saudi investment in  the U.S. have made him slightly quite popular with the Trump  administration. </p><p>All right, so Toyota is pausing its driverless car testing in the wake of  the fatal scandal involving an autonomous Uber car in Arizona.  The car  maker says Uber's incident is certainly unrelated to them, but it could  certainly have an emotional effect on its drivers.</p><p>I want to bring in Samuel Burke who is following the story.  So Samuel, do  we expect other car companies and other tech companies to follow suit? Just  so far, it's just Uber and Toyota.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  It certainly  wouldn't surprise me, Zain, because I think there's an incredible amount of  pressure on the people who are behind the wheel of the self-driving cars.</p><p>It sounds like a contradicting -- contradiction, but almost all of these  vehicles certainly in Arizona have somebody behind the wheel.  And of  course, the first thing that people say when they hear this story is, if  there was a driver behind the wheel during this incident in Tempe, why  weren't they able to stop it?</p><p>So I actually just spoke with somebody who has one of these jobs in  Arizona, and said that they feel the pressure, people don't realize how  difficult it can be to be at the wheel of a car that's driving all the  time.</p><p>It's easy to disengage even though it's your job when you're not actively  doing it and you're passive the whole time.  So they do feel this sense of  pressure, so I wouldn't be surprised if other companies follow the steps  that Toyota had taken.</p><p>But this is just a temporary measure, and let's be honest, this is the  future of driving.  We know that people will get back behind the wheel of  these driverless cars, and I'm sure that Uber's program will continue much  sooner than later.</p><p>ASHER:  But are we going to see lease -- I mean, you mentioned, it's just  temporary, fine.  But are we going to see at least types of regulation in  the mean time while they sort of figure this out.</p><p>Temporary regulation that block these driverless cars from testing in  public streets.</p><p>BURKE:  I actually just spoke to an executive at one of these companies who  said that he doesn't expect that in large part, maybe some small measures  here and there.  Arizona, the state where this is happened, it's actually a  hot bed of self-driving development. </p><p>And the state there, the governor has touted this as a real strong commerce  point for Arizona, so there will likely be a pause, but they expect because  this is benefitting a state like Arizona, even with this terrible strategy  for it to go on.</p><p>But Zain, this is a learning moment, not just for humans, but for the  actual cars.  It's terrible to say this, but this is an important data  point.  You don't want to think of a life as a data point, but that's  exactly what it has to be so that the cars can learn from this incident,  see what they did wrong so that it doesn't happen again.</p><p>Remember the goal of this self-driving technology is to eliminate all of  the human error that causes fatal accidents or non-fatal accidents.  Of  course, this time around, that's much harder to show.</p><p>[17:35:00] But it's a lot like fear of flying, everybody has it, even  though statistically it's very unlikely.  Yes, there's this uncomfortable  sense around this tragedy, but almost all the numbers would show  demonstrably that self-driving is much safer than us humans behind the  wheel. </p><p>ASHER:  Right, but perhaps, there should be some changes to make sure that  it's easy for the drivers behind the driverless cars to actually stop it in  the wake of potential accidents.</p><p>All right, Samuel Burke, live for us there, thank you so much.  OK, guys,  back to our top story tonight.  British lawmakers want Mark Zuckerberg to  testify at a parliamentary inquiry instead of fake news. </p><p>Earlier on, I spoke to the man leading those cause, conservative MP Damian  Collins, and I asked him what he wants to hear from the Facebook CEO.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR FOLKESTONE &amp; HYTHE:  The questions  that we asked when we had a policy hearing with Facebook in Washington last  month which was -- we asked them about their relationship with Cambridge  Analytica. </p><p>We asked what they do to keep user data safe, and also what they do to make  sure they can effectively recover data if it ends up in the hands of a  third party and then breach their own rules.</p><p>And it is data breach story we've been looking at.  You know, we see  unsatisfactory answers to all of those questions, and we certainly didn't  get clear answers to those questions when we posed them last month. </p><p>They said then they would give us their written evidence to support that,  they still hasn't come through.  So I think the time has come where someone  at the company like Mark Zuckerberg whose job it is to understand every  detail of what Facebook does. </p><p>He actually now takes the public position and answers questions on this  because our experience of dealing with Facebook in the past as you often  get, you know, very stiff answers, partial answers to questions, people  saying they don't have the information. </p><p>What now is the time for the people who do have the information to speak. </p><p>ASHER:  Yes, we haven't heard from Mark Zuckerberg at all just in terms of  him coming out and speaking to the public as our reporter Lori Siegel was  just mentioning.</p><p>But how do you think, just in terms of the solution going forward, how do  think Facebook should actually be held responsible because this is  obviously beyond just being a massive crisis for the company just in terms  of the data and mishandling.</p><p>I mean, this is huge.  How should they be held responsible in the way that  also sends messages, a strong message to other social media companies that,  you know, data mishandling is quite simply non-negotiable.</p><p>COLLINS:  That's right, it is non-negotiable.  And for Facebook users who  are following this story, their concern will be, well, you know, well,  there might not be surprised, but just how much data Facebook holds on  them.</p><p>But they might be even more concerned about whether Facebook can keep that  data safe.  So we have questions as part of our inquiry, part of our  parliamentary inquiry, we want the company to answer, we want Mark  Zuckerberg to answer.</p><p>But I think there's also a question of what can we do to stiffen the laws  in the U.K., because no matter how big a company is, they have to comply  with the laws of the country where they operate.</p><p>So we have been discussing changing the powers of the U.K. information  commissioner, to give her the power, not to request data as part of  investigations, but to go in and get it, if it's not forthcoming.</p><p>The moment there's a new bill before parliament which would give the  information commissioner the power to have a -- but deliver heavy fines.   But we think they should go beyond that, and they should have the power to  get the data.</p><p>That will be our best way of knowing that the big tech companies are not  just behaving in an ethical way, but they're abiding by the laws in our  country to make sure they're keeping people's data safe.</p><p>ASHER:  A lot of people would find that idea of, you know, the government  in the U.K. being able to get data from Facebook.  A lot of people will  find that overly restrictive.  Is it not somewhat of a concern of yours as  you work to sort of figure out a potential solution to this.</p><p>COLLINS:  Well, we should look at ways in other industries like tele -- you  know, telecoms and in broadcasting.  They have companies and it handles  huge amounts of personal data, there are data protection laws to make sure  that they do that probably. </p><p>But we have a regulator offcom which has oversight of those companies to  make sure they're complying with the law.  So these data protection issues  are one -- are issues that have been resolved in many other industries, but  the tech industry, it doesn't get applied.</p><p>And I think we have to say now that the tech is innovative, but it's also  established.  It's the dominant force in many of the markets where it  operates.  And it needs to be -- we need to have proper oversight of what  they're doing.</p><p>Otherwise, we are in a position where we can pass all the data protection  laws we like, but we're entirely dependent on the tech companies enforcing  them properly and they got no means of checking.  So I think it's a reserve  power, and not exercise by politicians but by an independent government  agency. </p><p>The ability to go in and get important data when it's part of an inquiry.   I think it'll be an important reform.  I think that will be our best way of  ensuring that the companies comply with the law.</p><p>ASHER:  OK, but beyond, you know, a controversial law like that for  example, what will be the best way at this point for Facebook to gain or  regain the trust of your committee? </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, I think they need to explain what -- how they keep using  data safe.  Why they didn't investigate more rigorously the data breach  involving Cambridge Analytica, why they didn't act, you know, quicker to  ensure that, that data have been destroyed.</p><p>And also what can they do to ensure the use of data that is gathered from  Facebook peep through people's interaction with apps and games and surveys  created by other people.</p><p>[17:40:00] What do they do to make sure that data is safe too? Because of  those -- it's not at all clear how about works at the moment.  And we'll be  holding a further hearing of a committee tomorrow afternoon in London where  we will be talking to a former policy officer at Facebook who was  responsible for overseeing in which their data policy works and the way  data privacy rules work. </p><p>To understand more about this, it will be very interesting to hear what  they have to say.  But I think this is an issue of increasing concern for  Facebook users.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ASHER:  MP Damian Green there.  OK, so here's a piece of advice for you  from tech experts, not from myself.  The tech experts are basically saying  that now might be a good time to check what data you are sharing with third  party apps on Facebook. </p><p>To find out, we're going to give instructions here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS,  and to find out, all you have to do is log on to Facebook and select  settings -- recognize that face, that was our friend Stelter. </p><p>Then navigate to the menu bar on the left and then click on apps, you will  see a list of third party apps, list of third party apps that you can get  access some of your data to stop sharing all data with a specific app,  click on the X, this will remove the app completely from your Facebook  account.</p><p>Or click on an app to find out what exactly you are sharing in terms of  data and make adjustments.  Now Facebook is not the only advertising  support network that sells some of your info to third parties.</p><p>Here's just a few: Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, AOL, Amazon, Twitter and Yelp  all do it too.  Brian Stelter, there's so much to discuss.  Saw your lovely  picture by the way on the screen there --</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  I don't know what I'm doing  on Facebook.  You know, I think all the fun from Facebook 10 or 15 years  ago, and now we're finally re-evaluating our own relationship with this  growing social network. </p><p>I haven't done that, that privacy check-up in years.  But what you just  showed makes me really want to log on and see how much I really I am  sharing. </p><p>ASHER:  Yes, because one of the things that I was asking you earlier is  really, why is it that we feel so comfortable trusting these social media  companies, these tech companies with so much personal information.</p><p>STELTER:  Because we do get a lot of benefits out of Facebook and Google  and other sites.  Let's be honest.  You know, I think there's a long  overdue reckoning with some of the down sides to social media, but there  are a lot of upside as well.</p><p>Whether it's baby pictures, reuniting with old friends, keeping in touch  with family, we do benefit from these sites.  But because they are free, it  means that we are the part.</p><p>And I think that's what too many users are belatedly starting to realize.   Now because it's free, advertisers are trying to reach us through this free  site.  We are really the ones being sold to advertisers through our data. </p><p>ASHER:  This Facebook, I guess and Twitter do more to bring us together or  more to tear us apart? </p><p>STELTER:  It certainly feels when you're in the eco -- the eco-chamber of  Facebook and Twitter, we are looking at the toxic comments they pile up on  stories feels like these sites do more to divide us.</p><p>But I try to be an optimist here.  We don't hear every day about the  weddings and marriage proposals, all of the reunions, it happens, thanks to  these social networking sites.  However, there are ways to have all the  good that come from social networks without so much of the toxicity,  without so much of the misuse of data.</p><p>And that's when I'm starting to hear politicians say, you know, you were  just talking to folks in the U.K., the politicians here in the U.S.,  lawmakers in the U.S., both on the Democratic and Republican sites have  been saying we need to figure out a way to preserve the good from Facebook,  without all this one like we're abused by the site.</p><p>ASHER:  I know, but one of the things that the British lawmaker -- I was  just speaking to Damian Green, did touch on earlier with this idea that,  you know, maybe -- Damian Collins, my producer just corrected me, thank you  so much, Tom.</p><p>He was talking about, you know, one of the main possible solutions -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>ASHER:  A possible solution -- </p><p>STELTER:  Yes -- </p><p>ASHER:  Would be for Facebook or the government rather to have access to  more of Facebook's data.  But the U.K. government has access to more of  Facebook's data.  I particularly find that price scary.</p><p>STELTER:  Yes, maybe the solution not to give away for more aware, yes.   Yes, Zuckerberg, Facebook talked years ago about privacy being dead.  That  on the internet, that's the trade off you make, that these big companies  and maybe big governments are going to have access to more of your personal  information.</p><p>But we are seeing a slow, but steady, resistance to that idea building.   Out of it gets lawmakers, different organizations that are forming to try  and say, hold on a second, we need to talk about the trade-offs we're  making when we log on to these sites.</p><p>And it shouldn't be entirely a one-way thing, we're giving all of our data  away when we log on.</p><p>ASHER:  Is this story over the past few days big enough for ordinary people  to really re-evaluate their relationship with Facebook and their privacy  settings, and how much time they spend on Facebook and what information  they give up. </p><p>STELTER:  I think people are giving it a second look, but we all see people  deleting their Facebook accounts or Instagram for that matter.  You know,  for the top five apps on a lot of people's phones all around the world,  Facebook apps, Messenger and Instagram, not just the main Facebook.</p><p>This company has embedded itself into most internet users daily lives.  And  I don't see that changing.  But if -- </p><p>[17:45:00] ASHER:  But the level of trust -- </p><p>STELTER:  But yes, and if you use Facebook, that's often, if you're not,  sure you trust it.  That does do damage to the company's bottom line.  So  it is in Facebook's best interest to address these problems.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, Brian Stelter, Brian, thank you so much, I appreciate  that.  OK, so it's been described as a state of absolute panic right now in  Texas.  A fifth package have exploded, this time at a FedEx sorting  facility, that story is next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ASHER:  Welcome back everybody.  So FedEx's profit for the third quarter  beat expectations on Wall Street.  The logistics company says it benefitted  from increased volumes at FedEx ground and freight, FedEx net profit got a  billion and a half dollar boost, thanks to the new U.S. corporate tax law.</p><p>Now entirely separate, we have another story entirely separate from the  company's earnings.  A package exploded at a FedEx sorting center near San  Antonio, Texas, on Tuesday morning.  That's after by the way four  explosions, two of them deadly which have rattled the city of Austin,  Texas, over the past three weeks.</p><p>Cnn national correspondent Nick Walsh is in Schertz, Texas, near the FedEx  facility.  So Nick, based on all the explosions, what can authorities at  this point, even though it's early days piece together about the suspect? </p><p>NICK WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is the main  thing that they are trying to figure out.  And frankly, I am not sure that  they know much.  They have appealed to that suspect, they have asked him or  her to contact them because they do not know what the motive is here.</p><p>Now initially, the first attacks, March 2nd, March 12th, they were  targeting two African-American men who were killed and a Latina woman who  was injured.  At that point, the police were saying to us, listen, this may  be a hate crime.</p><p>Sunday night, there was a tripwire that was attached to an explosion device  that injured two young white men in a different part of town.  And now, we  have these two packages apparently sent through FedEx, one that detonated  at this FedEx sorting facility behind me. </p><p>Those appear to be indiscriminate attacks.  So at this point, they are  still trying to figure out what the motive is behind this, and also  obviously, trying to find that bomber through forensics from the materials  that he has left behind and from the sites of those detonations, those  deadly detonations up in Austin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALSH (voice-over):  A little after midnight, another alarming escalation.   A package exploded on the conveyer belt here at this FedEx sorting facility  60 miles southwest of Austin. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  One employee that was standing near the explosion later  complained of ringing in the ears.  She was treated and released.</p><p>WALSH:  ATF, FBI and local law enforcement swarm the scene.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, that's what we're working on right now, we're  trying to understand what actually happened, we're trying to surf through  the evidence and let the evidence take us to where we need to go.</p><p>WALSH:  The FBI says law enforcement is now looking at two packages from  Tuesday.  </p><p>[17:50:00] The one that exploded in Schertz and the second suspicious  package found early this morning at another FedEx facility near the Austin  airport.</p><p>Federal Express says the company turned over to law enforcement, extensive  evidence related to these packages and the individual that shipped them,  collected from our advanced technology security systems.</p><p>The FBI now telling Cnn they suspect these devices are linked to their  investigation into the 18-day bombing spree in the Texas capital that has  left two men dead, killed by packages left on their porches, an elderly  woman badly injured by a similar device. </p><p>And two young men injured by device triggered by a tripwire across a  sidewalk in a quiet neighborhood Sunday night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Before we had to look for a package, now you have to  look for everywhere.  I mean, it's harder to seal why your identity of the  package. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you are not expecting a package, if it's something  that doesn't have an official label on it, or really just not -- just the  package itself, if there's anything out of the ordinary, we are asking the  community to please call 911. </p><p>WALSH:  This afternoon, Sarah Sanders tweeting from the White House:  \"there's no apparent nexus to terrorism at this time.\"  And the president  making his first comments on the situation.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This is obviously a very  sick individual or maybe individuals.  These are sick people and we will  get to the bottom of it.</p><p>WALSH:  Authorities have appealed to the bomber to contact them, the  individual has not a motive remains unclear.</p><p>(on camera):  And investigators are now appealing to an increasingly  frightened public for help.  The reward for information leading to an  arrest say now stands at $115,000. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ASHER:  Right, Nick Walsh, thank you so much, appreciate that.  Right,  still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, United Airlines pulled the  plugs on its animals -- flying animals in the cargo hold following a series  of incidents in the air.  We'll have details of this coming up after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ASHER:  All right, welcome back everybody.  After a string of mishaps, some  of which actually ended in tragedy, United Airlines is suspending pet  transportation in cargo hold.  There were three incidents in a week  including with this dog -- oh, adorable.</p><p>Which was actually loaded on the wrong flight and the plane was diverted to  the dog's proper destination in Ohio as soon as the mistake was realized.   So joining us live now is Rene Marsh.</p><p>So Rene, I mean, just walk us through this.  I mean, why completely suspend  pet transportation in cargo.  Why not just direct your resources to doing a  better job? </p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION &amp; TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT:   Right, well, I think that they feel like they got things so wrong with  these multiple situations that they need to take a pause and assess the  entire situation to see what is going wrong.  Now we're not talking about  just one incident, we're talking about multiple incidents here.  </p><p>[17:55:00] So as you mentioned, Zain, United Airlines is suspending its  program that allows passengers to transport their pets in the cargo hold.</p><p>The airlines says that they're going to stop accepting new reservations,  but they will honor any reservations that were made up until today.  And so  they -- what they're doing is they're reviewing their policy and how they  handle these animals. </p><p>They said that this review should be done by May 1st, so once it is  completed, then perhaps people will be allowed to carry their pets or  travel with their pets in the cargo hold of the plane.</p><p>But right now, they're doing that top-to-bottom review to make sure that  the animals flying in the belly of the plane are safe.  But in the meantime  though, if you do have a pet and you still want to carry it, it's a small  pet, carry it on board in the cabin of the plane.</p><p>You can do that, it's just right now, their focus is for those animals  traveling in the belly of the plane.</p><p>ASHER:  And in the cargo.  So just explain, why does it feel like United  Airlines is having more of a problem with pet transportation compared to  other airlines.</p><p>MARSH:  It feels that way because they are -- I mean, you know, you had -- </p><p>ASHER:  Go through my head then? </p><p>MARSH:  No, it's not in your head because I mean, you had an incident two  occasions where a pet was placed in the cargo hold and it was being flown  to the wrong destination, if you remember.</p><p>It was one dog that was sent to Japan, it was not supposed to be going to  Japan, and then you had another similar case again.  So clearly, there's a  breakdown in the system there, and the reason why United is taking such as  drastic approach here is because it's been in the headlines and it's not  good, especially not good for PR, back to you.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, Rene Marsh live for us there, thank you so much.  And my  friend, that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'm Zain Asher, thank you so much for  watching, I'll see you again tomorrow.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, announced Wednesday that Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing by the panel on Oct. 23. The focus will be on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency and its role in housing. The company agreed in a legal settlement in March to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers from both parties and top regulators, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have criticized Facebook's plan for the new currency, expressing concern that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. There also is concern that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency, to be called Libra, could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>\"Mark looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers' questions,\" Facebook said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>In July, Waters and other committee Democrats sent a letter to Facebook requesting a halt on moving forward with the currency and with the digital wallet, called Calibra, which would be used in the new currency system. House Democrats also have threatened legislation that would block big tech companies from getting into banking.</p><p>Waters has called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>Unlike digital currencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook's plan calls for Libra to be backed by real currencies.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, told lawmakers over two days of congressional hearings in July that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>The plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts, and would make it cheaper to send money across borders, Marcus said. He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project, as several lawmakers urged.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, Calif., with nearly 2.5 billion users around the globe, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of data privacy scandals, including lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting investigations of Facebook and the other big tech companies amid accusations of abuse of their market power to crush competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg had three days of private meetings in Washington last month with Trump and several lawmakers who, like the president, are critics of the tech industry. He also met with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to discuss ways to prevent foreign actors from disrupting next year's elections. In a separate session, Zuckerberg told the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee that the company would cooperate with their antitrust investigation.</p><p>Zuckerberg last testified to Congress in the spring, when he was questioned about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  In your Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Are investors freaking out because the government could be digging in and  way beyond Facebook?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New fears right now that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg might not be alone,  that there are other tech companies that are getting caught up in the, hey,  we're from the United States government and we would like to chat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nvidia plunging today after suspending self-driving tests.  That's got  local government interest.  Tesla dropping to its lowest level in almost a  year amid reports that the government is investigating a Tesla vehicle  crash in California and wants to know what exactly happened.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then there's the case of Microsoft, which was supposed to be the next  trillion-dollar company.  Reports now it was among the most poorly  performing Dow stocks, and no one, no one is investigating Microsoft.  </p><p>What is going on here with this widening concern in Washington that, you  know, we'd like to get a handle on this?  The problem with Washington  wanting to get a handle on something is, well, sellers get a handle on  selling and selling and selling.  And by day's end, down about 334.5  points.  </p><p>Now, keep in mind, we gained about 669 points yesterday, but this  whipsawing, this volatility, as our Ashley Webster can tell you from FOX  Business Network, has suddenly come back in vogue.  </p><p>What happened?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  The investors are  twitching out there, no doubt, Neil.  </p><p>If it wasn't for the last hour of trading, we'd be fine.  Right?  Unless  you're betting on these stocks going lower.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  But my, oh, my, you can almost feel it, when this sail -- the  selling of stocks starts to pick up momentum.  </p><p>But you mentioned those big tech companies.  Yes, we know that Facebook has  privacy problems.  We know that Nvidia, the big chip company, says it's  going to stop or at least suspend its self-driving car testing.  </p><p>But then, as you mentioned, Neil, Microsoft suddenly gets hit, is down  more, as I see here, more than 4 percent on the day.  That is what you call  indiscriminate selling.  That is guilty by association.  And it brings down  a whole sector.  </p><p>And, as we know, tech has led the way for these markets for so long.  But,  boy, oh, boy, you start taking -- you start talking about regulation that  could impact business models, that could impact earnings, and all of a  sudden they're running for the exits.  </p><p>But it's not just tech today, Neil.  We also saw the financials getting  hit, as we saw that 10-year yield on the treasury actually breaking below  2.8 percent.  In other words, it was a bond rally, a run to safety.  That  means lower rates and that hurts the banks.  The banks also got hit and  swept up in this big selling rush, if you like.  </p><p>As you can see, the 10-year yield down to 2.79.  It was at 2.9 something  just a week ago.  Down another more than five basis points.  So, in other  words, we're seeing a trend.  Yesterday, we were up 600 points.  Down today  344 points on the Dow.  Is this the new normal?  Analysts say yes.  </p><p>But we do get earnings, first-quarter earnings, next month.  Maybe that  will calm some of the nerves, Neil.  But, my goodness, once we get into  that 2:45, 3:00 hour, it's truly the witching hour every day.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It certainly seems to be.</p><p>Now, I know the biggest concern right now is that it's not just Facebook,  that the government is interested in talking to the folks behind Twitter  and Google and all of this just to get an idea of how they start collecting  information on us.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And the intentions might be fine, but Wall Street generally abhors  government looking into anything, doesn't it?  </p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, it's that Reagan comment, isn't it, I'm from the government  and I'm here to help you.  That's the most terrifying thing you can hear.  </p><p>And once you get regulations, generally, Washington doesn't do regulations,  it's never going to be a positive.  And certainly when it comes to these  big tech companies, Neil, that means reduced margins, not making as much  money, more transparency.  I understand all of that.  </p><p>But from a purely business point of view, that could spell bad news for  these very fast-growing companies.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much, my friend.  A very nice wrap-up of  a crazy day, Ashley Webster.</p><p>Just you hear this term volatility.  And it used to mean just swings of 1  percent or more.  And we saw very, very few of those, certainly last year.   In fact, putting it in perspective here, we have already doubled the number  of 1 percent moves in this early year.  We're not even done with the first  quarter, right?  More than double what we had all of last year, and that's  just a preview, we're told, of coming attractions.  </p><p>To Jonas Max Ferris, John Tamny, Bob Iaccino.</p><p>Bob, end it with you, begin with you.  </p><p>Is it your sense that, besides the drama of the last hour, that the Street  is worrying about a government fix for what happened or what was allowed to  happen at Facebook and that it extends beyond Facebook?  So a lot of your  colleagues, not you, mind you, freak out?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BOB IACCINO, PATH TRADING PARTNERS:  Yes, I think that's definitely what it  is, Neil.  That's what's happening, as you talk about Mark Zuckerberg  potentially testifying.  </p><p>He's awkward on stage at his own pre-prepared speeches.  I think Congress,  quite frankly, with a bank of lawyers, would absolutely shred him and it's  going to look bad.  </p><p>So, I definitely think that's what Wall Street is looking at.  And from the  volatility perspective, we just had an unprecedented run, a decades-low  run, where the average daily range of the equity markets was about 0.8  percent.  And historically that kind of run in low volatility is followed  by a run of high volatility.  </p><p>You might looking at six to nine months of these kinds of moves.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, John Tamny, when look at this, we were heralding a  little more than 24 hours ago, actually, a little more than two hours ago,  this notion that the president will get his way on these tariffs that the  Chinese are blinking on, that they're going to concede something, give  something.  </p><p>Either buy more semiconductor chips or that kind of thing to try to even  the gap between our two countries.  Good luck on pulling that off.  But  that this is bigger than trade.  This has more to do with a sector that has  led this rally that might be kind of coughing, right?  </p><p>JOHN TAMNY, EDITOR, REALCLEARMARKETS:  Well, yes.  </p><p>When you look at like Microsoft and Facebook, you're looking at two of the  five most valuable companies in the world.  And so suddenly we're hearing  about the possibility that regulation from Washington is on the way.  Let's  be clear about what that is.  </p><p>We're talking about people who cannot get jobs at these companies suddenly  having a say in how they're run.  Is it any wonder that investors are  spooked?  Add to the fact that I think the markets are saying the only  closed economy is the world economy.  When you shut off China, you shut off  the rest of the world for the U.S. to export to also.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, we talk about these extreme days, Jonas.</p><p>And I know you and I over the years have seen that, where one day an  industry can be a darling.  Suddenly, the next day, it's a pariah.  Which  is more accurate?  The sell-off that we saw in technology particularly  today or the run-up particularly in that sector yesterday?  </p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think that fear is always  there with technology.  That's a sector that has fallen out of favor in the  past.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Absolutely.  </p><p>FERRIS:  It can just fall 50 percent.  It's probably the single most risky  sector because of innovation that goes on.  Just the stocks get overprices  and then people all of a sudden are not into them.  We saw a lot of hot  money going into these tech funds recently, just like in 1999 and 2000.  </p><p>I think the fear really now here is just that.  It's what kind of Ashley  Webster was saying.  They're fast-growing companies.  Investors are worried  they're formerly fast-growing companies.  A lot of them were making money  essentially spying on people and selling information off.</p><p>At least that's what it's going to look like to the government regulators  when they finally see what is going on in Silicon Valley, an area that has  gotten very little regulation compared to, say, Europe, where they're  always shaking down these companies for something.</p><p>That might be happening or starting to happen here between the car crash,  between Facebook with the election stuff and this.  It's just they're just  going to pounce and they're not going to like what they see, if they even  understand it, and we might get a mishmash of rules that are going to bring  this business model to a grinding halt for the companies that live off of  it.  </p><p>It's not everybody.  It's more Facebook than like Apple, but these  companies, they give you free stuff.  It costs money to host all the  servers where you put up your videos, and they make money by watching you.   It's like having a community center and having microphones everywhere and  recording people and selling that information to the highest bidder.  </p><p>That's what the business model is going to look like to people in Congress  who don't understand it or senators.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  I think you're a little cruel when you say they couldn't get  a job at any of those companies.  I think it's a little mean.  </p><p>But I understand where all of you are coming from.</p><p>But, Bob, I'm looking at this and I'm wondering the pressure that suddenly  is on Mark Zuckerberg right now.  It's not only about trying to hold up his  company and image and reputation.  </p><p>Suddenly now, you have an entire industry that might be hanging on his  every word, because while they'd love to see a competitor under duress,  they're beginning to realize, hey, hey, we're in on this, too.  </p><p>IACCINO:  Well, to your point earlier, Neil, /I love the comments we have  gotten so far out of this panel, because this is not really news that they  have stolen your data.</p><p>I mean, Facebook has been stealing your data, Twitter's been stealing your  data.  Snapchat's doing it now.  I'm not on any of those except Twitter  because of that.  It's not news that they have been making money off of  your data.</p><p>And the average American doesn't seem to care about it.  And when the  government gets involved, I would much rather the government were  regulating the NSA than they would be Facebook because people are  voluntarily giving their data to Facebook in exchange for the platform use.  </p><p>That's something that is in their terms and is pretty widely known.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I will tell you, you touch on something.</p><p>IACCINO:  But you're right.  It's the business model.  It's the business  model, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>John, I'm reminded, I'm reminded -- that's a very good point.  </p><p>I'm reminded of the view that Scott McNealy had, who used to run Sun  Microsystems, that if you want your privacy, get over it in this day and  age.  I'm paraphrasing here, this notion that, with high technology and the  convenience it brings you, whether it's Facebook or some of these other  entities, you will surrender some of that.  </p><p>And there will be incidents that come up now and then that will make you  question, what's that balance?  That is going to be driven into focus right  now.  And imagine, whether they're congressional hearings in the case of  Facebook or FTC investigation looking at its books, that magnifying glass  will be most unwelcome for this industry.  </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>TAMNY:  Well, McNealy got it right.  But I will just add, in the case of  Facebook, you got that for free.  How do you think that Facebook was paying  for itself, other than widely using your data?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, you're absolutely right.  You're absolutely.</p><p>TAMNY:  And actually enhancing what it gives you precisely because it uses  your data.  </p><p>And so I think it's essential that Mark Zuckerberg remind Congress to mind  its own business.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know.  I don't know, because this extends to a Tesla,  right?  </p><p>When the government is looking into a crash that involves a Tesla vehicle a  week or so back in California, on top of what Uber is saying, we're going  to discontinue these driverless tests for a while, I think it's maybe  bigger than any individual company.  I just wonder where that goes.  </p><p>Jonas, what do you think?</p><p>FERRIS:  Neil, the business has evolved slowly, but questionably.  </p><p>It used to be controversial to sell search ads that were based on your  search traffic.  Now that is like the least of their problems with what  they're doing.  </p><p>The problem is, this evolution probably needs to be fixed.  I don't know if  the government is going to be able to do it.  They could hurt the industry.</p><p>CAVUTO:  We will watch very closely.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you.  A last-second notice for all coming on here and  trying to make sense of this crazy world.  Good job, all.</p><p>Again, I think as we were pointing out earlier on here, there was sort of a  safe haven run to bonds, to treasury notes, to something boring, because  boring was cool today.  I love days like this, because suddenly people like  me are cool.  That's what happened today.  Boring was a draw.  People went  to bonds.  </p><p>It was a safe place to park cash, and interest rates came down to 2.79  percent, even as they were selling off, actually because they were selling  off at the corner of Wall and Broad.  </p><p>We will stay on this, look at some of the other repercussions here and what  some folks on Capitol Hill are considering when they get back from their  vacation, because, boy, they are loaded for bear, and I'm not just talking  bear market.  We're on top of that.  </p><p>Also on top of Kim Jong-un.  Where the hell is he?  </p><p>After this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DENZEL WASHINGTON, ACTOR:  This is 1206 heading northbound on the main  line.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS:  Why are you still on the main line?  </p><p>WASHINGTON:  We need to know the location of your yard's crane.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it's not just a runaway train, more like a mystery train.   And everyone wants to know, on this mystery train, is a certain passenger  named Kim Jong-un on it?  </p><p>So we have got a possible secret meeting going on between China and North  Korea.  A lot of people are saying this, oddly enough, might have been  propelled by those threatened tariffs and the likes of sanctions that are  combining to produce an emergency powwow between North Korea and its  biggest benefactor, the Chinese.  </p><p>Former Press Secretary to Vice President Mike Pence Marc Lotter, also  national security analyst Rebecca Grant.</p><p>Did that, particularly on the tariff front, propel this -- this move today?   I mean, Rebecca, looking at what's going on, if Kim Jong-un is indeed in  China, did the tariffs in a weird way force this?  </p><p>REBECCA GRANT, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  They might have.  </p><p>But, you know, I don't really care who was on the train, whether it was Kim  or his sister or Colonel Rhee, their negotiator, or one of the other North  Korean officials.  I'm just glad that someone was there.</p><p>If it's Kim, I think it's high time he got out.  He needed a warm-up round.   But this means to me that China is still very serious, wants to be a part  of this.  And hopefully there was some progress made in figuring out the  big question, which is, what is Kim going to want to agree to real  denuclearization?</p><p>CAVUTO:  It could be added pressure, Marc, on the North Korean leader from,  again, his chief benefactor, the Chinese, to say you got to behave, or, or  these tariffs were just an elaborate subterfuge to get just what we're  watching now.  </p><p>I know that was Steve Bannon's argument when in New York the other day.  </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE:  I think  whether it's the tariffs or whether it's just the ongoing maximum pressure  campaign, it's showing that President Trump's leadership is working.  </p><p>North Korea knows that it needs to make changes.  China has already come to  the table and severely cut back on their exports to North Korea, which is  putting a real crimp in that country's economy.  </p><p>So they needed to do something, and as he prepares to meet with the  president, it's very important that they be on the same page.  And it's  good to see that hopefully that China is going to continue to work with the  U.S. and President Trump in continuing that maximum pressure.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I don't know what's the genesis for what, so I will defer to  both of you.  But I do wonder if part of this is about trying to settle on  a location for the North Korean leader and President Trump to meet.  </p><p>The president can't meet in North Korea.  I doubt even China is a logical  venue.  But what do you think of that, Rebecca?  </p><p>GRANT:  It's possible.  I wouldn't mind seeing a meeting in Beijing.  But  we're waiting to find out.  The border remains a really logical location.  </p><p>Let's not forget Kim does have an airplane.  It's an old Aleutian airliner  that he purchased from the Soviet Union back in the day, so he can go where  he needs to go.  But I think the real issue here, it was probably a fairly  tense meeting.  </p><p>China's been very unhappy with North Korea.  Kim has created no end of  trouble for them.  So I think there were probably some stern words  exchanged, whoever was in that meeting.  And China will have reminded North  Korea what they said last August, and that is, if you start trouble, you  are on your own.  </p><p>That was one of the key breakthroughs that led over time to this place  where we're now about to have an important summit and we have a chance to  pull this back from the brink.  I'm glad to see China doing this.  They are  communist countries.  They like to keep it quiet.  But I see this meeting,  whoever was in it, as definitely a positive step forward.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now I'm going to be sound like I'm reading a Bob Ludlum novel,  Marc, but is this an effort on the Chinese part to say, we are so over you,  Kim Jong-un?  You have been such an embarrassment.  You're going away.   You're taking a little trip.  </p><p>LOTTER:  I don't know if it's going to go that far, but it is good to see  that they're continuing to work with the maximum pressure campaign.  </p><p>And I do think, to Rebecca's point, when they said that, if you make  trouble, you're on your own, that's a significant step.  Also, let's not  underscore at the same time that the U.S. today, yesterday announced that  we have got a framework in place for the new economic agreement with South  Korea.  </p><p>So, again, North Korea feels the noose tightening around it, whether it's  from China, whether they have got new economic cooperation with the United  States to the south.  These are all things that are coming together to make  sure that we deal with the North Korean threat, and deal with it quickly.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Guys, thank you both very, very much.  </p><p>Again, we have no real details yet on what's going on in Beijing, who's  there, what's being discussed, who is strong-arming who, if any of that is  going on.</p><p>What we do know is the odd confluence of events where you have sanctions  that have pressured the North Koreans and now tariffs that have pressured  the Chinese that might, might, might be producing results.  We will simply  have to see.  </p><p>All right, if you ever see these census surveys, they ask you a lot of  general questions, like how many rooms in your house, how many cars you  have.  But are you an American citizen?  We used to ask that all the time.   Suddenly, it's become sacrilege.  And suddenly, because we are, California  is suing -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, you think about it, the whole census is about counting  every now and then how many Americans live in this country.  But,  apparently, it's grown to a great offense if you're ever that general or  vague.  </p><p>For example, the Trump administration adding the line about your  citizenship.  Are you a U.S. citizen?  Well, that was enough to get  California to sue, saying it's a big leap, even though it used to be a  common and pretty frequently asked question.  </p><p>Kevin Corke at the White House on how they're responding to this -- Kevin.  </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Neil.  </p><p>You're right about that.  Listen, this is the 2020 census we're talking  about.  And as you mentioned, this is fairly common stuff, with the  exception of the 2010 census asking about your citizenship status.  </p><p>Well, I should point out as well, California's A.G. is opposed asking that  question.  Xavier Becerra is calling it a deliberate effort to scare  Californians.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Given the way that this  administration has attacked immigrants, you can understand why immigrant  families would be afraid to fill out the census questionnaire.  </p><p>The Trump administration has yet again failed to learn from history.  They  fail to consider the consequences of scaring people into not filling out  the census forms.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE:  But, as you can well imagine, White House officials say, listen,  this is the Commerce Department's call, after all.  They may have consulted  with them, but they do have the final call.  They also add fairly quickly  that this is not unprecedented in any way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, this is a  question that's been included in every census since 1965, with the  exception of 2010, when it was removed.  We have contained this question  that's provided data that's necessary for the Department of Justice to  protect voters and specifically to help us better comply.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE:  Well, I just want to remind you this is not the first time, Neil,  we have actually seen the A.G. and the state of California sue the Trump  administration.  </p><p>Mr. Becerra also suing over the proposed border wall enhancement down in  San Diego and along the U.S.-Mexico border.  By the way, for the folks that  don't understand the real importance here, it's not just about counting  people.  We're talking about political representation and federal funding.  </p><p>So you can well imagine, Neil, why the state of California wants to make  sure that they're getting everyone counted, even if some of them may not be  here legally -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, all right, thank you very, very much, Kevin Corke.</p><p>Bottom line here, this always morphs into a discussion -- I'm a stickler  for using the right words for things when I can and when they apply -- but  to say that this morphed into being scaring immigrants, well, if it would  scare anyone, I guess it would be illegal immigrants.  </p><p>There is a big difference.  We're a nation of immigrants, so are we scaring  everybody, everyone who answers this survey?</p><p>It's a question my next guest is asking as well, FOX News contributor Kevin  Jackson.  </p><p>Kevin, I mean, the idea that if you're here illegally that this somehow is  targeting you, when in fact this all started with counting the number of  legal Americans here, and then criticizing and suing over the fear that  this will affect all immigrants, that's -- that's a stretch.  But your  thoughts.  </p><p>KEVIN JACKSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, of course it is.  </p><p>You know, Californians are living on another planet.  Look, this is a very  simple thing, Neil.  And everybody watching your program, the millions  watching FOX News know this.  This is California's attempt to minimize the  vote of legal citizens.  </p><p>And it has nothing to do with immigrants.  And in fact I love that the  Trump administration invoked the 1965 Civil -- or Voting Rights Act,  rather, in bringing this back, because, effectively, Barack Obama ignored  that and violated that Civil Rights Act.  </p><p>This is something that is supposed to protect citizens in keeping the vote  from being watered down.  The other thing is California's been losing  citizens quite readily because of the craziness of Jerry Brown and the  tactics of these legislators out there who are doing things like allowing  people with AIDS to infect people.  </p><p>They're passing laws and legislation that do not protect their citizens.   So this is -- but Sarah -- stretching something, trying to make it racist,  when in fact when they undid it in 2010, that really should have been  considered racist, and certainly not protecting U.S. citizens.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But, you know, I do notice a greater concern with not offending  those who are here illegally.  Fine.  If that's your wont, fine.</p><p>I know it's become a sanctuary state.  I know the mayor of Oakland won't  even allow ICE to come in without giving local residents, those who are  here illegally, a heads-up.  But now to start saying that a census that was  meant to keep count of the number of legal American citizens in any given  community and state to determine and apportion out the number of benefits  they should receive and what they should be getting from the United States  government down the road has become a much greater fixation on those who --  who aren't here legally, who shouldn't be here legally, who they take great  offense to protecting by morphing them into all immigrants.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JACKSON:  Look, Neil, this is one of these topics where I guarantee you  people are watching this program right now saying to themselves, where has  common sense gone in this country, when we know for a fact that the census  is there to do one thing?</p><p>It is to apportion votes, period, to apportion legislators.  What is  California trying to do when they say, we want to count the illegals?  I  don't care about the sanctuary states and all that.  We want to count  illegals as part of our population, and we don't want you to question  whether somebody's here legally or illegally.  </p><p>That's only got one outcome.  And that's because California is losing  companies.  It's losing citizens, people who are tired of being taxed into  oblivion, people who can be put in jail because they use the wrong pronoun  or they don't believe in climate -- global climate farce.  There are people  leaving in drones.  </p><p>And instead of addressing the real issue, they want to cover it up by  saying, let's count everybody that's here.  That's ridiculous.</p><p>And people in America are sick of this.  And, quite frankly, these  counties, Los Alamitos and people like this, that are saying, we're not  going to participant in this nonsense of Jerry Brown, are starting to speak  out.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, it's just getting crazy.  It deemed bigoted or racist if  you're just trying to get to the bottom of something...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  ... or to allow this to morph in, just when we had the illegal  immigrant debate.</p><p>And then they just dropped off illegal, and said, well, anti-immigrant.   And then, once again, in the wording of this lawsuit, that's exactly how it  came across.  But it is a weird world.  </p><p>All right, thank you very, very much, my friend.  </p><p>We have a lot more coming up here.  </p><p>But you know by now that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook fame is ready to  testify before Congress.  Here's the thing about the guy.  He is a genius.   He is a genius.  No one can deny that.  You don't create a multibillion- dollar behemoth if you're an idiot.</p><p>But not great taking questions.  Not great sometimes on camera.  You know,  we can't be gifted teleprompter readers, my friend.  I'm telling you,  though, that could be a big issue for him and for an entire industry.  I'm  telling you.  He's got more pressure on him than me at a fruit stand.  </p><p>I will explain.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Facebook's in a bear market.  It is down north of 20  percent.  What that means for you and for Mark Zuckerberg when he comes to  Congress to testify.  He will be poorer and under pressure.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Smile for the cameras, Mark.  Looks like Zuck won't  duck Congress after all.  Reports the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, will  indeed testify before Congress on this data scandal.  </p><p>There could be others as well.  Seems that everyone wants a piece of him,  talk to him, and get an idea on how it is the privacy of better than 50  million of his users was compromised.  </p><p>Market watcher Burt Flickinger and attorney Emily Compagno on this.</p><p>Burt, you know, if you think about it, the enormous pressure on him now,  not just for his company, but for an industry that very much fears a  federal fix, is that in the offing here, depending on how he does?  </p><p>BURT FLICKINGER, STRATEGIC RESOURCE GROUP:  It is in the offing, Neil.  </p><p>And, as you referenced with the fruit stand, Zuckerberg is under  unprecedented pressure, because the government and the citizens need to  know, after reports of Facebook, Google fixing the news, where there's up  to 23 percent of the news flow before presidential elections, and this most  recent concerning set of circumstances.  </p><p>And in terms of not testifying in before the British Parliament, that's  absolutely outrageous.  Winston Churchill did that in a matter of hours.   And before Congress, Casey Stengel, Mickey Mantle, and Roger Maris -- you  can look it up -- testified in '58, the same way Howard Hughes did in 1974.</p><p>And the whole market could be under pressure with Mark Zuckerberg, because  it's a matter of trust.  And without trust, you don't have consumer  confidence and, ultimately, Facebook doesn't have a product, this great  social media strategist, Mary Jane Mellet of SocialClique, reference. </p><p>And Zuckerberg isn't doing social media at Harvard College, to Elliott  House, and elsewhere.  He's got tremendous accountability and  responsibility.  And as, Ms. Mellet says, he has to change his behavior, or  Facebook will lose its relevance and could crater the markets.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, therein lies -- you know, and I will talk to the attorney  here, Emily Compagno.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, he's, you know, a very, very smart tech guy.  He  built this from nothing.  It started as a dating service.  And it's  obviously something much bigger now.  But, Emily, he is going to be ripped  apart.  And he has got to answer the proverbial question that these things  always come down the, what did you know, when did you know it, how did you  botch it, were you covering it up?</p><p>And they will be relentless, because they will, politicians probably of  both sides, be trying to finger him and saying, this is something we have  got to fix, much like they tried to fix banks, much like they tried big  tobacco.  And they're going to lump him in with that.  So, what does he do?  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  Well, regardless -- look, here's the deal.  </p><p>Whether they want to fix it or not, the important issue here is  transparency.  We all know the FTC is investigating Facebook right now, in  part because of their likely violation of the 2011 settlement where they  agreed to get express consent by every user before sharing their privacy --  sharing their data outside the bounds of their privacy agreement.  </p><p>Now, that is a non-public investigation.  So, what that means is, the  public will have no visibility into that investigation whatsoever.  And he  has been and Facebook has been invited by multiple committees on the  congressional Hill, right?</p><p>So, it's about as well how the government wants to define or how our  government wants to kind of categorize Facebook.  Do we define it as a  media group, as a newspaper?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But tech guys are not savvy at this.  They're brilliant, a lot of  I.Q., not a lot of E.Q.  And that could run against him.  </p><p>I'm not trying to disparage him.  I'm just trying to say, that's the -- you  know, the bane of existence for geniuses, right?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  </p><p>But I think the larger question is that they, they meaning Facebook and  Zuckerberg, was responsible for almost two billion users' private data, of  which 50 million was breached.  And so I think here the larger question is  whether it's in our best interest, our meaning the consumers, to regulate  that environment, or at least to get some answers, to find out what he knew  and when, as you said, and moving forward how that can be better regulated  to protect the consumer.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, it's not whether his E.Q. or I.Q. will kind of damage his  own credibility.  It's whether we will get the answers that the public  deserves.  And Congress right now, depending on how we categorize it, it's  important for us moving forward to know how to operate within that  regulatory framework.</p><p>And that's something that will play out.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, but we're not going to get those answers.  We're not going to  get those answers, Burt.</p><p>He's going to be limited by his own lawyers about what he can say,  especially with an FTC investigation going on concurrently.  </p><p>FLICKINGER:  Emily is completely correct.  And as the great U.S.  spokesperson and comedian Lucille Ball of Jamestown, New York, said,  Zuckerberg's got a lot of 'splaining to do.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FLICKINGER:  And with that, so far, his response -- Howard Hughes had a  tough time socially in testifying, but he helped himself with testifying.  </p><p>So far, Zuckerberg and Facebook have folded faster than this number one  ranked Harvard hockey preseason team that didn't even make the playoffs.  </p><p>They have done a lot of damage.  And they could really damage the Nasdaq  and the market with their obtuseness and being so opaque.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>FLICKINGER:  And as Emily said so well, transparency is key to protect the  consumer, which is critical.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, well put.  </p><p>We will see, because the pressure builds next month, when all this goes  down.  </p><p>All right, guys, thank you, very, very much.  </p><p>Well, for those who thought that the administration would be pussyfooting  around with dealing with the Russians, proof that it is not.  All those  Russian diplomats who were kicked out and, suddenly, suddenly, the  Democratic critics who are so silent.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  What's Russian for, oh, no, you didn't-ski?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know.  </p><p>I do know that Rich Edson is at the State Department, where they're trying  to brace for what the Russia response will be, our kicking out 60 of their  diplomats -- Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon, Neil.  </p><p>And other countries are now joining.  More Russians are heading home, as  NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Australia announced that  they are also joining more than two dozen countries in kicking out more  than 150 Russian diplomats.  </p><p>The Russian government is vowing to retaliate.  The foreign minister,  Sergei Lavrov, says -- quote -- \"Rest assured, we will respond.  The reason  is that no one would like to tolerate such obnoxiousness, and we won't  either.\"  </p><p>He says the United States used colossal pressure and blackmail to push  other countries to join it in kicking out these diplomats.  </p><p>And the State Department says it still has not heard from Russia since it  made the initial announcement.  The expectation here is that the response  of the Russians will mirror what the United States did, which is kick out  60 diplomats, close the consulate in Seattle.  </p><p>This deteriorating relationship between the United States and Russia, that  will fall to the next secretary of state.  That's expected to be the CIA  director, Mike Pompeo, who is actually here right now.  Arrived around 2:00  this afternoon.  Officials say he's meeting with top State Department staff  here.  He's also working on his confirmation hearing, preparing for that.   That is expected next month.  </p><p>And he will be the next secretary of state if the Senate confirms him.   Now, the State Department has been saying throughout the day, as has the  White House, that they're willing to have a better relationship with  Russia.  But the problem is, they need to see change in Russian behavior.   And thus far, they have seen none of that -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you, my friend.  </p><p>In the meantime, all the criticism that a lot of Democrats had particularly  of this president, that he was very soft on Russia, very, very unwilling to  take on Russia, now, of course, has agitated Russia over so many of its  diplomats getting kicked out courtesy one president Donald J. Trump.  </p><p>To retired General Jerry Boykin. </p><p>General, what do you make of this?  </p><p>LT. GEN. JERRY BOYKIN (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Yes.  </p><p>Well, first of all, keep in mind that all countries have people that are  doing human intelligence inside their embassies.  And most of them have  diplomatic cover.  So the fact that we are sending 60 of the Russians home  doesn't mean that the human intelligence collection effort will not  continue here.  </p><p>But I will tell you, this 26, 27 countries, they have come together because  of the leadership of Donald Trump.  And that was one of the objectives, is  to form this coalition to send a very strong message to the Russians.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, the president let his staff, you know, go ahead and do this,  send a signal clear, let it be handled through the State Department, go  through all the protocols that you would expect something like this would  be done.  </p><p>But I haven't heard from those who criticized him, assuming that he owes  Vladimir Putin something or that he wouldn't take on Vladimir Putin.  You  would expect that there would be an acknowledgement here, whether you like  President Trump or not, that on this particular issue at this particular  time he did the right thing.  </p><p>BOYKIN:  Well, you know, it's more of the same.  They're not going to give  him credit for doing anything.  </p><p>I mean, what have they given him credit for?  They have been continually  critical of him, in spite of his successes in his first year-plus.  </p><p>But, look, I think this is a very significant issue here, because think  about this.  You have 26, 27 countries that are all telling Russia, you are  not going to get away with these shenanigans in our countries and we're  going to punish you.  </p><p>And that is an embarrassment for Vladimir Putin personally, but it is also  difficult for them to carry on and continue the way they have been  operating, particularly in these countries.  And I think this coalition  will grow before it's all over with.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  General, while I have got you, I would be curious to get your  thoughts on Kim Jong-un of North Korea apparently in China.  There's  obviously a great deal of pressure there.  The Chinese are feeling the  tariffs squeeze, the North Koreans the sanctions squeeze.  Are the two  related?  </p><p>BOYKIN:  Well, yes, I think they are related, unquestionably.</p><p>The Chinese know that the North Koreans are feeling the squeeze.  They know  that there's internal unrest in North Korea, which could result in all  kinds of bad things happening there.  But I think that the Chinese are very  concerned also that Kim is going into a meeting with Donald Trump, and he  is not prepared for that meeting.  </p><p>And I think they're trying to prevent him from giving away the farm.  Now,  I think that that's that's -- they are wrong in thinking that that might  happen, because I don't think Kim has actually made a decision he's going  to give up his nuclear weapons yet.  </p><p>But China has -- I think has a real concern about where this is all going,  with him meeting with and negotiating with Donald Trump.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think they will keep him there, that he's not going back to  North Korea?  </p><p>BOYKIN:  No, I think he's going back to North Korea.  I don't think that  that's going to happen.  </p><p>But I got to tell you, the best solution to this whole thing, Neil, in my  view, is that the Chinese take him out.  Just wipe this guy out.  I don't  think that's going to happen anytime soon, though.</p><p>But it's a perplexing situation for the Chinese, just like it is for the  Americans and the South Koreans.  But, ultimately, I think Donald Trump is  going to prevail in this, because he's shown such strong leadership against  a guy that has never really had anybody stand up to him like this.  </p><p>And these sanctions are hurting him and hurting the North Korean people.   And that is a -- that is a recipe for disaster, if he doesn't do something  very quickly.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  It is weird stuff.  It might be a one-way train ticket, to  your point.  We shall see.  </p><p>General, thank you so much.  </p><p>BOYKIN:  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we told you about California, essentially a sanctuary  stat when it comes to illegals and all that stuff, suing anyone who dares  threaten the protection for those who aren't necessarily citizens.  </p><p>But not everyone wants to be a sanctuary state.  Some are trying to seek  sanctuary from the sanctuary thing, including one community where a vote is  any minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think California is hurting itself, hurting its reputation  by doing this, the mayor of Oakland, the governor who support these type of  measures?</p><p>MICHELLE STEEL, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR:  Oh, my God, yes.</p><p>Mayor of Oakland tells everybody that this is racist.  That has nothing to  do with it.  We don't want any criminals walking on the street.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, that is simply how the Orange County supervisor,  Michelle Steel, saw it.</p><p>Orange County wants a sanctuary from this sanctuary movement.  She and  other county officials are about to put their revolt to a vote.  </p><p>Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles with the latest on how that's expected to go  -- Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  You know, Neil, this effort in  Orange County began as a symbolic gesture, a way for the county to stand  behind the city of Los Alamitos, which opted out of California's sanctuary  law a couple of weeks ago. </p><p>But breaking right now, Orange County supervisors, who, by the way, are all  Republicans, have just voted to condemn California's sanctuary law.  On top  of that, they want to join the federal lawsuit against California.</p><p>And they're still debating, but it's also possible the county could file  its own lawsuit against the state.  Remember, under sanctuary laws, local  police are not allowed to notify federal immigration agents when they have  illegal immigrants in custody.  In other words, instead of deporting  criminal aliens, they're set free.  </p><p>For example, from January 1 to March 19, Orange County released 172 illegal  immigrant inmates back into the communities.  They'd been arrested for  domestic violence, driving under the influence and criminal threats.  </p><p>Unclear how many have re-offended.  But now Orange County Sheriff Sandra  Hutchens, who was using a who's in jail online database to notify the  public about exactly when inmates, including illegal inmates, are being set  free, so now the information is all out there.  </p><p>And that should allow ICE agents to be in the right place at the right time  to pick these people up, Neil.  But, yes, the vote is in.  Orange County  condemned sanctuary city policies, joining the federal lawsuit.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know what I don't understand, Trace, is -- that's one issue in  Orange County, then, but quite another, let's say you wander into Oakland,  right?  </p><p>GALLAGHER:  Sure.  </p><p>I mean, and Oakland is on the other side of this spectrum, right?  Oakland  Mayor Libby Schaaf has many times said, look, we -- she still stands behind  this.  Even with all the criticism, even with some people in the Democratic  Party criticizing her, she stands behind that decision to notify ICE -- or  notify illegal immigrants that ICE agents were coming down on them -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much, Trace Gallagher in California.  </p><p>GALLAGHER:  Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Orange Undersheriff Don Barnes, by the way, will be my  special guest tomorrow on this show, this push right now that has a state  divided, and the middle of this state now suing, suing the federal  government, more to the point, the Trump administration and the Commerce  Department, over a simple question that is included in this year's census:   Are you a legal citizen of this country?</p><p>More after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Everything goes back to Facebook.  The stock that is now in bear  market territory, having fallen 21 percent from its high, has now buffeted  the entire sector.  </p><p>Today was maybe just a flash, but I'm telling here, the fear seems to be  that the government is sniffing around.  That can't be good.  It won't only  sniff around Facebook.  It wants to talk to a lot of other players here.  </p><p>And that has Wall Street thinking, oh, no.  Been there, done that, don't  want to see it again.</p><p>We will see you tomorrow.</p><p>\"The Five\" is now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, HOST:  In your Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Are investors freaking out because the government could be digging in and  way beyond Facebook?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody.  I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New fears right now that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg might not be alone,  that there are other tech companies that are getting caught up in the, hey,  we're from the United States government and we would like to chat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nvidia plunging today after suspending self-driving tests.  That's got  local government interest.  Tesla dropping to its lowest level in almost a  year amid reports that the government is investigating a Tesla vehicle  crash in California and wants to know what exactly happened.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then there's the case of Microsoft, which was supposed to be the next  trillion-dollar company.  Reports now it was among the most poorly  performing Dow stocks, and no one, no one is investigating Microsoft.  </p><p>What is going on here with this widening concern in Washington that, you  know, we'd like to get a handle on this?  The problem with Washington  wanting to get a handle on something is, well, sellers get a handle on  selling and selling and selling.  And by day's end, down about 334.5  points.  </p><p>Now, keep in mind, we gained about 669 points yesterday, but this  whipsawing, this volatility, as our Ashley Webster can tell you from FOX  Business Network, has suddenly come back in vogue.  </p><p>What happened?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  The investors are  twitching out there, no doubt, Neil.  </p><p>If it wasn't for the last hour of trading, we'd be fine.  Right?  Unless  you're betting on these stocks going lower.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  But my, oh, my, you can almost feel it, when this sail -- the  selling of stocks starts to pick up momentum.  </p><p>But you mentioned those big tech companies.  Yes, we know that Facebook has  privacy problems.  We know that Nvidia, the big chip company, says it's  going to stop or at least suspend its self-driving car testing.  </p><p>But then, as you mentioned, Neil, Microsoft suddenly gets hit, is down  more, as I see here, more than 4 percent on the day.  That is what you call  indiscriminate selling.  That is guilty by association.  And it brings down  a whole sector.  </p><p>And, as we know, tech has led the way for these markets for so long.  But,  boy, oh, boy, you start taking -- you start talking about regulation that  could impact business models, that could impact earnings, and all of a  sudden they're running for the exits.  </p><p>But it's not just tech today, Neil.  We also saw the financials getting  hit, as we saw that 10-year yield on the treasury actually breaking below  2.8 percent.  In other words, it was a bond rally, a run to safety.  That  means lower rates and that hurts the banks.  The banks also got hit and  swept up in this big selling rush, if you like.  </p><p>As you can see, the 10-year yield down to 2.79.  It was at 2.9 something  just a week ago.  Down another more than five basis points.  So, in other  words, we're seeing a trend.  Yesterday, we were up 600 points.  Down today  344 points on the Dow.  Is this the new normal?  Analysts say yes.  </p><p>But we do get earnings, first-quarter earnings, next month.  Maybe that  will calm some of the nerves, Neil.  But, my goodness, once we get into  that 2:45, 3:00 hour, it's truly the witching hour every day.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  It certainly seems to be.</p><p>Now, I know the biggest concern right now is that it's not just Facebook,  that the government is interested in talking to the folks behind Twitter  and Google and all of this just to get an idea of how they start collecting  information on us.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And the intentions might be fine, but Wall Street generally abhors  government looking into anything, doesn't it?  </p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, it's that Reagan comment, isn't it, I'm from the government  and I'm here to help you.  That's the most terrifying thing you can hear.  </p><p>And once you get regulations, generally, Washington doesn't do regulations,  it's never going to be a positive.  And certainly when it comes to these  big tech companies, Neil, that means reduced margins, not making as much  money, more transparency.  I understand all of that.  </p><p>But from a purely business point of view, that could spell bad news for  these very fast-growing companies.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much, my friend.  A very nice wrap-up of  a crazy day, Ashley Webster.</p><p>Just you hear this term volatility.  And it used to mean just swings of 1  percent or more.  And we saw very, very few of those, certainly last year.   In fact, putting it in perspective here, we have already doubled the number  of 1 percent moves in this early year.  We're not even done with the first  quarter, right?  More than double what we had all of last year, and that's  just a preview, we're told, of coming attractions.  </p><p>To Jonas Max Ferris, John Tamny, Bob Iaccino.</p><p>Bob, end it with you, begin with you.  </p><p>Is it your sense that, besides the drama of the last hour, that the Street  is worrying about a government fix for what happened or what was allowed to  happen at Facebook and that it extends beyond Facebook?  So a lot of your  colleagues, not you, mind you, freak out?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BOB IACCINO, PATH TRADING PARTNERS:  Yes, I think that's definitely what it  is, Neil.  That's what's happening, as you talk about Mark Zuckerberg  potentially testifying.  </p><p>He's awkward on stage at his own pre-prepared speeches.  I think Congress,  quite frankly, with a bank of lawyers, would absolutely shred him and it's  going to look bad.  </p><p>So, I definitely think that's what Wall Street is looking at.  And from the  volatility perspective, we just had an unprecedented run, a decades-low  run, where the average daily range of the equity markets was about 0.8  percent.  And historically that kind of run in low volatility is followed  by a run of high volatility.  </p><p>You might looking at six to nine months of these kinds of moves.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, John Tamny, when look at this, we were heralding a  little more than 24 hours ago, actually, a little more than two hours ago,  this notion that the president will get his way on these tariffs that the  Chinese are blinking on, that they're going to concede something, give  something.  </p><p>Either buy more semiconductor chips or that kind of thing to try to even  the gap between our two countries.  Good luck on pulling that off.  But  that this is bigger than trade.  This has more to do with a sector that has  led this rally that might be kind of coughing, right?  </p><p>JOHN TAMNY, EDITOR, REALCLEARMARKETS:  Well, yes.  </p><p>When you look at like Microsoft and Facebook, you're looking at two of the  five most valuable companies in the world.  And so suddenly we're hearing  about the possibility that regulation from Washington is on the way.  Let's  be clear about what that is.  </p><p>We're talking about people who cannot get jobs at these companies suddenly  having a say in how they're run.  Is it any wonder that investors are  spooked?  Add to the fact that I think the markets are saying the only  closed economy is the world economy.  When you shut off China, you shut off  the rest of the world for the U.S. to export to also.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, we talk about these extreme days, Jonas.</p><p>And I know you and I over the years have seen that, where one day an  industry can be a darling.  Suddenly, the next day, it's a pariah.  Which  is more accurate?  The sell-off that we saw in technology particularly  today or the run-up particularly in that sector yesterday?  </p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think that fear is always  there with technology.  That's a sector that has fallen out of favor in the  past.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Absolutely.  </p><p>FERRIS:  It can just fall 50 percent.  It's probably the single most risky  sector because of innovation that goes on.  Just the stocks get overprices  and then people all of a sudden are not into them.  We saw a lot of hot  money going into these tech funds recently, just like in 1999 and 2000.  </p><p>I think the fear really now here is just that.  It's what kind of Ashley  Webster was saying.  They're fast-growing companies.  Investors are worried  they're formerly fast-growing companies.  A lot of them were making money  essentially spying on people and selling information off.</p><p>At least that's what it's going to look like to the government regulators  when they finally see what is going on in Silicon Valley, an area that has  gotten very little regulation compared to, say, Europe, where they're  always shaking down these companies for something.</p><p>That might be happening or starting to happen here between the car crash,  between Facebook with the election stuff and this.  It's just they're just  going to pounce and they're not going to like what they see, if they even  understand it, and we might get a mishmash of rules that are going to bring  this business model to a grinding halt for the companies that live off of  it.  </p><p>It's not everybody.  It's more Facebook than like Apple, but these  companies, they give you free stuff.  It costs money to host all the  servers where you put up your videos, and they make money by watching you.   It's like having a community center and having microphones everywhere and  recording people and selling that information to the highest bidder.  </p><p>That's what the business model is going to look like to people in Congress  who don't understand it or senators.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  I think you're a little cruel when you say they couldn't get  a job at any of those companies.  I think it's a little mean.  </p><p>But I understand where all of you are coming from.</p><p>But, Bob, I'm looking at this and I'm wondering the pressure that suddenly  is on Mark Zuckerberg right now.  It's not only about trying to hold up his  company and image and reputation.  </p><p>Suddenly now, you have an entire industry that might be hanging on his  every word, because while they'd love to see a competitor under duress,  they're beginning to realize, hey, hey, we're in on this, too.  </p><p>IACCINO:  Well, to your point earlier, Neil, /I love the comments we have  gotten so far out of this panel, because this is not really news that they  have stolen your data.</p><p>I mean, Facebook has been stealing your data, Twitter's been stealing your  data.  Snapchat's doing it now.  I'm not on any of those except Twitter  because of that.  It's not news that they have been making money off of  your data.</p><p>And the average American doesn't seem to care about it.  And when the  government gets involved, I would much rather the government were  regulating the NSA than they would be Facebook because people are  voluntarily giving their data to Facebook in exchange for the platform use.  </p><p>That's something that is in their terms and is pretty widely known.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But I will tell you, you touch on something.</p><p>IACCINO:  But you're right.  It's the business model.  It's the business  model, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>John, I'm reminded, I'm reminded -- that's a very good point.  </p><p>I'm reminded of the view that Scott McNealy had, who used to run Sun  Microsystems, that if you want your privacy, get over it in this day and  age.  I'm paraphrasing here, this notion that, with high technology and the  convenience it brings you, whether it's Facebook or some of these other  entities, you will surrender some of that.  </p><p>And there will be incidents that come up now and then that will make you  question, what's that balance?  That is going to be driven into focus right  now.  And imagine, whether they're congressional hearings in the case of  Facebook or FTC investigation looking at its books, that magnifying glass  will be most unwelcome for this industry.  </p><p>What do you think?  </p><p>TAMNY:  Well, McNealy got it right.  But I will just add, in the case of  Facebook, you got that for free.  How do you think that Facebook was paying  for itself, other than widely using your data?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, you're absolutely right.  You're absolutely.</p><p>TAMNY:  And actually enhancing what it gives you precisely because it uses  your data.  </p><p>And so I think it's essential that Mark Zuckerberg remind Congress to mind  its own business.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know.  I don't know, because this extends to a Tesla,  right?  </p><p>When the government is looking into a crash that involves a Tesla vehicle a  week or so back in California, on top of what Uber is saying, we're going  to discontinue these driverless tests for a while, I think it's maybe  bigger than any individual company.  I just wonder where that goes.  </p><p>Jonas, what do you think?</p><p>FERRIS:  Neil, the business has evolved slowly, but questionably.  </p><p>It used to be controversial to sell search ads that were based on your  search traffic.  Now that is like the least of their problems with what  they're doing.  </p><p>The problem is, this evolution probably needs to be fixed.  I don't know if  the government is going to be able to do it.  They could hurt the industry.</p><p>CAVUTO:  We will watch very closely.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you.  A last-second notice for all coming on here and  trying to make sense of this crazy world.  Good job, all.</p><p>Again, I think as we were pointing out earlier on here, there was sort of a  safe haven run to bonds, to treasury notes, to something boring, because  boring was cool today.  I love days like this, because suddenly people like  me are cool.  That's what happened today.  Boring was a draw.  People went  to bonds.  </p><p>It was a safe place to park cash, and interest rates came down to 2.79  percent, even as they were selling off, actually because they were selling  off at the corner of Wall and Broad.  </p><p>We will stay on this, look at some of the other repercussions here and what  some folks on Capitol Hill are considering when they get back from their  vacation, because, boy, they are loaded for bear, and I'm not just talking  bear market.  We're on top of that.  </p><p>Also on top of Kim Jong-un.  Where the hell is he?  </p><p>After this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DENZEL WASHINGTON, ACTOR:  This is 1206 heading northbound on the main  line.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS:  Why are you still on the main line?  </p><p>WASHINGTON:  We need to know the location of your yard's crane.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it's not just a runaway train, more like a mystery train.   And everyone wants to know, on this mystery train, is a certain passenger  named Kim Jong-un on it?  </p><p>So we have got a possible secret meeting going on between China and North  Korea.  A lot of people are saying this, oddly enough, might have been  propelled by those threatened tariffs and the likes of sanctions that are  combining to produce an emergency powwow between North Korea and its  biggest benefactor, the Chinese.  </p><p>Former Press Secretary to Vice President Mike Pence Marc Lotter, also  national security analyst Rebecca Grant.</p><p>Did that, particularly on the tariff front, propel this -- this move today?   I mean, Rebecca, looking at what's going on, if Kim Jong-un is indeed in  China, did the tariffs in a weird way force this?  </p><p>REBECCA GRANT, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  They might have.  </p><p>But, you know, I don't really care who was on the train, whether it was Kim  or his sister or Colonel Rhee, their negotiator, or one of the other North  Korean officials.  I'm just glad that someone was there.</p><p>If it's Kim, I think it's high time he got out.  He needed a warm-up round.   But this means to me that China is still very serious, wants to be a part  of this.  And hopefully there was some progress made in figuring out the  big question, which is, what is Kim going to want to agree to real  denuclearization?</p><p>CAVUTO:  It could be added pressure, Marc, on the North Korean leader from,  again, his chief benefactor, the Chinese, to say you got to behave, or, or  these tariffs were just an elaborate subterfuge to get just what we're  watching now.  </p><p>I know that was Steve Bannon's argument when in New York the other day.  </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE:  I think  whether it's the tariffs or whether it's just the ongoing maximum pressure  campaign, it's showing that President Trump's leadership is working.  </p><p>North Korea knows that it needs to make changes.  China has already come to  the table and severely cut back on their exports to North Korea, which is  putting a real crimp in that country's economy.  </p><p>So they needed to do something, and as he prepares to meet with the  president, it's very important that they be on the same page.  And it's  good to see that hopefully that China is going to continue to work with the  U.S. and President Trump in continuing that maximum pressure.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I don't know what's the genesis for what, so I will defer to  both of you.  But I do wonder if part of this is about trying to settle on  a location for the North Korean leader and President Trump to meet.  </p><p>The president can't meet in North Korea.  I doubt even China is a logical  venue.  But what do you think of that, Rebecca?  </p><p>GRANT:  It's possible.  I wouldn't mind seeing a meeting in Beijing.  But  we're waiting to find out.  The border remains a really logical location.  </p><p>Let's not forget Kim does have an airplane.  It's an old Aleutian airliner  that he purchased from the Soviet Union back in the day, so he can go where  he needs to go.  But I think the real issue here, it was probably a fairly  tense meeting.  </p><p>China's been very unhappy with North Korea.  Kim has created no end of  trouble for them.  So I think there were probably some stern words  exchanged, whoever was in that meeting.  And China will have reminded North  Korea what they said last August, and that is, if you start trouble, you  are on your own.  </p><p>That was one of the key breakthroughs that led over time to this place  where we're now about to have an important summit and we have a chance to  pull this back from the brink.  I'm glad to see China doing this.  They are  communist countries.  They like to keep it quiet.  But I see this meeting,  whoever was in it, as definitely a positive step forward.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now I'm going to be sound like I'm reading a Bob Ludlum novel,  Marc, but is this an effort on the Chinese part to say, we are so over you,  Kim Jong-un?  You have been such an embarrassment.  You're going away.   You're taking a little trip.  </p><p>LOTTER:  I don't know if it's going to go that far, but it is good to see  that they're continuing to work with the maximum pressure campaign.  </p><p>And I do think, to Rebecca's point, when they said that, if you make  trouble, you're on your own, that's a significant step.  Also, let's not  underscore at the same time that the U.S. today, yesterday announced that  we have got a framework in place for the new economic agreement with South  Korea.  </p><p>So, again, North Korea feels the noose tightening around it, whether it's  from China, whether they have got new economic cooperation with the United  States to the south.  These are all things that are coming together to make  sure that we deal with the North Korean threat, and deal with it quickly.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Guys, thank you both very, very much.  </p><p>Again, we have no real details yet on what's going on in Beijing, who's  there, what's being discussed, who is strong-arming who, if any of that is  going on.</p><p>What we do know is the odd confluence of events where you have sanctions  that have pressured the North Koreans and now tariffs that have pressured  the Chinese that might, might, might be producing results.  We will simply  have to see.  </p><p>All right, if you ever see these census surveys, they ask you a lot of  general questions, like how many rooms in your house, how many cars you  have.  But are you an American citizen?  We used to ask that all the time.   Suddenly, it's become sacrilege.  And suddenly, because we are, California  is suing -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, you think about it, the whole census is about counting  every now and then how many Americans live in this country.  But,  apparently, it's grown to a great offense if you're ever that general or  vague.  </p><p>For example, the Trump administration adding the line about your  citizenship.  Are you a U.S. citizen?  Well, that was enough to get  California to sue, saying it's a big leap, even though it used to be a  common and pretty frequently asked question.  </p><p>Kevin Corke at the White House on how they're responding to this -- Kevin.  </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey there, Neil.  </p><p>You're right about that.  Listen, this is the 2020 census we're talking  about.  And as you mentioned, this is fairly common stuff, with the  exception of the 2010 census asking about your citizenship status.  </p><p>Well, I should point out as well, California's A.G. is opposed asking that  question.  Xavier Becerra is calling it a deliberate effort to scare  Californians.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Given the way that this  administration has attacked immigrants, you can understand why immigrant  families would be afraid to fill out the census questionnaire.  </p><p>The Trump administration has yet again failed to learn from history.  They  fail to consider the consequences of scaring people into not filling out  the census forms.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE:  But, as you can well imagine, White House officials say, listen,  this is the Commerce Department's call, after all.  They may have consulted  with them, but they do have the final call.  They also add fairly quickly  that this is not unprecedented in any way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, this is a  question that's been included in every census since 1965, with the  exception of 2010, when it was removed.  We have contained this question  that's provided data that's necessary for the Department of Justice to  protect voters and specifically to help us better comply.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE:  Well, I just want to remind you this is not the first time, Neil,  we have actually seen the A.G. and the state of California sue the Trump  administration.  </p><p>Mr. Becerra also suing over the proposed border wall enhancement down in  San Diego and along the U.S.-Mexico border.  By the way, for the folks that  don't understand the real importance here, it's not just about counting  people.  We're talking about political representation and federal funding.  </p><p>So you can well imagine, Neil, why the state of California wants to make  sure that they're getting everyone counted, even if some of them may not be  here legally -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, all right, thank you very, very much, Kevin Corke.</p><p>Bottom line here, this always morphs into a discussion -- I'm a stickler  for using the right words for things when I can and when they apply -- but  to say that this morphed into being scaring immigrants, well, if it would  scare anyone, I guess it would be illegal immigrants.  </p><p>There is a big difference.  We're a nation of immigrants, so are we scaring  everybody, everyone who answers this survey?</p><p>It's a question my next guest is asking as well, FOX News contributor Kevin  Jackson.  </p><p>Kevin, I mean, the idea that if you're here illegally that this somehow is  targeting you, when in fact this all started with counting the number of  legal Americans here, and then criticizing and suing over the fear that  this will affect all immigrants, that's -- that's a stretch.  But your  thoughts.  </p><p>KEVIN JACKSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, of course it is.  </p><p>You know, Californians are living on another planet.  Look, this is a very  simple thing, Neil.  And everybody watching your program, the millions  watching FOX News know this.  This is California's attempt to minimize the  vote of legal citizens.  </p><p>And it has nothing to do with immigrants.  And in fact I love that the  Trump administration invoked the 1965 Civil -- or Voting Rights Act,  rather, in bringing this back, because, effectively, Barack Obama ignored  that and violated that Civil Rights Act.  </p><p>This is something that is supposed to protect citizens in keeping the vote  from being watered down.  The other thing is California's been losing  citizens quite readily because of the craziness of Jerry Brown and the  tactics of these legislators out there who are doing things like allowing  people with AIDS to infect people.  </p><p>They're passing laws and legislation that do not protect their citizens.   So this is -- but Sarah -- stretching something, trying to make it racist,  when in fact when they undid it in 2010, that really should have been  considered racist, and certainly not protecting U.S. citizens.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But, you know, I do notice a greater concern with not offending  those who are here illegally.  Fine.  If that's your wont, fine.</p><p>I know it's become a sanctuary state.  I know the mayor of Oakland won't  even allow ICE to come in without giving local residents, those who are  here illegally, a heads-up.  But now to start saying that a census that was  meant to keep count of the number of legal American citizens in any given  community and state to determine and apportion out the number of benefits  they should receive and what they should be getting from the United States  government down the road has become a much greater fixation on those who --  who aren't here legally, who shouldn't be here legally, who they take great  offense to protecting by morphing them into all immigrants.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JACKSON:  Look, Neil, this is one of these topics where I guarantee you  people are watching this program right now saying to themselves, where has  common sense gone in this country, when we know for a fact that the census  is there to do one thing?</p><p>It is to apportion votes, period, to apportion legislators.  What is  California trying to do when they say, we want to count the illegals?  I  don't care about the sanctuary states and all that.  We want to count  illegals as part of our population, and we don't want you to question  whether somebody's here legally or illegally.  </p><p>That's only got one outcome.  And that's because California is losing  companies.  It's losing citizens, people who are tired of being taxed into  oblivion, people who can be put in jail because they use the wrong pronoun  or they don't believe in climate -- global climate farce.  There are people  leaving in drones.  </p><p>And instead of addressing the real issue, they want to cover it up by  saying, let's count everybody that's here.  That's ridiculous.</p><p>And people in America are sick of this.  And, quite frankly, these  counties, Los Alamitos and people like this, that are saying, we're not  going to participant in this nonsense of Jerry Brown, are starting to speak  out.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, it's just getting crazy.  It deemed bigoted or racist if  you're just trying to get to the bottom of something...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  ... or to allow this to morph in, just when we had the illegal  immigrant debate.</p><p>And then they just dropped off illegal, and said, well, anti-immigrant.   And then, once again, in the wording of this lawsuit, that's exactly how it  came across.  But it is a weird world.  </p><p>All right, thank you very, very much, my friend.  </p><p>We have a lot more coming up here.  </p><p>But you know by now that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook fame is ready to  testify before Congress.  Here's the thing about the guy.  He is a genius.   He is a genius.  No one can deny that.  You don't create a multibillion- dollar behemoth if you're an idiot.</p><p>But not great taking questions.  Not great sometimes on camera.  You know,  we can't be gifted teleprompter readers, my friend.  I'm telling you,  though, that could be a big issue for him and for an entire industry.  I'm  telling you.  He's got more pressure on him than me at a fruit stand.  </p><p>I will explain.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Facebook's in a bear market.  It is down north of 20  percent.  What that means for you and for Mark Zuckerberg when he comes to  Congress to testify.  He will be poorer and under pressure.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Smile for the cameras, Mark.  Looks like Zuck won't  duck Congress after all.  Reports the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, will  indeed testify before Congress on this data scandal.  </p><p>There could be others as well.  Seems that everyone wants a piece of him,  talk to him, and get an idea on how it is the privacy of better than 50  million of his users was compromised.  </p><p>Market watcher Burt Flickinger and attorney Emily Compagno on this.</p><p>Burt, you know, if you think about it, the enormous pressure on him now,  not just for his company, but for an industry that very much fears a  federal fix, is that in the offing here, depending on how he does?  </p><p>BURT FLICKINGER, STRATEGIC RESOURCE GROUP:  It is in the offing, Neil.  </p><p>And, as you referenced with the fruit stand, Zuckerberg is under  unprecedented pressure, because the government and the citizens need to  know, after reports of Facebook, Google fixing the news, where there's up  to 23 percent of the news flow before presidential elections, and this most  recent concerning set of circumstances.  </p><p>And in terms of not testifying in before the British Parliament, that's  absolutely outrageous.  Winston Churchill did that in a matter of hours.   And before Congress, Casey Stengel, Mickey Mantle, and Roger Maris -- you  can look it up -- testified in '58, the same way Howard Hughes did in 1974.</p><p>And the whole market could be under pressure with Mark Zuckerberg, because  it's a matter of trust.  And without trust, you don't have consumer  confidence and, ultimately, Facebook doesn't have a product, this great  social media strategist, Mary Jane Mellet of SocialClique, reference. </p><p>And Zuckerberg isn't doing social media at Harvard College, to Elliott  House, and elsewhere.  He's got tremendous accountability and  responsibility.  And as, Ms. Mellet says, he has to change his behavior, or  Facebook will lose its relevance and could crater the markets.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, therein lies -- you know, and I will talk to the attorney  here, Emily Compagno.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, he's, you know, a very, very smart tech guy.  He  built this from nothing.  It started as a dating service.  And it's  obviously something much bigger now.  But, Emily, he is going to be ripped  apart.  And he has got to answer the proverbial question that these things  always come down the, what did you know, when did you know it, how did you  botch it, were you covering it up?</p><p>And they will be relentless, because they will, politicians probably of  both sides, be trying to finger him and saying, this is something we have  got to fix, much like they tried to fix banks, much like they tried big  tobacco.  And they're going to lump him in with that.  So, what does he do?  </p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  Well, regardless -- look, here's the deal.  </p><p>Whether they want to fix it or not, the important issue here is  transparency.  We all know the FTC is investigating Facebook right now, in  part because of their likely violation of the 2011 settlement where they  agreed to get express consent by every user before sharing their privacy --  sharing their data outside the bounds of their privacy agreement.  </p><p>Now, that is a non-public investigation.  So, what that means is, the  public will have no visibility into that investigation whatsoever.  And he  has been and Facebook has been invited by multiple committees on the  congressional Hill, right?</p><p>So, it's about as well how the government wants to define or how our  government wants to kind of categorize Facebook.  Do we define it as a  media group, as a newspaper?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  But tech guys are not savvy at this.  They're brilliant, a lot of  I.Q., not a lot of E.Q.  And that could run against him.  </p><p>I'm not trying to disparage him.  I'm just trying to say, that's the -- you  know, the bane of existence for geniuses, right?  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.  </p><p>But I think the larger question is that they, they meaning Facebook and  Zuckerberg, was responsible for almost two billion users' private data, of  which 50 million was breached.  And so I think here the larger question is  whether it's in our best interest, our meaning the consumers, to regulate  that environment, or at least to get some answers, to find out what he knew  and when, as you said, and moving forward how that can be better regulated  to protect the consumer.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, it's not whether his E.Q. or I.Q. will kind of damage his  own credibility.  It's whether we will get the answers that the public  deserves.  And Congress right now, depending on how we categorize it, it's  important for us moving forward to know how to operate within that  regulatory framework.</p><p>And that's something that will play out.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, but we're not going to get those answers.  We're not going to  get those answers, Burt.</p><p>He's going to be limited by his own lawyers about what he can say,  especially with an FTC investigation going on concurrently.  </p><p>FLICKINGER:  Emily is completely correct.  And as the great U.S.  spokesperson and comedian Lucille Ball of Jamestown, New York, said,  Zuckerberg's got a lot of 'splaining to do.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FLICKINGER:  And with that, so far, his response -- Howard Hughes had a  tough time socially in testifying, but he helped himself with testifying.  </p><p>So far, Zuckerberg and Facebook have folded faster than this number one  ranked Harvard hockey preseason team that didn't even make the playoffs.  </p><p>They have done a lot of damage.  And they could really damage the Nasdaq  and the market with their obtuseness and being so opaque.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>FLICKINGER:  And as Emily said so well, transparency is key to protect the  consumer, which is critical.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, well put.  </p><p>We will see, because the pressure builds next month, when all this goes  down.  </p><p>All right, guys, thank you, very, very much.  </p><p>Well, for those who thought that the administration would be pussyfooting  around with dealing with the Russians, proof that it is not.  All those  Russian diplomats who were kicked out and, suddenly, suddenly, the  Democratic critics who are so silent.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  What's Russian for, oh, no, you didn't-ski?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know.  </p><p>I do know that Rich Edson is at the State Department, where they're trying  to brace for what the Russia response will be, our kicking out 60 of their  diplomats -- Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good afternoon, Neil.  </p><p>And other countries are now joining.  More Russians are heading home, as  NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Australia announced that  they are also joining more than two dozen countries in kicking out more  than 150 Russian diplomats.  </p><p>The Russian government is vowing to retaliate.  The foreign minister,  Sergei Lavrov, says -- quote -- \"Rest assured, we will respond.  The reason  is that no one would like to tolerate such obnoxiousness, and we won't  either.\"  </p><p>He says the United States used colossal pressure and blackmail to push  other countries to join it in kicking out these diplomats.  </p><p>And the State Department says it still has not heard from Russia since it  made the initial announcement.  The expectation here is that the response  of the Russians will mirror what the United States did, which is kick out  60 diplomats, close the consulate in Seattle.  </p><p>This deteriorating relationship between the United States and Russia, that  will fall to the next secretary of state.  That's expected to be the CIA  director, Mike Pompeo, who is actually here right now.  Arrived around 2:00  this afternoon.  Officials say he's meeting with top State Department staff  here.  He's also working on his confirmation hearing, preparing for that.   That is expected next month.  </p><p>And he will be the next secretary of state if the Senate confirms him.   Now, the State Department has been saying throughout the day, as has the  White House, that they're willing to have a better relationship with  Russia.  But the problem is, they need to see change in Russian behavior.   And thus far, they have seen none of that -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you, my friend.  </p><p>In the meantime, all the criticism that a lot of Democrats had particularly  of this president, that he was very soft on Russia, very, very unwilling to  take on Russia, now, of course, has agitated Russia over so many of its  diplomats getting kicked out courtesy one president Donald J. Trump.  </p><p>To retired General Jerry Boykin. </p><p>General, what do you make of this?  </p><p>LT. GEN. JERRY BOYKIN (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Yes.  </p><p>Well, first of all, keep in mind that all countries have people that are  doing human intelligence inside their embassies.  And most of them have  diplomatic cover.  So the fact that we are sending 60 of the Russians home  doesn't mean that the human intelligence collection effort will not  continue here.  </p><p>But I will tell you, this 26, 27 countries, they have come together because  of the leadership of Donald Trump.  And that was one of the objectives, is  to form this coalition to send a very strong message to the Russians.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, the president let his staff, you know, go ahead and do this,  send a signal clear, let it be handled through the State Department, go  through all the protocols that you would expect something like this would  be done.  </p><p>But I haven't heard from those who criticized him, assuming that he owes  Vladimir Putin something or that he wouldn't take on Vladimir Putin.  You  would expect that there would be an acknowledgement here, whether you like  President Trump or not, that on this particular issue at this particular  time he did the right thing.  </p><p>BOYKIN:  Well, you know, it's more of the same.  They're not going to give  him credit for doing anything.  </p><p>I mean, what have they given him credit for?  They have been continually  critical of him, in spite of his successes in his first year-plus.  </p><p>But, look, I think this is a very significant issue here, because think  about this.  You have 26, 27 countries that are all telling Russia, you are  not going to get away with these shenanigans in our countries and we're  going to punish you.  </p><p>And that is an embarrassment for Vladimir Putin personally, but it is also  difficult for them to carry on and continue the way they have been  operating, particularly in these countries.  And I think this coalition  will grow before it's all over with.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  General, while I have got you, I would be curious to get your  thoughts on Kim Jong-un of North Korea apparently in China.  There's  obviously a great deal of pressure there.  The Chinese are feeling the  tariffs squeeze, the North Koreans the sanctions squeeze.  Are the two  related?  </p><p>BOYKIN:  Well, yes, I think they are related, unquestionably.</p><p>The Chinese know that the North Koreans are feeling the squeeze.  They know  that there's internal unrest in North Korea, which could result in all  kinds of bad things happening there.  But I think that the Chinese are very  concerned also that Kim is going into a meeting with Donald Trump, and he  is not prepared for that meeting.  </p><p>And I think they're trying to prevent him from giving away the farm.  Now,  I think that that's that's -- they are wrong in thinking that that might  happen, because I don't think Kim has actually made a decision he's going  to give up his nuclear weapons yet.  </p><p>But China has -- I think has a real concern about where this is all going,  with him meeting with and negotiating with Donald Trump.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think they will keep him there, that he's not going back to  North Korea?  </p><p>BOYKIN:  No, I think he's going back to North Korea.  I don't think that  that's going to happen.  </p><p>But I got to tell you, the best solution to this whole thing, Neil, in my  view, is that the Chinese take him out.  Just wipe this guy out.  I don't  think that's going to happen anytime soon, though.</p><p>But it's a perplexing situation for the Chinese, just like it is for the  Americans and the South Koreans.  But, ultimately, I think Donald Trump is  going to prevail in this, because he's shown such strong leadership against  a guy that has never really had anybody stand up to him like this.  </p><p>And these sanctions are hurting him and hurting the North Korean people.   And that is a -- that is a recipe for disaster, if he doesn't do something  very quickly.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  It is weird stuff.  It might be a one-way train ticket, to  your point.  We shall see.  </p><p>General, thank you so much.  </p><p>BOYKIN:  Thank you, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we told you about California, essentially a sanctuary  stat when it comes to illegals and all that stuff, suing anyone who dares  threaten the protection for those who aren't necessarily citizens.  </p><p>But not everyone wants to be a sanctuary state.  Some are trying to seek  sanctuary from the sanctuary thing, including one community where a vote is  any minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think California is hurting itself, hurting its reputation  by doing this, the mayor of Oakland, the governor who support these type of  measures?</p><p>MICHELLE STEEL, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR:  Oh, my God, yes.</p><p>Mayor of Oakland tells everybody that this is racist.  That has nothing to  do with it.  We don't want any criminals walking on the street.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, that is simply how the Orange County supervisor,  Michelle Steel, saw it.</p><p>Orange County wants a sanctuary from this sanctuary movement.  She and  other county officials are about to put their revolt to a vote.  </p><p>Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles with the latest on how that's expected to go  -- Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  You know, Neil, this effort in  Orange County began as a symbolic gesture, a way for the county to stand  behind the city of Los Alamitos, which opted out of California's sanctuary  law a couple of weeks ago. </p><p>But breaking right now, Orange County supervisors, who, by the way, are all  Republicans, have just voted to condemn California's sanctuary law.  On top  of that, they want to join the federal lawsuit against California.</p><p>And they're still debating, but it's also possible the county could file  its own lawsuit against the state.  Remember, under sanctuary laws, local  police are not allowed to notify federal immigration agents when they have  illegal immigrants in custody.  In other words, instead of deporting  criminal aliens, they're set free.  </p><p>For example, from January 1 to March 19, Orange County released 172 illegal  immigrant inmates back into the communities.  They'd been arrested for  domestic violence, driving under the influence and criminal threats.  </p><p>Unclear how many have re-offended.  But now Orange County Sheriff Sandra  Hutchens, who was using a who's in jail online database to notify the  public about exactly when inmates, including illegal inmates, are being set  free, so now the information is all out there.  </p><p>And that should allow ICE agents to be in the right place at the right time  to pick these people up, Neil.  But, yes, the vote is in.  Orange County  condemned sanctuary city policies, joining the federal lawsuit.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know what I don't understand, Trace, is -- that's one issue in  Orange County, then, but quite another, let's say you wander into Oakland,  right?  </p><p>GALLAGHER:  Sure.  </p><p>I mean, and Oakland is on the other side of this spectrum, right?  Oakland  Mayor Libby Schaaf has many times said, look, we -- she still stands behind  this.  Even with all the criticism, even with some people in the Democratic  Party criticizing her, she stands behind that decision to notify ICE -- or  notify illegal immigrants that ICE agents were coming down on them -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very much, Trace Gallagher in California.  </p><p>GALLAGHER:  Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Orange Undersheriff Don Barnes, by the way, will be my  special guest tomorrow on this show, this push right now that has a state  divided, and the middle of this state now suing, suing the federal  government, more to the point, the Trump administration and the Commerce  Department, over a simple question that is included in this year's census:   Are you a legal citizen of this country?</p><p>More after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Everything goes back to Facebook.  The stock that is now in bear  market territory, having fallen 21 percent from its high, has now buffeted  the entire sector.  </p><p>Today was maybe just a flash, but I'm telling here, the fear seems to be  that the government is sniffing around.  That can't be good.  It won't only  sniff around Facebook.  It wants to talk to a lot of other players here.  </p><p>And that has Wall Street thinking, oh, no.  Been there, done that, don't  want to see it again.</p><p>We will see you tomorrow.</p><p>\"The Five\" is now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: In your Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Are investors freaking out because the government could be digging in and way beyond Facebook?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New fears right now that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg might not be alone, that there are other tech companies that are getting caught up in the, hey, we're from the United States government and we would like to chat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nvidia plunging today after suspending self-driving tests. That's got local government interest. Tesla dropping to its lowest level in almost a year amid reports that the government is investigating a Tesla vehicle crash in California and wants to know what exactly happened.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then there's the case of Microsoft, which was supposed to be the next trillion-dollar company. Reports now it was among the most poorly performing Dow stocks, and no one, no one is investigating Microsoft.</p><p>What is going on here with this widening concern in Washington that, you know, we'd like to get a handle on this? The problem with Washington wanting to get a handle on something is, well, sellers get a handle on selling and selling and selling. And by day's end, down about 334.5 points.</p><p>Now, keep in mind, we gained about 669 points yesterday, but this whipsawing, this volatility, as our Ashley Webster can tell you from FOX Business Network, has suddenly come back in vogue.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The investors are twitching out there, no doubt, Neil.</p><p>If it wasn't for the last hour of trading, we'd be fine. Right? Unless you're betting on these stocks going lower.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>WEBSTER: But my, oh, my, you can almost feel it, when this sail -- the selling of stocks starts to pick up momentum.</p><p>But you mentioned those big tech companies. Yes, we know that Facebook has privacy problems. We know that Nvidia, the big chip company, says it's going to stop or at least suspend its self-driving car testing.</p><p>But then, as you mentioned, Neil, Microsoft suddenly gets hit, is down more, as I see here, more than 4 percent on the day. That is what you call indiscriminate selling. That is guilty by association. And it brings down a whole sector.</p><p>And, as we know, tech has led the way for these markets for so long. But, boy, oh, boy, you start taking -- you start talking about regulation that could impact business models, that could impact earnings, and all of a sudden they're running for the exits.</p><p>But it's not just tech today, Neil. We also saw the financials getting hit, as we saw that 10-year yield on the treasury actually breaking below 2.8 percent. In other words, it was a bond rally, a run to safety. That means lower rates and that hurts the banks. The banks also got hit and swept up in this big selling rush, if you like.</p><p>As you can see, the 10-year yield down to 2.79. It was at 2.9 something just a week ago. Down another more than five basis points. So, in other words, we're seeing a trend. Yesterday, we were up 600 points. Down today 344 points on the Dow. Is this the new normal? Analysts say yes.</p><p>But we do get earnings, first-quarter earnings, next month. Maybe that will calm some of the nerves, Neil. But, my goodness, once we get into that 2:45, 3:00 hour, it's truly the witching hour every day.</p><p>CAVUTO: It certainly seems to be.</p><p>Now, I know the biggest concern right now is that it's not just Facebook, that the government is interested in talking to the folks behind Twitter and Google and all of this just to get an idea of how they start collecting information on us.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: And the intentions might be fine, but Wall Street generally abhors government looking into anything, doesn't it?</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, it's that Reagan comment, isn't it, I'm from the government and I'm here to help you. That's the most terrifying thing you can hear.</p><p>And once you get regulations, generally, Washington doesn't do regulations, it's never going to be a positive. And certainly when it comes to these big tech companies, Neil, that means reduced margins, not making as much money, more transparency. I understand all of that.</p><p>But from a purely business point of view, that could spell bad news for these very fast-growing companies.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much, my friend. A very nice wrap-up of a crazy day, Ashley Webster.</p><p>Just you hear this term volatility. And it used to mean just swings of 1 percent or more. And we saw very, very few of those, certainly last year. In fact, putting it in perspective here, we have already doubled the number of 1 percent moves in this early year. We're not even done with the first quarter, right? More than double what we had all of last year, and that's just a preview, we're told, of coming attractions.</p><p>To Jonas Max Ferris, John Tamny, Bob Iaccino.</p><p>Bob, end it with you, begin with you.</p><p>Is it your sense that, besides the drama of the last hour, that the Street is worrying about a government fix for what happened or what was allowed to happen at Facebook and that it extends beyond Facebook? So a lot of your colleagues, not you, mind you, freak out?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BOB IACCINO, PATH TRADING PARTNERS: Yes, I think that's definitely what it is, Neil. That's what's happening, as you talk about Mark Zuckerberg potentially testifying.</p><p>He's awkward on stage at his own pre-prepared speeches. I think Congress, quite frankly, with a bank of lawyers, would absolutely shred him and it's going to look bad.</p><p>So, I definitely think that's what Wall Street is looking at. And from the volatility perspective, we just had an unprecedented run, a decades-low run, where the average daily range of the equity markets was about 0.8 percent. And historically that kind of run in low volatility is followed by a run of high volatility.</p><p>You might looking at six to nine months of these kinds of moves.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, John Tamny, when look at this, we were heralding a little more than 24 hours ago, actually, a little more than two hours ago, this notion that the president will get his way on these tariffs that the Chinese are blinking on, that they're going to concede something, give something.</p><p>Either buy more semiconductor chips or that kind of thing to try to even the gap between our two countries. Good luck on pulling that off. But that this is bigger than trade. This has more to do with a sector that has led this rally that might be kind of coughing, right?</p><p>JOHN TAMNY, EDITOR, REALCLEARMARKETS: Well, yes.</p><p>When you look at like Microsoft and Facebook, you're looking at two of the five most valuable companies in the world. And so suddenly we're hearing about the possibility that regulation from Washington is on the way. Let's be clear about what that is.</p><p>We're talking about people who cannot get jobs at these companies suddenly having a say in how they're run. Is it any wonder that investors are spooked? Add to the fact that I think the markets are saying the only closed economy is the world economy. When you shut off China, you shut off the rest of the world for the U.S. to export to also.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, we talk about these extreme days, Jonas.</p><p>And I know you and I over the years have seen that, where one day an industry can be a darling. Suddenly, the next day, it's a pariah. Which is more accurate? The sell-off that we saw in technology particularly today or the run-up particularly in that sector yesterday?</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think that fear is always there with technology. That's a sector that has fallen out of favor in the past.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>FERRIS: It can just fall 50 percent. It's probably the single most risky sector because of innovation that goes on. Just the stocks get overprices and then people all of a sudden are not into them. We saw a lot of hot money going into these tech funds recently, just like in 1999 and 2000.</p><p>I think the fear really now here is just that. It's what kind of Ashley Webster was saying. They're fast-growing companies. Investors are worried they're formerly fast-growing companies. A lot of them were making money essentially spying on people and selling information off.</p><p>At least that's what it's going to look like to the government regulators when they finally see what is going on in Silicon Valley, an area that has gotten very little regulation compared to, say, Europe, where they're always shaking down these companies for something.</p><p>That might be happening or starting to happen here between the car crash, between Facebook with the election stuff and this. It's just they're just going to pounce and they're not going to like what they see, if they even understand it, and we might get a mishmash of rules that are going to bring this business model to a grinding halt for the companies that live off of it.</p><p>It's not everybody. It's more Facebook than like Apple, but these companies, they give you free stuff. It costs money to host all the servers where you put up your videos, and they make money by watching you. It's like having a community center and having microphones everywhere and recording people and selling that information to the highest bidder.</p><p>That's what the business model is going to look like to people in Congress who don't understand it or senators.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. I think you're a little cruel when you say they couldn't get a job at any of those companies. I think it's a little mean.</p><p>But I understand where all of you are coming from.</p><p>But, Bob, I'm looking at this and I'm wondering the pressure that suddenly is on Mark Zuckerberg right now. It's not only about trying to hold up his company and image and reputation.</p><p>Suddenly now, you have an entire industry that might be hanging on his every word, because while they'd love to see a competitor under duress, they're beginning to realize, hey, hey, we're in on this, too.</p><p>IACCINO: Well, to your point earlier, Neil, /I love the comments we have gotten so far out of this panel, because this is not really news that they have stolen your data.</p><p>I mean, Facebook has been stealing your data, Twitter's been stealing your data. Snapchat's doing it now. I'm not on any of those except Twitter because of that. It's not news that they have been making money off of your data.</p><p>And the average American doesn't seem to care about it. And when the government gets involved, I would much rather the government were regulating the NSA than they would be Facebook because people are voluntarily giving their data to Facebook in exchange for the platform use.</p><p>That's something that is in their terms and is pretty widely known.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I will tell you, you touch on something.</p><p>IACCINO: But you're right. It's the business model. It's the business model, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>John, I'm reminded, I'm reminded -- that's a very good point.</p><p>I'm reminded of the view that Scott McNealy had, who used to run Sun Microsystems, that if you want your privacy, get over it in this day and age. I'm paraphrasing here, this notion that, with high technology and the convenience it brings you, whether it's Facebook or some of these other entities, you will surrender some of that.</p><p>And there will be incidents that come up now and then that will make you question, what's that balance? That is going to be driven into focus right now. And imagine, whether they're congressional hearings in the case of Facebook or FTC investigation looking at its books, that magnifying glass will be most unwelcome for this industry.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>TAMNY: Well, McNealy got it right. But I will just add, in the case of Facebook, you got that for free. How do you think that Facebook was paying for itself, other than widely using your data?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, you're absolutely right. You're absolutely.</p><p>TAMNY: And actually enhancing what it gives you precisely because it uses your data.</p><p>And so I think it's essential that Mark Zuckerberg remind Congress to mind its own business.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't know. I don't know, because this extends to a Tesla, right?</p><p>When the government is looking into a crash that involves a Tesla vehicle a week or so back in California, on top of what Uber is saying, we're going to discontinue these driverless tests for a while, I think it's maybe bigger than any individual company. I just wonder where that goes.</p><p>Jonas, what do you think?</p><p>FERRIS: Neil, the business has evolved slowly, but questionably.</p><p>It used to be controversial to sell search ads that were based on your search traffic. Now that is like the least of their problems with what they're doing.</p><p>The problem is, this evolution probably needs to be fixed. I don't know if the government is going to be able to do it. They could hurt the industry.</p><p>CAVUTO: We will watch very closely.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you. A last-second notice for all coming on here and trying to make sense of this crazy world. Good job, all.</p><p>Again, I think as we were pointing out earlier on here, there was sort of a safe haven run to bonds, to treasury notes, to something boring, because boring was cool today. I love days like this, because suddenly people like me are cool. That's what happened today. Boring was a draw. People went to bonds.</p><p>It was a safe place to park cash, and interest rates came down to 2.79 percent, even as they were selling off, actually because they were selling off at the corner of Wall and Broad.</p><p>We will stay on this, look at some of the other repercussions here and what some folks on Capitol Hill are considering when they get back from their vacation, because, boy, they are loaded for bear, and I'm not just talking bear market. We're on top of that.</p><p>Also on top of Kim Jong-un. Where the hell is he?</p><p>After this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DENZEL WASHINGTON, ACTOR: This is 1206 heading northbound on the main line.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: Why are you still on the main line?</p><p>WASHINGTON: We need to know the location of your yard's crane.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it's not just a runaway train, more like a mystery train. And everyone wants to know, on this mystery train, is a certain passenger named Kim Jong-un on it?</p><p>So we have got a possible secret meeting going on between China and North Korea. A lot of people are saying this, oddly enough, might have been propelled by those threatened tariffs and the likes of sanctions that are combining to produce an emergency powwow between North Korea and its biggest benefactor, the Chinese.</p><p>Former Press Secretary to Vice President Mike Pence Marc Lotter, also national security analyst Rebecca Grant.</p><p>Did that, particularly on the tariff front, propel this -- this move today? I mean, Rebecca, looking at what's going on, if Kim Jong-un is indeed in China, did the tariffs in a weird way force this?</p><p>REBECCA GRANT, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: They might have.</p><p>But, you know, I don't really care who was on the train, whether it was Kim or his sister or Colonel Rhee, their negotiator, or one of the other North Korean officials. I'm just glad that someone was there.</p><p>If it's Kim, I think it's high time he got out. He needed a warm-up round. But this means to me that China is still very serious, wants to be a part of this. And hopefully there was some progress made in figuring out the big question, which is, what is Kim going to want to agree to real denuclearization?</p><p>CAVUTO: It could be added pressure, Marc, on the North Korean leader from, again, his chief benefactor, the Chinese, to say you got to behave, or, or these tariffs were just an elaborate subterfuge to get just what we're watching now.</p><p>I know that was Steve Bannon's argument when in New York the other day.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: I think whether it's the tariffs or whether it's just the ongoing maximum pressure campaign, it's showing that President Trump's leadership is working.</p><p>North Korea knows that it needs to make changes. China has already come to the table and severely cut back on their exports to North Korea, which is putting a real crimp in that country's economy.</p><p>So they needed to do something, and as he prepares to meet with the president, it's very important that they be on the same page. And it's good to see that hopefully that China is going to continue to work with the U.S. and President Trump in continuing that maximum pressure.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I don't know what's the genesis for what, so I will defer to both of you. But I do wonder if part of this is about trying to settle on a location for the North Korean leader and President Trump to meet.</p><p>The president can't meet in North Korea. I doubt even China is a logical venue. But what do you think of that, Rebecca?</p><p>GRANT: It's possible. I wouldn't mind seeing a meeting in Beijing. But we're waiting to find out. The border remains a really logical location.</p><p>Let's not forget Kim does have an airplane. It's an old Aleutian airliner that he purchased from the Soviet Union back in the day, so he can go where he needs to go. But I think the real issue here, it was probably a fairly tense meeting.</p><p>China's been very unhappy with North Korea. Kim has created no end of trouble for them. So I think there were probably some stern words exchanged, whoever was in that meeting. And China will have reminded North Korea what they said last August, and that is, if you start trouble, you are on your own.</p><p>That was one of the key breakthroughs that led over time to this place where we're now about to have an important summit and we have a chance to pull this back from the brink. I'm glad to see China doing this. They are communist countries. They like to keep it quiet. But I see this meeting, whoever was in it, as definitely a positive step forward.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now I'm going to be sound like I'm reading a Bob Ludlum novel, Marc, but is this an effort on the Chinese part to say, we are so over you, Kim Jong-un? You have been such an embarrassment. You're going away. You're taking a little trip.</p><p>LOTTER: I don't know if it's going to go that far, but it is good to see that they're continuing to work with the maximum pressure campaign.</p><p>And I do think, to Rebecca's point, when they said that, if you make trouble, you're on your own, that's a significant step. Also, let's not underscore at the same time that the U.S. today, yesterday announced that we have got a framework in place for the new economic agreement with South Korea.</p><p>So, again, North Korea feels the noose tightening around it, whether it's from China, whether they have got new economic cooperation with the United States to the south. These are all things that are coming together to make sure that we deal with the North Korean threat, and deal with it quickly.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Guys, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>Again, we have no real details yet on what's going on in Beijing, who's there, what's being discussed, who is strong-arming who, if any of that is going on.</p><p>What we do know is the odd confluence of events where you have sanctions that have pressured the North Koreans and now tariffs that have pressured the Chinese that might, might, might be producing results. We will simply have to see.</p><p>All right, if you ever see these census surveys, they ask you a lot of general questions, like how many rooms in your house, how many cars you have. But are you an American citizen? We used to ask that all the time. Suddenly, it's become sacrilege. And suddenly, because we are, California is suing -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, you think about it, the whole census is about counting every now and then how many Americans live in this country. But, apparently, it's grown to a great offense if you're ever that general or vague.</p><p>For example, the Trump administration adding the line about your citizenship. Are you a U.S. citizen? Well, that was enough to get California to sue, saying it's a big leap, even though it used to be a common and pretty frequently asked question.</p><p>Kevin Corke at the White House on how they're responding to this -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hey there, Neil.</p><p>You're right about that. Listen, this is the 2020 census we're talking about. And as you mentioned, this is fairly common stuff, with the exception of the 2010 census asking about your citizenship status.</p><p>Well, I should point out as well, California's A.G. is opposed asking that question. Xavier Becerra is calling it a deliberate effort to scare Californians.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA (D), CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Given the way that this administration has attacked immigrants, you can understand why immigrant families would be afraid to fill out the census questionnaire.</p><p>The Trump administration has yet again failed to learn from history. They fail to consider the consequences of scaring people into not filling out the census forms.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE: But, as you can well imagine, White House officials say, listen, this is the Commerce Department's call, after all. They may have consulted with them, but they do have the final call. They also add fairly quickly that this is not unprecedented in any way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Look, this is a question that's been included in every census since 1965, with the exception of 2010, when it was removed. We have contained this question that's provided data that's necessary for the Department of Justice to protect voters and specifically to help us better comply.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE: Well, I just want to remind you this is not the first time, Neil, we have actually seen the A.G. and the state of California sue the Trump administration.</p><p>Mr. Becerra also suing over the proposed border wall enhancement down in San Diego and along the U.S.-Mexico border. By the way, for the folks that don't understand the real importance here, it's not just about counting people. We're talking about political representation and federal funding.</p><p>So you can well imagine, Neil, why the state of California wants to make sure that they're getting everyone counted, even if some of them may not be here legally -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, all right, thank you very, very much, Kevin Corke.</p><p>Bottom line here, this always morphs into a discussion -- I'm a stickler for using the right words for things when I can and when they apply -- but to say that this morphed into being scaring immigrants, well, if it would scare anyone, I guess it would be illegal immigrants.</p><p>There is a big difference. We're a nation of immigrants, so are we scaring everybody, everyone who answers this survey?</p><p>It's a question my next guest is asking as well, FOX News contributor Kevin Jackson.</p><p>Kevin, I mean, the idea that if you're here illegally that this somehow is targeting you, when in fact this all started with counting the number of legal Americans here, and then criticizing and suing over the fear that this will affect all immigrants, that's -- that's a stretch. But your thoughts.</p><p>KEVIN JACKSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, of course it is.</p><p>You know, Californians are living on another planet. Look, this is a very simple thing, Neil. And everybody watching your program, the millions watching FOX News know this. This is California's attempt to minimize the vote of legal citizens.</p><p>And it has nothing to do with immigrants. And in fact I love that the Trump administration invoked the 1965 Civil -- or Voting Rights Act, rather, in bringing this back, because, effectively, Barack Obama ignored that and violated that Civil Rights Act.</p><p>This is something that is supposed to protect citizens in keeping the vote from being watered down. The other thing is California's been losing citizens quite readily because of the craziness of Jerry Brown and the tactics of these legislators out there who are doing things like allowing people with AIDS to infect people.</p><p>They're passing laws and legislation that do not protect their citizens. So this is -- but Sarah -- stretching something, trying to make it racist, when in fact when they undid it in 2010, that really should have been considered racist, and certainly not protecting U.S. citizens.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, you know, I do notice a greater concern with not offending those who are here illegally. Fine. If that's your wont, fine.</p><p>I know it's become a sanctuary state. I know the mayor of Oakland won't even allow ICE to come in without giving local residents, those who are here illegally, a heads-up. But now to start saying that a census that was meant to keep count of the number of legal American citizens in any given community and state to determine and apportion out the number of benefits they should receive and what they should be getting from the United States government down the road has become a much greater fixation on those who -- who aren't here legally, who shouldn't be here legally, who they take great offense to protecting by morphing them into all immigrants.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JACKSON: Look, Neil, this is one of these topics where I guarantee you people are watching this program right now saying to themselves, where has common sense gone in this country, when we know for a fact that the census is there to do one thing?</p><p>It is to apportion votes, period, to apportion legislators. What is California trying to do when they say, we want to count the illegals? I don't care about the sanctuary states and all that. We want to count illegals as part of our population, and we don't want you to question whether somebody's here legally or illegally.</p><p>That's only got one outcome. And that's because California is losing companies. It's losing citizens, people who are tired of being taxed into oblivion, people who can be put in jail because they use the wrong pronoun or they don't believe in climate -- global climate farce. There are people leaving in drones.</p><p>And instead of addressing the real issue, they want to cover it up by saying, let's count everybody that's here. That's ridiculous.</p><p>And people in America are sick of this. And, quite frankly, these counties, Los Alamitos and people like this, that are saying, we're not going to participant in this nonsense of Jerry Brown, are starting to speak out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, it's just getting crazy. It deemed bigoted or racist if you're just trying to get to the bottom of something...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: ... or to allow this to morph in, just when we had the illegal immigrant debate.</p><p>And then they just dropped off illegal, and said, well, anti-immigrant. And then, once again, in the wording of this lawsuit, that's exactly how it came across. But it is a weird world.</p><p>All right, thank you very, very much, my friend.</p><p>We have a lot more coming up here.</p><p>But you know by now that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook fame is ready to testify before Congress. Here's the thing about the guy. He is a genius. He is a genius. No one can deny that. You don't create a multibillion- dollar behemoth if you're an idiot.</p><p>But not great taking questions. Not great sometimes on camera. You know, we can't be gifted teleprompter readers, my friend. I'm telling you, though, that could be a big issue for him and for an entire industry. I'm telling you. He's got more pressure on him than me at a fruit stand.</p><p>I will explain.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Facebook's in a bear market. It is down north of 20 percent. What that means for you and for Mark Zuckerberg when he comes to Congress to testify. He will be poorer and under pressure.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Smile for the cameras, Mark. Looks like Zuck won't duck Congress after all. Reports the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, will indeed testify before Congress on this data scandal.</p><p>There could be others as well. Seems that everyone wants a piece of him, talk to him, and get an idea on how it is the privacy of better than 50 million of his users was compromised.</p><p>Market watcher Burt Flickinger and attorney Emily Compagno on this.</p><p>Burt, you know, if you think about it, the enormous pressure on him now, not just for his company, but for an industry that very much fears a federal fix, is that in the offing here, depending on how he does?</p><p>BURT FLICKINGER, STRATEGIC RESOURCE GROUP: It is in the offing, Neil.</p><p>And, as you referenced with the fruit stand, Zuckerberg is under unprecedented pressure, because the government and the citizens need to know, after reports of Facebook, Google fixing the news, where there's up to 23 percent of the news flow before presidential elections, and this most recent concerning set of circumstances.</p><p>And in terms of not testifying in before the British Parliament, that's absolutely outrageous. Winston Churchill did that in a matter of hours. And before Congress, Casey Stengel, Mickey Mantle, and Roger Maris -- you can look it up -- testified in '58, the same way Howard Hughes did in 1974.</p><p>And the whole market could be under pressure with Mark Zuckerberg, because it's a matter of trust. And without trust, you don't have consumer confidence and, ultimately, Facebook doesn't have a product, this great social media strategist, Mary Jane Mellet of SocialClique, reference.</p><p>And Zuckerberg isn't doing social media at Harvard College, to Elliott House, and elsewhere. He's got tremendous accountability and responsibility. And as, Ms. Mellet says, he has to change his behavior, or Facebook will lose its relevance and could crater the markets.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, therein lies -- you know, and I will talk to the attorney here, Emily Compagno.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, he's, you know, a very, very smart tech guy. He built this from nothing. It started as a dating service. And it's obviously something much bigger now. But, Emily, he is going to be ripped apart. And he has got to answer the proverbial question that these things always come down the, what did you know, when did you know it, how did you botch it, were you covering it up?</p><p>And they will be relentless, because they will, politicians probably of both sides, be trying to finger him and saying, this is something we have got to fix, much like they tried to fix banks, much like they tried big tobacco. And they're going to lump him in with that. So, what does he do?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY: Well, regardless -- look, here's the deal.</p><p>Whether they want to fix it or not, the important issue here is transparency. We all know the FTC is investigating Facebook right now, in part because of their likely violation of the 2011 settlement where they agreed to get express consent by every user before sharing their privacy -- sharing their data outside the bounds of their privacy agreement.</p><p>Now, that is a non-public investigation. So, what that means is, the public will have no visibility into that investigation whatsoever. And he has been and Facebook has been invited by multiple committees on the congressional Hill, right?</p><p>So, it's about as well how the government wants to define or how our government wants to kind of categorize Facebook. Do we define it as a media group, as a newspaper?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But tech guys are not savvy at this. They're brilliant, a lot of I.Q., not a lot of E.Q. And that could run against him.</p><p>I'm not trying to disparage him. I'm just trying to say, that's the -- you know, the bane of existence for geniuses, right?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Right.</p><p>But I think the larger question is that they, they meaning Facebook and Zuckerberg, was responsible for almost two billion users' private data, of which 50 million was breached. And so I think here the larger question is whether it's in our best interest, our meaning the consumers, to regulate that environment, or at least to get some answers, to find out what he knew and when, as you said, and moving forward how that can be better regulated to protect the consumer.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO: So, it's not whether his E.Q. or I.Q. will kind of damage his own credibility. It's whether we will get the answers that the public deserves. And Congress right now, depending on how we categorize it, it's important for us moving forward to know how to operate within that regulatory framework.</p><p>And that's something that will play out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, but we're not going to get those answers. We're not going to get those answers, Burt.</p><p>He's going to be limited by his own lawyers about what he can say, especially with an FTC investigation going on concurrently.</p><p>FLICKINGER: Emily is completely correct. And as the great U.S. spokesperson and comedian Lucille Ball of Jamestown, New York, said, Zuckerberg's got a lot of 'splaining to do.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FLICKINGER: And with that, so far, his response -- Howard Hughes had a tough time socially in testifying, but he helped himself with testifying.</p><p>So far, Zuckerberg and Facebook have folded faster than this number one ranked Harvard hockey preseason team that didn't even make the playoffs.</p><p>They have done a lot of damage. And they could really damage the Nasdaq and the market with their obtuseness and being so opaque.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>FLICKINGER: And as Emily said so well, transparency is key to protect the consumer, which is critical.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, well put.</p><p>We will see, because the pressure builds next month, when all this goes down.</p><p>All right, guys, thank you, very, very much.</p><p>Well, for those who thought that the administration would be pussyfooting around with dealing with the Russians, proof that it is not. All those Russian diplomats who were kicked out and, suddenly, suddenly, the Democratic critics who are so silent.</p><p>CAVUTO: What's Russian for, oh, no, you didn't-ski?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't know.</p><p>I do know that Rich Edson is at the State Department, where they're trying to brace for what the Russia response will be, our kicking out 60 of their diplomats -- Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good afternoon, Neil.</p><p>And other countries are now joining. More Russians are heading home, as NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Australia announced that they are also joining more than two dozen countries in kicking out more than 150 Russian diplomats.</p><p>The Russian government is vowing to retaliate. The foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, says -- quote -- \"Rest assured, we will respond. The reason is that no one would like to tolerate such obnoxiousness, and we won't either.\"</p><p>He says the United States used colossal pressure and blackmail to push other countries to join it in kicking out these diplomats.</p><p>And the State Department says it still has not heard from Russia since it made the initial announcement. The expectation here is that the response of the Russians will mirror what the United States did, which is kick out 60 diplomats, close the consulate in Seattle.</p><p>This deteriorating relationship between the United States and Russia, that will fall to the next secretary of state. That's expected to be the CIA director, Mike Pompeo, who is actually here right now. Arrived around 2:00 this afternoon. Officials say he's meeting with top State Department staff here. He's also working on his confirmation hearing, preparing for that. That is expected next month.</p><p>And he will be the next secretary of state if the Senate confirms him. Now, the State Department has been saying throughout the day, as has the White House, that they're willing to have a better relationship with Russia. But the problem is, they need to see change in Russian behavior. And thus far, they have seen none of that -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you, my friend.</p><p>In the meantime, all the criticism that a lot of Democrats had particularly of this president, that he was very soft on Russia, very, very unwilling to take on Russia, now, of course, has agitated Russia over so many of its diplomats getting kicked out courtesy one president Donald J. Trump.</p><p>To retired General Jerry Boykin.</p><p>General, what do you make of this?</p><p>LT. GEN. JERRY BOYKIN (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Yes.</p><p>Well, first of all, keep in mind that all countries have people that are doing human intelligence inside their embassies. And most of them have diplomatic cover. So the fact that we are sending 60 of the Russians home doesn't mean that the human intelligence collection effort will not continue here.</p><p>But I will tell you, this 26, 27 countries, they have come together because of the leadership of Donald Trump. And that was one of the objectives, is to form this coalition to send a very strong message to the Russians.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, the president let his staff, you know, go ahead and do this, send a signal clear, let it be handled through the State Department, go through all the protocols that you would expect something like this would be done.</p><p>But I haven't heard from those who criticized him, assuming that he owes Vladimir Putin something or that he wouldn't take on Vladimir Putin. You would expect that there would be an acknowledgement here, whether you like President Trump or not, that on this particular issue at this particular time he did the right thing.</p><p>BOYKIN: Well, you know, it's more of the same. They're not going to give him credit for doing anything.</p><p>I mean, what have they given him credit for? They have been continually critical of him, in spite of his successes in his first year-plus.</p><p>But, look, I think this is a very significant issue here, because think about this. You have 26, 27 countries that are all telling Russia, you are not going to get away with these shenanigans in our countries and we're going to punish you.</p><p>And that is an embarrassment for Vladimir Putin personally, but it is also difficult for them to carry on and continue the way they have been operating, particularly in these countries. And I think this coalition will grow before it's all over with.</p><p>CAVUTO: General, while I have got you, I would be curious to get your thoughts on Kim Jong-un of North Korea apparently in China. There's obviously a great deal of pressure there. The Chinese are feeling the tariffs squeeze, the North Koreans the sanctions squeeze. Are the two related?</p><p>BOYKIN: Well, yes, I think they are related, unquestionably.</p><p>The Chinese know that the North Koreans are feeling the squeeze. They know that there's internal unrest in North Korea, which could result in all kinds of bad things happening there. But I think that the Chinese are very concerned also that Kim is going into a meeting with Donald Trump, and he is not prepared for that meeting.</p><p>And I think they're trying to prevent him from giving away the farm. Now, I think that that's that's -- they are wrong in thinking that that might happen, because I don't think Kim has actually made a decision he's going to give up his nuclear weapons yet.</p><p>But China has -- I think has a real concern about where this is all going, with him meeting with and negotiating with Donald Trump.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think they will keep him there, that he's not going back to North Korea?</p><p>BOYKIN: No, I think he's going back to North Korea. I don't think that that's going to happen.</p><p>But I got to tell you, the best solution to this whole thing, Neil, in my view, is that the Chinese take him out. Just wipe this guy out. I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, though.</p><p>But it's a perplexing situation for the Chinese, just like it is for the Americans and the South Koreans. But, ultimately, I think Donald Trump is going to prevail in this, because he's shown such strong leadership against a guy that has never really had anybody stand up to him like this.</p><p>And these sanctions are hurting him and hurting the North Korean people. And that is a -- that is a recipe for disaster, if he doesn't do something very quickly.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. It is weird stuff. It might be a one-way train ticket, to your point. We shall see.</p><p>General, thank you so much.</p><p>BOYKIN: Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we told you about California, essentially a sanctuary stat when it comes to illegals and all that stuff, suing anyone who dares threaten the protection for those who aren't necessarily citizens.</p><p>But not everyone wants to be a sanctuary state. Some are trying to seek sanctuary from the sanctuary thing, including one community where a vote is any minute.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think California is hurting itself, hurting its reputation by doing this, the mayor of Oakland, the governor who support these type of measures?</p><p>MICHELLE STEEL, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR: Oh, my God, yes.</p><p>Mayor of Oakland tells everybody that this is racist. That has nothing to do with it. We don't want any criminals walking on the street.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, that is simply how the Orange County supervisor, Michelle Steel, saw it.</p><p>Orange County wants a sanctuary from this sanctuary movement. She and other county officials are about to put their revolt to a vote.</p><p>Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles with the latest on how that's expected to go -- Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: You know, Neil, this effort in Orange County began as a symbolic gesture, a way for the county to stand behind the city of Los Alamitos, which opted out of California's sanctuary law a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>But breaking right now, Orange County supervisors, who, by the way, are all Republicans, have just voted to condemn California's sanctuary law. On top of that, they want to join the federal lawsuit against California.</p><p>And they're still debating, but it's also possible the county could file its own lawsuit against the state. Remember, under sanctuary laws, local police are not allowed to notify federal immigration agents when they have illegal immigrants in custody. In other words, instead of deporting criminal aliens, they're set free.</p><p>For example, from January 1 to March 19, Orange County released 172 illegal immigrant inmates back into the communities. They'd been arrested for domestic violence, driving under the influence and criminal threats.</p><p>Unclear how many have re-offended. But now Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens, who was using a who's in jail online database to notify the public about exactly when inmates, including illegal inmates, are being set free, so now the information is all out there.</p><p>And that should allow ICE agents to be in the right place at the right time to pick these people up, Neil. But, yes, the vote is in. Orange County condemned sanctuary city policies, joining the federal lawsuit.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know what I don't understand, Trace, is -- that's one issue in Orange County, then, but quite another, let's say you wander into Oakland, right?</p><p>GALLAGHER: Sure.</p><p>I mean, and Oakland is on the other side of this spectrum, right? Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf has many times said, look, we -- she still stands behind this. Even with all the criticism, even with some people in the Democratic Party criticizing her, she stands behind that decision to notify ICE -- or notify illegal immigrants that ICE agents were coming down on them -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much, Trace Gallagher in California.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Orange Undersheriff Don Barnes, by the way, will be my special guest tomorrow on this show, this push right now that has a state divided, and the middle of this state now suing, suing the federal government, more to the point, the Trump administration and the Commerce Department, over a simple question that is included in this year's census: Are you a legal citizen of this country?</p><p>More after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Everything goes back to Facebook. The stock that is now in bear market territory, having fallen 21 percent from its high, has now buffeted the entire sector.</p><p>Today was maybe just a flash, but I'm telling here, the fear seems to be that the government is sniffing around. That can't be good. It won't only sniff around Facebook. It wants to talk to a lot of other players here.</p><p>And that has Wall Street thinking, oh, no. Been there, done that, don't want to see it again.</p><p>We will see you tomorrow.</p><p>\"The Five\" is now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, announced Wednesday that Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing by the panel on Oct. 23. The focus will be on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency and its role in housing. The company agreed in a legal settlement in March to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers from both parties and top regulators, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have criticized Facebook's plan for the new currency, expressing concern that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. There also is concern that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency, to be called Libra, could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>\"Mark looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers' questions,\" Facebook said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>In July, Waters and other committee Democrats sent a letter to Facebook requesting a halt on moving forward with the currency and with the digital wallet, called Calibra, which would be used in the new currency system. House Democrats also have threatened legislation that would block big tech companies from getting into banking.</p><p>Waters has called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>France's finance minister said Wednesday that the European Union should not allow Facebook to develop the currency project on \"European territory\" because it threatens the monetary sovereignty of member countries. \"It should not be the role of a private company to try to get a sovereign currency like a sovereign state,\" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.</p><p>Unlike digital currencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook's plan calls for Libra to be backed by real currencies.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, told lawmakers over two days of congressional hearings in July that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>The plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts, and would make it cheaper to send money across borders, Marcus said.

Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, announced Wednesday that Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing by the panel on Oct. 23. The focus will be on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency and its role in housing. The company agreed in a legal settlement in March to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers from both parties and top regulators, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have criticized Facebook's plan for the new currency, expressing concern that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. There also is concern that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency, to be called Libra, could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>\"Mark looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers' questions,\" Facebook said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>In July, Waters and other committee Democrats sent a letter to Facebook requesting a halt on moving forward with the currency and with the digital wallet, called Calibra, which would be used in the new currency system. House Democrats also have threatened legislation that would block big tech companies from getting into banking.</p><p>Waters has called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>France's finance minister said Wednesday that the European Union should not allow Facebook to develop the currency project on \"European territory\" because it threatens the monetary sovereignty of member countries. \"It should not be the role of a private company to try to get a sovereign currency like a sovereign state,\" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.</p><p>Unlike digital currencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook's plan calls for Libra to be backed by real currencies.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, told lawmakers over two days of congressional hearings in July that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>The plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts, and would make it cheaper to send money across borders, Marcus said.

Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, announced Wednesday that Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing by the panel on Oct. 23. The focus will be on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency and its role in housing. The company agreed in a legal settlement in March to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers from both parties and top regulators, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have criticized Facebook's plan for the new currency, expressing concern that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. There also is concern that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency, to be called Libra, could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>\"Mark looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers' questions,\" Facebook said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>In July, Waters and other committee Democrats sent a letter to Facebook requesting a halt on moving forward with the currency and with the digital wallet, called Calibra, which would be used in the new currency system. House Democrats also have threatened legislation that would block big tech companies from getting into banking.</p><p>Waters has called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>France's finance minister said Wednesday that the European Union should not allow Facebook to develop the currency project on \"European territory\" because it threatens the monetary sovereignty of member countries. \"It should not be the role of a private company to try to get a sovereign currency like a sovereign state,\" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.</p><p>Unlike digital currencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook's plan calls for Libra to be backed by real currencies.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, told lawmakers over two days of congressional hearings in July that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>The plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts, and would make it cheaper to send money across borders, Marcus said.

Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, announced Wednesday that Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing by the panel on Oct. 23. The focus will be on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency and its role in housing. The company agreed in a legal settlement in March to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers from both parties and top regulators, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have criticized Facebook's plan for the new currency, expressing concern that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. There also is concern that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency, to be called Libra, could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>\"Mark looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers' questions,\" Facebook said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>In July, Waters and other committee Democrats sent a letter to Facebook requesting a halt on moving forward with the currency and with the digital wallet, called Calibra, which would be used in the new currency system. House Democrats also have threatened legislation that would block big tech companies from getting into banking.</p><p>Waters has called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>France's finance minister said Wednesday that the European Union should not allow Facebook to develop the currency project on \"European territory\" because it threatens the monetary sovereignty of member countries. \"It should not be the role of a private company to try to get a sovereign currency like a sovereign state,\" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.</p><p>Unlike digital currencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook's plan calls for Libra to be backed by real currencies.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, told lawmakers over two days of congressional hearings in July that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>The plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts, and would make it cheaper to send money across borders, Marcus said. He did not agree to a suspension of the plan or a pilot project, as several lawmakers urged.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users around the globe, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of data privacy scandals, including lapses in opening the personal data of millions of users to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting investigations of Facebook and the other big tech companies amid accusations of abuse of their market power to crush competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg had three days of private meetings in Washington last month with Trump and several lawmakers who, like the president, are critics of the tech industry. He also met with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to discuss ways to prevent foreign actors from disrupting next year's elections.

Among those that are paid, the fees may vary considerably.</p><p>In its discussions ahead of the launch, Facebook had offered hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for smaller publishers, a few million for bigger ones, and substantially more for the very largest outlets, according to people familiar with those talks.</p><p>The move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing regulatory scrutiny. Google has resisted paying publishers but announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, addressing another long-running complaint from publishers.</p><p>The new service marked a key shift, said Mr Thomson, who has been sharply critical of Facebook and Google in the past for issues including not paying for news on their platforms.</p><p>\"Great journalism will only be sustainable at scale if there is a fundamental change in the landscape like this,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Thomson said Facebook's move was \"a powerful precedent that will echo around editorial departments\".</p><p>MEDIA P23</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-aee33d84f85e11e98fc4d03f578c182c537bc56d3cc068bb1ecce8055f3be8aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XC7-VNC1-JD3N-53NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 28, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.Acting pre-emptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content, and ensure election integrity and data portability. </p><p>The internet 'needs new rules,' he said.Facebook, a social media giant with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.AdvertisingIt is Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.'The participants had a discussion touching on multiple issues, including the role and responsibility of social media platforms in protecting our democracy, and what steps Congress should take to defend our elections, protect consumer data, and encourage competition in the social media space,' Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Warner, said in a statement.Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting from them and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.

However, this time the challenge is not about the U.S. Privacy Shield but about a request by EU anti-trust regulators for documents from Facebook which Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook says would force it to reveal a substantial amount of its employees\u2019 personal data.    It also says that, to date, it has cooperated with the European Commission anti-trust investigations, but pointed out that the way the request was formulated would mean that Facebook would have to hand over information that includes employees private messages among other things. Even still, Facebook expects to hand over hundreds of thousands of documents to the regulator. \"The exceptionally broad nature of the commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission's investigations,\" Lamb said in response to an inquiry from the French news agency AFP.    Among the documents that are covered by the request, according to Lamb, are documents that include sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees. Facebook thinks such requests should be reviewed by EU courts, according to Lamb, and is asking the court to weigh in on broad search terms such as \"applause\" or \"for free\" that could easily be found in personal email messages or other exchanges way beyond the scope of antitrust matters.    Investigations such as this can involve requests for messages or documents containing certain words or phrases and are designed to scoop up the most information possible.    Meanwhile, a U.S. antitrust hearing, including top executives of four Big Tech firms, originally set for this week has been postponed. A notice filed by the House Judiciary Committee set no new date for the hearing titled \"Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.\"    Chief executives Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet had agreed to participate in the session.   Google Faces Australian Courts Over Data Privacy   Elsewhere, the Australian Competition and  Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) has launched court proceedings against Alphabet\u2019s Google accusing it of misleading Australian consumers to obtain their consent to expand the scope of personal information that Google could collect and combine about consumers\u2019 internet activity, for use by Google, including for targeted advertising.    While the complaint may seem a distant problem for a distant country, the case itself has widespread implications in other jurisdictions and while there doesn\u2019t appear to be any cases on the books elsewhere, it would be logical to see similar cases elsewhere if this complaint is upheld.    In court documents, the ACCC accused Google of misleading consumers when it failed to get their explicit informed consent about its move in 2016 to start combining personal information in consumers\u2019 Google accounts with information about those individuals\u2019 activities on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display ads. \u201cWe are taking this action because we consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims said in a statement . \u201cGoogle significantly increased the scope of information it collected about consumers on a personally identifiable basis. This included potentially very sensitive and private information about their activities on third party websites. It then used this information to serve up highly targeted advertisements without consumers\u2019 express informed consent.\u201d    For its part, Google said the change was optional and consumer consent was sought through prominent and easy-to-understand notifications. In a statement to Reuters news agency, Google said. \u201cIf a user did not consent, their experience of our products and services remained unchanged,\u201d a Google spokesman said in an email. The statement also said that the company intends to defend its position.    Before 28 June 2016, Google stated in its privacy policy:\" [We] will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.\u201d    On 28 June 2016, Google deleted this statement and inserted the following statement: \u201c[d]epending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\u201d    Google acquired DoubleClick, a supplier of ad-serving technology services to publishers and advertisers in 2008. Google now supplies DoubleClick\u2019s services through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands.    Combined with the personal data stored in Google accounts, this provided Google with valuable information with which to sell even more targeted advertising, including through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands, the ACCC claims. The regulators are seeking a fine \u201cin the millions.\"   Okta Assesses Data Privacy Concerns   These are not just legal battles; these are all issues that have resonance with the public and those who work in digital workplaces. To find out exactly how deep this goes,  San Francisco-based Okta , which develops  an enterprise-grade, identity management service, commissioned Juniper Research to conduct an online survey of over 12,000 people between the ages of 18 and 75 in six countries, notably Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.There were four principle findings in the research which was carried out between 20th and 31st January 2020 and 27th April to 6th May   1. Consumers Underestimate Data Tracking   A significant number of respondents believe companies are not collecting data about their online and offline activities. 42% of Americans do not think online retailers collect data about their purchase history, and 49% do not think their social media posts are being tracked by social media companies.   2. Consumers Say Privacy Outweighs All   While technology companies have launched initiatives to track the spread of COVID-19, many consumers are not buying it. 84% of Americans are worried that data collection for COVID-19 containment will sacrifice too much of their privacy, and 74% of Australians say the same.   3. Distrust in Government Is High   While social media companies are the least trusted overall, global respondents make it clear that governments are still not popular. 70% of Americans are uncomfortable with the government tracking their data, and less than a quarter (24%) of US respondents are willing to share their data to help law enforcement.   4. Consumers Are Sitting on Gold Mines of Data   37% of consumers would not sell their personal data. Another 27% are unsure if payment is worth it to sacrifice their data. When it comes to specific types of data, 76% of all respondents are unwilling to sell some portion of their data.   Private And Public Sector Divided Over Data Privacy   However, to suggest that there is a single view on data and about the way data is being accessed, would be a mistake. A recently released Ernst &amp; Young report entitled Bridging AI's Trust Gaps shows that there are significant differences in how the public and private sectors view the future of ethics, governance, privacy, policy and regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.    The EY web-based survey was conducted between 2019 and early 2020. It obtained responses from 71 policymakers and 284 companies across 55 countries. Specifically, it showed that AI discrepancies exist in four key areas: fairness and avoiding bias, innovation, data access and privacy and data rights. There were three major findings:   1. Policymakers Have Specific Priorities, Private Sector Lacks Consensus   Policymakers' responses show widespread agreement on the ethical principles most relevant for different applications of AI. The private sector's top choices were principles prioritized by existing regulations, such as GDPR, rather than emerging issues such as fairness and non-discrimination.    2. Disagreement About the Future Direction of Governance   While both policymakers and companies agree a multi-stakeholder approach is needed to guide the direction of AI governance, results show disagreement on what form it will take: thirty-eight percent of organizations surveyed expect the private sector to lead a multi-stakeholder framework, and only 6% of policymakers agree.   3. Overcoming Differences Through Collaboration   The survey also found that there are stakeholder group blind spots when it comes to the implementation of ethical AI, with 69% of companies agreeing that regulators understand the complexities of AI technologies and business challenges, while 66% of policymakers disagreed.    Nigel Duffy, EY Global Artificial Intelligence Leader, pointed out that the findings indicate that as AI transforms business and industries, poor alignment diminishes public trust in AI and slows the adoption of critical applications. For efforts to be fruitful, companies and policymakers need to be aligned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42704590223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G1-1991-JCSC-J3VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CMS Wire</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000D7EQ</classCode><className>SHUTTERSTOCK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The President has been among those critics, having repeatedly criticised Facebook  as \"anti-Trump\" and for perceived  anti-conservative bias. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Trump has tweeted on multiple occasions in support of conservative activists who have either been kicked  off Facebook or had run-ins with the company. </p><p>The President confirmed the meeting on Thursday evening. \"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today,\" he tweeted.</p><p>The meeting was the most important meeting of Mr Zuckerberg's rare visit  to Congress as he sought to bridge a divide between the social media giant and policymakers who have grown increasingly suspicious of its dominance.</p><p>Facebook has been under the scrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission for data privacy violations and multiple states in antitrust probes. </p><p>Mr Zuckerberg's visit comes after the Justice Department's announcement  of an antitrust investigation into large tech companies, which could include Facebook.</p><p>The Facebook founder and current chief executive was due to meet members of House Judiciary Committee yesterday, following a slew of meetings on Thursday with some of his most prominent critics in Congress.</p><p>The social media mogul was also expected to meet Democratic Representative David Cicilline, who is leading the committee's antitrust panel.</p><p>Mr Cicilline is several months into a sweeping antitrust investigation of tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Last week,  Mr Cicilline sent letters to all four companies seeking detailed records on their business practices, acquisitions and prior dealings with governments around the world.</p><p>It was billionaire Mr Zuckerberg's first reported trip to Washington since an appearance before Congress in April 2018, when he testified on Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>The US Senate's most vocal critic of the tech industry offered a challenge  to the Facebook boss: sell your WhatsApp and Instagram properties  to prove you're serious about protecting data privacy.</p><p>It may have been more than  Mr Zuckerberg expected from his private meeting with Senator Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. </p><p>The Facebook chief left the hour-long meeting - one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill - without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down  a hallway.</p><p>Mr Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put  a wall around the services or, better  yet, sell them off, Senator Hawley said he told Mr Zuckerberg.</p><p>The Facebook founder, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman declined  to comment.</p><p>The popular services are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg's discussion with  Mr Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.</p><p>During his visit, Mr Zuckerberg also met other senators, including Mark Warner, vice-chairman of the  Senate Intelligence Committee, and  Mike Lee, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee. </p><p>Mr Zuckerberg also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Mr Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Mr Lee's office said the two  discussed bias against conservatives  on Facebook's platform, regulation  of online services, enforcement of  antitrust laws in the tech industry  and data privacy issues.</p><p>Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and  make money off users' personal data.  A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the US, could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Acting pre-emptively, Mr Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, has nearly 2.5 billion users. However it is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of  abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Mr Warner helped organise a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for  Mr Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>Mr Warner said he wanted  Mr Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system\".</p><p>Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Mr Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"</p><p>Mr Warner and Mr Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.</p><p>The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Mr Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they are not using political bias to filter content. </p><p>Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean  a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.</p><p>Earlier this week, Facebook said it expects to name the first members of a new quasi-independent oversight board by the end of the year. The oversight panel is intended to rule on thorny content issues, such as when Facebook or Instagram posts constitute hate speech. It will be empowered to make binding rulings on whether posts or ads violate the company's standards. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GHERLD-NQ222565632</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GHERLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3H-61M1-F0PR-909D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142728</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Herald (Glasgow)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51350\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

When the internet started, the hippies in California wanted it to be free. That saw the rise of advertising-sponsored content and the unintended consequence of that was the development of sophisticated capability in the socio-economic profiling of people.\"</p><p>Turner says that meant companies could build a profile around people's individual biases, gaining important information about what they responded to and using that to keep them online for longer or to buy certain products or, in the case of an election campaign, vote for the desired candidate.</p><p>\"The thing I grapple with is that we knew this profiling was happening so why didn't we care,\" he says.</p><p>One reason people overlooked data collection was the sheer convenience and connectivity of Facebook.</p><p> Quickly became indispensable </p><p>Families and friends living on opposite sides of the world could keep in touch. Entrepreneurs could launch their businesses by cheaply promoting goods and services via the platform. Busy executives could corral colleagues for the office Christmas party and protest organisers could rally the troops.</p><p>Launched in 2004 by Zuckerberg and his Harvard college buddies, Facebook quickly became indispensable to its users. In just four years it boasted 100 million registered users. By 2010 it had passed the half-billion mark.</p><p>Today there are more than 2 billion users, or more than a quarter of the world's population.</p><p>In Australia the platform boasts 16 million users, or 60 per cent of the population, with the bulk of these in the key advertising demographic between 25 and 39.</p><p>\"They should have a greater sense of responsibility and accountability which corresponds to the power they have,\" says Turner.</p><p>\"If Facebook skates through this it will be instructive about how powerful these monopolies are and it will increase the calls for greater regulation. I hope what doesn't happen is that we completely back off thinking about how technology can contribute to humanity.\"</p><p>The regulation is already starting to happen.</p><p>In Europe, a new set of data privacy rules will take effect on May 25, restricting the type of personal data technology companies can collect and share. The new regulations include the \"right-to-be-forgotten\" law so people can ask companies to remove online information about them as well as parental consent rules.</p><p>In Australia, the landscape is also moving quickly towards greater regulation, even if that's an unpalatable word for the federal government.</p><p> Control own data </p><p>The responsible minister Angus Taylor, whose portfolio covers cyber security and law enforcement, said the government expects to bring its Consumer Data Rights legislation to Parliament later this year.</p><p>\"The basic principle is that people control their own data and it is only used in a way they consent to,\" he told AFR Weekend.</p><p>\"I don't think it's radical legislation; it's simply in line with community expectations.\"</p><p>The banking sector is the federal government's first target under this new legislation and it provides a model for how Facebook and other social media platforms might find themselves regulated.</p><p>In an effort to engender competition and foster innovation, Treasurer Scott Morrison is looking to break the stranglehold of Australia's \"big four\", through what he is calling \"open banking\".</p><p>This should eventually allow consumers to safely and easily share their transaction history and loan records with another institution or fintech player, which could use such data to offer better terms to the customer.</p><p>\"Granting third-party access to a customer's data will allow rival providers to offer competitive deals,\" Morrison said in a statement on February 7.</p><p>The basic principle behind this proposed reform is the government decreeing data is owned by the consumer, rather than the bank.</p><p>It took this same approach to mobile phone numbers in 2001, when legislation decreed these didn't belong to the operator but rather the consumer, thereby allowing people to change providers while still keeping their old number.</p><p> Heart of platform economics </p><p>This same principle could be applied to Facebook and other social media platforms.</p><p>Using a similar \"open\" model, the government's new legislation could mean any data captured by a platform is ultimately owned by the individual rather than the company.</p><p>A consumer could then decide who, if anyone, they wished to share their user history with.</p><p>Such a move, which will be fiercely resisted by the big tech firms, would not only stop the likes of Cambridge Analytica accessing user data, but go some way to breaking Facebook's overall dominance and might also impact on how Google deploys data.</p><p>This goes to the heart of platform economics and Facebook itself.</p><p>One of the biggest drawcards is the so-called \"network effect\". If friends and family use a particular social media platform then people can feel compelled to join to stay in touch.</p><p>Platforms like Facebook also take the information they glean from people and use that data to target content, and more importantly, advertising in their direction.</p><p>This keeps a user coming back but also makes it harder for other platforms to offer the same tailored content and advertising as they don't have access to the data and user history.</p><p> Powerful position </p><p>In addition that data allows the big platforms to vertically integrate - remember when Amazon just sold books - and use their superior analysts to wipe out the competition.</p><p>\"These platforms are not about capitalism, they are about feudalism,\" says Turner.</p><p>\"They're landlords and that's an extremely powerful position because they're setting the rules for engagement. They should really be public private partnerships.\"</p><p>Depending on how far legislation in Australia and other parts of the world goes, this could see the likes of Facebook resembling a regulated utility, like an electricity provider.</p><p>Breaking the monopoly these platforms have over data is the first step and should also help curtail their competitive advantage in using such data to move into other industries and becoming even more dominant.</p><p>And while the focus is on Facebook today, this attention could quickly switch to the dominance of other platforms like Amazon and China's Alibaba, as they move further down the value chain and morph from being retailers to looking more and more like farmers or food processors.</p><p>\"Amazon and Alibaba talk openly about building global trading networks,\" says Turner from Data61.</p><p>The issue is how to prevent all the value in a sector like agriculture accruing to the platform owner, like it has in the media space to Google and Facebook.</p><p> Basic responsibility </p><p>Tighter regulation is the obvious answer, an outcome Zuckerberg was peddling hard to avoid during media appearances this week.</p><p>He said the company had \"made mistakes\" and would double the number of staff working on security and was building technology to stamp out propaganda.</p><p>\"This was a major breach of trust, and I'm really sorry that this happened,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data.\"</p><p>That is unlikely to be enough for Facebook users or law makers, who are moving quickly to curtail the power of the large platforms, which account for seven of world's 10 most valuable companies.</p><p>\"I could be wrong but I think this is big enough and enough of the market feels like technology companies are arrogant and they want to hold them to account,\" says Turner.</p><p>That's the type of public sentiment which eventually saw cigarette companies regulated in the 1980s.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029505366</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXW-2551-DY19-C1DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1596\"/><timeReceived>04:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Websites all across the world were readjusted for these regulations. Facebook, though, seems to think it should be free to do with customer data as it wishes, but it's not okay with Ireland's Data Protection Commission. </p><p>This has left Facebook to say it may be forced to end operations in Europe if it's not allowed to transfer data around the world as it wishes.Facebook's Court Filing in DublinTo be clear, while this does concern the protection of data, it is not being called a violation of the GDPR. A preliminary order was delivered by the Irish DPC in August that would stop the transfer of data about European customers to servers in the United States. This is due to concerns about data surveillance by the U.S. government. Facebook turned around and filed a lawsuit to challenge the ban. In a sworn affidavit that was filed this week, it accused the Irish data-protection commissioner of bias and a lack of fairness, noting that similar tech companies weren't being asked to do the same. It added that this ruling would force it to abandon operations in Europe and leave 410 million Facebook and Instagram users without the services. 'It is not clear to [Facebook] how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU,' wrote Yvonne Cunnane[1], Facebook Ireland's head of data protection and associate general counsel, in a sworn affidavit.Cunnane further complains that Facebook was only given three weeks to respond to the ruling by the Irish DPC. She refers to that timeline as 'manifestly inadequate' and says the social network wasn't even contacted before the ruling. There are additional concerns about this ruling being made unilaterally by Ireland's data protection commissioner, Helen Dixon. 'The fact one person is responsible for the entire process is relevant to [Facebook's] concerns, in respect of the inadequacy of the investigative process engaged in and independence of the ultimate decision-making process,' wrote Cunnane. There is also a complaint that Facebook is the only big tech company called out, yet Cunnane complains others use similar methods to transfer data from the EU to the U.S. 'This gives rise to an apprehension that [Facebook] is not being treated equally,' Cunnane alleges. 'If [Facebook] alone is being investigated and subject to a suspension of data transfers to the U.S., this would be liable to create a serious distortion of competition.'A Facebook spokesperson cooled the language slightly, claiming, 'Facebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe.' Cunnane's court filing simply explains that 'Facebook, and many other businesses, organizations, and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services.'Fallout of Facebook's Court FilingA judge allowed this challenge of Facebook's and put a stay on the ban on data transfers, yet the DPC can challenge the decision if it chooses to. Cunnane also mentioned that 410 million in Europe use Facebook and Instagram for their freedom of expression. Additionally, the company generated \u20ac208 billion in sales for companies that use the social media site for business. The Facebook business model transfers data across the world, and that allows it to target users with pointed, specific ads. If it's not allowed to transfer data to the U.S., it will affect the company's revenue. A technology policy researcher at University College London, Michael Veale, told VICE News, 'The idea that Facebook would withdraw from the European market is absurd brinkmanship that I don't think anyone truly believes.'

Websites all across the world were readjusted for these regulations. Facebook, though, seems to think it should be free to do with customer data as it wishes, but it\u2019s not okay with Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission. This has left Facebook to say it may be forced to end operations in Europe if it\u2019s not allowed to transfer data around the world as it wishes. Facebook\u2019s Court Filing in Dublin To be clear, while this does concern the protection of data, it is not being called a violation of the GDPR. A preliminary order was delivered by the Irish DPC in August that would stop the transfer of data about European customers to servers in the United States. This is due to concerns about data surveillance by the U.S. government. Facebook turned around and filed a lawsuit to challenge the ban. In a sworn affidavit that was filed this week, it accused the Irish data-protection commissioner of bias and a lack of fairness, noting that similar tech companies weren\u2019t being asked to do the same. It added that this ruling would force it to abandon operations in Europe and leave 410 million Facebook and Instagram users without the services. \u201cIt is not clear to [Facebook] how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU,\u201d wrote Yvonne Cunnane, Facebook Ireland\u2019s head of data protection and associate general counsel, in a sworn affidavit. Cunnane further complains that Facebook was only given three weeks to respond to the ruling by the Irish DPC. She refers to that timeline as \u201cmanifestly inadequate\u201d and says the social network wasn\u2019t even contacted before the ruling. There are additional concerns about this ruling being made unilaterally by Ireland\u2019s data protection commissioner, Helen Dixon. \u201cThe fact one person is responsible for the entire process is relevant to [Facebook\u2019s] concerns, in respect of the inadequacy of the investigative process engaged in and independence of the ultimate decision-making process,\u201d wrote Cunnane. There is also a complaint that Facebook is the only big tech company called out, yet Cunnane complains others use similar methods to transfer data from the EU to the U.S. \u201cThis gives rise to an apprehension that [Facebook] is not being treated equally,\u201d Cunnane alleges. \u201cIf [Facebook] alone is being investigated and subject to a suspension of data transfers to the U.S., this would be liable to create a serious distortion of competition.\u201d A Facebook spokesperson cooled the language slightly, claiming, \u201cFacebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe.\u201d Cunnane\u2019s court filing simply explains that \u201cFacebook, and many other businesses, organizations, and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services.\u201d Fallout of Facebook\u2019s Court Filing A judge allowed this challenge of Facebook\u2019s and put a stay on the ban on data transfers, yet the DPC can challenge the decision if it chooses to. Cunnane also mentioned that 410 million in Europe use Facebook and Instagram for their freedom of expression. Additionally, the company generated \u20ac208 billion in sales for companies that use the social media site for business. The Facebook business model transfers data across the world, and that allows it to target users with pointed, specific ads. If it\u2019s not allowed to transfer data to the U.S., it will affect the company\u2019s revenue. A technology policy researcher at University College London, Michael Veale, told VICE News, \u201cThe idea that Facebook would withdraw from the European market is absurd brinkmanship that I don\u2019t think anyone truly believes.\u201d If you\u2019d rather just not deal with any of the Facebook drama, try these five Facebook alternatives.

That includes academic researchers studying mergers and market power, policy advocates pursuing new rules to rein in tech and other industries, and grassroots groups that have battled bigness on the ground. The investments could serve as an early counterweight to the millions of dollars that Facebook, Google and other big businesses, well beyond tech, spend annually to furnish research in their favor and stave off regulation.</p><p>\"Americans understand corporate power has gotten out of control,\" Hughes said, \"and a lot of [groups] are interested in organizing to push back against them.\"</p><p>The launch of the new anti-monopoly fund reflects an evolution in Hughes's personal engagement on antitrust roughly five months after he issued his first public call to break up and regulate Facebook. In an essay for The New York Times, Hughes said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's influence exceeded \"anyone else in the private sector or government,\" granting him the power to gobble up rivals, crowd out investment and stifle innovation, threatening consumers and democracy itself.</p><p>Such concerns have resonated with regulators in the United States, who have embarked on a slew of antitrust investigations targeting big tech in recent months. Nearly every state attorney general has signed on to an antitrust probe of Google, and a similarly sized state-led probe of Facebook is now under way. In Washington, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission broadly have set their sights on the two tech giants and others in the tech industry, including Amazon, while Congress considers an update to federal antitrust laws. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Hughes has played an early role in those investigations, working with well-known competition experts and former government officials to make the case to regulators that Facebook, in particular, needs to be broken up. This spring, Hughes also began speaking to potential donors about committing money toward coordinated \"anti-monopoly\" investments. The term is supposed to encompass regulatory fixes and other solutions beyond the application of federal law to break companies apart, he said.</p><p>In practice, the new $10 million fund could invest in organizations that craft or advance privacy legislation, Hughes said, or activist groups akin to those that fought against Amazon as it sought to expand its headquarters in New York City. He did not name the initial set of funding recipients but said they would be broad in nature, akin to the kind of bets that his Economic Security Project has made in its previous work around guaranteed basic income.</p><p>But Hughes said the new research, advocacy and grassroots investments also will span well beyond tech - to focus on other areas of the economy where corporate giants had wielded their dominance in damaging ways.</p><p>\"There was a sense concentration in the economy has gotten completely out of control, and we need to do something about it,\" he said. \"There have been a good number of groups working on this for some time, and some funders working on this for some time. But it felt like the right next step would be creating a fund that would be catalytic, and time bound, to invest in a cross section of groups - to include groups fighting tech but also in the agriculture and pharmaceutical spaces.\"</p><p>Researchers have found merging hospitals in major metropolitan areas can result in higher prices for admissions. State attorneys general have sued major pharmaceutical companies for conspiring to fix the price of generic drugs, running afoul of antitrust laws. Beyond health care, some experts contend the agriculture sector has faced the same troubles, resulting in big businesses that result in serious economic hardship for farmers, a new report this year found. And the financial sector long has been the target of those who feel the government is captured by the very industries it's supposed to oversee.</p><p>\"The increased awareness and interest in this issue [among] the American people as well as American lawmakers has been 20 years of growth in two years,\" said Tom Perriello, the executive director for domestic programs at the Open Society Foundation, which has committed funding. \"We need to meet that moment, meet that demand from Americans that are very concerned about this.\"</p><p>The list of initial commitments also includes the Ford Foundation, the Nathan Cummings Foundation, the Knight Foundation and others. Some, like Soros, have funded some of tech's most potent antagonists in the past, including Open Markets Institute, which has advocated for the break up of companies including Facebook and Google.</p><p>Joining them are former tech executives such as Hughes; the Hewlett Foundation, which had been established by the computer-maker's co-founder; and the Omidyar Network, established by Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay.</p><p>Anamitra Deb, a senior director at the Omidyar Network overseeing tech and antitrust work, said the roster gave them the \"credibility of insider knowledge,\" adding: \"To us it's a positive sign that people who are insiders, if you will, are now saying, 'Hang on, maybe some things have gone too far'.\"</p><p>Even some of the fund's donors acknowledged that the initial size of the fund, at $10 million, represents a small fraction of the $1.7 billion that companies and their lobbying organizations have spent already in Washington just over roughly the past six months. Hughes, however, said the goal isn't to get into an \"arms race.\"</p><p>\"There's more concentration now than 20 years ago,\" he said. \"It's our view we need to be having a conversation about what this is doing to the economy more broadly.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-f031f2a8de9447098ea8c92180bb4937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X93-80V1-DXKP-J2M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1155\"/><timeReceived>10:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0009YTF</classCode><className>OMIDYAR NETWORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
