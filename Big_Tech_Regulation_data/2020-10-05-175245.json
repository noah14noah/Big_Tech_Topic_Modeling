While the remit of the task force largely overlaps with the FTC's existing enforcement activities, the announcement signals regulators' increasing focus on the industry.The Tech Task Force, established on February 26, 2019, is a stand-alone division that draws on existing staff mdash; approximately 17 attorneys within the bureau who have experience in various technology markets, including those for online advertising, social networking, mobile operating systems and apps, and platforms. While the staff is not sufficiently robust to investigate or litigate conduct or mergers without assistance, the Task Force will coordinate with other divisions within the FTC as it weighs the need for longer-term changes. </p><p>Even if it were to include staff from other divisions on its investigation or litigation teams, the number of permanent members limits the number and complexity of the matters it can handle. In announcing the task force, FTC Chairman Joseph J. Simons said that \"it makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.\" The task force is led by Patricia Galvan, currently a deputy assistant director of the Mergers III Division, and Krisha Cerilli, currently counsel to the director of the Bureau of Competition.The FTC's announcement outlined three areas of focus: anti-competitive conduct, prospective mergers and consummated mergers, all of which already fall within the ambit of the FTC's enforcement activity. The FTC has long investigated conduct by technology companies, like Google and Facebook, and it has challenged a number of tech mergers, including the merger between CDK and Auto/Mate, two providers of dealer management systems for car dealerships, and that of DraftKings and FanDuel, the two largest daily fantasy sports websites. Even mergers that the FTC has declined to challenge have been subjected to significant scrutiny, such as the online real estate database Zillow's acquisition of Trulia. Further, federal enforcers, including the FTC, challenged three consummated tech mergers in 2017, demonstrating that the practice is far from novel.Yet populist pressure continues to encourage the FTC to enforce the antitrust laws more aggressively, particularly against the major tech companies. Both sides of the political aisle have called for increased scrutiny of the activities of so-called \"Big Tech.\" Commentators have criticized U.S. antitrust policy as being overly permissive, attributing the \"bigness\" of tech companies to merger enforcement that has been too lax and drawing attention to so-called \"killer acquisitions,\" in which companies acquire nascent companies, purportedly with the goal of heading off a challenge to their market dominance. In March 2019, presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up a number of the big tech companies, including unwinding consummated mergers to \"promote healthy competition in the market.\"Concerns over privacy have likewise led to calls to apply antitrust principles more rigorously to regulate the use of customer data. Recent split decisions among the commissioners along political party lines in Staples/Essendant and Fresenius/NxStage mdash; where Commissioners Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter issued strongly worded dissenting statements mdash; suggest that the Democratic minority will echo these calls for more vigorous enforcement and closely scrutinize the task force's progress.There are potential lessons to be learned about what could come next for the Tech Task Force from the 2002 creation of the FTC's Merger Litigation Task Force by Simons, who at the time was the director of the Bureau of Competition. Simons created the task force after the FTC struggled to win a series of challenges to hospital mergers. At the time, the FTC employed retrospective studies to assess its approach to such mergers and used the knowledge gained to hone its method for challenging such mergers. The Merger Litigation Task Force thus \"reinvigorated the [FTC]'s hospital merger review program, and also sharpened the agency's focus on merger enforcement in retail industries, particularly regarding matters involving food, beverages, and supermarkets,\" according to the February 26, 2019, FTC press release announcing the Tech Task Force. Perhaps most interestingly, the Merger Litigation Task Force also led to the creation of Mergers IV, the FTC division dedicated to mergers involving hospitals, consumer goods, supermarkets, funeral homes and retail outlets. While the FTC has made no such announcement, the creation of a permanent technology division is a real possibility.Whether the Tech Task Force leads enforcers to impose materially stricter standards on tech companies is far less clear. The FTC shares oversight responsibility with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), including in matters involving technology and the digital economy, making the DOJ's approach to tech equally important. DOJ Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Andrew C. Finch has said that he is \"skeptical of the drastic calls for breaking up firms or turning tech platforms into regulated utilities,\" and the DOJ is unlikely to cede tech enforcement to the FTC. Both agencies share jurisdiction over conduct in many tech industries, but the clearance agreement between them allows one agency to take the lead on an investigation. Accordingly, the FTC could be more aggressive on those matters over which it takes the lead. Regardless of what cases the federal agencies would like to bring, they still have to apply the existing legal standards and convince a court to rule in their favor.Nevertheless, the task force likely will have an impact in the years to come, as its creation increases the scrutiny of how technology companies conduct their business and negotiate deals, and may result in the FTC staff learning new and more focused methods for evaluating the potential competitive effects of tech conduct and mergers.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Federal regulators said Wednesday they are fining Facebook $5 billion for privacy violations and instituting new oversight and restrictions on its business.</p><p>SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook was ordered Wednesday to create new layers of oversight for its collection and handling of users' data by the Federal Trade Commission, as the agency detailed a privacy settlement with the social network that became a referendum on how aggressive US regulators would be against big tech companies.</p><p>Under the agreement, the FTC mandated that the Silicon Valley company add new positions and practices to increase the transparency and accountability of how it treats people's information. The agency also formally imposed a record $5 billion fine against Facebook for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal data.</p><p>Yet the measures, which the FTC's commissioners approved in a 3-2 vote this month, drew sharp criticism for not going far enough in curbing the data habits of the world's largest social media company. Republican and Democratic lawmakers pilloried the settlement as a drop in the bucket for Facebook and said the FTC failed to limit a core practice that has repeatedly raised privacy questions: the company's gathering, sharing, and use of people's personal information.</p><p>That puts US regulators in a difficult position as authorities around the world have stepped up their actions to crimp the power of tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. Over the past few years, the US has been seen as a lesser force in tech regulation, especially compared with European officials who have imposed a series of large penalties against the tech giants.</p><p>The FTC agreement \"utterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way,\" said Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is pushing for new federal privacy laws, said the settlement would not deter Facebook from further privacy violations.</p><p>Within the FTC, the settlement was divisive, with the agency's three Republican commissioners voting to approve the deal while the two Democratic commissioners dissented. The agreement stopped short of more punitive measures that the FTC had previously discussed against Facebook, including holding chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally liable for missteps and potentially taking the company to court. The fine was also a fraction of Facebook's $56 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>The agency also agreed the settlement would shield Facebook from known claims of violations before June 12, 2019, essentially giving the company a pass on its past. And it provided immunity to Facebook officers and directors.</p><p>In a statement, the FTC's Republican commissioners said the agreement \"will provide significant deterrence not just to Facebook, but to every other company that collects or uses consumer data.\" The FTC's two Democratic commissioners disagreed. \"I fear it leaves the American public vulnerable,\" said Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner.</p><p>Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post that the agreement would \"reduce the number of mistakes we make and help us deliver stronger privacy protections for everyone.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-c4348a9a-ae52-11e9-872b-e97458d81249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN5-CRV1-JC2G-C2KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>LL0009VDU</classCode><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Hemli[1] Jacqueline R. Java[2] Bracewell LLP[3] Update[4] In an unprecedented move further expanding its ongoing investigation of large technology companies, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) hasordered[5]Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Googleto provide details about their acquisitions during the past 10 years that werenot reportable to U.S. antitrust agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act. Invoking its authority under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, which authorizes the FTC to conduct widespread studies that do not have a specific law enforcement purpose, the Special Orders issued to these five companies on February 11, 2020, require them to provide a broad array of information and documents on the terms, scope, structure, and purpose of those prior acquisitions. The probe will likely involve hundreds of transactions that previously escaped antitrust review because they fell below the HSR Act's dollar-value thresholds or were otherwise exempt from filing.1[6]The Special Orders require each recipient to provide information similar to that requested in an HSR filing. </p><p>The orders also compel the firms to provide details regarding their corporate acquisition strategies, voting and board appointment arrangements, agreements to hire key personnel, and non-compete arrangements. Additionally, the companies are required to provide information related to post-acquisition product development and pricing, including whether and how acquired assets were integrated and how acquired data has been handled.Through the probe, the FTC seeks toenhance its understanding of acquisitions in technology marketsand to examine whether the large tech companies' acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors have harmed consumers or otherwise hurt competition by discouraging innovation or investment. The investigation will cover not only full-fledged takeovers of smaller companies, but also arrangements involving minority investments, licensing agreements, and data acquisitions. According to FTC Chairman Joe Simons, '[t]his initiative will enable the Commission to take a closer look at acquisitions in this important sector, and also to evaluate whether the federal agencies are getting adequate notice of transactions that might harm competition.'This FTC probe could have significant ramifications for antitrust review of mergers. At a micro level, FTC officials acknowledged that the study could lead antitrust regulators to seek to unwind or modify previously consummated transactions they deem anticompetitive. More broadly, the FTC intends that this probe will help it analyze whether additional transactions should be subject to premerger notification requirements.Also notable was that two of the five FTC Commissioners (from different political parties), Christine S. Wilson (R) and Rohit Chopra (D), issued ajoint statement[7]supporting the issuance of the Special Orders but also questioning the sufficiency of the HSR notification process generally and calling for similar studies of smaller non-HSR reportable deals across other industries, beginning with healthcare.In their statement, the Commissioners identify several healthcare markets, including pharmaceuticals, hospitals, and dialysis facilities, that have seen a pattern of consolidation through acquisitions, many of which fall below the HSR thresholds.No matter what the outcome of this study, the potential for further such industry-wide probes, coupled with the increasingly frequent review of consummated mergers by the antitrust agencies in recent years, serves as an important reminder to companies and their counsel to assess the antitrust risk associated with transactions, irrespective of deal size. 1Pursuant to the HSR Act, the federal antitrust agencies (the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice) have a statutory right to review mergers, acquisitionsand joint ventures over a certain size before they are consummated. 2020 Bracewell LLP [ 1]:

Invoking its authority under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, which authorizes the FTC to conduct widespread studies that do not have a specific law enforcement purpose, the Special Orders issued to these five companies on February 11, 2020, require them to provide a broad array of information and documents on the terms, scope, structure, and purpose of those prior acquisitions. The probe will likely involve hundreds of transactions that previously escaped antitrust review because they fell below the HSR Act's dollar-value thresholds or were otherwise exempt from filing.1The Special Orders require each recipient to provide information similar to that requested in an HSR filing. </p><p>The orders also compel the firms to provide details regarding their corporate acquisition strategies, voting and board appointment arrangements, agreements to hire key personnel, and non-compete arrangements. Additionally, the companies are required to provide information related to post-acquisition product development and pricing, including whether and how acquired assets were integrated and how acquired data has been handled.Through the probe, the FTC seeks to enhance its understanding of acquisitions in technology markets and to examine whether the large tech companies' acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors have harmed consumers or otherwise hurt competition by discouraging innovation or investment. The investigation will cover not only full-fledged takeovers of smaller companies, but also arrangements involving minority investments, licensing agreements, and data acquisitions. According to FTC Chairman Joe Simons, '[t]his initiative will enable the Commission to take a closer look at acquisitions in this important sector, and also to evaluate whether the federal agencies are getting adequate notice of transactions that might harm competition.'This FTC probe could have significant ramifications for antitrust review of mergers. At a micro level, FTC officials acknowledged that the study could lead antitrust regulators to seek to unwind or modify previously consummated transactions they deem anticompetitive. More broadly, the FTC intends that this probe will help it analyze whether additional transactions should be subject to premerger notification requirements.Also notable was that two of the five FTC Commissioners (from different political parties), Christine S. Wilson (R) and Rohit Chopra (D), issued a joint statement[2] supporting the issuance of the Special Orders but also questioning the sufficiency of the HSR notification process generally and calling for similar studies of smaller non-HSR reportable deals across other industries, beginning with healthcare. In their statement, the Commissioners identify several healthcare markets, including pharmaceuticals, hospitals, and dialysis facilities, that have seen a pattern of consolidation through acquisitions, many of which fall below the HSR thresholds.No matter what the outcome of this study, the potential for further such industry-wide probes, coupled with the increasingly frequent review of consummated mergers by the antitrust agencies in recent years, serves as an important reminder to companies and their counsel to assess the antitrust risk associated with transactions, irrespective of deal size. 1 Pursuant to the HSR Act, the federal antitrust agencies (the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice) have a statutory right to review mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures over a certain size before they are consummated.

The Federal Trade Commission announced [1]it plans to examine past acquisitions from Microsoft  MSFT, -2.26%[2], Google parent company Alphabet Inc.  GOOGL, +0.09%[3] GOOG, +0.01%[4], Apple Inc.</p><p> AAPL, -0.60%[5], Amazon.com Inc.  AMZN, +0.79%[6], and Facebook Inc.  FB, -2.76%[7] The agency wants information from the five companies, which have a market value of more than $5 trillion, on their corporate purchases dating back to the beginning of 2010 that did not undergo scrutiny from the federal government under the Hart-Scott-Rodino, or HSR, Act.  For more: Expect Big Tech antitrust talk to continue in 2020, but action is far from guaranteed[8]  In a conference call with reporters, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons deemed the request a study not related to law enforcement actions but an attempt to better understand the flood of transactions that are not reportable under HSR. He said there is no financial threshold for the size of the horizontal and vertical deals it plans to look at. The request grew out of the FTC's hearing last year on transaction activity among tech companies, he added. He said the FTC would focus on deals of companies that could have potentially developed into larger businesses, and moves by tech giants that increased their influence in adjacent markets. Simons said the number of deals under scrutiny is in the 'hundreds,' and could lead to the 'unwinding' of some of the mergers.  'It is important to keep tech markets open and competitive,' Simons said on the conference call. See also: Four reasons why antitrust actions will likely fail to break up Big Tech[9]  'The orders will help the FTC deepen its understanding of large technology firms' acquisition activity, including how these firms report their transactions to the federal antitrust agencies, and whether large tech companies are making potentially anticompetitive acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors that fall below HSR filing thresholds and therefore do not need to be reported to the antitrust agencies,' the agency said in its announcement of the investigation[10]. The FTC's probe intensifies the heat on Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook, all of which have been under the piercing eyes of the federal government as well as European authorities for their competitive tactics, as they cement dominant market positions and delve into new areas of business. Microsoft, however, had escaped any scrutiny after surviving its own antitrust fight with the government in the days of the dot-com boom and bust[11]. The antitrust suspects: Facebook and Apple appear to be most at risk[12]  The companies' larger acquisitions are typically approved by the FTC before they close. Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, Google's purchases of YouTube and DoubleClick, and Amazon's merger with Whole Foods all received clearance from the FTC before closing.  However, Big Tech makes myriad smaller deals every year that are never announced and do not go through regulatory channels. For instance, Google closed on a $2.4 billion acquisition of software company Looker[13] in 2019 and agreed to purchase Fitbit for $2.1 billion[14] \u2014 a deal that is still under review \u2014 but also spent $1 billion to acquire other companies that the company does not name in its annual filing. Apple largely avoids big-name acquisitions, but has spent more than $1.6 billion in the past three fiscal years on business acquisitions, according to its annual filing, and Chief Executive Tim Cook has said that Apple is buying a smaller company about every two to three weeks on average[15]. Shares in all five companies dipped in intraday trading immediately following the announcement. None of the five companies immediately responded to email messages seeking comment. A Microsoft spokesman late Tuesday said. 'We look forward to working with the FTC to answer their questions.'The post FTC to investigate 'hundreds' of past acquisitions made by Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook[16] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[17].

The rise in technology has made personal information of consumers more vulnerable than ever before. Because of this, the FTC has started to bring more data security and privacy cases against big tech companies. </p><p>Since the U.S. does not have a comprehensive federal privacy law or independent agency solely committed to privacy violations, enforcement falls under the FTC's purview. For years, many privacy advocates have claimed that the FTC does not issue strong enough penalties against big tech companies that fail to adequately safeguard consumer data. Now that more people are talking about data privacy issues and recent data breaches, we see a trend emerging of the FTC issuing larger fines and calling for stricter privacy standards. Two noteworthy FTC investigations recently made headlines due to the fines involved.Musical.ly CaseIn February 2019, the Department of Justice filed a complaint for the FTC against a popular social media music platform called Musical.ly (now known as TikTok). This organization operates an app that many children under the age of 13 have used for years. Features of the app included the ability to share videos and communicate directly with users. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA') requires that organizations get parental consent before obtaining, using, or disclosing any personal information from children under 13. The FTC investigation discovered that the app required users to provide identifying factors (such as an email address, phone number, name, and picture) in order to register. Privacy settings were automatically set to public. If the user changed to private mode, their photo and biography were still published to the public and other users could send direct messages to private users even if they did not follow their account. The complaint alleged that Musical.ly violated COPPA in a number of ways, such as failing to obtain the age of their users, allowing users under 13 to create accounts and use the app without parental consent, and failure to notify parents about collecting their children's data. The company knew that children were using the app because many parents contacted Musical.ly to complain. There were also reports of adults using the app to attempt contact with children. As a settlement, the FTC issued a record-setting fine against Musical.ly in the amount of $5.7 million only weeks after filing the complaint, which is the largest fine to date in a COPPA case. The FTC also ordered the company to comply with COPPA, periodically submit compliance reports, and delete old content published by users under 13. While they did change their policies in July 2017 to require collection of age data and deny access to those under 13, they failed to delete old data violating COPPA prior to the policy change. Since the order, TikTok has expressed willingness to comply with the law and fix past mistakes. On February 27, two FTC commissioners issued a statement on this matter, commenting: 'The FTC's action to crack down on the privacy practices of Musical.ly, now known as TikTok, is a major milestone for our COPPA enforcement program. Agency staff uncovered disturbing practices, including collecting and exposing the location and other sensitive data of young children. In our view, these practices reflected the company's willingness to pursue growth even at the expense of endangering childrenFTC investigations typically focus on individual accountability only in certain circumstances\u2014and the effect has been that individuals at large companies have often avoided scrutiny. We should move away from this approach. Executives of big companies who call the shots as companies break the law should be held accountableas we continue to pursue violations of law, we should prioritize uncovering the role of corporate officers and directors and hold accountable everyone who broke the law.' As such, this case should definitely be an eye opener to organizations that offer membership to children. If they fail to comply with the law, even larger penalties than this could follow.Facebook InvestigationFacebook is not a new player in the realm of data privacy issues. In March 2018, the FTC began to investigate Facebook's privacy measures and potential violation of a previous order the agency issued in 2011. This order outlined ways to improve Facebook's privacy practices, such as transparency regarding sharing user data with third-parties. While Facebook has had several questionable privacy practices over the past few years, the major trigger for the 2018 investigation was Facebook's involvement with Cambridge Analytica. This political consultancy improperly obtained access to millions of Facebook users' data. Facebook has not admitted fault for this incident to date. The FTC and Facebook have been in settlement discussions regarding this issue for over a year now. While neither has divulged any specific details of the negotiations, there is talk that the FTC wants to impose a multi-billion dollar fine. The largest fine to date for a privacy issue is $22.5 million against Google in 2012. A settlement would also likely include stricter privacy initiatives and compliance monitoring. The fact that these negotiations have taken over a year now has troubled many people since Facebook users continue to be at risk every day that passes without enforcing stricter privacy policies. Facebook's current struggles go beyond the FTC, as they are also under investigation for violating the EU's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'). In turn, privacy advocates and lawmakers are calling for much more intervention into Facebook's privacy practices than a simple fine. Some ideas include cracking down on privacy requirements, appointing an independent director to solely represent user privacy interests, prohibiting integration of other business operations, imposing individual liability for corporate officers, and even dismantling the company. Regardless, reaching a settlement with the FTC would help boost Facebook's reputation and show it is committed to maintaining user privacy. If the FTC does impose a multi-billion dollar fine and some other strict requirements, this will likely spark a change in the way big tech companies handle privacy matters. Doing so might also help support the recent push for a federal privacy law. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg even recently issued a public statement agreeing that the government needs to regulate harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data portability. Zuckerberg suggested modeling a privacy initiative after the GDPR. For now, the public just needs to wait and see what comes of the settlement negotiations and any changes in the realm of social media privacy as a result. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411155734535073025176900212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2P-M251-JCMN-Y0GX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><timeReceived>7:55 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has taken aim at edge providers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">T</emphasis>here has been a lot of talk inside the Beltway about whether tech giants have gotten to near monopoly status by anti-competitively buying up competitors in their infancy before they can trigger red flags with antitrust regulators, then reaping the fruits of never-were competitors' innovations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the Federal Trade Commission is doing something about getting to the bottom of that concern, though it is facing a challenge from a critic of edge providers trying to recraft the FTC as a digital-focused investigative arm - but one no longer independent from the Trump cabinet.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), arguably the leading critic of tech companies in Congress, says overhauling the FTC and merging it into the Justice Department is the best approach to regulating edge providers.</p><p>He also said the government doesn't need to create a new \"unaccountable bureaucracy\" to oversee Big Tech, as some have suggested Congress should do. FTC chairman Joseph Simons agreed, saying that the FTC, with added resources and authority, is the right agency for the job.</p><p>\"The FTC isn't working,\" Hawley said in announcing his new campaign. \"It wastes time in turf wars with the DOJ, nobody is accountable for decisions, and it lacks the 'teeth' to get after Big Tech's rampant abuses. Congress needs to do something about it.\"</p><p>The senator would also get the FTC out of the merger review business, leaving that duty to the DOJ (see box).</p><p>Almost everyone, including the head of the FTC, agrees that the agency could use more tools in its tech reg toolkit, including more money and staff. That's particularly true now that it has the principal oversight of broadband privacy and access.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bringing FTC to Justice</emphasis></p><p>Hawley wants to help by putting the FTC under Justice and making it accountable to that agency, which would be a big change but would provide more market analysis and enforcement muscle.</p><p>Currently, the agency must sue companies to enforce its policies, rather than regulate compliance. Hawley says that means it lacks the \"teeth\" to go after what he calls tech's \"rampant abuses.\"</p><p>Hawley's call for an overhaul came the same day the commission said it would start flexing what muscle it has.</p><p>It sent \"special order\" information requests to five of the biggest tech players - Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft - seeking information and documents to help it review the \"terms, scope, structure, and purpose of transactions that each company consummated between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2019.\"</p><p>The Trump administration has signaled it would take a retrospective look at some of the deals that may have passed under its antitrust radar as Big Tech got bigger, just to make sure they did not build those collective trillion-dollar market caps via anticompetitive means.</p><p>Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the DOJ's antitrust chief, has said that big, even to the extent of being a natural monopoly, isn't necessarily bad. But he has conceded the market needs a fresh look.</p><p>\"One of the FTC's biggest problems is that Congress has cut its funding over the decades, leaving the agency under-resourced to do its job,\" Joshua Stager, senior counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute, said. \"Senator Hawley's proposal does not acknowledge this reality, nor does he acknowledge that his own institution bears at least some blame for starving the agency of resources. It is difficult to take this proposal seriously when it ignores such a core problem.\"</p><p>Argued Hawley: \"The reality is the FTC is not putting even its current resources to effective use because the FTC is poorly designed.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCHNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCHNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8M-G5R1-DY5H-11WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241792</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Multichannel News</publicationName><volume>Vol. XLI</volume><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A renewed focus on mergers and acquisitions is signaling to tech giants that such strategic moves are soon going to be more trouble than worth.

The FTC said it requested information about hundreds of smaller deals made by the five tech companies over the past decade that weren't required to be reported to regulators by law and could provide insights into antitrust abuses. Facebook, Google and others have scooped up dozens of smaller tech firms over the years, many of them for less than $100 million. </p><p>\"If during this study we see transactions that were problematic, all our options are on the table and it is conceivable we can initiate enforcement action with those deals,\" Joseph J. Simons, the FTC chairman, said in a call with reporters. He added that the orders for information were separate from the FTC's ongoing antitrust investigations into big tech companies, but could inform the inquiries. The actions escalate the scrutiny in Washington of the nation's largest technology companies. The Justice Department, Congress and state attorneys generals are also examining Apple, Amazon and others to probe whether they acted in an anticompetitive manner in many different areas. Lawmakers have united around the issue, in a rare show of bipartisanship. In examining the smaller deals, the FTC signaled it was looking specifically into a tech industry practice, known as \"killer acquisitions,\" that smaller rivals have said was used to choke off competition. Under that strategy, the large tech companies purchase a nascent competitor to protect their dominance and prevent the smaller company from growing into a bigger threat. The FTC has previously made similar demands for information from the pharmaceutical and retail industries to explore how companies in those sectors used pricing and ad strategies, for example, to harm consumers. But the request for information about past tech mergers was the first by the agency for Silicon Valley giants. Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. The companies could file motions to quash the FTC's requests.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN75871612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6D-YF31-JC8S-D34B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"376\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Microsoft did not immediately respond. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The inquiry announced Tuesday differs from a traditional investigation: Using what's known as its 6(b) authority, the FTC can embark on wide-ranging reviews of entire industries without necessarily bringing a law-enforcement action. The agency in the past has invoked such powers to delve deep into drug prices, alcohol ads and gas gouging, experts said, often ushering about major changes in the markets and companies it studies.</p><p>With Big Tech, the FTC is particularly interested in the smaller startups purchased by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Such deals typically aren't large enough to require companies under law to report them to agencies such as the FTC, which would then review them for competition concerns. The document demands sent to the five tech giants require them to demystify these transactions, explaining their acquisition strategies and the ways they ingested startups - and the data they amassed - into their own services.</p><p>\"The acquisition practices of the leading tech companies long have been the subject of tremendous scrutiny, and this will be an opportunity to assemble the best body of data on how many of these deals took place and what their competitive significance was,\" said William Kovacic, a top professor at George Washington University's law school who previously served on the FTC.</p><p>\"It can lead you either to go to the Congress and say, 'We need change in the law,' and it can guide your own law enforcement decision-making.\"</p><p>The FTC's heightened interest in Big Tech - and the mergers that helped enhance tech giants' footprints - comes at a moment when regulators around the country are intensifying their scrutiny of an industry that long had avoided it. Amazon, Facebook and Google each are facing a raft of investigations by state and federal authorities, including the FTC, which has focused in particular on the social networking giant's past acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>The Justice Department also has embarked on a wide-ranging probe of search, social networking and e-commerce, exploring dominant companies in those industries. That probe will take companies to San Francisco this week, as regulators seek to learn the extent to which tech giants such as Facebook and Google have crowded out investment in new companies that might challenge them.</p><p>Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have embarked on their own review of the industry, exploring whether federal antitrust law needs to be updated for the digital age. Some members of Congress who long have questioned Silicon Valley's corporate footprint praised the FTC, urging it to use the data it gathers to take aim at Big Tech.</p><p>\"While I welcome this announcement, it's no substitute for action,\" Sen.

Simons said Tuesday, later adding that the range of actions the agency could take includes \"unwinding\" anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet, which owns Google, declined to comment. Microsoft did not immediately respond. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The inquiry announced Tuesday differs from a traditional investigation: Using what's known as its 6(b) authority, the FTC can embark on wide-ranging reviews of entire industries without necessarily bringing a law-enforcement action. The agency in the past has invoked such powers to delve deep into drug prices, alcohol ads and gas gouging, experts said, often ushering about major changes in the markets and companies it studies.</p><p>With Big Tech, the FTC is particularly interested in the smaller start-ups purchased by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google's parent company and Microsoft. Such deals typically aren't large enough to require companies under law to report them to agencies such as the FTC, which would then review them for competition concerns. The document demands sent to the five tech giants require them to demystify these transactions, explaining their acquisition strategies and the ways they ingested start-ups - and the data they amassed - into their own services.</p><p>\"The acquisition practices of the leading tech companies long have been the subject of tremendous scrutiny, and this will be an opportunity to assemble the best body of data on how many of these deals took place and what their competitive significance was,\" said William Kovacic, a top professor at George Washington University's law school who previously served on the FTC.</p><p>\"It can lead you either to go to the Congress and say, 'We need change in the law,' and it can guide your own law enforcement decision-making.\"</p><p>The FTC's heightened interest in Big Tech - and the mergers that helped enhance tech giants' footprints - comes at a moment when regulators around the country are intensifying their scrutiny of an industry that long had avoided it. Amazon, Facebook and Google each are facing a raft of investigations by state and federal authorities, including the FTC, which has focused in particular on the social networking giant's past acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>The Justice Department also has embarked on a wide-ranging probe of search engines, social networking and e-commerce, exploring dominant companies in those industries. That probe will take companies to San Francisco this week, as regulators seek to learn the extent to which tech giants such as Facebook and Google have crowded out investment in new companies that might challenge them.</p><p>Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have embarked on their own review of the industry, exploring whether federal antitrust law needs to be updated for the digital age. Some members of Congress who long have questioned Silicon Valley's corporate footprint praised the FTC, urging it to use the data it gathers to take aim at Big Tech.</p><p>\"While I welcome this announcement, it's no substitute for action,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement. \"The FTC must demonstrate a willingness to forcefully stand up to Big Tech by scrutinizing every deal and taking vigorous action to stop the dangerous and destructive consolidation in the tech industry.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-5c60f83e2fb245379b317826000abe9d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y63-9RN1-JB4M-V09P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><timeReceived>5:27 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

These companies will have to provide information such as the terms, scope, structure, and purpose of such transactions made between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019. Two FTC commissioners wanted to scope expanded to Privacy and Data Security as well. More on that below.<br/><br/>The companies will also have to reveal information related to post-acquisition product development and pricing, including how acquired assets were integrated and how the acquired data was used. We have reached out to Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft for comment, and will update the story when they reply. Amazon declined to comment.</p><p>What is the HSR Act? The HSR Act requires companies to file pre-merger notifications with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department for certain acquisitions. However, companies are not required to report acquisitions less than $50 million.<br/><br/>FTC's objectives: With this, the agency aims to asses whether these companies made potentially anticompetitive acquisitions of nascent or potential companies, and examine trends in acquisitions and the structure of deals. It also wants to deepen its understanding of how big tech companies report their transactions to federal antitrust agencies, and learn how small firms perform once they are acquired. FTC said that this exercise will help it in deciding whether smaller transactions should be subject to pre-merger notification requirements under the HSR Act.</p><p>* It is worth mentioning that this study is part of a follow-up from the FTC's 2018 'Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century,' held during the fall 2018 - spring 2019.</p><p>* The hearings examined (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/hearings-competition-consumer-protection\">https://www.ftc.gov/policy/hearings-competition-consumer-protection</url>) whether broad-based changes in the economy, evolving business practices, new technologies, or international developments might require adjustments to competition and consumer protection law, enforcement priorities, and policy.</p><p>What the tech companies will have to do: As part of the exercise, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Apple will have to provide information similar to that requested on the HSR notification and report form. Additionally, documents related to corporate acquisition strategies, voting and board appointment agreements, agreements to hire key personnel from other companies and post-employment agreements not to compete with the company, will also have to be submitted.<br/><br/>Why this matters: Acquisitions involving a large sum of money, such as Facebook buying WhatsApp and Instagram, are reported by the companies, and are thus, open to regulatory scrutiny. However, that is isn't always the case with smaller acquisitions, which often go unreported: Apple's CEO Tim Cook last year claimed that the company acquires a company every two to three weeks, and often doesn't announce these deals because these are usually \"small companies\" and Apple is \"primarily looking for talent and intellectual property\".<br/><br/>FTC Commissioners wanted scope expanded to Privacy and Data Security</p><p>Following FTC's announcement, Commissioners Christine S. Wilson and Rohit Chopra urged the agency to also explore consumer protection issues arising from the privacy and data security practices of technology companies, including social media platforms.</p><p>* The FTC should also study how content curation and targeted advertising practices impact data collection, use and sharing, and look into how the monetisation of data helps these causes, the Commissioners recommended. They also said that the agency should launch a similar examination of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry next.</p><p>* In a series of tweets (<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/chopraftc/status/1227289728283705344?s=09\">https://twitter.com/chopraftc/status/1227289728283705344?s=09</url>), Commissioner Chopra said that several companies get big by \"swallowing and shutting down potential threats,\" and often, these acquisitions are \"all about big data\". He said that neither did Google invent YouTube nor did Facebook invent Instagram. The FTC review will \"provide clarity on why boardrooms are shelling out billions for our personal data,\" he added.</p><p>Big Tech is being probed for violating anti-trust laws in the US:</p><p>* In July 2019, The US' Justice Department opened (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/07/223-big-tech-faces-anti-trust-probe-from-us-justice-department/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/07/223-big-tech-faces-anti-trust-probe-from-us-justice-department/</url>) a broad investigation of \"market-leading\" online platforms to review if they engage in practices that reduce competition, stifle innovation or harm consumers.</p><p>* In June 2019, Justice Department was granted authority to investigate (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650861/apple-department-of-justice-antitrust-authority-facebook-google-amazon-ftc-investigations\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650861/apple-department-of-justice-antitrust-authority-facebook-google-amazon-ftc-investigations</url>) Apple for potential antitrust violations.</p><p>* In May 2019, reports came out claiming that an antitrust investigation (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18648052/google-us-justice-department-doj-investigation-antitrust-search\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18648052/google-us-justice-department-doj-investigation-antitrust-search</url>) of Google from the US Department of Justice was imminent because of the company's search business.</p><p>* At US' Attorney General Barr's confirmation hearing (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184363/trump-attorney-general-william-barr-big-tech-privacy-antitrust\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18184363/trump-attorney-general-william-barr-big-tech-privacy-antitrust</url>) in January 2019, he told Senators that the Justice Department should take a harder look at whether companies like Google and Amazon were abusing their market dominance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0051683986</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6G-F1B1-JB5M-W4J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Simons wouldn't address specific cases during the first oversight hearing with all five new commissioners before the Senate Consumer Protection Subcommittee (see 1811230021). Hours earlier Tuesday, Facebook also faced heat at a multicountry hearing in U.K.'s House of Commons (see 1811270014).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., became the latest lawmaker to announce work on a privacy bill (see 1811140053). She told us she hasn't lined up a Republican partner but is working on the draft now, before announcing her bill at the hearing. Ranking member Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who previously introduced a bill with Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said for his additional privacy bill, he's working with Chairman Jerry Moran, R-Kan.</p><p>\"I'm anxious to see what [the FTC's] game plan is as it relates to privacy,\" Moran told us before the hearing. \"Everything I know to date tells me the FTC is working well together.\" Outgoing Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters he's \"anxious to engage in that discussion, and hopefully there will be some ideas put forward on which they can agree.\"</p><p>Moran and Blumenthal pressed Simons for a timeline on the Facebook probe. Blumenthal said the FTC has \"fallen short on confronting pressing challenges, sometimes because the commission lacks the sufficient tools, but too often the problem seems to be a lack of will.\" Congress is fed up with big tech telling Americans to trust us, he added. Simons told Blumenthal the FTC's goal is to turn around his opinion about enforcement efforts.</p><p>Asked if the agency will publicize results of the Facebook probe when it concludes, Simons said, \"I would think so.\" He repeated his call for privacy legislation to grant the agency civil penalty authority, rulemaking authority and jurisdiction over nonprofits and common carriers. His Democratic colleagues have supported that call, and now the newest commissioner, Christine Wilson, said she's on board. Commissioner Noah Phillips was the only member to hesitate on civil penalties, saying such authority can chill conduct that benefits consumers. All five commissioners said they support Congress repealing the common-carrier exemption.</p><p>Democratic Commissioners Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said the agency lacks resources needed to carry out enforcement responsibilities. Cities expand, and they need more cops, and the FTC is the same, Chopra said. Everyone tells Congress they could use more resources, Moran said, but this situation feels real, saying he sympathizes with Chopra's comment.</p><p>The FTC needs more resources as the U.S. economy is becoming more \"digitized and complex,\" said outgoing Senate Commerce ranking member Bill Nelson, D-Fla. The agency's 1,000 employees can do only so much to police a $19 trillion economy, he added.</p><p>The agency should always be willing to litigate even the biggest companies with legions of lawyers, lobbyists and public relations experts, Chopra said. Simons said the commission could use more resources for litigation, since that staff is \"almost killing itself,\" and within the Economics Bureau and Office of Technology Research and Investigation. The agency works nimbly and efficiently, though, Phillips noted. He called privacy a nebulous concept and warned against new rules that will have tradeoffs for consumers and competition. He cited the EU's general data protection regulation's impact on innovation.</p><p>The GDPR is a \"natural experiment for us to take benefit of\" and learn from, Simons told reporters. \"Is it having an impact on competition? Is it entrenching some of the digital platforms? Is it causing advertising to shift toward the big platforms like Google? Things like that. We're studying that closely.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TV4-R451-DYRJ-01WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 28, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Commissioner Noah Phillips was the only member to hesitate on civil penalties, saying such authority can chill conduct that benefits consumers. All five commissioners said they support Congress repealing the common-carrier exemption.</p><p>Democratic Commissioners Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said the agency lacks resources needed to carry out enforcement responsibilities. Cities expand, and they need more cops, and the FTC is the same, Chopra said. Everyone tells Congress they could use more resources, Moran said, but this situation feels real, saying he sympathizes with Chopra's comment.</p><p>The FTC needs more resources as the U.S. economy is becoming more \"digitized and complex,\" said outgoing Senate Commerce ranking member Bill Nelson, D-Fla. The agency's 1,000 employees can do only so much to police a $19 trillion economy, he added.</p><p>The agency should always be willing to litigate even the biggest companies with legions of lawyers, lobbyists and public relations experts, Chopra said. Simons said the commission could use more resources for litigation, since that staff is \"almost killing itself,\" and within the Economics Bureau and Office of Technology Research and Investigation. The agency works nimbly and efficiently, though, Phillips noted. He called privacy a nebulous concept and warned against new rules that will have tradeoffs for consumers and competition. He cited the EU's general data protection regulation's impact on innovation.</p><p>The GDPR is a \"natural experiment for us to take benefit of\" and learn from, Simons told reporters. \"Is it having an impact on competition? Is it entrenching some of the digital platforms? Is it causing advertising to shift toward the big platforms like Google? Things like that. We're studying that closely.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONSED-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONSED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TV4-R871-JC8G-91S8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Consumer Electronics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 28, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Yet even judged by the standards of most of his peers, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Satya_Nadella\"> Mr Nadella</url> stands out.</p><p>By the end of November, the total return generated for Microsoft shareholders during his near-six year tenure passed $1tn. Contrast that with the moment when he took over as only the third CEO in Microsoft\u2019s history, and the software company looked like it might be on the fast track to technological irrelevance.</p><p>This stunning exercise in wealth creation has occurred at a time when the purpose and power of large companies has come under more scrutiny than at any time in a century. The single-minded pursuit of shareholder value is in question, and politicians and regulators are showing a new appetite for challenging the dominant companies of the age \u2014 particularly in tech.</p><p>So it is notable that Mr Nadella has put Microsoft back at the top of the tech heap without attracting the resentment and anxiety provoked by some other tech leaders \u2014 or, for that matter, Microsoft\u2019s own former self. The software company was once considered to be the model of the corporate bully, using its monopoly over PC software to hold sway over the tech world.</p><p>The equanimity that has accompanied its recent rise is a testament to the new purpose at the heart of the company, as well as a corporate culture that reflects the personal qualities of a chief executive more given to humility than the intellectual arrogance the company was once known for.</p><p>It is still far too early to judge the impact of the new Microsoft that Mr Nadella has been building. With control of one of the handful of cloud computing platforms that stand to dominate tech\u2019s next phase, it is likely to wield significant influence over the future of business and society, whether for good or ill.</p><p>Mr Nadella himself is well aware of the risks, and claims to have set parameters for his company that will ensure that its impact on the world is benign. At a time when the reputation of the tech industry is moving in inverse proportion to its power, he is also keen to distance himself from the rest of the pack.</p><p>\u201cThere is no such thing as Big Tech any more,\u201d he declares, a reference to what he claims are key differences in business model between the leading tech companies that have put them on diverging paths. Proving that Microsoft has truly changed its ways and become a new type of tech giant will be the ultimate test.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One mark of Mr Nadella\u2019s success</emphasis> in 2019 has been how seldom his company has been in the headlines. With a focus on selling technology to businesses more than consumers, it operates largely behind the scenes, though it does reach consumers through the Bing search engine and email service, the Xbox games console and tailored versions of its PC software.</p><p>There are still plenty of controversies to navigate, from the company\u2019s tussles with the US government over access to personal data hosted on its servers, to the housing shortages and other growing pains caused by its expansion in the greater Seattle area. Early in the year, it set aside $500m to support more affordable housing in its home region, pre-empting similar moves by other Big Tech companies.</p><p>Wall Street\u2019s growing confidence in the Nadella revival at Microsoft brought a 50 per cent advance in its share price over the course of 2019, nearly twice the increase in the wider stock market. That took its market capitalisation past $1tn for the first time, and a fifth of the way to a second trillion.</p><p>By mid-December, the increase in value on Mr Nadella\u2019s watch had stretched to $850bn. Add in the $150bn of stock buybacks and dividends paid out over the same period, and the total shareholder returns generated under his tenure now reach into 13 digits.</p><p>That is still not as much as Tim Cook, his counterpart at Apple who was FT Person of the Year in 2014, who has clocked up $1.27tn in shareholder value in eight years (reflecting an $870bn advance in Apple\u2019s stock market value over that period, along with nearly $400bn in buybacks and dividends). But while Mr Cook has proved himself the operational genius capable of fulfilling the potential of the company built by Steve Jobs, Mr Nadella\u2019s record has depended on engineering a more fundamental corporate revival. </p><p>\u201cHe brought in a new culture, a new enthusiasm,\u201d says Michael Cusumano, a management professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cMicrosoft became an exciting place to work again.\u201d</p><p>When Mr Nadella took over, Microsoft was in danger of having missed almost every important new technology trend since the turn of the century. An expensive pursuit of Google in the search market had come up short, and social networking had passed it by entirely. Attempts to catch up with Apple and Google in smartphones came to nothing: one of Mr Nadella\u2019s first acts was to shut down the Nokia mobile business Microsoft had bought in a last-ditch gamble. And in cloud computing, a late start left it far behind Amazon. </p><p>At the root of the problem was Microsoft\u2019s addiction to the monopoly profits churned out by its PC operating system. The effort to keep Windows at the centre of the computing universe handicapped engineers, hampering efforts to break into mobile and cloud computing.</p><p>Mr Nadella responded by taking Microsoft back to its roots, looking to a period before Windows when its software tools were used by other companies to build their own technology. \u201cThat fundamental notion that we build tools, build platforms so that others can build more technology, I think is more relevant, more needed in 2019 than it was in 1975,\u201d he says.</p><p>Aged 46 when he took over, the new chief was only 11 years younger than co-founder Bill Gates. According to Mr Cusumano, though, that was enough to free him from the company\u2019s old dogmas: \u201cHe\u2019s the next generation \u2014 he\u2019s really part of the internet generation.\u201d</p><p>As it chases Amazon in cloud computing, Microsoft was recently awarded a landmark US Department of Defense contract worth up to $10bn. Amazon, the favourite to win the work, has sued the Pentagon, claiming it lost the work because of political bias. But the fact that Microsoft was deemed capable of taking on the assignment, even though it still lacks all the security clearances required, is a sign of the technical capabilities and massive new cloud infrastructure that Microsoft has amassed under Nadella.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft\u2019s board did not turn</emphasis> straight to Mr Nadella when it came to looking for a replacement for Steve Ballmer, instead pursuing a number of potential outsiders to fill the gap. Yet his undramatic elevation to the job in early 2014 was in keeping with a rise that was characterised by technical vision and quiet assurance.</p><p>Raised in Hyderabad, the future Microsoft boss failed an entrance exam to the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, but did earn an electrical engineering degree at Mangalore University before moving to the US to the University of Wisconsin.</p><p>His first assignment, after joining Microsoft in 1992, was to work on Windows. But his rise inside the company was defined by a new technology era. He made his name running the search engine Bing \u2014 an also-ran against Google, but still a lesson for Microsoft in how to build and run services that reach massive online audiences. He later took on Azure, the company\u2019s nascent cloud computing platform.</p><p>In a company defined by intense rivalries, naked displays of ambition and cut-throat competition, Mr Nadella\u2019s unassuming and collaborative style stood out. It has been central to the new culture he has tried to bring to the company.</p><p>Empathy is a quality he prizes highly, and tries to instil in Microsoft\u2019s staff. He attributes his own to the experience of a first son who was born with cerebral palsy. It led to years of personal frustration, he has said, before he learnt to be less self-centred about the setback.</p><p>He has promoted a new outlook for Microsoft workers, based on a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d that would involve constantly being open to learning and new ideas, rather than the \u201cfixed mindset\u201d of the past \u2014 concepts taken from psychologist Carol Dweck. And he worked to break down silos, instead championing a \u201cOne Microsoft\u201d approach that would unify the company. </p><p>\u201cIn the old days, this was the most internally competitive culture I have ever seen \u2014 everyone was fighting for their lives,\u201d says Margaret Heffernan, a software entrepreneur who has worked on management issues at Microsoft. \u201cThe culture has changed radically.\u201d</p><p>Mr Nadella\u2019s use of language has been key, says Ms Heffernan. For people outside the tech industry, his use of jargon can seem stilted. But for those inside the company, simple messages, frequently repeated, have helped to cement the new behaviours.</p><p>The results are not always elegant. \u201cWe have set aside some of our classic know-it-all behaviour to at least start the journey, culturally, to say, \u2018We\u2019d better become learn-it-alls,\u2019\u201d the Microsoft chief says. He calls this adjustment \u201ca hard thing\u201d, given the company\u2019s previous culture.</p><p>Peggy Johnson, an early hire to Mr Nadella\u2019s top management group, credits him with an unusual \u201cconsistency of message\u201d. That has turned what might have been merely lip-service in another company into an engine for real cultural change. After spending an entire senior management meeting discussing diversity and inclusion, she says, Mr Nadella went on to repeat the same themes exhaustively: \u201cWe never stopped talking about it. It wasn\u2019t just a box-check.\u201d</p><p>Microsoft\u2019s business divisions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING</emphasis></p><p>The PC operating system still makes this Microsoft\u2019s biggest division, though it is only 36 per cent of revenues and could soon be eclipsed by newer businesses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES</emphasis></p><p>The most profitable division includes Office. Alongside LinkedIn, Microsoft\u2019s biggest acquisition, it is now building a wider set of services for workers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTELLIGENT CLOUD</emphasis></p><p>Home to the Azure cloud computing platform, as well as Microsoft\u2019s server software.</p><p>To some extent, the kinder, gentler Microsoft reflects a new era in tech in which the company can no longer go it alone and alliances in areas such as cloud have become more important. \u201cSatya realised that if we didn\u2019t partner, we wouldn\u2019t grow,\u201d Ms Johnson says.</p><p>Mr Nadella himself is careful not to declare victory in the cultural overhaul. After all \u2014 as he admits \u2014 to do so would itself show the company had slipped back into a fixed mindset. Instead, he says: \u201cFrom ancient Greece to modern Silicon Valley, the only thing that gets in the way of continued success and relevance, and impact, is hubris.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The way Microsoft exerts</emphasis> its resurgent power in the tech world will help to determine how Mr Nadella is judged. That has made its battle with messaging start-up Slack a test of how much the company, once known for its highly aggressive tactics, has really changed.</p><p>Slack pulled off a successful stock market listing earlier this year. But its shares have fallen back 50 per cent as investors have worried about a full-on attack from Microsoft, which has been promoting a service called Teams.</p><p>Stewart Butterfield, Slack\u2019s chief executive, complains about the way Microsoft has been throwing its weight around, accusing it of being \u201cunsporting\u201d. Teams has been included free of charge with Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 service \u2014 a \u201cbundling\u201d technique that once got the company in hot water with regulators when used in connection with Windows. Mr Butterfield says Microsoft keeps putting Teams in front of its Office users, even when they don\u2019t want it: \u201cIf you disable it, they enable it for you. If you uninstall it, they reinstall it for you,\u201d he says.</p><p>But he adds, grudgingly, of Microsoft\u2019s tactics: \u201cI would probably do the same thing myself.\u201d And he also applauds Mr Nadella\u2019s transformation of the company: \u201cI think he\u2019s made a lot of good strategy choices.\u201d</p><p>The Microsoft boss gives Mr Butterfield\u2019s complaints short shrift. \u201cThe question he should ask himself is whether Slack would even exist if it was not for Windows, and his ability to distribute on Windows without Microsoft getting in the way,\u201d he says. Just because Microsoft competes on a particular service, he adds, it has not shut off access to its software platforms: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re locking up one layer to somehow disadvantage him.\u201d</p><p>This, according to Mr Nadella, highlights an important difference between Microsoft and other Big Tech members. It does not act as a gatekeeper, instead allowing developers like Slack to reach the Windows audience \u201cwithout any tax collection\u201d. He adds that the company\u2019s rivals benefit from being able to freely reach their customers using Microsoft\u2019s platforms: \u201cGoogle makes more money on Windows than all of Microsoft. Tell me another platform where that will be true: none.\u201d</p><p>He goes on to contrast the role of companies such as Microsoft with that of aggregators, which dominate a market by amassing far more content than rivals \u2014 like Google and Facebook in online media, or Amazon in ecommerce. Referring to how companies like these work, he says: \u201cYou commoditise supply. You\u2019re even sort of commoditising the demand, in some ways. That\u2019s a very different dynamic.\u201d</p><p>Mr Nadella\u2019s efforts to paint Microsoft as the responsible face of tech is already some years in the making. He was earlier than Silicon Valley rivals to warn of the potential pitfalls of AI \u2014 and also earlier to codify possible responses. Under Microsoft president Brad Smith, Microsoft has championed a \u201cDigital Geneva convention\u201d, setting out terms for managing future cyber conflicts.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re taking a much more thoughtful approach to tech,\u201d says Ms Heffernan. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for someone to take these issues up and make themselves the good guys of tech.\u201d</p><p>Ultimately, it will be Microsoft\u2019s success as a platform supporting a wider range of digital activity that will determine its value \u2014 both to shareholders, and to society at large. According to Mr Nadella, regulators around the world will not stand in its way, no matter how large the company gets, as long as it generates more wealth for people who rely on its services than it does for itself.</p><p>\u201cWe have to create a local surplus in every country,\u201d he says. \u201cBigness by itself is not a problem, as long as the surplus around it is broad. I feel like we\u2019re on the right side of history.\u201d</p><p>Letter in response to this article:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How Nadella added more value to Microsoft / From John Sabalis, Richmond, VA, US</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-0e8c300220c711ea92daf0c92e957a96</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSH-9WG1-JB77-K4YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2459\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Pokud budou trhy setrv\u00e1vat v nervozit\u011b, bude Big Tech pravd\u011bpodobn\u011b v p\u0159\u00edzni.

but they suggested the market was just due for a breather. </p><p>Simon French, chief economist for Panmure Gordon, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning: 'We need to put those moves into context.</p><p>'Those companies (Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft) collectively at the start of September, were up 57 per cent year to date.</p><p>'And that is in contrast to the Dow Jones industrial Average of more traditional US companies which is down 2 per cent on the year.</p><p>'So I think it was a case of investors taking some money off the table for some of these tech stocks, given some very, very sky high valuations and a great run.</p><p>'But also there will also be concerns that tall poppies attract attention from regulators and potentially with a US presidential election coming up in November, and lawmakers questioning whether they have too much market dominance.'</p><p>Yesterday's tumble wiped 5 per cent off the Nasdaq and marked an abrupt halt in a rally over the past few months that has taken the stock markets to record highs.</p><p>Before yesterday, Apple had seen its price rise by more than 75 per cent since the start of 2020, while the FTSE 100 had fallen by 23 per cent this year.</p><p>Investors have been attracted to Apple's stock amid hopes it would benefit from high consumer demand in lockdown as people switched to working from home. </p><p>On Tuesday, Apple rose just under 4 per cent after a report that the company had asked suppliers to make at least 75million 5G iPhones for later this year.</p><p>It was also boosted by a four-for-one stock split that made its shares more affordable to more investors, which was first announced five weeks ago.</p><p>The company cut each $500 (\u00a3375) share into four $125 (\u00a395) shares, saying it did so for a broader base of investors to afford to buy its stock.</p><p>Last month Apple, which is the world's biggest company by market capitalisation, become the first US firm to boast a market value of $2trillion (\u00a31.5trillion).</p><p>That milestone came just two years after the firm became the first to reach $1trillion (\u00a30.75trillion).</p><p>This year the firm has overcome the shutdown of factories in China that produce the iPhone and the closure of its retail sales amid the Covid-19 crisis.</p><p>The company has a hugely loyal customer base which continued to buy iPhones and other devices online while stuck at home during the lockdown.</p><p>During the pandemic Apple gained about $6.7billion (\u00a35billion) in value every business day - the equivalent of adding a Rolls-Royce every day to its market cap.</p><p>Apple reported an 11 per cent increase in quarterly revenue in July with sales up to $59.7billion (\u00a344.8billion), but said its new iPhone 12 had been delayed.</p><p>Apple has been at the vanguard of a group of Big Tech companies that are increasingly taking over people's lives - and the stock market in the US.</p><p>Just five companies - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google's parent company - account for nearly 23 per cent of the S&amp;P 500's entire value.</p><p>Saudi Aramco reached a market value of $2trillion shortly after becoming a public company in December 2019, although it has fallen since amid a drop in oil prices.</p><p>Apple is said to be preparing to ship 75million new iPhone 12 models this year with the company hoping sales of the next-generation iPhone reach 80million.</p><p>The initial figures are in line with previous iPhone launches, suggesting Apple does not think the crisis and economic slowdown are causing consumer interest to wane.</p><p>The company is planning to launch four iPhone 12 models later this year with different screen sizes, 5G support and crisp OLED displays.</p><p>Apple is also preparing a new iPad Air with an edge-to-edge screen, two new versions of the Apple Watch and a smaller and cheaper HomePod speaker.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-65708518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RY-H2S1-F021-62HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><timeReceived>7:29 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

This guide is designed to allow you to follow the fortunes of your shares and their sectors quickly and easily. Whether you hold the shares or not, the FTSE 350 guide is designed to give you enough information to decide what you should do now - buy, sell or hold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We've rummaged through all 350 companies and picked out the most interesting stories to highlight in each sector, along with an overview of the sector. We've also provided key information on each company (latest share price, market value, PE and dividend yield) plus a reminder of what the IC's view of the company was at the time of its last published results.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the start of this year the FTSE 350 index has been going nowhere. On 18 October, the index was down almost 10 per cent since 1 January 2000.</p><p>Between 1 January 1999 and 18 October, it rose by 8.25 per cent, hardly enough to make investors drool at the mouth and only a fraction more than many instant access savings and current accounts are paying.</p><p>Of course, hidden behind this year's poor show so far for the combined performance of the top 350 companies are sharp movements in the share prices of individual companies and whole sectors. Investors who picked the right shares at the right time are now sitting on first-class gains.</p><p>The strongest climbers over the period were biotech Cambridge Antibody with returns in excess of 464 per cent, followed by Oxford GlycoSciences which notched up a gain of more than 400 per cent.</p><p>Biotechs account for four out of five of the top risers over the period (Celltech and Shire Pharmaceuticals are the other two), giving the lie to the notion that all biotechs are loss-making disaster zones. But also found among the top 20 risers are unloved retailers and household and toiletry product makers. Matalan, the discount clothing chain, rose by 82.8 per cent and Reckitt Benckiser jumped 64.5 per cent.</p><p>British Telecom, Stagecoach and Eidos, all erstwhile darlings of the market, shed more than 50 per cent of their value. Eidos lost 77 per cent of its value and only narrowly avoided being the worst performing stock over the whole period - it was pipped by Atlantic Telecom, with a fall of 77.9 per cent, not a great record for its first year as a constituent of the FTSE 350.</p><p>The net effect of wild gyrations in telecom, software and IT stocks was to push those sectors right down to the bottom of the sector performance table - only steel did worse. Software and computer services fell by 33 per cent between 1 January and 18 October 2000 (against a gain of 165 per cent for the whole of 1999) while telecom services dropped 36.6 per cent. IT hardware is down more than 25 per cent although since 1 January 1999 it has grown by a staggering 738 per cent. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>31\u00a0 Construction/housebuilding</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0snapshot - paper &amp; packaging</entry></row><row><entry>32 \u00a0 Pharmaceuticals and healthcare</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0snapshot - investment banks</entry></row><row><entry>33 \u00a0 Engineering</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Building materials/merchants</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0snapshot - steel</entry></row><row><entry>34\u00a0 Banks</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asset managers/other financial</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0snapshot - household products</entry></row><row><entry>35\u00a0 Life assurance</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0insurance</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0snapshot - gas distribution</entry></row><row><entry>36\u00a0 Electricity</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Property/real estate</entry></row><row><entry>37\u00a0 Transport</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mining</entry></row><row><entry>40\u00a0 Support services</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Telecoms</entry></row><row><entry>41\u00a0 Leisure/hotels</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0electronics &amp; electricals</entry></row><row><entry>42\u00a0 Breweries,beverages, pubs, restaurants</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Food producers</entry></row><row><entry>43\u00a0 Food &amp; drug retailers</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Retailers</entry></row><row><entry>44\u00a0 Broadcasting &amp; media agencies</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Publishing &amp; printing</entry></row><row><entry>45\u00a0 IT hardware</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tobacco</entry></row><row><entry>46\u00a0 IT software/computer services</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0snapshot - Internet</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Insurance brokers</entry></row><row><entry>47\u00a0 Aerospace/defence</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chemicals</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0snapshot - automobiles</entry></row><row><entry>48\u00a0 Oil exploration</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Water</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0snapshot - distributors</entry></row><row><entry/></row><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>construction/housebuilding</p><p>Housebuilders have had a great year so far. Prices soared in the first six months, pushing profits and margins forward, and the slowdown shows no sign of accelerating into a full-scale recession for the moment. But the market isn't convinced and the shares are unlikely to move far from their lowly ratings until the City is persuaded that interest rates have peaked and profits are sustainable.</p><p>PE ratios for the FTSE 350 crowd range from a dismal four for Wimpey to a slightly less dismal eight for sector leaders like Redrow and Berkeley. As well as destroying shareholder value, low ratings make fund-raising difficult. Some of the companies have had enough, and Redrow has joined smaller players like Linden and Fairview in considering a stock market exit. The company has started the ball rolling with a 30 per cent share buy-back, but chief executive Paul Pedley has indicated that he'll take the company private if things don't improve in the next couple of years.</p><p>Operationally, the aim for many of the housebuilders is to catch up with leaders like Berkeley, with its London focus, and Wilson Bowden which makes good use of a healthy long-term land bank. At the other end of the scale, Wimpey's margins languish at 8 per cent but there are plans to improve this through cost cutting and improving the land bank. Labour shortages are hitting all housebuilders, prompting some to start using manufactured components like timber frames in their houses.</p><p>Margin improvement is also an aim for the contractors which have traditionally been plagued by wafer thin margins. The idea is to cut out competitive bidding and only work on contracts where there is a long-term relationship with the client. Both AMEC and Balfour Beatty look well placed to win some of the recently-announced infrastructure improvement work, while AMEC is increasing its push towards support services contracts. <table

snapshots - paper &amp; packaging</p><p>The packaging industry has been in the doldrums for many years. Investors' antipathy towards the sector has meant that many companies have been bought up by foreign competitors. In order to compete companies have been doubling up in their core businesses to gain critical mass or exiting altogether. The weak euro has also given European competitors an advantage in the UK and made it more difficult for UK companies to export in Europe.</p><p>Rexam: Good value (258p, 8 Sep 2000) David S Smith: Fairly priced (168p, 7 Jul 2000)</p><p>pharmaceuticals and healthcare</p><p>Glaxo Wellcome's GBP 120bn merger with SmithKline Beecham - creating the world's biggest pharmaceutical company by sales - should have been the sector's story of the year. But the real stars of 2000 have been the biotechs.</p><p>A constellation of companies hit the stock market equivalent of the jackpot following years of investor indifference. When we last reviewed the FTSE 350 back in January it had just six pharmaceutical companies. Industry figures were full of gloom. Clinical progress was going unnoticed, raising capital was hellishly difficult and all the while cashpiles were dwindling. The FTSE 350 now boasts 10 pharma stocks following breakthroughs by Cambridge Antibody Technology and Oxford GlycoSciences, and reratings of SkyePharma and Biocompatibles.</p><p>Safety needle maker Medisys also joined the FTSE 350 after a spectacular time on Aim.</p><p>What's changed the fortunes of these biotech companies - and made the fortunes of many more investors - has been a combination of two things.</p><p>On the one hand, from February onwards the boom in information-technology stocks began to spread to biotechnology as well. Institutional and private investors who had made a packet from internet or telecom shares began to move into budding biotech companies. Having successfully risked and won, they spied fresh fields of enterprise.</p><p>On the other hand, the wider biotech endeavour took some significant strides forward, helping to convince investors that the science behind it could really deliver. In essence, the biotechnology approach to medicine can be defined as discovering how the body works at the levels of genes and proteins and then using this knowledge to understand how diseases happen.</p><p>In June US president Bill Clinton and UK prime minister Tony Blair announced that scientists had completed a first draft of the entire human genome. It was a hugely symbolic achievement. Of more practical significance were the launches of the new generation antibody-based drugs, including Celltech's Mylotarg for acute myeloid leukaemia.</p><p>As biotechnology began to prove its worth, the City ratcheted up expectations of what it might eventually achieve. The biggest winners were companies closest to the cutting edge of genomics. Shares in Cambridge Antibody Technology and Oxford GlycoSciences exploded because of each company's ability to speed up the development of new drugs.</p><p>They both announced a string of development pacts with big pharma and US biotech firms, as well as advancing their own compounds through clinical trials.</p><p>Meanwhile Glaxo and SmithKline inched towards their merger. European regulators quickly gave the all clear. However, the minute examination of the deal by US antitrust authorities - which still isn't finished - must have left thousands of researchers and middle managers in limbo.</p><p>AstraZeneca, by contrast, has enjoyed a good few months. Shares had been weighed down by concerns about Losec, its blockbuster ulcer drug that is losing patent protection in the US next year. It's hauling generic competitors through the courts wherever possible while spending millions of pounds launching Nexium, its improved version of Losec. However, third- quarter figures this week suggest that sales of Nexium are taking off more slowly than expected. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"3\"

shape; asset management and corporate finance are firing on all cylinders too. The business was certainly boosted by the acquisition of Rea Brothers; that deal quadrupled funds managed to GBP 2.6bn. Close is one of the last merchant banks left but with this kind of growth profile it looks well paced to go it alone.</p><p>Good value (1,208p, 6 October 2000)</p><p>- It's the investment book that dominates market sentiment in Durlacher and, not surprisingly, the bank's shares took a mighty big punch after the technology sector collapsed. Still with earnings rocketing ahead it's hard to fault the performance. And now that the company is doing a joint venture with Germany's bmp, expect Durlacher to take an increasing interest in life science investments.</p><p>Good value (94p, 22 September 2000)</p><p>- Singer &amp; Friedlander is selling its Swedish stockbroker, Carnegie. Ditching that highly profitable operation might look odd, but it will slash costs and make the bank more focused. Brokers also think that Carnegie might be worth about GBP 700m; add Singer's chunk of that to the cash from selling Collins Stewart and subtract the total from S&amp;F's market cap and the core bank looks undervalued.</p><p>Good value (286p, 8 September 2000)</p><p>engineering</p><p>Having struggled for the last two years against the high rate of sterling and its old economy image, the UK engineering sector is now threatening to make a comeback. Since the high-tech shake-out in March the FTSE 350 engineering sector has risen by 1.77 per cent, outperforming the general 350 by 4.56 per cent. However despite its recent modest outperformance, analysts urge caution, arguing that while many engineering shares appear cheap in a majority of cases the depressed levels are fully justified. Many engineering companies are highly exposed to the strength of the US economy - which accounts for around 50 per cent of the sector's sales - and the recent slowdown of the US housing and automotive markets has already led to a slowdown in sales at Tomkins. ABN Amro engineering analyst Guy Hewett looks for companies which serve markets detached from the general US industrial sector or whose valuation is rock bottom. In the former group Hewett identifies BBA, which provides aviation services to the US market (and is exposed to the economic but not the industrial cycle) as attractive. BBA shares lost some ground on the news of the departure next year of the group's respected chief executive Roberto Quarta but the underlying business is performing strongly. In the latter category Hewett singles out Enodis, which on a consensus forecast of GBP 101m in profits for the current year trades on a miserly forward PE multiple of 5.5.</p><p>With a large number of companies in the sector languishing on single-digit PE multiples takeover speculation is rife. The share price of West Midlands- based engineer IMI, for example, has recently climbed on speculation that a private equity buyer is planning a break-up bid. Elsewhere Glasgow-based pumps maker Weir, which fought off a 300p a share takeover offer from Texas- based rival Flowserve, now trades at only 191p and rumours of further moves for the company abound.

materials/merchants</p><p>Building materials stocks looked to be staging a recovery from recent lows until everything went wrong in August. Since then, fears about the state of the US market and rising raw material prices have sent shares plummeting. The construction and building materials sector has underperformed the rest of the FTSE 350 by 15 per cent over the last year.</p><p>The concern about the US is that, after a number of decent years, the market has peaked and the economy is set for a general slowdown. But the view isn't universal. \"It may have peaked in certain respects such as new houses, but it's not coming off the edge of a cliff,\" says Simon Brown, construction analyst at Williams de Broe. Many of the companies, especially Aggregate Industries, RMC and Hanson, have large exposure to the US and would be hit badly by a slowdown. Plasterboard manufacturer BPB demonstrated the market's fears by coming out with a profits warning in September because of overcapacity in the US plasterboard market.</p><p>Consolidation still dominates the sector gossip. After Hanson bought Pioneer and RMC bought Rugby last year, talk is rife of who might be next. Aggregate Industries is often tipped as the next target as observers believe it to be too small to survive on its own. Hepworth has GBP 100m cash and is looking for a European boiler acquisition, and Pilkington has been out buying up Ford's US glass interests.</p><p>But the biggest M&amp;A story of the year was Lafarge's unsuccessful GBP 3.4bn takeover bid for Blue Circle. The UK cement producer managed to fight off the French challenge through a mixture of improvements in the Asian operations, cost cutting and share buy-backs. Lafarge still controls a 30 per cent stake and may come back for a second bite next year. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"5\"

snapshots - steel</p><p>Corus, created from the merger of British Steel and the Dutch group Hoogovens last year, has struggled since the company's shares hit a peak of 174p earlier this year on anticipation of GBP 200m in cost savings flowing from the merger. The enduring strength of sterling has decimated earnings from UK operations and the shares are now near a five-year low of 50p. Corus may have some value as a short-term trading play, but has little else to recommend it.</p><p>Good value (98p, 30 June 2000)</p><p>banks</p><p>Former banking watchdog, Don Cruickshank, says that the banks are making hundreds of millions of pounds by ripping off their long-suffering retail customers. And a glance at the return on equity for a player like Lloyds TSB - at well over 30 per cent - would seem to bear that out. But times are changing and the banking market is getting tougher.</p><p>It's already happened to the mortgage banks; they have spent the past few years watching their margins gradually disappear and only the really low-cost banks - like Northern Rock - can survive as pure mortgage operations. The rest have had to diversify into higher margin operations and some, such as Halifax, still have some work left to do.</p><p>Then there's e-banking. Egg started off that craze, and the rest have jumped in, fearful that they can't afford to be left behind. But ask around the City and it's hard to find anyone who thinks the perplexing range of new internet banks, such as Halifax's IF.com or Abbey National's cahoot.com, will actually ever make more than the cost of capital. And with so much competition at once combined with a big development and marketing spend, mega losses are on the cards for now.</p><p>The clearing banks are unlikely to escape this more cut-throat world. For years they have sat back and grown fat by funding their loans with cheap money from retail depositors. But now that Halifax plans to offer savings- type rates on current accounts, the likes of Barclays can't just carry on regardless.</p><p>Still, it's going to be years before increased competition really bites into these superb money generators. In the meantime, and with a fairly benign economic outlook ahead, the banks should do pretty well and that's likely to be reflected in share prices. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec

rollercoaster ride offered by tech stocks this year things have been especially hairy. At the beginning of the year a player with a big tech book - such as London Pacific - would have seen its shares soar. But when the technology sector collapsed in the spring these companies would have at least partially followed that sector down.</p><p>Still, for those with the right nose for an investment, along with a reasonably diversified book, there are good returns to be made. And for players that also have brokerage operations, such as ED&amp;F Man, the future looks bright indeed. An increasing number of people want to buy and sell their own shares rather than just trust their money to fund managers. And the growing levels of dealing activity that result from this should mean pretty decent profits for brokerages. The internet too should help boost this trend so watch out for those with a decent web offering.</p><p>The consumer finance companies look in good shape too. A player such as Cattles makes money by lending to those borrowers that the banks turn away. That might sound like a recipe for disaster, but the highly individual approach keeps defaults to a minimum. And the high interest rates charged mean decent profits.</p><p>But it's the growth prospects that should keep investors interested. The demand for this service is huge and most players are constrained only by their ability to put in place systems to manage the risk. And Provident Financial is even rolling out the doorstep lending concept into the under- banked eastern European countries. The growth profile alone makes it hard for these companies to go too far wrong. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"7\"

round the City. Even among analysts who recommend selling Reckitt's shares there is a recognition that Mr Becht has managed to put some zing into the marketing. Returns, in terms of brand awareness and sales, are now beginning to show through. Reckitt's shares have risen 54 per cent this year. Since it accounts for the lion's share of the sector, Reckitt's success explains why the sector has outperformed all others in 2000. However, as much as one quarter of all its products are oil-derived. The strength of crude and Reckitt;s limited ability to pass on higher costs to its supermarket customers suggest tougher times may lie ahead.</p><p>Good value (832p, 8 September 2000)</p><p>life assurance</p><p>The UK's life market still looks robust. The pension hungry general public is waking up to the fact that the state is no longer the place to look for help in their old age, and that's meant a brisk trade for the life players. Today's relatively low interest rate world has also left life products looking like a better deal than putting cash in the bank. In fact, it's the life market where most of the big composites players are looking to avoid the still tough world of general insurance.</p><p>And it's the likes of Legal &amp; General, with its legendary low-cost culture, and the newly created CGNU, with its well-positioned international focus, that should be set for a bright future. Moreover, for those able to make it pay there should be plenty of opportunities to take advantage of the new stakeholder pension.</p><p>In fact the market outlook for life products remains a tad better here than it does across the channel in continental Europe. Governments there have been generally slower to bite the bullet on pension reform and that's meant a lot of consolidation rumours buzzing around the City involving the big European players such as Germany's Allianz or Holland's Aegon. But expectations that the big Europeans would steam in have failed to materialise. The thing is that they need scale and the only affordable deals are too small to really satisfy their needs.

Royal &amp; Sun Alliance has deliberately focused on general insurance because it believes that the returns available from a recovering general insurance market will soon beat what can be achieved from the increasingly crowded life market.

But after several years of plummeting premium rates the worst appears to be over, although the recovery still looks decidedly patchy. Motor rates are bounding along with increases of up to 30 per cent but take a sector like marine and things still look flat. And premium rates in property and casualty, while decent enough, still can't match the buoyancy of the motor sector.</p><p>Despite better news, several problems still face the insurers. To begin with, and despite the huge losses from storm and earthquake ridden 1999, there's still oodles of excess capital to be soaked up in the global insurance market. And until more of that cash pile has been consumed the world's general players will struggle to pass on really meaty rate increases.</p><p>Reinsurance holds the key. Reinsurance rates are going up, but they will have to go up faster than they currently are before the direct players feel sufficiently pinched to start really pushing premium rates up. There could be another 12 months to go before that scenario is working. In the meantime, the patchiness of the recovery means that some sectors could peak before the rest of the market recovery gets fully underway. Again, take motor; the chunky rate increases there have been running for well over a year and that sector must start running out of steam soon.</p><p>As for investors they have two basic choices when buying into the insurance recovery: bargain deals or expensive quality.</p><p>Take Royal &amp; Sun Alliance; its determination to stick to its core property and casualty business when others wanted life exposure has driven the share price down much too far.</p><p>Then there's a high quality player like Independent Insurance; even when the market was rock-bottom it never made underwriting losses and does not need to waste the recovery turning round a loss-making book.</p><p>The trouble is that this kind of quality is far from cheap. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"9\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>Name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0price\u00a0 mkt cap\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0div\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0last IC recommendation</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(GBP m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ratio\u00a0 yield</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(%)</entry></row><row><entry>Independent\u00a0 315.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0756.00\u00a0 20.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.82\u00a0 Buy (303p, 18 Aug 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>INSURANCE</entry></row><row><entry>ROYAL &amp; SUN\u00a0 450.0\u00a0 6,435.00\u00a0 39.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.20\u00a0 Buy (467p, 8 Sep 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>ALLIANCE</entry></row><row><entry/></row><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>sector snapshots - gas distribution</p><p>Centrica is performing strongly in the liberalised supply markets and is levering its enormous market share to cross-sell a wide range of consumer products. It now hopes to repeat the trick in North America after buying electricity supplier Direct Energy. Investors should keep an eye on gas costs, which are coming under increasing upwards pressure. Fairly priced 231p, 14 September 2000.</p><p>Just last week BG completed its demerger in Lattice (the former Transco business) and BG Group (the international exploration arm). Lattice is now responsible for operating the national gas pipeline system. A telecoms network along the UK pipeline infrastructure should add some spice in the long term. As for BG Group, although still in the gas distribution sector, it's really an oil and gas exploration play. Given that its new executive finance director comes from SmithKline Beecham (recently merged with Glaxo Wellcome), analysts think the group is gearing up for some major corporate moves. No previous comments for Lattice or BG Group. Last BG comment: Fairly priced (439p, 14 September 2000).</p><p>electricity</p><p>After getting hammered early in the year, electricity shares are back in vogue as investors come to recognise the real growth that can come from these boring utilities.</p><p>Much of the growth is driven by international expansion. Scottish Power, National Grid and Powergen have all made big US acquisitions.</p><p>All should be able to use their sharp cost-cutting skills to deliver a good return on their investments. International Power, the overseas part of recently demerged National Power, is also looking stateside for growth.</p><p>However, it is expecting to build power stations rather than operate entire utilities.</p><p>But there's also growth to be had at home. The liberalised domestic electricity and gas markets have given imaginative electricity companies room to grow by adding additional retail customers to their books, cross-selling a range of products to them and milking them for cash.</p><p>But though the domestic energy markets offer big opportunities, there are also potential pitfalls. Independent Energy, one of the most successful new entrants, collapsed earlier this year as faulty customer information led to billing and ultimately cash-flow problems. Those left in the sector will now be taking extra care.</p><p>There's also a race on to hit critical mass.</p><p>Analysts think companies need 4-5m customers to survive as energy suppliers. Centrica and Scottish &amp; Southern Energy apart, no quoted energy supplier has that amount. This leaves them plenty of work to do.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest challenge for the electricity companies will be the introduction of a new electricity trading mechanism. That's turning the cosy wholesale generation market into a cut-throat contract-based system. Analysts at Merrill Lynch suggest that electricity contract prices have already fallen 10-15 per cent and that forward agreements point to a further 10 per cent fall over the next year.</p><p>These falling prices have already prompted British Energy to issue a profits warning and cut its dividend. The other generators shouldn't be hit as badly, but the outcome is yet to be seen. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"10\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>Name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0price\u00a0 mkt cap\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0div\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0last IC</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(GBP m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ratio\u00a0 yield\u00a0 recommendation</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(%)</entry></row><row><entry>BRITISH ENERGY\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0187.5\u00a0 1,163.81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.74\u00a0 High enough (136p, 19</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>INNOGY HOLDINGS\u00a0 201.0\u00a0 2,245.96\u00a0 na \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00.00\u00a0 na</entry></row><row><entry>INTERNATIONAL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0282.0\u00a0 3,164.04\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05.91 \u00a0 Fairly priced (341p,</entry></row><row><entry>POWER\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a019 May 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>NATIONAL GRID\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0576.5 \u00a0 8,558.20\u00a0 25.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.69\u00a0 Buy (548p (tip</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0update), 8 Sep 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>POWERGEN\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0520.5\u00a0 3,388.45\u00a0 10.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.43\u00a0 Good value (529p, 14</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sep 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>SCOT. &amp;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0577.0\u00a0 4,947.29\u00a0 12.5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05.30\u00a0 Buy (527p, 9 Jun</entry></row><row><entry>SOUTHERN\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry>SCOTTISH POWER \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0524.0\u00a0 9,683.52\u00a0 14.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.92\u00a0 Buy (523p, 12 May</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry>VIRIDIAN GROUP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0739.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0968.84\u00a0 12.9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.18\u00a0 Buy (729p, 19 May</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry/></row><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>property/real estate</p><p>The property sector is in rather good shape. The housing market in the south- east might be cooling but taking some of the froth out of the market could prove to be a welcome way of delivering longer-term stability. The commercial market looks strong too with most sectors turning in decent valuation growth and rental uplifts that at least keep pace with inflation. And there's no sign of the huge speculative overbuilding which pushed the property market off the cliff back in the early 1990s.</p><p>But take a look at property company share prices and one could be forgiven for thinking that the market is in the depths of recession. Even the sector's giants, such as Land Securities and British Land, are suffering with share prices that languish up to 40 per cent below their NAVs.</p><p>Property analysts say that they have never seen property company valuations treated so churlishly against the background of such decent market conditions. It's a situation that's taking its toll on the listed players.</p><p>The yawning chasms which separate share prices and NAVs have led many property players to go private; the biggest being the once great MEPC. While others have decided that the best way to realise shareholder value is to simply sell the properties and liquidate the company. And the City thinks that property looks set to remain out of favour with investors for a while yet.</p><p>Ironically, that's an opportunity. Every privatisation has involved cash offers that are well below a company's most recent NAV. But the cash on offer has also been much better than the share price. And with some property analysts speculating that another 20 listed players could go private over the next 18 months, there could be more cash offers on the way. The trick is to spot those that are most likely to throw in the towel. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"11\"

year. It recovered only to be hit by worries over escalating fuel prices.</p><p>Most high profile among the companies on the sick list is British Airways. Though it's reasonably well hedged, analysts have still downgraded forecasts as the oil price has refused to budge. But others have been hit too. P&amp;O warned in its final set of results that fuel prices were having a negative impact on its cruise business.</p><p>But fuel prices aren't providing the only excitement in the sector. High on the list is rail refranchising. The rail contracts originally decided five years ago are being reorganised and renegotiated. The first one has already been awarded and seven more will be decided over the coming months.</p><p>Rail has been one of the fastest growing forms of passenger transport in the UK. So for the winners in refranchising, the prize (and impact on the share price) could be very large. Consolidation is expected on the railways and the big players, anxious to build their market share, could be willing to pay big money for those successful in rail franchising.</p><p>Also important for the big public transport operators is a strong performance from their US businesses. Firstgroup, National Express and Stagecoach all made big US acquisitions last year. Stagecoach's acquisition, Coach USA, ran into problems and that led to a collapse in the share price early this year.</p><p>Stagecoach now seems to be resolving its US difficulties. National Express and Firstgroup have been more fortunate and their subsidiaries are progressing well. However, Stagecoach's problems have made the markets jittery and a slip could lead to a derating.</p><p>The ports sector sprang into life earlier this year after a seemingly complete loss of shareholder interest. It came as they languished on low ratings and financial buyers, attracted by ports' strong cash flows, attempted to take advantage of this.</p><p>None were taken over, but the sector was rerated and venture capitalists now seem to have lost interest. However, there are still good buys, particularly as some have exciting property interests not reflected in their share prices.</p><p>But much of the interest over the next year is likely to be focused on British Airways. Rod Eddington's first few months in his job as chief executive of BA were hijacked somewhat by merger talks with KLM. Now that has fallen through, he will be able to turn to his main job of returning the business to profitability.</p><p>The prospects look good and BA already has a cost-cutting strategy in place. So long as the fuel price doesn't jump even further, that should mean BA returns to profitability next year. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"12\"

rally in base metals prices has been a restrained one this year, and the share prices of major mining groups have not, in general, been able to repeat their outperformance of the previous year.</p><p>Instead, consolidation has been the big theme. Billiton has taken the lead in this field. It bid C$ 1.7bn for Canadian natural resources group Rio Algom, a price that some thought was too high, and followed that with a deal to take up Alcoa's stake in the Worsley alumina refinery in Australia. The deals forced Billiton to raise fresh funds, but they give it a quick leg-up into the copper market. Cash is burning a hole in the pockets of Anglo American as it continues to shed its conglomerate baggage. After the acquisition of Tarmac, Anglo tried to break into the iron ore market by bidding for Australia's North Ltd, but was pipped at the post by Rio Tinto. Eyebrows were raised when new chief executive Tony Trahar hinted the cross-holding with De Beers might be unwound, but others believe the Oppenheimers have no intention of loosening their hold.</p><p>Anglo's results comfortably beat forecasts, driven by earnings from its platinum operations. Platinum also boosted Lonmin, whose shares hit a high of 919p in September, a year after we tipped them at almost half that level. But the company's opportunistic bid for the rest of troubled gold miner Ashanti was blocked.</p><p>Rio Tinto had a subdued year. The acquisition of North went down well enough, but its copper business had a disappointing 12 months. Rio's return on capital remains the best in the sector, but with Billiton and Anglo attracting more attention, the company will need to work hard to preserve its pre-eminence. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"13\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>Name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0price\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mkt cap\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0div\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0last IC</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(GBP m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ratio\u00a0 yield\u00a0 recommendation</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(%)</entry></row><row><entry>ANGLO AMERICAN\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03,718.0\u00a0 15,171.29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fairly priced</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(4,064p, 14 Sep</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry>BILLITON\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0241.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05,600.73\u00a0 16.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buy (282p, 8 Sep</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry>LONMIN\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0800.0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a01,419.20\u00a0 26.9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buy (663p, 16 Jun</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry>RIO TINTO (REG)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0963.0\u00a0 10,236.68\u00a0 14.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.21\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fairly priced</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1,095p, 11 Aug</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry/></row><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>support services</p><p>The trend for outsourcing continues and support services remains a growth sector. Over the past year, the sector has outperformed the All-Share index by 13 per cent and this strong growth is likely to continue.</p><p>The emphasis is gradually changing though. The UK market is maturing, making the high growth levels of the past difficult to repeat. As a result, foreign expansion is taking on an added importance. Continental Europe in particular is some way behind the UK and North America in the outsourcing stakes and the opportunities for expansion there are large.</p><p>Foreign markets can often also offer better returns. Harvey Nash recently indicated that its expansion will focus on Europe and Australasia where margins are higher and it can compete on service rather than price.</p><p>Geography aside, there's also a shift in work emphasis with white-collar outsourcing gaining in importance. Blue-collar outsourcing tends to be more established and consequently offers lower growth prospects. However, business process outsourcing, which can encompass administration, call centres and IT management is growing rapidly. The market for this white-collar type work is growing at around 20 per cent annually.</p><p>Amey has recognised this and is moving away from its construction roots and towards white-collar work. Last year, it acquired Comax which is involved in business process outsourcing and that has increased its presence in the sector massively, leaving it poised for rapid growth.</p><p>But blue-collar outsourcing still has some life left. It looks set to get a kick from increased government spending on new schools and hospitals and upgraded roads and railways. That will help contractors like Jarvis that have a close involvement with transport infrastructure projects and others that have an expertise in private finance initiative projects and facilities

ride full of unexpected peaks and troughs, finally arriving back where you started feeling slightly sick. Shares soared at the start of the year, but over the last six months, the telecoms stocks have underperformed the rest of the FTSE 350 by 28 per cent.</p><p>So where has it all gone wrong? The networks are in place, and rapid growth is expected for all over the next five years. But investors have started to panic. The business plans are untried, and there's a lot of competition, especially in the small and medium-sized business sector (SME) where BT, Colt, Energis, Atlantic, Thus, Kingston and a host of smaller players are fighting for market share.</p><p>There are also concerns about the so-called unbundling of the local loop, the process by which BT has to allow alternative operators access to its local exchanges. This in turn will allow operators to start offering high-speed, high-bandwidth services using ADSL technology. The process should be complete by mid-2001 but things aren't progressing smoothly. New entrants like Energis are complaining that BT is obstructing progress by preventing access to the most popular stations and investors are worried that this is threatening future profitability.</p><p>Life is no easier in the mobile sector. Vodafone is the only pure mobile play, and along with BT it has been caught up in the auction process for third generation licences in Europe which are costing billions of pounds. While the potential returns are huge, the technology, let alone the business plan, is still unproved. What's more, a group of mobile operators including Orange is about to come to market and Vodafone shares will be among the first to suffer from the new supply of mobile telecoms paper. <table

year will certainly be one to forget for most leisure companies and no more so than in the travel sector. Beleaguered shareholders in tour operator Thomson Travel eventually succumbed to a GBP 1.7bn bid from Europe's largest operator, Preussag in the summer. There was, however, little to smile about for the band of half a million small shareholders who paid 170p a share when the group floated in 1998. After a bidding war with German rival C&amp;N Touristic, the final take-out price only matched the flotation price.</p><p>Investors in Airtours must be ruing the day 12 months ago when the European Competition Commission blocked its bid for First Choice Holidays. Things just went from bad to worse as the company unleashed a series of profits warnings. The aggressive expansion into the German package market proved disastrous with losses spiralling to GBP 100m in the last year. Now even C&amp;N Touristic is thought unlikely to bid for Airtours, whose shares have plunged 50 per cent in the last year.</p><p>Profits warnings also came thick and fast at computer games developer Eidos, best known for Tomb Raider starring Lara Croft. Slippage in the product pipeline, poor trading and delays in the release of Sony's PlayStation 2 had a devastating effect on the share price. With a takeover bid yet to emerge - Eidos has been in discussions with a potential suitor since June - finance director Jeremy Lewis resigned earlier this month.</p><p>Mike Smith, chief executive of Rank, certainly faced an uphill struggle when he took over the hot seat a year ago. A strategic review was the number one priority and with the debt mountain well over GBP 1bn, disposals were always likely. The Tom Cobleigh pub chain, Odeon cinemas and most recently the holiday camps have all been sold. The video duplication business Deluxe could be next for the chop, which would just leave Hard Rock Cafe and the gaming division. Shareholders, who have seen GBP 2.5bn wiped off the group's market value since 1995, will be hoping the worst is now over.</p><p>At least international hoteliers have something to smile about. Hilton is now reaping the benefits of its massive capital expenditure and estate upgrade programme and first-half figures showed buoyant trading. London turned in a strong performance, a trend confirmed by Thistle Hotels and Millennium &amp; Copthorne. London and international operators aside, life for regional operators is less rosy. Valuations in the sector are set to remain low given low growth expectations in the economy, the fact that the cycle has peaked and the zero-sum game in the market. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup

12 months. Often seen as lying on the fringes of the technology boom, the sector has lost some of its highest-profile members including Marconi, which moved to the IT hardware sector, and Racal, which was bought by Thomson CSF of France. What's left is a bit of a hotchpotch: companies involved in consumer electronics, companies making manufacturing components and companies with exposure to high-tech growth areas.</p><p>In the consumer field, NXT and Pace Micro Technology are both aiming to become household names in the next 10 years. NXT is developing flat loudspeakers which enhance performance and is hoping to become as famous as Dolby by licensing out its technology to the likes of DaimlerChrysler and Bang &amp; Olufsen. Pace makes set-top boxes for digital TV but is hoping that the boxes will eventually become gateways for all information into the home.</p><p>On the industrial and commercial front, applications are similarly varied. Fairey's products improve manufacturing efficiency, while First Technology makes crash test dummies for car manufacturers and Chloride makes systems that protect power supplies. Controls group Invensys has made a splash since it was created in the merger of BTR and Siebe. With the market already jittery about the acquisition of troubled Dutch software group Baan the company released its first profits warning in mid-September, sending the shares crashing.</p><p>While lacking the glamour of the IT and telecoms sectors, the electronics sector also lacks the volatility. The shares rose and fell in the tech boom, but the movements were not as exaggerated as elsewhere. Companies in the sector can offer excellent prospects for investors, but the nature of the business means that comparisons are difficult to find, making the investment decision that little bit harder.

finally happened this year with the leading international brewers vying for some prize assets. The country's largest brewer, Scottish &amp; Newcastle, with a 29 per cent market share, was first off the mark, bidding GBP 1.7bn for the brewing interests of French group Danone. The price paid can only be described as full, but S&amp;N was eager to gain control of the premium Kronenbourg lager brand which it had been brewing under license.</p><p>Not to be outdone, privately owned Interbrew entered the UK market with vengeance buying both the Whitbread and Bass brewing operations for GBP 2.7bn. Not surprisingly, the regulator was hardly going to sit on the sidelines as the combined operations give Interbrew a 33 per cent share of the domestic market. The Competition Commission is currently investigating the regulatory issues, and though Interbrew may retain its dominant position, it will most likely have to make some concessions to placate the authorities. Interbrew itself is rumoured to be considering an IPO later this year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Whitbread, having failed in its bid for Allied Domecq pubs last year, has decided to do away with its own pubs to focus on its leisure businesses. The 3000-strong pub estate is now officially for sale and is expected to fetch around GBP 1.5bn.</p><p>Not to be left out of proceedings the largest regional brewer, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, shocked the market in May, reporting profits well below market expectations. The shares collapsed and it wasn't long before entrepreneur Robert Beare, with the backing of private equity firm Botts &amp; Co, entered the fray. Amid shareholder unrest, Wolves' days as a quoted company seem numbered.</p><p>No such problems in the spirits sector, which has been enjoying a resurgence in fortunes in recent years. Allied Domecq and Diageo have both enjoyed strong price and volume growth and now look set to do battle in the coming months when Seagram auctions its drinks business. Diageo has already laid its cards on the table, joining forces with French group Pernod Ricard. While Allied, which has the most to gain, may go it alone.</p><p>The other notable corporate activity concerned the Granada and Compass merger. The shares in the hotels to food outsourcing and servicing giant have had a rocky ride lately.</p><p>A revenue warning from Granada Media, in which the group retains a 80 per cent stake, certainly hasn't helped. Following a strategic review it now seems likely that some or all of the hotel portfolio, which includes the Posthouse, Heritage and Le Meridien brands, could be sold off. <table

investors take flight from tech stocks. But although the volatility of the last couple of weeks has propped up shares, this temporary rise cannot compensate for the fact that the sector has underperformed the FTSE All-Share by 13.5 per cent in the last 12 months.</p><p>Nevertheless, there have been some interesting developments in the sector. The biggest, perhaps, was Unilever's acquisition of the US-based Best Foods last June for a hefty GBP 12.3bn. The acquisition, deemed to be expensive by the City, is supposed to help Unilever to speed up its own sluggish growth. It probably will - Best Foods is one of the best operators among the global food processors, but Unilever is now facing a daunting task of restructuring and integrating its acquisitions at the same time.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cadbury Schweppes, has been shopping too.</p><p>Everyone wanted Cadbury to buy something sweet, but with few confectionery offers on the market, Cadbury decided to pay $ 1.45bn for the US-based Snapple Beverage to strengthen its US drinks business. Snapple is currently the leader in the US juice drink market, where its combined share with Cadbury will now stand at a solid 25 per cent. The good news is Cadbury still has enough cash for a sweets deal.</p><p>Elsewhere, Unigate's Malton food division has been suffering because of higher UK pig prices. Malton's profits are expected to be down by GBP 5m at the interim stage - that is, if it still belongs to Unigate by then: the company previously hinted that it might sell Malton, estimated to be worth about GBP 50m. Plus, Unigate itself is rumoured to be a takeover target, although the group is also said to be considering an offer for the UK-based Hazlewood Foods. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"19\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>Name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0price\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mkt cap\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0div\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0last IC</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(GBP m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ratio\u00a0 yield\u00a0 recommendation</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(%)</entry></row><row><entry>ASSOCIATED BRITISH\u00a0 374.75\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,966.80\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.19\u00a0 Fairly priced</entry></row><row><entry>FOODS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(393p, 28 Apr</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry>CADBURY SCHWEPPES\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0421.00 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a08,554.71\u00a0 16.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.68\u00a0 Buy (441p, 4 Aug</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry>NORTHERN FOODS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0108.00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0635.49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.46\u00a0 Fairly priced</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(117p, 9 Jun</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry>TATE &amp;

If it makes you relieved as a consumer, imagine the relief of the supermarkets when it became clear that the Competition Commission would not demand any divestment from the big five.</p><p>Even though the review was out only two weeks ago, the Competition Commission let its position be known well in advance, thus allowing the supermarket shares to shrug off the weight of uncertainty.</p><p>This is not to say that the sector has since shot up - food retailers are anything but a high-growth area. But there appears to be some improvement among those which six months ago looked less than promising.</p><p>Sainsbury, although still far from recovered from the wounds inflicted by Asda's price offensive, is looking healthier. Sales are improving, stores are getting modernised and IT overhaul has been entrusted to an experienced outsider, Andersen Consulting. Improving efficiency is still a priority, but the high cost of the restructuring should be paid for out of the proceeds from the sale of Homebase, which seems to have attracted a few bidders.</p><p>Safeway, which only a year ago was looking pretty dismal, seems to have got its act together.</p><p>The new-ish ex-Wal-Mart CEO Carlos Criado-Perez responded to Wal-Mart with its very own weapon - by cutting prices, with a resulting increase in sales and an extra million customers a week flocking to the stores. It remains to be seen whether with all the promotions and new customers Safeway will be able to keep its profit margins.</p><p>But then Safeway's shares have been lifted by more than just its own brighter prospects - it is still considered to be the sector's favourite takeover target, and the City has been busy speculating about potential bidders.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesco, the reigning king of the sector, is above all the skirmishes. Having conquered Britain, it is now focusing on international expansion, and the two biggest foreign operations, Hungary and Thailand, are expected to deliver profits this year. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"20\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>Name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0price\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mkt cap\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0div\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0last IC</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(GBP m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ratio\u00a0 yield\u00a0 recommendation</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(%)</entry></row><row><entry>ICELAND GROUP\u00a0 309.00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01,068.52\u00a0 13.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good value (302p, 8</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sep 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>MORRISON (WM)\u00a0 177.00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,702.26\u00a0 21.8 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a00.96\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good value\u00a0 (168p, 29</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sep 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>SAFEWAY (UK) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0274.00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,872.89\u00a0 16.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good value (248p, 26</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>SAINSBURY (J)\u00a0 353.25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06,801.91\u00a0 17.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.50 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fairly priced (315p,</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09 Jun 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>TESCO\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0261.00\u00a0 17,747.82\u00a0 26.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good value\u00a0 (236p, 22</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sep 2000)</entry></row><row><entry/></row><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>retailers</p><p>Polarisation, deflation, competition - these are the three words that best summarise what has been happening in the retail sector in the last year.</p><p>The closer a retailer is to the extreme within its sector, the better it seems to be doing - just look at the darling of fashionistas, Selfridges, or the king of discounters, Matalan.</p><p>Meanwhile, mid-market, with the exception of Next, remains synonymous with desperation, epitomised by Marks &amp; Spencer. Despite a number of radical steps - price cuts, management overhaul and the introduction of a designer collection to name just a few - M&amp;S has so far been unable to stop its freefall.</p><p>Price deflation is not helping - an increasingly choosy and spoilt-for-choice customer is not willing to part with his or her cash as easily as some years ago. Against the background of rising costs - fuel and import being the main offenders - consumer prices in the UK continue to fall and the pressure on margins, especially in the commoditised clothing sector, is increasing.</p><p>True, despite general doom and gloom, there are some potentially interesting developments in the sector. Kingfisher, which has finally decided to demerge its less-than-exciting general merchandise division, is going to enjoy the higher rating of its successful DIY business, B&amp;Q. Dixons' European expansion should start paying off and game consols sales should bounce back after the release of the new platforms, although getting rid of Freeserve seems to be a prerequisite of the full recovery.</p><p>But these bits of good news are drops in the ocean.</p><p>The reality is that general retailers continue to remain very much out-of- fashion, and for a good reason. Polarisation, deflation and competition will continue to dominate the retail horizon.

media agencies</p><p>The arrival of digital broadcasting is shaking up the sector and providing new revenue generating opportunities. In the television industry it has greatly increased the number of channels, which is fragmenting audiences, and has brought in interactive services such as shopping and banking.</p><p>This shake-up encouraged ITV giants Carlton and United News &amp; Media to announce a merger at the beginning of the year, but regulatory requirements scuppered their plans and allowed Granada Media to steal the show. United eventually sold all of its ITV franchises to Granada leaving Carlton in a poor second place.</p><p>A new broadcasting bill, expected within the next couple of years, is anticipated to pave the way for the creation of a single company to control ITV. A single company will be better able to compete with increased competition from new channels. It is widely anticipated that enough homes will have converted to digital in the next 10 years to allow the government to switch off the analogue signal.</p><p>The radio industry is also going digital but at a much slower pace. Digital radio sets will deliver better quality sound and the ability to receive text but the high cost of equipment is still holding back sales. But this hasn't stopped radio being the fastest growing advertising medium. It is not just benefiting from dot-coms trying to build their brands but is also seen as a cost-effective option for advertisers looking for a broad reach.</p><p>Also in this section are advertising and marketing groups such as WPP, which became the world's largest agency this year when it acquired US group Young &amp; Rubicam.</p><p>The industry has been going through a long period of consolidation as advertisers have favoured appointing single agencies for all their global needs. Advertising and marketing groups are dependent on strong global economies for growth and so long as the economy is performing well, so should they. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec

America Online announced their plans to merge, the fortunes of the IT and media sectors have been tied together.</p><p>The idea is that large media companies will attract internet traffic and prosper because they have valuable content and well-known brands. Publishers such as Reed, Reuters and Pearson have all announced plans to invest vast sums of money distributing their products over the internet. But while these announcements initially guaranteed hikes in the companies' share prices investors are now wondering when these investments will pay off.</p><p>For music publishers, though, it has been a different story. The industry has always feared that new technology such as MP3 - which allows music to be downloaded from the internet - would lead to mass pirating of content. It didn't help that industry leaders such as EMI were slow to embrace the opportunities of distributing their music content digitally. EMI has also been plagued by its failed attempts to find a partner ever since Seagram walked away from a deal in April 1998. The collapse of its planned merger with Time Warner's music interests is also likely to weigh heavily on the shares as the eventual likelihood of a deal diminishes.</p><p>The value of the FTSE media sector rose quickly with the market euphoria for TMT stocks in the first quarter of the year and despite falling far off its year high it is still only 4 per cent down from the beginning of the year. Despite its strong ties with the technology sector the publishing industry is still very much driven by advertising revenues. So long as the economic outlook remains buoyant, whatever the current thinking on the potential of the internet, publishers should do well. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec

Forrester Research predicts that in three years' time the market for mobile e-commerce will run into trillions of dollars. 3G technology means mobile phones will be able connect to the internet faster and will be able to offer more services such as live video.</p><p>Although the UK doesn't have a big mobile phone manufacturer such as Nokia or Ericsson it does have many companies that supply technology to this industry. ARM Holdings, for example, has cornered the world market for mobile phone microchips and is widely tipped to be the next Intel. It is far ahead of competitors in this market - it is estimated that 50-70 per cent of the mobile market uses its designs - and has a good infrastructure in place to attract the biggest original equipment manufacturers. It is also moving into designing chips for other fast-growing sectors such as smart cards, set-top boxes and for bluetooth technology, which links different systems wirelessly.</p><p>Fibre-optics components maker Bookham Technology is also a hope for the future. It bucked the trend in the tech sector by floating on the main market in April, when most investors were turning away from tech stocks. Bookham has the technology to manufacture silicon-based fibre-optic components faster and more cheaply than those assembled manually. It is the internet again and the demand for wide bandwidth telecoms applications which is prompting the boom in demand for fibre optics.</p><p>The boom in telecommunications and the expected demand for internet on the move is really driving the IT hardware industry. According to a recent report by Merrill Lynch every large cap stock in the European IT hardware sector has had its earnings forecasts upgraded for 2001 and the sector on aggregate has been upgraded by 8 per cent.</p><p>Nokia recently reported better-than-expected third-quarter results with mobile phone sales rocketing up 59 per cent to E5.46bn. This followed similarly good figures from US companies such as Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.</p><p>Despite the rosy outlook, investors have recently turned sceptical again and the FTSE IT hardware index has lost 28 per cent of its value since early September. Over the past 12 months, however, it has been the best performing sector and seen a 128 per cent increase to 7,066.20. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"24\"

shares have been a runaway success this year. Tobacco has been the second best-performing FTSE 350 sector in 2000, rising 38 per cent and outperforming the index by 51 per cent.</p><p>It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out why. March's technology rout and the growing jitters over the US economy, interest rates, oil prices and inflation, have seen institutions heading for the safety of so-called defensive stocks.</p><p>Negative factors such as US litigation and the prospect of advertising bans are more than outweighed by the tobacco companies' stable earnings profile, high cash generation and juicy dividends. All three companies have been busy cutting costs, pushing through price increases and expanding overseas to boost growth. Improving prospects in emerging markets like eastern Europe and the Far East are also likely to help profits this year.</p><p>ABN Amro forecasts BAT will report a 17 per cent rise in normalised pre-tax profit this year to GBP 2.27bn, boosted by the impact of last year's acquisition of Rothmans, and an 8 per cent rise in the dividend to 28.3p. Imperial is expected to show a 10 per cent rise in profits to GBP 448m and a 10 per cent rise in dividend to 30.25p. Gallaher is expected to report a slight fall in profit to GBP 342m because of the timing of changes in duty last year and the impact on interest charges of the GBP 246m acquisition of Russian cigarette maker Liggett-Ducat. But it should increase the dividend by 6 per cent to 23.5p.</p><p>Gallaher's acquisition of Liggett-Ducat is part of the consolidation process underway in the industry. BAT bought Rothmans last year and Imperial has been on the acquisition trail. Although M&amp;A activity has waned recently, some analysts expect it to pick up next year. Gallaher, the smaller of the three tobacco stocks, is seen as a prime takeover candidate, with BAT seen as one of the likely bidders. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"25\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>Name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0price\u00a0 mkt cap\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0div\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0last IC</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(GBP m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ratio\u00a0 yield\u00a0 recommendation</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(%)</entry></row><row><entry>BRITISH AMERICAN\u00a0 480\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a010,454.39\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fairly priced</entry></row><row><entry>TOBACCO\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(400p, 4 Aug 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>GALLAHER GROUP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0415\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,612.58\u00a0 12.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.06\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fairly priced</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(372p, 14 Sep 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>IMPERIAL TOBACCO \u00a0 695\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03,620.95\u00a0 12.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buy (555p, 12 May</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry/></row><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>IT software/computer services</p><p>After high-tech hype rocketed stocks to stratospheric heights, reality finally bit the IT software sector earlier this year. The bursting of the tech bubble in April and recent jitters over earnings in the US have contributed to the sector losing around 30 per cent of its value since the start of the year, making it the third worst performer of the FTSE 350 in 2000. Since April, the sector is down 54 per cent, under-performing the FTSE 350 by 51 per cent.</p><p>The damage is unlikely to be fatal, however, and indeed many stocks, particularly those new technology stocks with focus on e-commerce and the internet, have retained their stellar ratings. Surfcontrol and Staffware have both made huge gains on the stock market this year through their exposure to web-based activities, even though their revenues at this early stage remain tiny compared to those of older technology stocks such as Computacenter and Sage.</p><p>Computacenter was one the worst performing software stocks this year, with shares losing around two-thirds of their value since January and ongoing concerns over declining margins are unlikely to help its near-term prospects.</p><p>Acquisitions have helped accounting and payroll software supplier Sage maintain its consistently strong performance and the prospects for selling new software and servicing its existing customers remain excellent. Nonetheless, Sage has suffered badly on the markets - shares are down by nearly 40 per cent since the start of the year.</p><p>Independent software and computer services analyst Richard Holway believes the collapse in the share prices of companies like Sage is \"ludicrous.\" \"Future success in the sector will be built on growth in recurring revenues,\" he said, \"rather than over-optimistic forecasts of future earnings\". Over 70 per cent of Sage's current revenues are recurring.</p><p>The shift in sentiment towards e-commerce and internet-based stocks is only likely to be temporary and while there will always be \"flavours of the month\" like Staffware, Mr Holway believes that the backbone of the industry will continue to be represented by those with a solid revenue base like Sage.</p><p>Exposure to mobile telecoms, meanwhile, has helped three of the sector's other established players, Logica, CMG and Sema, to consolidate their high market valuations and largely avoid the big sell-off. Logica's revenues are now 40 per cent-based on mobile networks, while CMG saw its interim operating profits in telecoms rise eight-fold last year.</p><p>Sema, now the world's largest supplier of mobile communications software, did not post quite such impressive growth as CMG but remains well-positioned in a market from which most analysts still expect sky-high growth, despite the disappointing take-up of WAP so far.</p><p>According to Mr Holway's most recent estimates, based on historic PE ratio averages, the IT sector faces a further 20-25 per cent slide in the fourth quarter, before a recovery can begin midway through next year. Of course, that won't stop the market taking a few punts on companies such as Staffware or Telework in the meantime. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"26\"

brokers</p><p>- Investors are now looking at the internet with a more realistic eye. At the height of the frenzy for internet stocks Freeserve was worth over GBP 9bn, but recently fell out of the FTSE100 with a valuation of just GBP 1.7bn. Internet hotel company Telecity floated after the shakeout, but has recently seen investors question its prospects. The shares reached 2,307p in September but are now trading below the 775p issue price at 662p. Freeserve: Good value (337p, 30 June 2000) Telecity: High enough (1,520p, 4 Aug 2000)</p><p>- Claims Direct specialises in personal injury claims and acts as an intermediary between claimants and lawyers. The thing is that Claims Direct has been turning in a heady pace of growth for years and now that legal aid has been scrapped for personal injury cases that trend looks set for a further boost. The shares have risen to over 240p since floating at 180p in July.</p><p>No previous IC coverage</p><p>- Not that long ago the insurance brokers were busily consolidating, but with all the big deals now done Jardine Lloyd Thompson thinks that it's probably set to stay independent. But deal or no deal, business has been good for this company. Brokerage profits continue to roll in and with a decent outlook for energy, property and reinsurance rates, Jardine should have some good times ahead.</p><p>Fairly priced (322p, 4 August 2000)</p><p>aerospace/defence</p><p>The aerospace and defence sector has recently rallied strongly - outperforming the FTSE 350 by 23.9 per cent since March. The weakening of sterling against the dollar, strong defence spending in the US, and the high oil price - which could boost orders from the Middle East - are all cited as factors justifying higher ratings.</p><p>The most attractive companies have either a strong high-tech presence and/or have developed a business model which includes a major servicing element. Alex Hunter of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter identifies BAE Systems and Rolls- Royce in these categories. \"BAE has a strong order book, a high quality of management and is trading on an unusually low rating,\" says Mr Hunter. BAE's commercial aerospace division is performing strongly, producing first-half profits of GBP 34m (compared to break-even in the first half of 1999) and looks set to make further progress in the second half as Airbus continues to win orders for large commercial jets. Airbus's planned super jumbo project, the A3XX looks likely to go ahead and will provide a further avenue for growth.</p><p>Despite seeing its shares slump to 161p in September after a GBP 120m provision was made to meet the cost of new emission regulations on turbines the long- term prospects of Rolls-Royce also appear good. \"Rolls-Royce has a huge earnings potential from servicing engines while its strategy of leveraging its gas turbine technology by expanding out of aerospace into power generation looks like a sound one,\" says Mr Hunter.

A number of companies remain acquisitive and the long-term trend is towards consolidation. Cobham exemplifies this.

The diversified nature of GKN means that even if this growth doesn't materialise, growth should come from elsewhere in the company. In particular, the industrial services division is growing rapidly on the back of a rapidly expanding pallet-pooling business. Good value (903p, 11 August 2000).</p><p>chemicals</p><p>This year has not been an easy ride for the UK chemicals sector. The strength of the pound, the weakness of the euro, a slowdown in demand and the highest oil prices for a decade have squeezed profit margins and frightened off investors by the truckload. On the back of depressed share prices, most companies have consolidated and refocused but the stocks remain broadly out of favour.</p><p>Both ICI and polymer producer British Vita have suffered in tough market conditions. Although there are signs that ICI's transformation from bulk to specialty chemicals producer is beginning to bring its rewards, debt remains a major problem and further disposals are needed before shares mount a sustained recovery.</p><p>Raw materials costs, meanwhile, are likely to maintain pressure on Vita's margins for the near term, although its fundamentals remain robust. While chemical companies have suffered more than most as a result of the tech stocks boom, exposure to technology has helped Johnson Matthey to stand out from the crowd. Interest in its cutting-edge fuel cell technology and a healthy cash position have helped its share price soar by nearly 80 per cent since late last year, bucking the sector's downward trend.</p><p>With the failed Air Products and Air Liquide bids behind it, BOC is making the best of life as an independent in a consolidated industrial gases market. Third-quarter results showed an increase in pre-tax profits on last year and an improved cash flow. It may not be too long before bid speculation casts its shadow once more.</p><p>Laporte took the most extreme step in its own restructuring process in September when it hived off over half the company to focus on specialty organics.

Government statistics suggest the sector hasn't been this profitable since Nigel Lawson was chancellor and Wham were top of the charts. But the City values oil companies in terms of their ability to generate free cash flow over much longer periods. One bumper year in 20 won't change the fundamental picture.</p><p>And those long-term prospects for oil prices are too uncertain to bank on. While Opec has displayed impressive unity as crude prices rise - despite widespread cheating on production quotas - the cartel has yet to prove it can maintain a united front in the face of falling prices. Once the current spike in heating oil passes, the speculative bubble could be ripe for pricking come the spring.</p><p>However, assuming a mid-cycle oil price of $ 18 per barrel, all of the UK's major oil companies would be highly profitable. The questions arise over where future production will come from. Exploration activities are increasingly focused on deep water areas, where both risks and costs are much higher. If Shell is to meet its growth targets, for example, 60 per cent of new output will need to come from deep water wells.</p><p>BP, Shell, Enterprise and Lasmo have all promised shareholders that they'll resist the urge to splurge those exceptional profits on excessive capital expenditure. In any case, after this autumn's fuel protests the British government may well decide that windfall profits merit windfall taxes on North Sea production. However, given the government's stated aim to foster further investment in the North Sea, analysts think it has little leeway to levy any thumping taxes.</p><p>Throughout the year BP has been buying back millions of its own shares. Shell will do the same once changes in Dutch law make it tax efficient to do so. It's essentially a way of returning cash to shareholders without raising dividends to unsustainable levels, but in terms of share price valuations analysts view the trend as neutral. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"29\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>Name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0price\u00a0 mkt cap\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0div\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0last IC recommendation</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(GBP m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ratio\u00a0 yield</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(%)</entry></row><row><entry>BP AMOCO\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0622.5 \u00a0 141,114.25\u00a0 17.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fairly priced (588p, 11</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aug 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>ENTERPRISE\u00a0 554.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,763.41\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buy (591p, 15 Sep 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>OIL</entry></row><row><entry>LASMO\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0144.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01,935.83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.93\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buy (132p, 11 Aug 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>SHELL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0598.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a059,499.27\u00a0 24.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.64 \u00a0 Good value (558p, 11 Aug</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry/></row><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>water</p><p>Water companies have spent most of the past year coming to terms with the regulator's severity. Average price cuts of over 12 per cent this year meant that the sector had to start some serious cost-cutting if it was to avoid widespread dividend cuts.</p><p>But some companies felt costs had been pared to the bone and, already struggling with high debt levels, this has left some with serious problems. Most high profile was Hyder. It has now been taken over by a US electricity consortium.</p><p>An alternative to selling out seems to have been found. That is breaking the business up and separating asset ownership from operation. Selling the assets allows the operating company to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders. A number of companies have expressed an interest.</p><p>Among these, Kelda was the first. It proposed selling its pipelines to a mutual company and then running them on a contract. The regulator blocked the idea because of its details, but the basic idea looks like one that's still got plenty of mileage in it.</p><p>Hyder's new owners want to implement a version of the plan and are seeking to hire an operating company to run Hyder's water network. Anglian Water and Pennon are also expected to make announcements about restructuring soon.</p><p>Partly in reaction to the troubled UK market, British water companies are seeking growth overseas. The international water market is growing rapidly as foreign countries seek to bring increased efficiency to their own water sectors.</p><p>Both Thames Water and Kelda have made acquisitions in the US and Thames and Anglian have been active in the developing world. Thames' strong overseas presence was a key factor behind RWE's recent decision to take it over. With Kelda and Anglian on lower ratings than Thames was, this leaves them looking vulnerable should another buyer emerge. <table pgwide=\"640\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"30\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>Name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0price\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0mkt cap\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0div\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0last IC recommendation</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(p)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(GBP m)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ratio\u00a0 yield</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(%)</entry></row><row><entry>AWG\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0626.5\u00a0 1,837.42\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00.00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fairly priced (555p, 9</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jun 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>KELDA GROUP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0351.0\u00a0 1,379.08\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hold (tip update)</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(320p, 28 Jul 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>PENNON GROUP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0723.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0986.36\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.34\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fairly priced (560p,</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a011 Jul 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>SEVERN TRENT \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0770.0\u00a0 2,636.48\u00a0 11.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.49\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good value (590p, 9</entry></row><row><entry> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jun 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>THAMES WATER\u00a0 1,202.5\u00a0 4,225.66\u00a0 12.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.30 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good value (797p, 26</entry></row><row><entry>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May 2000)</entry></row><row><entry>UNITED\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0695.0\u00a0 3,825.54 \u00a0 8.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buy (704p, 25 Aug</entry></row><row><entry>UTILITIES\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02000)</entry></row><row><entry/></row><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>sector snapshots - distributors</p><p>- Having developed a leading position in UK industrial catalogue distribution, Electrocomponents is applying its successful business model to overseas markets.

The company is scaling up global manufacturing to be able to deliver about 500 million doses and possibly as many as 1 billion doses per year, beginning in 2021.The commission previously announced preliminary plans to secure hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines being developed by the likes of Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford, Sanofi and partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc, as well as CureVac NV.Moderna shares gave up early gains, trading 1.3 lower in New York.24 Aug 2020-03:15PM BSTBalfour Beatty wins \u00a31.3bn contract to extend Hong Kong airportConstruction giant Balfour Beatty has won a \u00a31.3bn contract to extend Hong Kong airport, the company announced on Monday.My colleague Ben Gartside reports:Awarded to its subsidiary Gammon, which is run by Balfour in conjunction with Hong Kong-based Jardine Matheson, the project will encompass an expansion of the airport's second terminal, construction of interconnecting bridges, mechanical and electrical works as well as associated viaducts and roads.Leo Quinn, Balfour Beatty's chief executive, said: \"This award marks Gammon's second significant contract for the Airport Authority Hong Kong this year and the largest single contract ever awarded to Gammon.\" Gammon had already secured another valuable contract in relation to Hong Kong Airport earlier in the year, comprising of tunnel construction and baggage management worth \u00a3760m.Balfour announced a half yearly loss last week of \u00a324m, largely down to the lockdown earlier in the year which had negatively affected their construction business. 24 Aug 2020-02:41PM BSTWall Street rally continues US stocks have opened in the green, pushing on from last week's rally as investors cheer vaccine developments and some easing of tensions between the US and China.

The FTSE is now 1.8pc higher, while France's CAC 40 and the German Dax have both broken the 2pc mark.Equities are being boosted by signs of a progress in coronavirus treatments and a thaw in US and China relations.Over the weekend, President Trump moved to expand access to a virus treatment involving blood plasma from recovered patients.24 Aug 2020-09:29AM BSTWetherspoon warns of annual loss JD Wetherspoon warned that the fallout from the pandemic will push the pub chain to an annual loss, as it said the boost from the Eat Out to Help Out scheme will fade when the programme ends. The operator also said it was looking to discuss waivers for the current fiscal year with its lenders in due course.Sales have been given a boost from the Government's subsidised meal scheme but were still sharply lower compared with the same period last year. It also appealed to the Government to maintain a lower VAT rate for food when the meal subsidy scheme ends.The firm said: Sales have gradually improved, with a rapid acceleration recently, largely due to subsidised food, coffee and soft drinks in the early part of the week. The company nonetheless expects a period of more subdued sales once the scheme for subsidised early-week meals and drinks ends.Chairman Tim Martin also challenged claims made by medical experts that pubs were transmission hubs for Covid-19. He said:Risk cannot be eliminated completely in pubs. But sensible social distancing and hygiene policies, combined with continued assistance and co-operation from the authorities, should minimise it.Shares rose 1.1pc to 985p. 24 Aug 2020-09:06AM BSTBunzl resumes dividend Bunzl resumed dividend payouts after reporting a 16.6pc rise in first-half profit.Pre-tax profits came in at \u00a3306.8m for the six months to June compared to \u00a3264.2m a year earlier.Trading was boosted by robust demand for facemasks, gloves as well as food packaging for the grocery sector.The company, which supplies products ranging from disposable tableware to latex gloves and cleaning chemicals, also announced that it had entered into deals to buy MCR Safety, a US-based personal protection equipment business, and Abco Kovex, a packaging distributor in Ireland. Shares rose 3.9pc to \u00a324.98 in early trading. Chief executive Frank van Zanten said:The recent substantial declines in profitability in the lower margin food service and retail sectors were more than offset by strong performances in the generally higher-margin safety, cleaning &amp; hygiene and healthcare sectors, primarily driven by significant sales volumes of Covid-19 related products including masks, sanitisers, gloves, disinfectants, coveralls, disposables wipes, face shields and eye protection...We have also seen good growth in our grocery businesses.24 Aug 2020-08:48AM BSTMike Ashley swoops on arch rival Dave Whelan's sports empireMore on Frasers...We report:Mike Ashley has swooped on arch rival Dave Whelan's sports empire, buying some of the assets of DW Sports, which entered administration at the start of August.Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and House of Fraser, said the move will \"save a number of jobs\". About 1,700 role were put at risk when DW called in administrators.Frasers will pay \u00a337m to the administrators of DW and the total could rise to \u00a343.9m if it also acquires some leaseholds.The retailer said the deal was for parts of DW's gym and fitness business, including some stock, but did not include the DW business name and its intellectual property.Frasers said the acquisition compliments its existing gym and fitness club portfolio and would place them under its Everlast brand.The move comes after Mr Ashley's retail empire announced last week that it would plough \u00a3100m into online expansion and open stores in shopping centres in an attempt to profit from the collapse of high street rivals.Analysts at Peel Hunt said: \"Mr Ashley has a long record of buying from the administrator, but commentators have pointed out that the DW gyms are 'wet' gyms, which are hard to run very profitably.\"Frasers will doubtless argue that property-wise it has bought a tenner for a fiver, but the main thrust of last week's prelims was that the online strategy would be to the fore, so buying more bricks-and-mortar assets is not aligned.\"DW appointed insolvency specialists earlier this month after trading plummeted when it was forced to shut its stores and gyms during lockdown.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\u200bRead the full story here.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>24 Aug 2020-08:33AM BSTPearson appoints ex-Walt Disney executive Andy Bird as new bossPearson has appointed former Walt Disney International chairman Andy Bird as its new chief executive, replacing longstanding boss John Fallon.

Sydney, Singapore and Wellington were also in positive territory.</p><p>                     Coming up today                   </p><p>Interim results: Bunzl</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-65435017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NM-V7K1-F021-619P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2553\"/><timeReceived>4:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 24, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

You probably think I'm going to blog about what it all means and the implications for financial markets (I did that the other day[1] and back in February[2]). Apparently the vote is the fault of the Northerners and Welsh, which was called out to me by a City colleague over a month ago[3]. His view was that the London market people may all listen to the economic pundits and forecasters, but the average chap on the Clapham Omnibus reads The Sun and <person><nameText>Rupert Murdoch </nameText></person>ran a very effective campaign to Leave. Thanks Rupert[4]. A special thanks for giving the youth of Britain a legacy they do not want. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://3duuql1imy7b2ct4ry35dyw3.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Old.jpeg\">http://3duuql1imy7b2ct4ry35dyw3.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Old.jpeg</url> Following this vote, no one knows what will happen next (although the BBC have a go, as you'll see below). For example, it's interesting to see that England and Wales voted Leave, whilst Scotland and Northern Ireland voted Remain. Is this the start of devolution of the United Kingdom?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://3duuql1imy7b2ct4ry35dyw3.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/UK-vote.jpeg\">http://3duuql1imy7b2ct4ry35dyw3.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/UK-vote.jpeg</url> How Britain Voted from the New York Times[5] No wonder <person><nameText>David Cameron, </nameText></person>our Prime Minister, is exiting following the Brexiting as his position is no longer tenable. Unfortunately, it means we will have never-ending coverage from the BBC, who will no doubt talk about this for months to come. Mind you, if you want to know what it all means, the BBC has a great analysis[6]\u00a0and summarise the exit process as follows[7]. What happens next? Mr Cameron said in the event of a leave vote, he would activate\u00a0Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty[8]\u00a0without undue delay - setting in motion the process of withdrawing from the European Union. George Osborne has suggested this could happen within two weeks of a leave vote. Once Article 50 is triggered, there is no way back into the EU unless by unanimous consent from all other member states. But quitting the EU is not an automatic process - it has to be negotiated with the remaining members. These negotiations are meant to be completed within two years but the European Parliament has a veto over any new agreement formalising the relationship between the UK and the EU. The idea would be to allow other EU leaders the time to realise they need a 'friendly' trade deal with the UK to continue exporting their consumer goods into the British market without tariffs. Also Britain could, technically, ignore all of this, the Vote Leave campaign says, and simply write the EU out of its laws, although that wouldn't make future negotiations any easier. As only one part of one country has ever left the European Community - Greenland more than 30 years ago (read Carolyn Quinn's feature on how they left[9]) - we will be in uncharted territory here. So, depending on when the prime minister triggers Article 50, perhaps at some time in late summer, or early autumn 2016, negotiations will begin in Brussels on the terms of its exit and the nature of the UK's subsequent relationship with the EU. This would involve not only rescinding the European Communities Act, which gives primacy to EU law in the UK, but also sifting through an estimated 80,000 pages of EU agreements, which have been enacted over the past five decades, to decide which will be repealed, amended or retained - a process which Parliament will want to oversee. After two years, the UK would no longer be bound by existing EU Treaties unless both it and the other 27 states agree unanimously to extend the process of negotiations. As the Article 50 two-year deadline approaches after the vote to leave, the prime minister of the day will be under pressure to sort out the terms of Britain's exit and a new trade deal with the EU before the country ceases to be a member. It is possible, say Remain campaigners, that Britain's membership could cease and the UK revert to trading with the EU under World Trade Organization rules, which would involve exporters being hit by import taxes, or tariffs. The deal would have to be agreed by a qualified majority on the council of ministers and be ratified by the member states. It would also have to be agreed by the European Parliament and MPs at Westminster. Under this scenario British ministers would return to Brussels, at some point, to negotiate a more favourable trade deal, which Remain campaigners have warned could take years, maybe even decades, to fully complete. The Leave campaign insists that a favourable trade deal could be done fairly rapidly because it would not be in the interests of France and Germany to lose access to the British market for its consumer goods. They also reject the two-year timetable for exit, saying the government should aim to complete negotiations on a new EU-UK trade deal by 2020. Bankers reactions There's a range of reactions so far that have hit the headlines including Lloyd Blankfein, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, who has stated that 'we respect the decision of the British electorate and have been focused on planning for either referendum outcome for many months.\u00a0Goldman Sachs[10]\u00a0has a long history of adapting to change, and we will work with relevant authorities as the terms of the exit become clear. Our primary focus, as always, remains serving our clients' needs.' Reuters reports that\u00a0Barclays CEO Jes Staley[11]\u00a0said the outcome of the vote would not affect the bank's new strategy of being a 'transatlantic' bank anchored in the UK and US. 'The strategy we announced on 1 March, 2016 was not conditional on the UK remaining in the EU'. Douglas Flint, Chairman of\u00a0HSBC[12] said Friday marked 'a new era for Britain and British business \u2026 the work to establish fresh terms of trade with our European and global partners will be complex and time consuming. We will be working tirelessly in the coming weeks and months to help our customers adjust to and prepare for the new environment.' Meanwhile Mark Carney has reassured the markets by saying[13]: 'There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold. And it will take some time for the United Kingdom to establish new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world. Some market and economic volatility can be expected as this process unfolds. But we are well prepared for this. The Treasury and the Bank of England have engaged in extensive contingency planning and the Chancellor and I have been in close contact, including through the night and this morning. The Bank will not hesitate to take additional measures as required as those markets adjust and the UK economy moves forward.' What does it mean for London as a Fintech Hub\u00a0(according to IB Times[14])? Consensus among the technology community is that Brexit will topple London from its position as the most favoured fintech hub on the planet; the view of many startups and venture capitalists. There are three main reasons for this - firms rely on rolling out products across Europe, many technology companies rely on developers from all over the EU, and the concomitant fear and uncertainly which will curb investment pouring into the capital's tech scene. We are dealing in unknowns right now, but certain legal and regulatory strictures could be mentioned, such as EU laws around data protection which firms were formerly bound by, or the European Commission's attempt to establish a 'Digital Single Market'.\u00a0Adjustments to the regimes around doing business are expected to take a couple of years to iron out and the words 'keep calm and carry on' now seem to be the order of the day. There are around 500 fintech companies in the UK, averaging \u00a325m revenue and a profit of \u00a35m; paying 20% tax this equates to about \u00a35bn over the next ten years. Players in the fintech arena predict the most likely winners would be cities like Amsterdam and Dublin which already boast a progressive regulatory environment, tax advantages and growing technology clusters. Simon Black, CEO, of digital payment platform PPRO Group, said: 'Dublin would probably benefit most within Europe: It has a big tech scene, taxes are particularly low with a 12% corporate rate and major FinTech companies such as MasterCard, Apple, PayPal and First Data already have significant operations there providing critical mass. Black said in an emailed statement that fintech firms 'will see their status as financial institutions recognised across the EU and EEA under threat, all of these businesses will not wait for trade deals to be resolved. They will immediately begin forming plans to relocate at least some of their operations, and the majority of new jobs will be outside of the UK'. Ah well, there you have it. The British have given up their membership of the European Club. #Brexit[15] pic.twitter.com/S8xSP1JeMB[16] \u2014 Bored Elon Musk (@BoredElonMusk) June 24, 2016[17]Finally, in a NSFW moment, here is

The full answers are presented below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Participants were: Tim Worner, Seven West Media; Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co; Paul Anderson, Network Ten; Michael Miller, News Corp; Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media: Patrick Delany, Foxtel; Mike Sneesby, Stan; Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo; Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment; Graham Burke, Village Roadshow; Scott Lorson, FetchTV; Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group; Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network); and Andy Penn, Telstra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Media is going through radical disruption with the rise of tech players like Netflix, social media platforms, digital classifieds and online video. What do you consider to be the biggest threats and the biggest opportunities for your business?</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Andy Penn, Telstra:</p><p>We have seen unparalleled growth in video streaming which shows no sign of slowing. The availability of content anytime, anywhere across a growing number of international and local platforms is a clear benefit for our customers. It is also driving massive demand on our network so the investments we are making -including to lead the market in 5G - is hugely important, and makes us excited to be in the business of connectivity at this time of rapid change. Our goal is to bring customers closer to their passions by delivering the best network, and creating simple and compelling media experiences with our products like Telstra TV and the AFL, NRL, MyFootball, and Netball Live apps. Customers are looking for value, but not at the expense of the customer experience. Our opportunity is to partner with all our customers favourite platforms to bring all that content together, giving them choice, flexibility and a seamless customer experience that truly blends from home to mobile and back again.</p><p>Tim Worner, Seven West Media:</p><p>I'd argue the biggest threat is complacency. The competition for eyeballs and engagement, and the advertising dollars that follow, is intensifying every day. Our marketplace continues to change rapidly and a failure to match the speed of that change inside our company is a threat, no question. But, we have a strong stable of brands, world-class live news, live sport all year round and content that resonates around the world. The opportunity we have is that in this fragmenting world, the value of mass reach will only increase, as will providing advertisers a brand-safe environment and the most rigorous and transparently audited metrics in the market. The exponential demand for content is massive opportunity for Seven Studios. The only way these over the top services can succeed is by having the best fresh content, and they will chew through it at a great rate. We're Australia's biggest producer of high-quality long-form content, and we're already selling to Netflix, to broadcasters in the UK, cable networks in the US and many others around the world. What's also very handy for us is that the battle for eyeballs is now firmly centred around connected TVs, not mobile. And the big digital players have nowhere near as strong a foothold on the big screen as they do on the little screen.</p><p>Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co: </p><p>I'll start with the opportunity. Has always been and will remain our ability to engage with audiences around quality content. It's what Nine does. And when the biggest threat is the competition from new distribution platforms, we've set ourselves the goal to benefit from the content we own and control to make more from those new distribution platforms. We've done that through 9Now, Stan and our growing digital publishing platforms. From an advertising industry perspective, being able to unlock the benefit of greater distribution of our content , and thereby provide great opportunities for advertisers, is the key to success.</p><p>Paul Anderson, Network Ten:</p><p>Digital disruption has brought its challenges but the great thing is that demand for engaging video and audio content is insatiable. We are a premium video content brand, that's our bread and butter, so we are embracing change and are very well placed to grow our business in this ever connected, video obsessed world. Ten has always been different - we are the network for the young and young at heart - and because of that our viewers \"lean in\" to our content. You only have to see how Twitter lights up during The Bachelor or Australian Survivor to see that in action and that's without being able to track the group chats happening on Snapchat, WhatsApp and other platforms. We believe that by producing excellent broadcast quality content that entertains and connects with our audience, they will watch it and engage with it. We can monetise this so we are excited about our future. The opportunity for us is to better connect our content with our viewers, the cord cutters and the cord-nevers, by investing in our platform ecosystem. This means better understanding how audiences want content and giving them, and our advertisers, more of what they want. Our focus is to provide amazing content to our audiences wherever they want it.</p><p>Michael Miller, News Corp:</p><p>Undoubtedly the biggest challenge to all media businesses is the rise of the digital platforms and their impact on the distribution of local content, digital advertising revenues, and consumption of quality journalism. The digital platforms use our unique content to attract and keep users within their ecosystem, yet we are not remunerated for their use of our content. They also intermediate the relationship with our readers and set unreasonable terms on how we can engage with them. The biggest opportunity for News Corp is in being the provider of original, local journalism, with local voices for local audiences. Trust in journalism and ???traditional' mastheads has increased against a backdrop of digital disinformation. The provision of local content and the roles of journalists and editors are important to communities across Australia. The combined Foxtel/FOX SPORTS also presents huge opportunities for News Corp. We have an ambitious strategy to deliver Foxtel's quality sports, news and entertainment content to many more Australians, and have a team of world-class executives to do this.</p><p>Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media:</p><p>The greatest opportunity for us was delivered through the media law reform which enabled the proposed merger with Nine. Once completed, the logic of the deal - strongly growing digital-based earnings across the diversified businesses - will likely generate a market re-rate.</p><p>Patrick Delany, Foxtel:</p><p>The threats and opportunities we face are different sides of the same coin. The biggest threat is the way traditional media has been disrupted by new companies offering content directly to consumers online. Our biggest opportunity is that we have an unbeatable suite of extraordinary content to take on the digital disrupters and we also have the ability to own family viewing in front of the most important screen of all, which is the big TV in every Australian home.</p><p>Mike Sneesby, Stan:</p><p>Even though consumers have quickly taken to streaming TV in the last few years, the shift to internet delivered television is still at a relatively early stage. Stan has become a key part of that evolution in the Australian television landscape and our long-term opportunities come from continuing to lead that evolution from a local Australian perspective.</p><p>Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo:</p><p>Netflix is healthy competition to our television business. Our challenge is to continue working with our television partners to deliver great programming for viewers while providing reliable local news, information and, of course, a trusted and free service. That's our point of difference and our advantage. Spotify and other music streaming services have unquestionably disrupted the audio industry. However, we see this as an opportunity, not only to continue delivering great music, but to constantly improve our local and national shows. Radio remains the place where audiences go to discover new music and to hear about their local community. We have a finger on the local pulse of communities throughout all of Australia and importantly the ability to engage consumers in the real world, which is incredibly unique. People are always going to want to be entertained and we are excited to have new formats that allow us to make audio even more personal. The audio landscape is incredibly fertile right now and Southern Cross' expertise in this space gives us great confidence in our ability to benefit from emerging technology.</p><p>Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment:</p><p>Digital platforms enhance established media such as radio and provide more opportunities for strong brands such as Nova and smooth to diversify their audiences. We have also leveraged our capability in content creation into new digital products such as our mobile platform targeting Millennials, known as GOAT. The increasing connectivity in cars and homes and advancements in voice activation technology provide an opportunity for us to reimagine the customer experience of radio and create more value through new forms of digital interaction with listeners. This requires a delicate balance between continued investment in our very successful core business and making a few bets on the future.</p><p>Graham Burke, Village Roadshow:</p><p>The biggest effect on our company is the additional competition for eyeballs from Netflix. They are able to produce on a global scale and Australia is just a semicolon. However, it's not all bad as it is contributing to enhancing in people's culture film entertainment as major part for what they do. Then when they go out, more inclined to go to the movies because they like filmed drama and want to experience it in a social environment on a big screen.</p><p>Scott Lorson, FetchTV:</p><p>Fetch is an aggregation service offering \"All your Entertainment in one place\". The recent explosion in quality content options, NBN-led improvements in broadband speeds, and strategic move of Telco's into the Entertainment market all serve to validate the Fetch business model and enhance our consumer proposition. We are now swimming downstream with the right product, right partners, and market momentum. Our biggest risk is failing to evolve at a sufficient pace. and conceding our hard earned leadership position a nimble competitor.</p><p>Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group:</p><p>I doubt very much that we are seeing the end of \"radical disruption\" - in fact, it's only a matter of time before the disruptors will be disrupted. It's increasingly difficult to see where disruption is coming from and typically, it won't come from an obvious source. The biggest threat, I believe, is the threat of time or in truth, the lack of it. Consuming information and content will become an even bigger challenge particularly for companies that produce engaging content in real time. Every magazine in the world is being produced in a different way compared to five years ago. The market is changing, the world is changing, people's tastes are changing and as a result, our business is changing. As people's consumption habits evolve, our business evolves and this presents great opportunities for us. We are always on the lookout for opportunities to expand the business.</p><p>Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network):</p><p>Radio is the core of our offering and continues to be as relevant as ever. Its ability to retain and grow audiences during this period of rapid digital disruption is down to its adaptability and understanding of how the consumption of radio is changing. Let's not forget that we're fundamentally a content business with a long history in building audiences and connecting them with our advertising partners. That won't change but we are successfully utilising new technologies to further engage and build audiences by extending our content into digital publishing and social platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Media companies are getting closer to each other, whether that be mergers or sharing production and back-end costs. Are traditional rivalries dead?</emphasis></p><p>Andy Penn, Telstra:</p><p>Traditional rivalries are not dead. Legislation in Australia ensures healthy competition will remain. But consumers are demanding value and we need to adapt to their expectations. That means finding the right economics to deliver a great experience, even when costs required to create and deliver content are high. So companies need to look for synergies, and partnerships across the value chain are becoming more common to capitalise on opportunities to be more cost efficient. In fact, the competition in video streaming is actually growing the total audience size and consumption which is benefiting everyone. So those partnerships are likely to continue. We bring a great deal of technology expertise and a large customer base to the partnerships we have the likes of Foxtel, Netflix, Stan, and the biggest sports in Australia.</p><p>Tim Worner, Seven West Media:</p><p>They are not dead, but it is very different, and that is compared to how it was as recently as, say, two years ago. No question we are now in a world of ???frenemies'. Our mantra is ???collaborate on technology, compete on content'. As we showed with our playout operation joint venture with Nine Entertainment Co, there are opportunities to make savings, and maybe even build growth together. That business just announced Southern Cross as its first outside client. And as much as we have fundamental disagreements with some of the ways the digital giants operate and are allowed to operate, we are clients of theirs, they are customers of ours and we do collaborate from time to time. So again, it's a frenemy relationship.</p><p>Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co:</p><p>In the modern media landscape the notion of rivals who can't work together is dead. Of course we still compete. It's one of the most competitive markets in the world. But there is also recognition that the world has changed and where there is opportunities to build mutually beneficial relationships where it makes strategic sense we will do so - recent examples of this in Nine's case can be seen both with Your Money, a partnership for a business channel between us and News Corp, or the merger of the Nine and Seven playout centres. As Ken Auletta notes in his recent book in an era digital disruption ???frenemies' are increasingly the way of the future.</p><p>Paul Anderson, Network Ten:</p><p>Scale has become incredibly important and this might have something to do with the gargantuan size of the FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) and the eye watering amount of money they can pour into content and technology. Ten is now part of CBS, one of the biggest and most successful mass media companies in the world. We plan to take full advantage of that through leveraging content, technology and monetisation. As to traditional rivalries, yes we are in a very competitive industry but Ten isn't interested in school yard skirmishes with our older rivals, we never have been. Having said that, where it makes sense to collaborate and find better ways to operate and promote our industry then we will always be up for a conversation, frenemy or not.</p><p>Michael Miller, News Corp:</p><p>The competition for consumers and an increased share of clients' marketing dollars has always been fierce and this ferocity is growing. That competitive spirit will always remain. The old silos that divided and separated print, TV and radio have been replaced by multimedia companies. However, where working together makes business sense, we will do. Recent agreements such as the commercial printing deal with Fairfax will help with scale and efficiency and makes commercial sense. Similarly our joint venture with Nine, the Your Money channel; and the arrangement to broadcast Sky News content on WIN regional television network. And while we will continue to compete, as publishers we are strongly aligned in the message that ???The Truth Builds Trust.' This campaign creatively asserts the importance and value of trusted journalism and authentic storytelling - which lies at the heart of our great news brands - to advertisers. It reminds companies of the importance of associating their brand with articles and in environments their customers trust.</p><p>Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media:</p><p>Rivalry in the media will never end. We all care too much. The economic stresses the industry has faced has delivered cooperation at the back end, but competition around journalism and content is as hot as ever.</p><p>Patrick Delany, Foxtel:</p><p>No.</p><p>Mike Sneesby, Stan:</p><p>Many aspects of the media landscape have evolved as international players have entered the market. This means local players have to adjust their business models, strategies and play to their strengths. Inevitability those adjustments, combined with developments in the regulatory environment, will lead to mergers and acquisitions, partnerships and deals that would have seemed impossible three to five years ago.</p><p>Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo:</p><p>Traditional media companies aren't competing on distribution channels, they are competing on content and sales, so it makes sense for us consolidate back office functions and save money which can be better used on delivering great content to engage our respective audiences and advertisers. This is particularly important in the face of emerging players and unregulated giants like Facebook, which have such a clear and inequitable competitive advantage. We have long worked with other regional TV broadcasters on transmission facilities. We are now working with Nine and Seven for TV playout. We have joint ventures with other commercial radio broadcasters to transmit digital radio around Australia. As an industry, we are moving together so we can spend more money on content, remain vibrant and entertain audiences in the great way we always have across new and existing delivery mechanisms.</p><p>Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment:</p><p>I observe most media companies very willing to engage in conversations around operational efficiencies. However, from a strategic point of view, company to company, product to product, competition will remain and to me, we need strive for both. There has always been a bigger win in competitors working together to grow their sector. Industry wide initiatives to better position and promote radio as a sector are now common place with moves into automated holdings and shared streaming apps, to name a few.</p><p>Graham Burke, Village Roadshow:</p><p>In our space we continue to compete in traditional ways and the people that run our Exhibition and Distribution businesses are vitally interested in market share and traditional rivalries are very much alive. Any further mergers are unlikely given ACCC.</p><p>Scott Lorson, FetchTV:</p><p>Australian media organisations are experiencing profound structural shifts brought on by technology advancements, international competition and rapidly shifting viewing behaviours. The consumer is now in control and preference is perishable. Focus has shifted from short-term market share wins to industry wide initiatives to \"protect the species\", as legacy players buy time to re-invent their business models. In this context, all bets are on, enemies are frenemies, and companies must embrace partnerships with traditional and non traditional players to survive and excel. For Fetch, our entire business is built on partnerships, and we consider this orientation to be a core competency and competitive differentiator.</p><p>Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group:</p><p>I believe that if ever there was a time where media companies should and must work together it is now. All media companies are facing challenges that are materially affecting their business. Digital disruption is challenging all traditional media outlets and as such, a collective approach to the challenges ahead is critical.</p><p>Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network):</p><p>While efficiencies and synergies drive a lot of the decision making, rivalry and health competition particularly in the ever accelerating news and content cycle will be needed to maintain quality journalism and combat the era/perception of ???Fake News'. Australian radio is one of the most resilient and innovative markets in the world and that's down to strong competition between networks. We all strive for a greater share of audiences and revenue dollars, producing great content and sales innovations, and that's going to intensify.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook and Google are currently at the heart of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's inquiry into how digital platforms impact media. Given how fast disruption and innovation has moved, is there any point for regulators in trying to keep up?</emphasis></p><p>Andy Penn, Telstra:</p><p>There is absolutely a need for regulators to keep up in what is a rapidly growing, rapidly changing and incredibly important area. It is fast moving but at the end of the day legislation has to be there to make sure consumers are never disadvantaged.</p><p>Tim Worner, Seven West Media:</p><p>Yes, there is every point. There is an urgent need to address the market power of these platforms and to create a more level playing field. The global digital giants are massively impacting the market, both commercially and in the effect they have on local news and content production. And they're doing it free from the regulatory burdens imposed on the rest of us. Already the ACCC inquiry has increased awareness of the lack of transparency and spurious reach and viewability claims of some digital platforms. More work needs to be done to ensure media buyers have access to verified and comparable consumer reach information across different mediums. We also hope that the inquiry will result in real action that will have a lasting benefit to Australian news and content production. Traditional media are the ones investing in accurate and trusted news and public affairs, which is so essential for democracy, and we're the ones investing in local production. We have argued that, given the market power of Google and Facebook, a levy or collective licensing regime needs to be developed to ensure professional content producers are being appropriately remunerated for the monetisation of their content by digital platforms.</p><p>Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co:</p><p>Yes things are constantly changing but there are also themes that have been around for as long as our industry. And working out how new platforms accept responsibility for some of those themes must be a long term agenda. Upholding community standards, negating social harms, upholding accuracy and reliability of information provided to the community are one part. And contribution to our industry and the provision of quality local content to Australians is another. All players must be both held accountable and responsible for what they publish on their platforms and contribute in a meaningful way to our industry and community.</p><p>Paul Anderson, Network Ten:</p><p>It is ridiculous to say that just because technology evolves at lightning speed or companies are enormous and global that they should be allowed to make their own rules. The ACCC inquiry is very interesting and comes at a really key time. The problems some of these tech giants have with transparency, brand safety, data management, privacy and so on are well known. I sense that the Government and Parliament are willing to act if the ACCC thinks that is the right thing to do.</p><p>Michael Miller, News Corp:</p><p>While innovation and disruption will continue to transform businesses, anti-competitive conduct requires regulatory attention and News Corp globally continues to detail the various anti-competitive practices of the digital platforms and how these harm content creation. The current ACCC inquiry is world-leading. Regulators around the world, including in the US and Europe, are now also focused on addressing potential anti-competitive conduct of global digital platforms.</p><p>Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media:</p><p>It's the regulator's job to keep up.</p><p>Patrick Delany, Foxtel:</p><p>Of course we have to keep up. It is not acceptable that the Wild Wild Web allows our content to be stolen and then monetised by Big Tech. It is not acceptable that fake news and fake advertising enrich organisations that take no responsibility for the harm those things cause. Regulators and society at large are resetting their relationship with big tech and I am confident necessary change is coming, not only in the form of sensible regulation, but from a population weary of data abuses by these platforms.</p><p>Mike Sneesby, Stan:</p><p>Absolutely. And in many cases the priority needs to be on carefully removing local regulation that potentially restricts local operators as opposed to creating new regulation.</p><p>Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo:</p><p>Absolutely, but perhaps it should be less about trying to ???keep up' and more about regulating from the outset. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) sets out and enforces a very clear and stringent set of regulations which radio and television broadcasters must adhere to. We believe this is critical to hold us to a high standard of practice and to provide a safe environment for audiences and advertisers. Meanwhile online and social media players remain largely unregulated, allowing them to exploit Australian consumers, all the while paying minimal Australian taxes. We also need to be thinking about appropriate regulation for emerging audio products such as smart speakers and in-car audio software, and we need to be thinking about it now. These new platforms are controlled by a similar small group of large international companies with substantial market power: Amazon, Google and Apple. They don't produce their own audio content but seek to monetise radio and podcast content produced by others. Radio plays an essential role in keeping people informed; local news, emergencies etc. Podcasting is growing in popularity and has a highly engaged and valuable audience. Content creators deserve an even regulatory playing field so they can earn a fair reward for entertaining and informing their audiences. We would encourage the ACCC consider recommending to ACMA and the Government a simple licence mechanism for all digital providers to operate in Australia - ensuring fair and reasonable oversight and consumer protections.</p><p>Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment:</p><p>The faster the pace of disruption, the more important it becomes that regulators ensure a level and fair playing field for the Australian media against multinational tech giants. This does not exist now and the faster the disruption, the more unfair it becomes.</p><p>Graham Burke, Village Roadshow:</p><p>It is absolutely vital that regulators and legislation keep up given the emergence of colossal foreign competitors in our marketplace. This is crucial to protect Australian companies who employ our people. As a kid growing up, I remember Mad Magazine that had black spy and white spy and without protection the black spy will just envelope the universe!</p><p>Scott Lorson, FetchTV:</p><p>Media regulation is often necessary to ensure diverse and local voices, promote competition, protect consumers and combat piracy. Governments and regulators need to show strong leadership if they are to evolve regulation for an industry characterised by rapid change, competing commercial interests and strong media influence. Policy consistency is key, as is pragmatic and forward thinking regulation. The answers are often evident, but the will to action can be lacking.</p><p>Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group:</p><p>It is absolutely critical. Every media company in Australia has, at some time, been subjected to this scrutiny and in my view; I fail to see why there should be any exception.</p><p>Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network):</p><p>We have an unbalanced media sector and the need for authorities to create an even playing field has never been more critical so that global media platforms (and yes, they are media companies!) are held to account and regulated to the same extent as Australian operators. Enforcement of an appropriate degree of regulatory controls is good for the media industry but it must be a level playing field. Commercially, domestic players invest significant resources to ensure compliance and this, in conjunction with the flow of advertising dollars towards global players, is putting pressure on our ability to continually invest in creating and delivering content to our audiences. It's incumbent on the regulator to keep up to ensure that our market approach and business models are judged within the context of the total market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Name two pieces of content, technology or product (one from your organisation, one from a rival) that you admire, and why.</emphasis></p><p>Andy Penn, Telstra:</p><p>Telstra TV. It is the market leading streaming product that brings together all the best services in one place with simple content discovery and cross platform search experience, along with a companion mobile app on IOS and Android. The interface is great, it gives you access to Free to Air, streaming and catch up and the search means you do not have to remember where content is, TTV can tell you what the options are to view it, in SD, HD, free or paid.</p><p>I am also a fan of is Amazon prime. It's a well-developed platform with a great interface providing seamless user experience and a great service. But another reason I like it is they eventually got Garth Brooks to go digital!</p><p>Tim Worner, Seven West Media:</p><p>From Seven Studios, I'd say ???Bride and Prejudice'. This upcoming season is absolutely brilliant and has the chance to be really noisy. From elsewhere, FaceTime is something that allows us to communicate a bit more personally with our kids wherever they might be.</p><p>Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co:</p><p>For us the launch of 9Galaxy our TV automation buying platform has been a game changer for Nine with already 30 per cent of our off peak and multichannel inventory traded on the platform. This removes a significant administrative cost on the business, while simultaneously providing major efficiencies in trading for both us and our clients. We are continuing to invest in this platform and will continue to ramp up its capabilities as the market moves to simplify the TV buying process. A rival's content? I'd have to say Seven's horse racing coverage. It's world class.</p><p>Paul Anderson, Network Ten:</p><p>I am a huge fan of ten daily, our new mobile friendly website that delivers short form content across News, Sport and Entertainment. One of its best features is The Bachelor TL:DRs (\"Too Long Didn't Read\"). Matt Whitehead is ten daily's Senior Entertainment Reporter and someone had the brilliant idea to put a camera on him talking about each ep of The Bachelor, hilarious. I'm loving ten daily's The Bachelorette TL: DRs now too. I love the way voice-controlled virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa are changing our world. They not only cleverly connect devices at home but they also provide excellent collaboration opportunities for companies to extend their brands and services in a different way. We've partnered with Amazon Alexa, for example, to deliver the latest Ten News flash briefings to people throughout the day. They can just call out and say \"Alexa, what's my news?\" to hear the latest headlines. How cool is that?</p><p>Michael Miller, News Corp:</p><p>The Australian's recent podcast series The Teacher's Pet is a stunning example of original, unique content that attracted extraordinary audience numbers - more than 25 million downloads. It is testament to the compelling investigative journalism of Hedley Thomas that this series proved so groundbreaking and such a global success. It is now second on the iTunes podcast chart to My Father The Murderer, created by journalist Nina Young of our digital women's network - whimn.com.au. The AFR's Rich List, modelled on The Sunday Times Rich List in the UK, was a terrific franchise created by John Stensholt. We liked it so much we hired him. Watch this space.</p><p>Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media:</p><p>Our newspapers and digital sites remain a daily miracle. The Americans. A choice binge.</p><p>Patrick Delany, Foxtel:</p><p>The technology I admire most is our magical iQ4 set top box and the smart remotes that are about to join it. The iQ4 is the monster truck of set top boxes and the sharpest brain you can have in your home. The world of content it can seamlessly take you to, including 4K pictures, is next level amazing. The other products you have to watch with a mixture of admiration and trepidation is games like Fortnite. The audience and engagement they achieve is extraordinary and the hold they have on some young people's lives is troubling.</p><p>Mike Sneesby, Stan:</p><p>Well, it's pretty clear that Video-On-Demand is leading an evolution for our eyes and ears, but I'm seriously in awe of how Food-on-Demand is leading an evolution for our bellies. UberEats isn't a rival, but I'm both obsessed and fascinated by the way all this food just turns up at your door. It's really fun to watch an episode of Get Shorty (my current Stan favourite) and see if I can get a sushi platter, a pizza and a burrito to arrive in unison, all while the closing credits are rolling.</p><p>Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo:</p><p>We are incredibly proud of PodcastOne Australia, which produces and distributes the original podcasts of more than 50 Australian creators, and has accomplished more than 60 million downloads since launching in July 2017. It has rapidly become the leading commercial original podcasting platform in Australia. PodcastOne's premium original content model is inspired by Netflix's own archetype, so we certainly see great merit in what Netflix has done for its audience. There is an increasing appetite for original on-demand content and we're excited to continue expanding our already diverse content state, while growing understanding and uptake of the medium among trade and consumers.</p><p>Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment:</p><p>For a refreshingly honest and authentic talk radio show, our FIVEaa team of David &amp; Will (Dave Penberthy and Will Goodings) is a must listen. The show's sustained audience growth in Adelaide shows that intelligent talk does resonate with audiences and challenges the notion that you have to \"shock\" or \"rant\" to connect in commercial talk. From the broader market, The Australian's Teacher's Pet podcast is the best example of the powerful \"lean-in\" experience of podcasting and a demonstration that Australian audio content can compete on a global scale.</p><p>Graham Burke, Village Roadshow:</p><p>In terms of content, technology or product, it is simply a question of the wide array of innovation that is just part and parcel of running every aspect of our businesses in 2018. Singling out one area of admiration is the ability to know our customer, where they live and knowing what they want.</p><p>Scott Lorson, FetchTV:</p><p>The reality is that it has taken contributions across our entire ecosystem to usher in this Golden Era for entertainment viewing. Consumers enjoy unprecedented access to premium programming along with new tools to help search, discover and access that content. They can also view that content on bigger screens with better sound quality and higher resolution, both at home and on the go. As the master aggregator, Fetch are proud to play a central role in simplifying and enriching the entertainment experience for millions of Aussie viewers.</p><p>Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group:</p><p>Female Futures has been a real success story for us. It's a forward-thinking collection of initiatives designed to support Australian women. We made a commitment to use our influential voice to ignite positive change for women. Since August this year, 36 magazine brands had been running a \"No Gender Selective Tax\" campaign in support of removing the GST. This involved editorial and advertising content across all major brands as well as an influencer campaign across social media. We were able to reach around 9 million voters who were directly affected by this sort of policy before the government decided to make the change. Looking internationally, Hello Sunshine has created an interesting new media model for a new age. It's centred on storytelling with women at the core, wherever women are spending their time and attention. They have built a deep and engaged community across film, television, audio, book clubs, digital and live shows to name just a few. It's driven by the authenticity and values of its champion, Reese Witherspoon.</p><p>Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network):</p><p>iHeartradio is our digital entertainment and music streaming platform that now reaches over 1 million registered users. The platform complements our broader digital and social offerings, allowing a seamless content experience for our audiences on whichever platform they choose to consume live radio and other forms of audio including on-demand music and podcasts. The rich data set that we are building will allow for greater personalisation and drive new commercial opportunities for us. Technology is opening up many new and exciting opportunities to consume content. I recently visited a volumetric capture studio and was blown away. It's VR/MR on steroids and the possibilities and creative content experiences are endless.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520068248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKM-YKV1-DY19-C44V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6206\"/><timeReceived>06:45 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The full answers are presented below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Participants were: Tim Worner, Seven West Media; Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co; Paul Anderson, Network Ten; Michael Miller, News Corp; Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media: Patrick Delany, Foxtel; Mike Sneesby, Stan; Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo; Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment; Graham Burke, Village Roadshow; Scott Lorson, FetchTV; Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group; Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network); and Andy Penn, Telstra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Media is going through radical disruption with the rise of tech players like Netflix, social media platforms, digital classifieds and online video. What do you consider to be the biggest threats and the biggest opportunities for your business?</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Andy Penn, Telstra:</p><p>We have seen unparalleled growth in video streaming which shows no sign of slowing. The availability of content anytime, anywhere across a growing number of international and local platforms is a clear benefit for our customers. It is also driving massive demand on our network so the investments we are making -including to lead the market in 5G - is hugely important, and makes us excited to be in the business of connectivity at this time of rapid change. Our goal is to bring customers closer to their passions by delivering the best network, and creating simple and compelling media experiences with our products like Telstra TV and the AFL, NRL, MyFootball, and Netball Live apps. Customers are looking for value, but not at the expense of the customer experience. Our opportunity is to partner with all our customers favourite platforms to bring all that content together, giving them choice, flexibility and a seamless customer experience that truly blends from home to mobile and back again.</p><p>Tim Worner, Seven West Media:</p><p>I'd argue the biggest threat is complacency. The competition for eyeballs and engagement, and the advertising dollars that follow, is intensifying every day. Our marketplace continues to change rapidly and a failure to match the speed of that change inside our company is a threat, no question. But, we have a strong stable of brands, world-class live news, live sport all year round and content that resonates around the world. The opportunity we have is that in this fragmenting world, the value of mass reach will only increase, as will providing advertisers a brand-safe environment and the most rigorous and transparently audited metrics in the market. The exponential demand for content is massive opportunity for Seven Studios. The only way these over the top services can succeed is by having the best fresh content, and they will chew through it at a great rate. We're Australia's biggest producer of high-quality long-form content, and we're already selling to Netflix, to broadcasters in the UK, cable networks in the US and many others around the world. What's also very handy for us is that the battle for eyeballs is now firmly centred around connected TVs, not mobile. And the big digital players have nowhere near as strong a foothold on the big screen as they do on the little screen.</p><p>Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co: </p><p>I'll start with the opportunity. Has always been and will remain our ability to engage with audiences around quality content. It's what Nine does. And when the biggest threat is the competition from new distribution platforms, we've set ourselves the goal to benefit from the content we own and control to make more from those new distribution platforms. We've done that through 9Now, Stan and our growing digital publishing platforms. From an advertising industry perspective, being able to unlock the benefit of greater distribution of our content , and thereby provide great opportunities for advertisers, is the key to success.</p><p>Paul Anderson, Network Ten:</p><p>Digital disruption has brought its challenges but the great thing is that demand for engaging video and audio content is insatiable. We are a premium video content brand, that's our bread and butter, so we are embracing change and are very well placed to grow our business in this ever connected, video obsessed world. Ten has always been different - we are the network for the young and young at heart - and because of that our viewers \"lean in\" to our content. You only have to see how Twitter lights up during The Bachelor or Australian Survivor to see that in action and that's without being able to track the group chats happening on Snapchat, WhatsApp and other platforms. We believe that by producing excellent broadcast quality content that entertains and connects with our audience, they will watch it and engage with it. We can monetise this so we are excited about our future. The opportunity for us is to better connect our content with our viewers, the cord cutters and the cord-nevers, by investing in our platform ecosystem. This means better understanding how audiences want content and giving them, and our advertisers, more of what they want. Our focus is to provide amazing content to our audiences wherever they want it.</p><p>Michael Miller, News Corp:</p><p>Undoubtedly the biggest challenge to all media businesses is the rise of the digital platforms and their impact on the distribution of local content, digital advertising revenues, and consumption of quality journalism. The digital platforms use our unique content to attract and keep users within their ecosystem, yet we are not remunerated for their use of our content. They also intermediate the relationship with our readers and set unreasonable terms on how we can engage with them. The biggest opportunity for News Corp is in being the provider of original, local journalism, with local voices for local audiences. Trust in journalism and ???traditional' mastheads has increased against a backdrop of digital disinformation. The provision of local content and the roles of journalists and editors are important to communities across Australia. The combined Foxtel/FOX SPORTS also presents huge opportunities for News Corp. We have an ambitious strategy to deliver Foxtel's quality sports, news and entertainment content to many more Australians, and have a team of world-class executives to do this.</p><p>Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media:</p><p>The greatest opportunity for us was delivered through the media law reform which enabled the proposed merger with Nine. Once completed, the logic of the deal - strongly growing digital-based earnings across the diversified businesses - will likely generate a market re-rate.</p><p>Patrick Delany, Foxtel:</p><p>The threats and opportunities we face are different sides of the same coin. The biggest threat is the way traditional media has been disrupted by new companies offering content directly to consumers online. Our biggest opportunity is that we have an unbeatable suite of extraordinary content to take on the digital disrupters and we also have the ability to own family viewing in front of the most important screen of all, which is the big TV in every Australian home.</p><p>Mike Sneesby, Stan:</p><p>Even though consumers have quickly taken to streaming TV in the last few years, the shift to internet delivered television is still at a relatively early stage. Stan has become a key part of that evolution in the Australian television landscape and our long-term opportunities come from continuing to lead that evolution from a local Australian perspective.</p><p>Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo:</p><p>Netflix is healthy competition to our television business. Our challenge is to continue working with our television partners to deliver great programming for viewers while providing reliable local news, information and, of course, a trusted and free service. That's our point of difference and our advantage. Spotify and other music streaming services have unquestionably disrupted the audio industry. However, we see this as an opportunity, not only to continue delivering great music, but to constantly improve our local and national shows. Radio remains the place where audiences go to discover new music and to hear about their local community. We have a finger on the local pulse of communities throughout all of Australia and importantly the ability to engage consumers in the real world, which is incredibly unique. People are always going to want to be entertained and we are excited to have new formats that allow us to make audio even more personal. The audio landscape is incredibly fertile right now and Southern Cross' expertise in this space gives us great confidence in our ability to benefit from emerging technology.</p><p>Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment:</p><p>Digital platforms enhance established media such as radio and provide more opportunities for strong brands such as Nova and smooth to diversify their audiences. We have also leveraged our capability in content creation into new digital products such as our mobile platform targeting Millennials, known as GOAT. The increasing connectivity in cars and homes and advancements in voice activation technology provide an opportunity for us to reimagine the customer experience of radio and create more value through new forms of digital interaction with listeners. This requires a delicate balance between continued investment in our very successful core business and making a few bets on the future.</p><p>Graham Burke, Village Roadshow:</p><p>The biggest effect on our company is the additional competition for eyeballs from Netflix. They are able to produce on a global scale and Australia is just a semicolon. However, it's not all bad as it is contributing to enhancing in people's culture film entertainment as major part for what they do. Then when they go out, more inclined to go to the movies because they like filmed drama and want to experience it in a social environment on a big screen.</p><p>Scott Lorson, FetchTV:</p><p>Fetch is an aggregation service offering \"All your Entertainment in one place\". The recent explosion in quality content options, NBN-led improvements in broadband speeds, and strategic move of Telco's into the Entertainment market all serve to validate the Fetch business model and enhance our consumer proposition. We are now swimming downstream with the right product, right partners, and market momentum. Our biggest risk is failing to evolve at a sufficient pace. and conceding our hard earned leadership position a nimble competitor.</p><p>Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group:</p><p>I doubt very much that we are seeing the end of \"radical disruption\" - in fact, it's only a matter of time before the disruptors will be disrupted. It's increasingly difficult to see where disruption is coming from and typically, it won't come from an obvious source. The biggest threat, I believe, is the threat of time or in truth, the lack of it. Consuming information and content will become an even bigger challenge particularly for companies that produce engaging content in real time. Every magazine in the world is being produced in a different way compared to five years ago. The market is changing, the world is changing, people's tastes are changing and as a result, our business is changing. As people's consumption habits evolve, our business evolves and this presents great opportunities for us. We are always on the lookout for opportunities to expand the business.</p><p>Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network):</p><p>Radio is the core of our offering and continues to be as relevant as ever. Its ability to retain and grow audiences during this period of rapid digital disruption is down to its adaptability and understanding of how the consumption of radio is changing. Let's not forget that we're fundamentally a content business with a long history in building audiences and connecting them with our advertising partners. That won't change but we are successfully utilising new technologies to further engage and build audiences by extending our content into digital publishing and social platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Media companies are getting closer to each other, whether that be mergers or sharing production and back-end costs. Are traditional rivalries dead?</emphasis></p><p>Andy Penn, Telstra:</p><p>Traditional rivalries are not dead. Legislation in Australia ensures healthy competition will remain. But consumers are demanding value and we need to adapt to their expectations. That means finding the right economics to deliver a great experience, even when costs required to create and deliver content are high. So companies need to look for synergies, and partnerships across the value chain are becoming more common to capitalise on opportunities to be more cost efficient. In fact, the competition in video streaming is actually growing the total audience size and consumption which is benefiting everyone. So those partnerships are likely to continue. We bring a great deal of technology expertise and a large customer base to the partnerships we have the likes of Foxtel, Netflix, Stan, and the biggest sports in Australia.</p><p>Tim Worner, Seven West Media:</p><p>They are not dead, but it is very different, and that is compared to how it was as recently as, say, two years ago. No question we are now in a world of ???frenemies'. Our mantra is ???collaborate on technology, compete on content'. As we showed with our playout operation joint venture with Nine Entertainment Co, there are opportunities to make savings, and maybe even build growth together. That business just announced Southern Cross as its first outside client. And as much as we have fundamental disagreements with some of the ways the digital giants operate and are allowed to operate, we are clients of theirs, they are customers of ours and we do collaborate from time to time. So again, it's a frenemy relationship.</p><p>Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co:</p><p>In the modern media landscape the notion of rivals who can't work together is dead. Of course we still compete. It's one of the most competitive markets in the world. But there is also recognition that the world has changed and where there is opportunities to build mutually beneficial relationships where it makes strategic sense we will do so - recent examples of this in Nine's case can be seen both with Your Money, a partnership for a business channel between us and News Corp, or the merger of the Nine and Seven playout centres. As Ken Auletta notes in his recent book in an era digital disruption ???frenemies' are increasingly the way of the future.</p><p>Paul Anderson, Network Ten:</p><p>Scale has become incredibly important and this might have something to do with the gargantuan size of the FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) and the eye watering amount of money they can pour into content and technology. Ten is now part of CBS, one of the biggest and most successful mass media companies in the world. We plan to take full advantage of that through leveraging content, technology and monetisation. As to traditional rivalries, yes we are in a very competitive industry but Ten isn't interested in school yard skirmishes with our older rivals, we never have been. Having said that, where it makes sense to collaborate and find better ways to operate and promote our industry then we will always be up for a conversation, frenemy or not.</p><p>Michael Miller, News Corp:</p><p>The competition for consumers and an increased share of clients' marketing dollars has always been fierce and this ferocity is growing. That competitive spirit will always remain. The old silos that divided and separated print, TV and radio have been replaced by multimedia companies. However, where working together makes business sense, we will do. Recent agreements such as the commercial printing deal with Fairfax will help with scale and efficiency and makes commercial sense. Similarly our joint venture with Nine, the Your Money channel; and the arrangement to broadcast Sky News content on WIN regional television network. And while we will continue to compete, as publishers we are strongly aligned in the message that ???The Truth Builds Trust.' This campaign creatively asserts the importance and value of trusted journalism and authentic storytelling - which lies at the heart of our great news brands - to advertisers. It reminds companies of the importance of associating their brand with articles and in environments their customers trust.</p><p>Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media:</p><p>Rivalry in the media will never end. We all care too much. The economic stresses the industry has faced has delivered cooperation at the back end, but competition around journalism and content is as hot as ever.</p><p>Patrick Delany, Foxtel:</p><p>No.</p><p>Mike Sneesby, Stan:</p><p>Many aspects of the media landscape have evolved as international players have entered the market. This means local players have to adjust their business models, strategies and play to their strengths. Inevitability those adjustments, combined with developments in the regulatory environment, will lead to mergers and acquisitions, partnerships and deals that would have seemed impossible three to five years ago.</p><p>Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo:</p><p>Traditional media companies aren't competing on distribution channels, they are competing on content and sales, so it makes sense for us consolidate back office functions and save money which can be better used on delivering great content to engage our respective audiences and advertisers. This is particularly important in the face of emerging players and unregulated giants like Facebook, which have such a clear and inequitable competitive advantage. We have long worked with other regional TV broadcasters on transmission facilities. We are now working with Nine and Seven for TV playout. We have joint ventures with other commercial radio broadcasters to transmit digital radio around Australia. As an industry, we are moving together so we can spend more money on content, remain vibrant and entertain audiences in the great way we always have across new and existing delivery mechanisms.</p><p>Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment:</p><p>I observe most media companies very willing to engage in conversations around operational efficiencies. However, from a strategic point of view, company to company, product to product, competition will remain and to me, we need strive for both. There has always been a bigger win in competitors working together to grow their sector. Industry wide initiatives to better position and promote radio as a sector are now common place with moves into automated holdings and shared streaming apps, to name a few.</p><p>Graham Burke, Village Roadshow:</p><p>In our space we continue to compete in traditional ways and the people that run our Exhibition and Distribution businesses are vitally interested in market share and traditional rivalries are very much alive. Any further mergers are unlikely given ACCC.</p><p>Scott Lorson, FetchTV:</p><p>Australian media organisations are experiencing profound structural shifts brought on by technology advancements, international competition and rapidly shifting viewing behaviours. The consumer is now in control and preference is perishable. Focus has shifted from short-term market share wins to industry wide initiatives to \"protect the species\", as legacy players buy time to re-invent their business models. In this context, all bets are on, enemies are frenemies, and companies must embrace partnerships with traditional and non traditional players to survive and excel. For Fetch, our entire business is built on partnerships, and we consider this orientation to be a core competency and competitive differentiator.</p><p>Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group:</p><p>I believe that if ever there was a time where media companies should and must work together it is now. All media companies are facing challenges that are materially affecting their business. Digital disruption is challenging all traditional media outlets and as such, a collective approach to the challenges ahead is critical.</p><p>Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network):</p><p>While efficiencies and synergies drive a lot of the decision making, rivalry and health competition particularly in the ever accelerating news and content cycle will be needed to maintain quality journalism and combat the era/perception of ???Fake News'. Australian radio is one of the most resilient and innovative markets in the world and that's down to strong competition between networks. We all strive for a greater share of audiences and revenue dollars, producing great content and sales innovations, and that's going to intensify.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook and Google are currently at the heart of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's inquiry into how digital platforms impact media. Given how fast disruption and innovation has moved, is there any point for regulators in trying to keep up?</emphasis></p><p>Andy Penn, Telstra:</p><p>There is absolutely a need for regulators to keep up in what is a rapidly growing, rapidly changing and incredibly important area. It is fast moving but at the end of the day legislation has to be there to make sure consumers are never disadvantaged.</p><p>Tim Worner, Seven West Media:</p><p>Yes, there is every point. There is an urgent need to address the market power of these platforms and to create a more level playing field. The global digital giants are massively impacting the market, both commercially and in the effect they have on local news and content production. And they're doing it free from the regulatory burdens imposed on the rest of us. Already the ACCC inquiry has increased awareness of the lack of transparency and spurious reach and viewability claims of some digital platforms. More work needs to be done to ensure media buyers have access to verified and comparable consumer reach information across different mediums. We also hope that the inquiry will result in real action that will have a lasting benefit to Australian news and content production. Traditional media are the ones investing in accurate and trusted news and public affairs, which is so essential for democracy, and we're the ones investing in local production. We have argued that, given the market power of Google and Facebook, a levy or collective licensing regime needs to be developed to ensure professional content producers are being appropriately remunerated for the monetisation of their content by digital platforms.</p><p>Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co:</p><p>Yes things are constantly changing but there are also themes that have been around for as long as our industry. And working out how new platforms accept responsibility for some of those themes must be a long term agenda. Upholding community standards, negating social harms, upholding accuracy and reliability of information provided to the community are one part. And contribution to our industry and the provision of quality local content to Australians is another. All players must be both held accountable and responsible for what they publish on their platforms and contribute in a meaningful way to our industry and community.</p><p>Paul Anderson, Network Ten:</p><p>It is ridiculous to say that just because technology evolves at lightning speed or companies are enormous and global that they should be allowed to make their own rules. The ACCC inquiry is very interesting and comes at a really key time. The problems some of these tech giants have with transparency, brand safety, data management, privacy and so on are well known. I sense that the Government and Parliament are willing to act if the ACCC thinks that is the right thing to do.</p><p>Michael Miller, News Corp:</p><p>While innovation and disruption will continue to transform businesses, anti-competitive conduct requires regulatory attention and News Corp globally continues to detail the various anti-competitive practices of the digital platforms and how these harm content creation. The current ACCC inquiry is world-leading. Regulators around the world, including in the US and Europe, are now also focused on addressing potential anti-competitive conduct of global digital platforms.</p><p>Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media:</p><p>It's the regulator's job to keep up.</p><p>Patrick Delany, Foxtel:</p><p>Of course we have to keep up. It is not acceptable that the Wild Wild Web allows our content to be stolen and then monetised by Big Tech. It is not acceptable that fake news and fake advertising enrich organisations that take no responsibility for the harm those things cause. Regulators and society at large are resetting their relationship with big tech and I am confident necessary change is coming, not only in the form of sensible regulation, but from a population weary of data abuses by these platforms.</p><p>Mike Sneesby, Stan:</p><p>Absolutely. And in many cases the priority needs to be on carefully removing local regulation that potentially restricts local operators as opposed to creating new regulation.</p><p>Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo:</p><p>Absolutely, but perhaps it should be less about trying to ???keep up' and more about regulating from the outset. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) sets out and enforces a very clear and stringent set of regulations which radio and television broadcasters must adhere to. We believe this is critical to hold us to a high standard of practice and to provide a safe environment for audiences and advertisers. Meanwhile online and social media players remain largely unregulated, allowing them to exploit Australian consumers, all the while paying minimal Australian taxes. We also need to be thinking about appropriate regulation for emerging audio products such as smart speakers and in-car audio software, and we need to be thinking about it now. These new platforms are controlled by a similar small group of large international companies with substantial market power: Amazon, Google and Apple. They don't produce their own audio content but seek to monetise radio and podcast content produced by others. Radio plays an essential role in keeping people informed; local news, emergencies etc. Podcasting is growing in popularity and has a highly engaged and valuable audience. Content creators deserve an even regulatory playing field so they can earn a fair reward for entertaining and informing their audiences. We would encourage the ACCC consider recommending to ACMA and the Government a simple licence mechanism for all digital providers to operate in Australia - ensuring fair and reasonable oversight and consumer protections.</p><p>Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment:</p><p>The faster the pace of disruption, the more important it becomes that regulators ensure a level and fair playing field for the Australian media against multinational tech giants. This does not exist now and the faster the disruption, the more unfair it becomes.</p><p>Graham Burke, Village Roadshow:</p><p>It is absolutely vital that regulators and legislation keep up given the emergence of colossal foreign competitors in our marketplace. This is crucial to protect Australian companies who employ our people. As a kid growing up, I remember Mad Magazine that had black spy and white spy and without protection the black spy will just envelope the universe!</p><p>Scott Lorson, FetchTV:</p><p>Media regulation is often necessary to ensure diverse and local voices, promote competition, protect consumers and combat piracy. Governments and regulators need to show strong leadership if they are to evolve regulation for an industry characterised by rapid change, competing commercial interests and strong media influence. Policy consistency is key, as is pragmatic and forward thinking regulation. The answers are often evident, but the will to action can be lacking.</p><p>Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group:</p><p>It is absolutely critical. Every media company in Australia has, at some time, been subjected to this scrutiny and in my view; I fail to see why there should be any exception.</p><p>Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network):</p><p>We have an unbalanced media sector and the need for authorities to create an even playing field has never been more critical so that global media platforms (and yes, they are media companies!) are held to account and regulated to the same extent as Australian operators. Enforcement of an appropriate degree of regulatory controls is good for the media industry but it must be a level playing field. Commercially, domestic players invest significant resources to ensure compliance and this, in conjunction with the flow of advertising dollars towards global players, is putting pressure on our ability to continually invest in creating and delivering content to our audiences. It's incumbent on the regulator to keep up to ensure that our market approach and business models are judged within the context of the total market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Name two pieces of content, technology or product (one from your organisation, one from a rival) that you admire, and why.</emphasis></p><p>Andy Penn, Telstra:</p><p>Telstra TV. It is the market leading streaming product that brings together all the best services in one place with simple content discovery and cross platform search experience, along with a companion mobile app on IOS and Android. The interface is great, it gives you access to Free to Air, streaming and catch up and the search means you do not have to remember where content is, TTV can tell you what the options are to view it, in SD, HD, free or paid.</p><p>I am also a fan of is Amazon prime. It's a well-developed platform with a great interface providing seamless user experience and a great service. But another reason I like it is they eventually got Garth Brooks to go digital!</p><p>Tim Worner, Seven West Media:</p><p>From Seven Studios, I'd say ???Bride and Prejudice'. This upcoming season is absolutely brilliant and has the chance to be really noisy. From elsewhere, FaceTime is something that allows us to communicate a bit more personally with our kids wherever they might be.</p><p>Hugh Marks, Nine Entertainment Co:</p><p>For us the launch of 9Galaxy our TV automation buying platform has been a game changer for Nine with already 30 per cent of our off peak and multichannel inventory traded on the platform. This removes a significant administrative cost on the business, while simultaneously providing major efficiencies in trading for both us and our clients. We are continuing to invest in this platform and will continue to ramp up its capabilities as the market moves to simplify the TV buying process. A rival's content? I'd have to say Seven's horse racing coverage. It's world class.</p><p>Paul Anderson, Network Ten:</p><p>I am a huge fan of ten daily, our new mobile friendly website that delivers short form content across News, Sport and Entertainment. One of its best features is The Bachelor TL:DRs (\"Too Long Didn't Read\"). Matt Whitehead is ten daily's Senior Entertainment Reporter and someone had the brilliant idea to put a camera on him talking about each ep of The Bachelor, hilarious. I'm loving ten daily's The Bachelorette TL: DRs now too. I love the way voice-controlled virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa are changing our world. They not only cleverly connect devices at home but they also provide excellent collaboration opportunities for companies to extend their brands and services in a different way. We've partnered with Amazon Alexa, for example, to deliver the latest Ten News flash briefings to people throughout the day. They can just call out and say \"Alexa, what's my news?\" to hear the latest headlines. How cool is that?</p><p>Michael Miller, News Corp:</p><p>The Australian's recent podcast series The Teacher's Pet is a stunning example of original, unique content that attracted extraordinary audience numbers - more than 25 million downloads. It is testament to the compelling investigative journalism of Hedley Thomas that this series proved so groundbreaking and such a global success. It is now second on the iTunes podcast chart to My Father The Murderer, created by journalist Nina Young of our digital women's network - whimn.com.au. The AFR's Rich List, modelled on The Sunday Times Rich List in the UK, was a terrific franchise created by John Stensholt. We liked it so much we hired him. Watch this space.</p><p>Greg Hywood, Fairfax Media:</p><p>Our newspapers and digital sites remain a daily miracle. The Americans. A choice binge.</p><p>Patrick Delany, Foxtel:</p><p>The technology I admire most is our magical iQ4 set top box and the smart remotes that are about to join it. The iQ4 is the monster truck of set top boxes and the sharpest brain you can have in your home. The world of content it can seamlessly take you to, including 4K pictures, is next level amazing. The other products you have to watch with a mixture of admiration and trepidation is games like Fortnite. The audience and engagement they achieve is extraordinary and the hold they have on some young people's lives is troubling.</p><p>Mike Sneesby, Stan:</p><p>Well, it's pretty clear that Video-On-Demand is leading an evolution for our eyes and ears, but I'm seriously in awe of how Food-on-Demand is leading an evolution for our bellies. UberEats isn't a rival, but I'm both obsessed and fascinated by the way all this food just turns up at your door. It's really fun to watch an episode of Get Shorty (my current Stan favourite) and see if I can get a sushi platter, a pizza and a burrito to arrive in unison, all while the closing credits are rolling.</p><p>Grant Blackley, Southern Cross Austereo:</p><p>We are incredibly proud of PodcastOne Australia, which produces and distributes the original podcasts of more than 50 Australian creators, and has accomplished more than 60 million downloads since launching in July 2017. It has rapidly become the leading commercial original podcasting platform in Australia. PodcastOne's premium original content model is inspired by Netflix's own archetype, so we certainly see great merit in what Netflix has done for its audience. There is an increasing appetite for original on-demand content and we're excited to continue expanding our already diverse content state, while growing understanding and uptake of the medium among trade and consumers.</p><p>Cathy O'Connor, Nova Entertainment:</p><p>For a refreshingly honest and authentic talk radio show, our FIVEaa team of David &amp; Will (Dave Penberthy and Will Goodings) is a must listen. The show's sustained audience growth in Adelaide shows that intelligent talk does resonate with audiences and challenges the notion that you have to \"shock\" or \"rant\" to connect in commercial talk. From the broader market, The Australian's Teacher's Pet podcast is the best example of the powerful \"lean-in\" experience of podcasting and a demonstration that Australian audio content can compete on a global scale.</p><p>Graham Burke, Village Roadshow:</p><p>In terms of content, technology or product, it is simply a question of the wide array of innovation that is just part and parcel of running every aspect of our businesses in 2018. Singling out one area of admiration is the ability to know our customer, where they live and knowing what they want.</p><p>Scott Lorson, FetchTV:</p><p>The reality is that it has taken contributions across our entire ecosystem to usher in this Golden Era for entertainment viewing. Consumers enjoy unprecedented access to premium programming along with new tools to help search, discover and access that content. They can also view that content on bigger screens with better sound quality and higher resolution, both at home and on the go. As the master aggregator, Fetch are proud to play a central role in simplifying and enriching the entertainment experience for millions of Aussie viewers.</p><p>Paul Dykzeul, Bauer Media Group:</p><p>Female Futures has been a real success story for us. It's a forward-thinking collection of initiatives designed to support Australian women. We made a commitment to use our influential voice to ignite positive change for women. Since August this year, 36 magazine brands had been running a \"No Gender Selective Tax\" campaign in support of removing the GST. This involved editorial and advertising content across all major brands as well as an influencer campaign across social media. We were able to reach around 9 million voters who were directly affected by this sort of policy before the government decided to make the change. Looking internationally, Hello Sunshine has created an interesting new media model for a new age. It's centred on storytelling with women at the core, wherever women are spending their time and attention. They have built a deep and engaged community across film, television, audio, book clubs, digital and live shows to name just a few. It's driven by the authenticity and values of its champion, Reese Witherspoon.</p><p>Ciaran Davis, Here There &amp; Everywhere (Australian Radio Network):</p><p>iHeartradio is our digital entertainment and music streaming platform that now reaches over 1 million registered users. The platform complements our broader digital and social offerings, allowing a seamless content experience for our audiences on whichever platform they choose to consume live radio and other forms of audio including on-demand music and podcasts. The rich data set that we are building will allow for greater personalisation and drive new commercial opportunities for us. Technology is opening up many new and exciting opportunities to consume content. I recently visited a volumetric capture studio and was blown away. It's VR/MR on steroids and the possibilities and creative content experiences are endless.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520068248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKM-YKV1-DY19-C451-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6206\"/><timeReceived>06:45 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They both believe in \"free enterprise\" -- a free and unregulated market (a capitalism with no rules). The Libertarians can't do much about it, but the conservative Republicans have been trying to force their free market utopia on this country for decades (since the Reagan administration).&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p>And they have been fairly successful in that effort, by giving unregulated capitalism a new name -- \"Trickle-Down\" economics. They had a lot of Americans fooled into believing that removing regulations on corporations and financial institutions, destroying (or at least weakening) labor unions, and cutting taxes for the rich and corporations would be beneficial for all Americans.&lt;nl/&gt;They lied. What it really did was shrink the middle class, stagnate wages for most Americans, induce the exporting of good American jobs, increase poverty, and cause the biggest recession in this country since the Great Depression (a recession that many Americans still haven't recovered from). That doesn't matter to the Republicans -- who only care about putting more money into the pockets of their rich friends and donors. They could care less about ordinary Americans, and because of that, they still cling to their failed economic policy.&lt;nl/&gt;Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich says they are sending America back to the late Nineteenth Century[1], and he has a point. The Republicans would love to replay that time in American history -- a time when Big Business ruled, and workers had no rights. Here is what he had to say:&lt;nl/&gt;My recent column[2] about the growth of on-demand jobs like Uber making life less predictable and secure for workers unleashed a small barrage of criticism from some who contend that workers get what they're worth in the market.A\u00a0Forbes Magazine\u00a0contributor, for example,\u00a0writes[3]\u00a0that jobs exist only 'when both employer and employee are happy with the deal being made.' So if the new jobs are low-paying and irregular, too bad.Much the same argument was voiced in the late nineteenth century over alleged 'freedom of contract.[4]' Any deal between employees and workers was assumed to be fine if both sides voluntarily agreed to it.\u00a0It was an era when many workers were 'happy' to toil twelve-hour days in sweat shops for lack of any better alternative.\u00a0It was also a time of great wealth for a few and squalor for many. And of corruption, as the lackeys of robber barons deposited sacks of cash on the desks of pliant legislators.Finally, after decades of labor strife and political tumult, the twentieth century brought an understanding that capitalism requires\u00a0minimum standards[5]\u00a0of decency and fairness - workplace safety, a minimum wage, maximum hours (and time-and-a-half for overtime), and a ban on child labor.We also learned that capitalism needs a fair balance of power between big corporations and workers.\u00a0We achieved that through antitrust laws that reduced the capacity of giant corporations to impose their will, and labor laws that allowed workers to organize and bargain collectively.\u00a0By the 1950s, when\u00a035 percent\u00a0[6]of private-sector workers belonged to a labor union, they were able to negotiate higher wages and better working conditions than employers would otherwise have been 'happy' to provide.But now we seem to be heading back to nineteenth century.Corporations are shifting full-time work onto temps, free-lancers, and contract workers who fall outside the labor protections established decades ago.The nation's biggest corporations and Wall Street banks are larger and more potent than ever.\u00a0And labor union membership has shrunk to fewer than 7 percent of private-sector workers.So it's not surprising we're once again hearing that workers are worth no more than what they can get in the market.But as we should have learned a century ago, markets don't exist in nature. They're created by human beings. The real question is how they're organized and for whose benefit.In the late nineteenth century they were organized for the benefit of a few at the top.\u00a0But by the middle of the twentieth century they were organized for the vast majority.During the thirty years after the end of World War II, as the economy doubled in size, so did the wages of most Americans \u2014 along with improved hours and working conditions.Yet since around 1980, even though the economy has doubled once again (the Great Recession notwithstanding), the wages most Americans have stagnated. And their benefits and working conditions have deteriorated.\u00a0This isn't because most Americans are worth less. In fact, worker productivity<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bls.gov/lpc\">http://www.bls.gov/lpc</url>/\u00a0is\u00a0higher[7]\u00a0than ever.\u00a0It's because big corporations, Wall Street, and some enormously rich individuals have gained political power to organize the market in ways that have enhanced their wealth while leaving most Americans behind.That includes\u00a0trade agreements[8]\u00a0protecting the intellectual property of large corporations and Wall Street's financial assets, but not American jobs and wages.Bailouts of big Wall Street banks and their executives and shareholders when they can't pay what they owe, but not of homeowners who can't meet their mortgage payments.\u00a0Bankruptcy protection for big corporations, allowing them to shed their debts, including labor contracts. But no bankruptcy protection for college graduates over-burdened with student debts.Antitrust leniency toward a vast swathe of American industry - including Big Cable (Comcast, AT...Time-Warner), Big Tech (Amazon, Google), Big Pharma, the largest Wall Street banks, and giant retailers (Walmart).But less tolerance toward labor unions \u2014 as workers trying to form unions are fired with impunity, and more states adopt so-called\u00a0'right-to-work' laws[9]\u00a0that undermine unions. We seem to be heading full speed back to the late nineteenth century.\u00a0So what will be the galvanizing force for change this time?\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;       \u00a0    <url

Fullstack Academy cofounders David Yang and Nimit Maru plan to run the two companies as separate entities, but will unify their pricing structures and borrow back and forth between the two curriculums. Fullstack Academy will open its second school in Chicago in an office within 1871, the city's digital startup hub. (Fullstack's first location is at 5 Hanover Square in Manhattan's Financial District.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are not going to be competing - we are one company now,\" Maru said in a phone interview. \"We're going to be working with them in Chicago, where they built a really great brand...Starter League has an array of high-curriculum software that we'll be able to take advantage of and a strong alumni base in Chicago. We'll share cultural practices, too.\"</p><p>Starter League CEO Neal Sales-Griffin, who cofounded the company with Mike McGee, will stay on for the transition.</p><p>Fullstack, a Y Combinator-backed firm, has a team of about 34 full-time employees, while The Starter League has relied upon contractors. Those Chicago-area contractors will be offered full-time jobs if they would like to stay on as employees, Maru said, but Fullstack's model is to hire people only as employees. \"Not everyone will decide to join,\" he predicted.</p><p>Coding schools have become a big business. While Code Academy is credited with being among the first, there are now 100 such boot camps for coders around the world. Course Report, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.coursereport.com/resources/course-report-2015-bootcamp-market-size-study\">in its 2015 market size report,</url> forecasted that 16,056 students would graduate from coding schools in 2015, a 138 percent increase from 6,740 students in 2014. Coding bootcamps were expected to generate $172 million in tuition revenue in 2015, more than double the $52 million they raked in for 2014.</p><p>Fullstack cofounder David Yang said that the company has not taken in any additional venture funding or investment since its Y Combinator days. It is a for-profit business, but it is regulated as an educational institution by the states in which it operates.</p><p>\"We really want to build a Fullstack and we care a lot about sustainability. Educational institutions can last for tens of hundreds of years, and we want to be doing the right thing,\" Yang said.</p><p>Fullstack graduates - 400 have gone through the program since it launched in 2014-are typically amateur coders who might have taken a class or two previously but are not engineers. This has not hurt their chances of getting a job at a big firm. Alumni have gone on to work at big tech companies including Facebook (Nasdaq: FB), Google (Nasdaq: GOOG), Dropbox and Palantir. The 17-week full-time immersive class costs $16,810, while a flex immersive program that is part-time and takes twice as long is priced at $15,080.</p><p>It's pricey, yet can be cheaper than a four-year degree in computer science.</p><p>\"The way I would compare it is it's like having a major in biology versus medical school,\" Maru said, adding that the latter \"focuses a lot on the theory but not the practice of how employees are using this in the real world.\"</p><p>As a result of the acquisition, The Starter League's prices will be placed in line with those of Fullstack, Maru said. Backed by Basecamp, which is the birthplace of Ruby on Rails, the Starter League has graduated students who tend to go on to start their own companies. Among the 1,400 people who have been through the program since its inception, founders have started WeDeliver (which was acquired), ReliefWatch, BallotReady, Launchpad Lab, Know Your Company, as well as future coding bootcamps, such as MakerSquare (acquired), Bitmaker, and DevPoint Labs.</p><p>Fullstack Academy is currently accepting applications to its full-time software engineering immersive in Chicago via its website. The remote component of this program, Foundations, will start in May, while on-premise classes will start in June.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

It's also got a sizable lead on music streamers, with more than 50 million paid subscribers. <person><nameText>Spotify </nameText></person>confirmed it hired banks Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Allen &amp; Co. to advise on an IPO.  </p><p>  Whether <person><nameText>Spotify's </nameText></person>big valuation can aid interest in Pandora remains to be seen. </p><p>  Tweet endorsement </p><p>  Alphabet may be breathing a big sigh of relief. </p><p>  Interim Federal Trade Commission Chair Maureen Ohlhausen has risen to become the favorite to land the permanent spot in what would be a surprise, a source told our Josh Kosman. </p><p>  Ohlhausen was an FTC commissioner when the regulator voted in 2013 to close an investigation into Google's alleged monopolistic activity. </p><p>  The former favorite to be FTC Chair, Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, was far more likely to open a probe into whether Alphabet improperly pressured mobile phone makers to install Google apps on their phones, sources said. </p><p>  Former FTC Commissioner Josh Wright, who was on President Trump's Department of Justice transition team, may have tipped the scales for Ohlhausen in a May 9 tweet stating that she \"will make an excellent chair\" and the appointment to the position was \"long overdue.\" </p><p>  Wright has not always been friendly with the fellow Republican Ohlhausen, the source said, making his endorsement even more noteworthy. </p><p>  Trump would find it easier to name Ohlhausen, since she would not require Senate confirmation as she has already been confirmed.  </p><p>  Ohmmmmm </p><p>  May is National Meditation month, and that seems to be the topic on everyone's mind. </p><p>  Jennifer Gould Keil reports that supermodel Gisele Bundchen (pictured) told a crowd at the David Lynch Foundation's Women of Vision Humanitarian Awards that she meditates whenever she can, even in the back seat of a New York City taxi.  </p><p>  Robin Roberts, a co-anchor of ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" also told emcee Rosanna Scotto that she now gets up at 3:15 a.m. instead of 4 a.m. - to meditate. Her co-host George Stephanopoulos also practices transcendental meditation, or TM.  </p><p>  Roberts and Bundchen were among the honorees at the awards dinner. </p><p>  Meditation may even have helped actor Leonardo DiCaprio win his first Oscar - a prize that had long eluded him - as he meditated with Montreal-based expert Lynne Goldberg while he was filming \"The Revenant\" in Calgary.  </p><p>  Goldberg is in town to spread the meditation mantra - and her app, OMG. I Can Meditate!  </p><p>  While the transcendental meditation taught through the Lynch Foundation, which also uses meditation as a tool to help veterans and victims of sexual and domestic abuse, touts 20 minutes twice a day, Goldberg has an app for 1-, 2- and 5-minute meditation options.  </p><p>  On the 'Stick' </p><p>  Mark Aaron James, an indie singer and musician, released his newest album, the aptly named \"My Mighty MAJic Stick,\" last week. </p><p>  The recording is the first nationally distributed album that is physically available only on USB drive (in addition to online downloads and streaming platforms).  </p><p>  The flash drive is shaped like a credit card and offers an additional 2 GB of memory.  </p><p>  James says of the format, \"With computers rarely incorporating CD drives anymore, and most consumers listening on digital players, it seemed a logical format to experiment with. It's exciting to try something new.\"  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>GISELE BUNDCHEN.

All of it.Read Attorney General Barr's Speech Blasting Hollywood, Big Tech On Risks Of Corporate Collaboration With ChinaBarr forcefully outlined the specific risks of American industries' deep entanglements with the Chinese Communist Party, from Hollywood to Big Tech. By Emily Jashinsky, The Federalist, [1]July 16, 2020 In a Thursday speech at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, Attorney General William Barr delivered strong and detailed remarks aimed at exposing the Chinese Communist Party's 'economic blitzkrieg,' which Barr described as 'an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower.' Barr forcefully outlined the specific risks of American industries' deep entanglements with the CCP, from Hollywood to Big Tech. </p><p>'American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report,' the attorney general said. 'But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.' [embedded content] A full transcript of Barr's remarks is below. TRANSCRIPT: Thank you, Andrew for that very kind introduction and for the excellent work that you and your team have done in protecting the people of the Western District of Michigan. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum \u2014 especially Director Elaine Didier \u2014 for hosting today's event. I'd also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging. Thank you for accommodating us. I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today. It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century \u2014 that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future. Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that '[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.'[1][2] Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities.[2][3] In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party. It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America's reengagement with the People's Republic of China, which began with President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong. At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. Yet even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote: 'If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people . This last impression\u2014of the reality of China's colossal potential\u2014is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.'[3][4] It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass. Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China's remarkable rise, had a famous motto: 'hide your strength and bide your time.'[4][5] That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today. By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving 'closer to center stage,' 'building a socialism that is superior to capitalism,' and replacing the American Dream with the 'Chinese solution.'[5][6] China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived. The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg\u2014an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party's 'Made in China 2025' initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, 'Made in China 2025' sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether. 'Made in China 2025' is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China. The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's 'Belt and Road' infrastructure initiative. Although billed as 'foreign aid,' in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism. Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its 'Digital Silk Road' initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go. AI long ago outmatched the world's chess grandmasters. But the PRC's interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea. The following year, Beijing unveiled its 'Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,' a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence. The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production.[6][7] 'Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,' in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation.[7][8] The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer \u2014 allowing us to serve as the world's 'arsenal of democracy.' China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's 'arsenal of dictatorship.' How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion. Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled 'How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.'[8][9] The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing. Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers \u2014 including American companies \u2014 from exporting them to countries in need. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing. China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively 'creating their own competitors.'[9][10] America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as 'APIs.' As one Defense Health Agency official noted, '[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],' it 'could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.'[10][11] To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a 'high-value-added-industry' and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates.[11][12] Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies. In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs. As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, '[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.'[12][13] Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps. If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, 'the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.'[13][14] Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil. All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence\u2014even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion. Take Hollywood. Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences. For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.) But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized. In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the 'Ancient One,' a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that 'if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.'[14][15] Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say '[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.'[15][16] These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party. The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market\u2014both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier. But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood\u2014and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, '[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.'[16][17] Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China. Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which 'liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.'[17][18] Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China\u2014the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship. Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud. The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives \u2014 efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view. As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a 'friendly face' on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed. America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the 'guanxi' \u2014 or system of influential social networks\u2014necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

But it does require those who are acting as the 'agents' of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility.[18][19] These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern. By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded 'Confucius Institutes,' which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands. In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength. Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood that. They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values. In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces. I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a 'stupid mistake.'[19][20] Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours. Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks. American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive. During the Cold War, Lewis Powell \u2014 later Justice Powell \u2014 sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. '[T]he time has come,' he said, 'indeed, it is long overdue\u2014for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.'[20][21] So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement. If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: 'Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.'[21][22] Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule. The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before. If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we\u2014the American people, American government, and American business together\u2014can do it again. Our freedom depends on it. [1][23] Robert C.

All of it.   Read Attorney General Barr\u2019s Speech Blasting Hollywood, Big Tech On Risks Of Corporate Collaboration With China   Barr forcefully outlined the specific risks of American industries\u2019 deep entanglements with the Chinese Communist Party, from Hollywood to Big Tech.    By Emily Jashinsky, The Federalist, July 16, 2020    In a Thursday speech at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, Attorney General William Barr delivered strong and detailed remarks aimed at exposing the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s \u201ceconomic blitzkrieg,\u201d which Barr described as \u201can aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world\u2019s preeminent superpower.\u201d    Barr forcefully outlined the specific risks of American industries\u2019 deep entanglements with the CCP, from Hollywood to Big Tech. \u201cAmerican companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report,\u201d the attorney general said. \u201cBut if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.\u201d    [embedded content]    A full transcript of Barr\u2019s remarks is below.    TRANSCRIPT:    Thank you, Andrew for that very kind introduction and for the excellent work that you and your team have done in protecting the people of the Western District of Michigan.  I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum \u2014 especially Director Elaine Didier \u2014 for hosting today\u2019s event.  I\u2019d also like to offer a special thanks to the Ford Presidential Foundation and Executive Director Joe Calvaruso.  Even under normal circumstances, hosting an event can be a challenge, but these days, I know it is especially challenging.  Thank you for accommodating us.  I am also grateful to you, the audience, for honoring me with your presence today.    It is a privilege to be here to speak about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century \u2014 that is, the United States\u2019 response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party.  The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world.  It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rules-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship.  How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will control the future.    Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien spoke about the CCP\u2019s ideology and global ambitions.  He declared, and I agree, that \u201c[t]he days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People\u2019s Republic of China are over.\u201d [1]  Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities. [2]   In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world.  I hope these speeches will inspire the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Communist Party.    It is fitting that we are here today at the Ford Presidential Museum.  Gerald Ford served at the highest echelons of our government at the dawn of America\u2019s reengagement with the People\u2019s Republic of China, which began with President Nixon\u2019s historic visit in 1972.  Three years later, in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders, including Mao Zedong.    At the time, it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States.  Yet even then, there were signs of China\u2019s immense latent power.  In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then-Minority Leader Ford wrote:  \u201cIf she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge a self-sufficient power of a billion people \u2026. This last impression\u2014of the reality of China\u2019s colossal potential\u2014is perhaps the most vivid of our journey.  As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\u201d [3]   It is now nearly fifty years later, and the prescient ponderings of these two congressmen have come to pass.    Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reforms launched China\u2019s remarkable rise, had a famous motto: \u201chide your strength and bide your time.\u201d [4]   That is precisely what China has done.  China\u2019s economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world\u2019s GDP in 1980 to nearly 20 percent today.  By some estimates, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours.  The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving \u201ccloser to center stage,\u201d \u201cbuilding a socialism that is superior to capitalism,\u201d and replacing the American Dream with the \u201cChinese solution.\u201d [5]   China is no longer hiding its strength, nor biding its time.  From the perspective of its communist rulers, China\u2019s time has arrived.    The People\u2019s Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg\u2014an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world\u2019s preeminent superpower.  A centerpiece of this effort is the Communist Party\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles.  Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership.  Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications.  It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.    \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d is the latest iteration of the PRC\u2019s state-led, mercantilist economic model.  For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy.  To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China\u2019s communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and espionage.  About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have had a nexus to China.    The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific.  In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world\u2019s maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors\u2019 ships and fishing boats.    Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure initiative.  Although billed as \u201cforeign aid,\u201d in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC\u2019s strategic interests and domestic economic needs.  For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017.  This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.    Just as consequential, however, are the PRC\u2019s plans to dominate the world\u2019s digital infrastructure through its \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d initiative.  I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world\u2019s most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G.  Perhaps less widely known are the PRC\u2019s efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence.  Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill such as chess or the even more complex Chinese strategy game Go.  AI long ago outmatched the world\u2019s chess grandmasters.  But the PRC\u2019s interest in AI accelerated in 2016, when AlphaGo, a program developed by a subsidiary of Google, beat the world champion Go player at a match in South Korea.  The following year, Beijing unveiled its \u201cNext Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\u201d a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030.  Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.    The PRC\u2019s drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware.  According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. [6]   \u201cSince then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\u201d in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter environmental regulation. [7]    The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these materials.  Overall, China is America\u2019s top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports.  The risks of dependence are real.  In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea.  The PRC could do the same to us.    As China\u2019s progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC\u2019s predatory economic policies are succeeding.  For a hundred years, America was the world\u2019s largest manufacturer \u2014 allowing us to serve as the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of democracy.\u201d  China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010.  The PRC is now the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of dictatorship.\u201d    How did China accomplish all this?  No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people.  At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China\u2019s meteoric rise possible.  China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade.  In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status.  In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations.  Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.    Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \u201cHow America\u2019s Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\u201d [8]  The article details how China\u2019s communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile.  The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies.  Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits.  Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.    Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services.  The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on that dependency.  For example, China is the world\u2019s largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns.  In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers \u2014 including American companies \u2014 from exporting them to countries in need.  It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing.    China\u2019s dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns.  It has become the United States\u2019 largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China.  China\u2019s government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft.  As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \u201ccreating their own competitors.\u201d [9]    America also depends on Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals.  America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world\u2019s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \u201cAPIs.\u201d  As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \u201c[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\u201d it \u201ccould result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\u201d [10]    To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China\u2019s rulers went to the same playbook they used to gut other American industries.  In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \u201chigh-value-added-industry\u201d and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. [11]   Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies.  American firms face well-known obstacles in China\u2019s health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China.  And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.    In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers.  Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.    As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China\u2019s rulers isn\u2019t to trade with the United States.  It is to raid the United States.  If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards.  But in the end, the PRC\u2019s goal is to replace you.  As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, \u201c[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\u201d [12]    Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China\u2019s political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed.  As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.  It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary.  The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.    If what happened in China stayed in China, that would all be bad enough.  But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America.  As this Administration\u2019s China Strategy recognizes, \u201cthe CCP\u2019s campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China\u2019s borders.\u201d [13]   Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.    All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence\u2014even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States.  Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.    Take Hollywood.  Hollywood actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit.  And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood\u2019s ideals of social justice.  But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world\u2019s most powerful violator of human rights.  This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.    For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus.  The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China.  (In the novel, Patient Zero is a boy from Chongqing.)  But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal.  The deal never materialized.    In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange , filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \u201cAncient One,\u201d a Tibetan monk in the comic books, from Tibetan to Celtic.  When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \u201cif you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he\u2019s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\u201d [14]  Or, he continued, the Chinese government might say \u201c[w]e\u2019re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\u201d [15]    These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to conform to CCP propaganda.  National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien offered even more examples in his remarks.  But many more scripts likely never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits.  Chinese government censors don\u2019t need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them.  This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.    The story of the film industry\u2019s submission to the CCP is a familiar one.  In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world\u2019s largest box office.  The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market\u2014both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China\u2019s WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime.  Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing.  In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only 3.8 percent five years earlier.    But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than co-opting Hollywood\u2014and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions.  To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi.  By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain access to U.S. technology and know-how.  As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \u201c[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\u201d [16]   Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.    Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC.  America\u2019s big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.    In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \u201cliberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\u201d [17]   Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies such as Cisco helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China\u2014the world\u2019s most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.    Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP.  For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests.  Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store.  Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the CCP easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the cloud.    The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence.  More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives \u2014 efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.    As China\u2019s government loses credibility around the world, the Department of Justice has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party.  Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC\u2019s request.  Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence and put a \u201cfriendly face\u201d on pro-regime policies.  The legislator or policymaker who hears from a fellow American is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner.  And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.    America\u2019s corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists.  You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \u201cguanxi\u201d \u2014 or system of influential social networks\u2014necessary to do business with the PRC.  But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct.  But it does require those who are acting as the \u201cagents\u201d of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship and their political or other similar activities by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating its credibility. [18]    These requirements are designed not to stifle your rights to free expression, which are protected by the First Amendment, but rather to ensure that the American public and their legislators can discern what or who is the true source of speech on matters of public concern.    By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations.  The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions.  For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \u201cConfucius Institutes,\u201d which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing.  Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP\u2019s demands.    In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions.  But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America\u2019s economic, technological, and military strength.    Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom.  A world marching to the beat of Communist China\u2019s drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.    There was a time American companies understood that.  They saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.    In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics.  During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films.  To boost the morale of America\u2019s troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.    I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.  When Disney produced Kundun , the 1997 film about the PRC\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it.  Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn\u2019t let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States.    But that moment of courage wouldn\u2019t last long.  After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access.  The CEO apologized for Kundun , calling it a \u201cstupid mistake.\u201d [19]   Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai.  As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management.  Of the park\u2019s 11,000 full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party.  They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures during business hours.    Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles.  Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.    American companies must understand the stakes.  The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarterly earnings report.  But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.    During the Cold War, Lewis Powell \u2014 later Justice Powell \u2014 sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it.  \u201c[T]he time has come,\u201d he said, \u201cindeed, it is long overdue\u2014for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\u201d [20]    So too today.  The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods.  And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.    If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers.  As Justice Powell wrote: \u201cStrength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\u201d [21]   Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action.  Following the recent imposition of the PRC\u2019s draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data.  True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees.  We will see if these companies hold firm.  I hope they do.  If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s corrupt and dictatorial rule.    The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them.  To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy.  America has done that before.  If we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we\u2014the American people, American government, and American business together\u2014can do it again.  Our freedom depends on it.    [1] Robert C.

Thank you for standing by and welcome to the business year 2016 conference call. (Operator Instructions) I must advise you the conference is being recorded today, Thursday, March 16, 2017.</p><p>I would now like to hand the conference over to your CEO, <person><nameText>Dr. Bernd Scheifele. </nameText></person>Please go ahead, sir.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE, </nameText></person>CEO, CHAIRMAN OF THE MANAGING BOARD, HEIDELBERGCEMENT AG: Okay, hello to everybody. Good afternoon here from London. I welcome you to our call on our final 2016 figures and the outlook for 2017. I'm sitting here with Dr. Naeger, the CFO of the Company, Andreas Schaller, Head of our Investor and Communication Department and Ozan Kacar, the Head of the Investor Relations department.</p><p>As usual, I will lead you through the operational figures and markets, and Dr. Naeger will lead you through the financial figures with a clear focus on the pro forma figures and the consolidation impact of Italcementi.</p><p>If I start with chart 3, I think, as a summary, I think we had a good cash flow. Our cash flow from operations went up by 29%, and also free cash flow, meaning after maintenance CapEx, is significantly up, close to 40%. The adjusted earnings per share is up 23%. You have seen that we had one-offs of about EUR324 million. There are mainly three big items. We had obviously restructuring costs for Italcementi which were about EUR156 million or EUR159 million.</p><p>And then we were cautious and we were writing down the goodwill in Ukraine and the assets in Ukraine, in eastern Ukraine where we have the cement plant which is at the moment seized by the rebels, we have written down to zero. And we have also written down the goodwill in Congo and assets in a significant way. And furthermore, we had a ship accident in our Mibau venture. And this overall led to a one-time negative impact and it also includes the currency loss in Egypt due to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound.</p><p>The dividend proposal is to increase the dividend by 23% to EUR1.60. That's consistent with what we told you two years ago, that we want to have a progressive dividend and we want to reach by 2019 a payout ratio of 40%. The dividend increase is in line with the adjusted earnings per share increase and a little bit lower than the free cash flow generation.</p><p>On the Italcementi integration, I think we have good news. The synergies we have upgraded to EUR470 million. If you put that in context, that means about 11% of the turnover. That's a very high value. We are absolutely convinced that we will deliver on these synergies. I think we will -- as I told you earlier, we will do better.</p><p>We have earned again a premium on our cost of capital. Dr. Naeger will explain that a little bit more in detail. We have reached a ROIC of 7.2% against a WACC of 7%. And that even in the first year of the acquisition of Italcementi I think that shows our financial discipline and overall good performance.</p><p>On the outlook, if we look to the markets, I would say three categories in a nutshell. US is going to be strong; I think we'll discuss that later a little bit more in detail. We expect solid growth in our mature markets in Europe, Canada and Australia. Overall economic underlying trend is good. There are political risks but the underlying economics, especially also in Europe, are okay.</p><p>And in Asia and Africa, it's, in a way, mixed pictures. We have three markets where we see margin pressure. That is obviously Indonesia and this is Thailand. In Thailand, we have not increased the price yet. We hope that we can do that in April in order to offset the price decrease from last year. And then in Africa, it's mainly Ghana. The rest of the countries [in] Asia and Africa runs pretty well. We're going to focus on efficiency and especially strong cash flow generation. And we expect a volume improvement in all business lines, as we did this year, EBITDA growth mid to double-digit, leverage 2.5 or below.</p><p>Chart 4 gives you again an overview on what happened. I think I do not have to comment very much on that. The operating EBITDA went up by 5%. That's what we discussed in the trading statement call in February. And you see down there then the adjusted earnings per share, which is about 23%.</p><p>Chart 5 gives you the payout ratio for the dividend, and you see, since we went to the capital market in September 2009, we have step by step increased the payout of the dividend, and over the last seven years we had an increase in the payout of dividends of about 45% on a yearly basis. That shows that over the last seven years I think we have really tried to improve the returns to the shareholders.</p><p>Chart 6 gives you an overview over the last four years. You see by and large we have reached EBITDA growth of about, if you take the average, 6%, 7%. With all the ups and downs in the world economy, free cash flow is clearly more significant up. I expect this trend to continue because I think our finance costs will go down in a significant way this year and already next year. Earnings per share on an annual basis went up by 11%; dividend payments over the last five years it's about 38%. And then you see also the share price. If you take back five years, I think we have done pretty well -- we have clearly beaten the DAX and also the MSCI. In 2016, we have beaten the DAX third year in a row.</p><p>And chart 7 shows you the premium on cost of capital. It shows you the ROIC, which is at 7.2%, and the WACC which is 6.96%. And you see the invested capital went up a little bit compared to 2015.</p><p>On the synergies side, chart 8, we have upgraded the target. Originally we were at -- I think when we did the transaction it was EUR170 million and then we went up to EUR250 million, EUR400 million. Now we are at EUR470 million. The increase comes mainly from three areas. One part is coming from treasury and the other part is on SG&amp;A. We're going to have -- we have more aggressive targets now in France and in Egypt than we originally anticipated. And the third comes from logistics or market synergies, especially from North America. And you see we have realized synergies about EUR155 million in 2016. We expect to do another EUR270 million into -- EUR175 million in 2017.</p><p>I think in 2016 we have done a good job. We have closed down the Bergamo headquarter of Italcementi. In the meantime, the management has moved out of the building, and they are sitting now all outside of Bergamo in the very modern i.lab building. We have also closed down the headquarters of Ciments Francais Holding in Paris, and we have also closed down our old CBR headquarter in Brussels and we are moving now to a very efficient and modern building close to the airport in Brussels in April.</p><p>On the workforce, I think as we speak today we have about reduced already 2,000. The target is 2,550, but as I told you earlier, I think it's going to be more 3,000.</p><p>Focus area for this year will be France. We have started the social plan negotiation with the French unions. The target, overall target, is to reduce in headquarter functions around 200 FTE. We have not started any operations in the plants yet because we think it's better to wait for the result of the French election before we start social negotiations on plant level, because in France that can be a rather hot issue and we wanted not to disturb the social peace.</p><p>In Egypt, we are moving strongly on reducing the workforce. So, on the synergies I think we are pretty confident, and maybe I can point to one issue Dr. Naeger can explain more in detail. I think the EUR470 million includes only treasury synergies of about EUR60 million. We looked back in the Board meeting on Monday a little bit what were our original assumptions for Italcementi when we made the deal -- the plan, what were the plan. And then if we compare that, on the financial costs, for the Company for financing the purchase price and the debt of Italcementi, which was a total volume of about EUR6.8 billion or EUR7 billion, we are roughly EUR200 million below.</p><p>That means by and large, forget about all the fees and whatever, commitment fees of the banks. By and large, our interest financing is about 3% lower than anticipated, and obviously, we get a clear boost from the investment grade in November, because, as you know, once you are investment grade, the ECB can buy your bonds. And obviously, the difference between non-investment grade companies and investment-grade companies increased by that, and that's why we have very cheap financing.</p><p>Italcementi normally had about a cost of debt of about 5%, and obviously you have seen our latest bonds, we finance somewhere around 1% or 1.5% and that shows you the difference. And that obviously has a significant cash impact which you will see this year and the years to come.</p><p>The volume side I think we have already explained in the trading statement. I think that's all set.</p><p>Chart 10 shows you again the EBITDA performance in 2016, and then we showed again the chart on Western and Southern Europe. There was some irritation after the trading statement call because I think we were down in Q4 about EUR60 million or EUR70 million, and the question was whether there was any problem in the operational business.</p><p>I told you in the call there is no problem. It has to do with one-offs and with CO2 provisions, which had to be made, and with PPA adjustments and also that the booking between holding cost and operational cost was changed because the -- because to the consolidation of Italcementi and different accounting practice in Heidelberg compared to what was done in the past in Bergamo, and especially also for the central costs of Ciments Francais Holding in Paris.</p><p>If you do it like for like, operationally we were about up by EUR18 million. We had a mixed picture in Q4 in Europe. We had weak markets in Spain and also especially Italy, and Germany was weather related relatively down, France was stable, UK was okay. And that gives you a little bit the picture.</p><p>I think chart 12, I asked Ozan to put that in because I think it gives you a little bit an impression on what happened with the Italcementi assets in the second half. And what we have done here, we have compared the published second-half 2015 figures for the Italcementi assets with the results achieved starting the second half after closing July 1. And the overall message is that we see in the Italcementi operations a clear increase, a positive trend in EBITDA that goes more or less through all areas, except for Asia. And in Asia, it's Thailand where we had a price pressure coming from new capacity and undisciplined market behavior, whereas the rest is up.</p><p>And, in my opinion, you see here clearly two points. First of all, the rather drastic management change which we did on top management level in the countries has clearly paid off. Except for Greece and Bulgaria, we have put in always a new managing director. That was a considerable decision from my side in order to change the spirit of the Company very fast.</p><p>And you see also that the new management teams or the new leadership in the former Italcementi countries or assets is clearly buying into the HeidelbergCement management culture. It's also worthwhile that they all make their forecast for the second half for 2016 and also they reach, more or less, their working capital target. So we had a very high discipline from Italcementi side in order to reach the targets in 2016.</p><p>Chart 13 I think is important to understand the cash generation and the relationship between cash and EBITDA in our Company. The left chart shows you the EBITDA generation over a period of four years, and you see in 2013 Indocement contributed on EBITDA about 22%, US only 14%. That has changed now. The US is now at 26%, with an upward trend, and Indonesia is at 10% with a downward trend.</p><p>The key difference between Indonesia and US is in Indonesia we own 51%, and what you see in the cash flow statement is only the dividend, as cash what we received is the dividend. Whereas on Heidelberg in US we do not pay taxes because we have tax losses carried forward. We own it 100% and there's also no withholding tax. So obviously here we get more or less 100% from the EBITDA also as cash.</p><p>The same principle applies to Ghana where we have a participation of about 60%, 62%, and also in Thailand we have a joint venture with 55%. The message is in 2017 we expect a strong run in the US again with a strong cash generation, whereas we see maybe weaker developments in countries where we have only majority participations and where the impact on the cash generation is clearly lower. And there you see then the consequence on the right side that the free cash flow increased quite a bit.</p><p>Now chart 14 and 15 talks a little bit about the outlook. Let's talk about the US. I was last week -- on Thursday, Friday I spent two days in Dallas with our management. The reason was to prepare a little bit for the upcoming analyst call but also with a meeting in the West with the investors in the next days. And I think it was good timing because our team just came back from the largest construction trade fair in the US, from the Las Vegas CONEXPO, and obviously, that was a good opportunity to get a little bit what's the feedback from the market.</p><p>We had about -- attendance from our cement customers; 45% of our customer base was there. So I think it gives you quite a good view. And the overall messages in US, everybody expects a strong year; customers are very positive on 2017. I would say they are even bullish for 2018 and 2019. And that's what we see also in our volumes for January and February. They are up 7%, 8%. Also pricing in cement is already in February before the main price increases in April already up 7%; in aggregates, pricing is up 5%. And I think that's also underlined by the PCA who came out with a forecast yesterday who upgraded its forecast.</p><p>And the confidence of the customers is driven by two facts. First of all, they think that the tax reform will come, which will obviously reduce the tax burden, and by that lead to better earnings and more cash flow for the US customers -- for the US companies. And secondly, they think the tax reform will also allow the big tech companies to repatriate their cash which is bunkered in Europe, and they expect then that a significant portion of that cash will be invested in fixed assets in US. These investments will, with a tax rate of maybe 20%, have a clearly better return than if the corporate tax rate is around 40%, which is the case at the moment.</p><p>So message, strong outlook on the US. We think volumes are going to be solid, pricing is going to be strong, so we think we have another good year in North America, and maybe 2018 and 2019 even stronger.</p><p>If you look to Europe, also in Europe we see clearly the consumer confidence, the business confidence in Europe has clearly improved. We had in 2016 in the Eurozone a growth rate of 1.7%. That compares with US 1.6%. That shows you Europe is not so bad. Maybe the perception in North America is different from what is the reality on the ground.</p><p>We expect good growth in Germany, Benelux. UK, in our opinion, will stay also firm. And also in Southern Europe, especially in France, we see stabilization of the market, and Spain comes back, Italy with a question mark.</p><p>In Eastern and Northern Europe, clear good news. Eastern Europe is coming back and Northern Europe, Norway, Sweden, strong markets in Sweden, I would say even a boom, due to residential needs due to the refugees. And also in the former Soviet Union countries, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia, the market has -- is coming back. We see strong pricing in these countries, in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan; we expect price increases between 10% and 15%, and have also positive pricing momentum in Eastern Europe.</p><p>And, as I said, in Africa and Asia, mixed picture.</p><p>That's it from my side and I hand over to Dr. Naeger on the financial results.</p><p>LORENZ NAEGER, CFO, HEIDELBERGCEMENT AG: Yes, thank you very much, Dr. Scheifele. Good afternoon also from my side and good morning to US. I would like to lead you through the financial report where the presentation starts on page 25.</p><p>So what we have is a very successful integration of Italcementi also from a financial perspective. Just to remind you that we had quite successful negotiations with the European antitrust and the US antitrust where we were -- had only to do a very small number of compulsory disposals. In the beginning the expected figure was much -- the expected number of assets was significantly higher. But then I think we had -- we brought it down and we could sell these two assets, the one in Belgium and the other one in US, only one plant in Martinsburg, at pretty good prices and multiples.</p><p>We had to manage two IPOs, one in Italy, one in Morocco. In Italy, we were at the absolute minimum of the legal timing and were able to acquire all shares of Italcementi within a very small period of time. In Morocco, that was a very [thorough] process where finally we did buy I think five shares or something like that. So that's exactly what we wanted to have.</p><p>We then were able to wind down very fast the expensive heritage financing of Italcementi. This turned out to be a real asset which really contributes now and in the future to lower cost. Italcementi had a big bunch of early-maturing, quite expensive debt, roughly EUR1.5 billion we could wind down very quickly, and by that replace 5% to 6% interest by 0.5% to 1.5% interest.</p><p>Overall this led to fairly low transaction and integration costs, as you can see in our additional ordinary result. This was close to EUR160 million. In this industry, we have seen significantly higher costs in transactions of comparable size and type, also relative to the size of the transaction.</p><p>We show in the year improved financial metrics. The cash flow improved as we applied typical HeidelbergCement financial discipline, especially on CapEx and on working capital. On the operating cash flow in Italcementi at least before we had control we still have to work a lot. This was not really managed in Italcementi early and we see big potential here for the future.</p><p>We then had on HeidelbergCement heritage, a quite successful management of the pension obligations by decreasing the defined benefit obligation, and a pretty good return on our pension assets. I will outline later, we have 18% return on our pension assets this year.</p><p>The financial result improved, despite higher debt. And last but not least, our return on invested capital continued to increase to 7.2% at a WACC of 7%; I will also outline a little bit further.</p><p>All this quite good environment led then to an investment grade rating which we achieved in November 2016, which I think was overdue. And our target, of course, is to comfortably establish the Company inside the investment grade corridor.</p><p>If you then go to the income statement on slide 26, you more or less see what I have outlined. If I go to the lines below the result of current operations, we see the additional ordinary result which I will explain on the next page. Result from participation up 30%, as also our JVs are in good shape and have successfully developed.</p><p>The financial result, minus EUR490 million, improving EUR56 million from last year despite a higher debt stemming from the Italcementi acquisition of roughly EUR2 billion on average over the year. And as I outlined, we have been able to push that down and you see it here in the financial result.</p><p>Income taxes are in line with our expectations and on the same level as last year. Net result from discontinued operation, minus EUR3 million, and minorities minus EUR190 million, also on last year's level. So the Group share of profit as reported, EUR706 million compared to EUR800 million. If we adjust for the additional ordinary result, we are up 23% to EUR1,032 million.</p><p>On slide 27 you can see the split of the additional ordinary result, including Italcementi at EUR160 million. There are some asset and goodwill impairments. We had a bad accident with a ship in the Baltic Sea where a ship from us destroyed a high voltage cable in the sea with its anchor. EUR25 million is expected damage here.</p><p>And then we had the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. There were some questions earlier this morning on this. Suez Cement, our company in Egypt, had financial debt denominated in US dollars, mainly stemming from dividend obligations which they have to pay, which are in dollars, and also stemming from acquisition or from purchase of coal and spare parts, all denominated in dollars.</p><p>As long as the Egyptian currency was regulated there were no dollars in the country to be able to pay the dollar bills and so we had to keep the dollar debt as we were unable to pay it. And once the Egyptian pound devaluated, we need more pounds to serve this dollar debt. That's exactly what happened and that caused this devaluation loss of EUR47 million. That's the background of that; that's why we show it here in the additional ordinary result.</p><p>If we then move to the cash flow statement on slide 28, we can see that cash flow from operating activities had a very nice development, up EUR425 million to EUR1.9 billion, coming from EUR1.4 billion. Please note, in the line decrease in provisions through cash payments that there is a significant increase of EUR138 million to EUR383 million. This includes, to a large extent, payments from Italcementi for restructuring and for severance payments for employees.</p><p>Total investment up from EUR1 billion to EUR4 billion. This is total Italcementi. EUR3 billion out of the EUR4 billion are directly linked to Italcementi, EUR1 billion is normal CapEx which you have during the year. And out of the EUR1 billion, normal CapEx, about EUR700 million, are stay in business.</p><p>Proceeds from fixed asset disposals and consolidation EUR800 million inflow. This includes EUR600 million cash in Italcementi and then the cash flow from investing activities of the discontinued operations, EUR900 million. This is the disposal of the Martinsburg plant and the CCB after the acquisition of Italcementi. So, overall, free cash flow in this definition minus EUR400 million.</p><p>If we put this in the chart, you can see it on slide 29, and there you can see we use a different definition for the free cash flow. There it includes not all CapEx but only the CapEx for growth and expansion. So the free cash flow is EUR1.3 billion. We have borrowings from EUR1.4 billion. We have then growth CapEx EUR2.3 billion net of the disposals and the consolidation of the Italcementi debt of EUR2.3 billion.</p><p>I mean that from the operational side free cash flow a very nice development, and we also expect the free cash flow to further develop.</p><p>If we look to the balance sheet, we have to note that that's all more or less Italcementi. The currency impact from between December 31, 2016, and same day 2015 was very small. The basket of the currency remains very stable. So all the differences you see in the change column are more or less Italcementi.</p><p>We have booked a preliminary PPA which includes goodwill of EUR1.7 billion out of the intangible of -- which increased by EUR1.9 billion. So out of this EUR1.7 billion is Italcementi. This is a preliminary figure; it may change a little bit until June 30, 2017, but I expect this change to be not very significant and it's relatively likely that the goodwill will reduce again a little bit.</p><p>Property, plant and equipment up EUR4 billion, Italcementi acquisition, and the same for all the other balance sheet positions. Same for also cash; increase stems from Italcementi.</p><p>The equity goes up by EUR1.9 billion. This is also mainly Italcementi. EUR700 million from the capital increase, as we exchanged 10.5 million shares of HeidelbergCement against share of Italcementi with the former owner, Italmobiliare, and then we accounted for the minority interest inside Italcementi Group for about EUR600 million.</p><p>Debt goes up, as reported. Provisions a little bit up, deferred taxes Italcementi and also the operating liability up EUR1.6 billion. Net we have an increase in the net debt of the Company of EUR3.7 billion.</p><p>Now let's look a little bit back to page 7 where we have outlined our return on invested capital and the WACC. We have achieved a return on invested capital of 7.2% and the WACC is 6.96%, slightly up, mainly due to an increase of the beta factor.</p><p>We have -- if you look at the capital, then you see that the capital increases from 2015 EUR21.5 billion to EUR23.6 billion. We have slightly changed the calculation mode here as we have calculated the invested capital as the average of the quarterly capital invested. So we have included two quarters, which is Q1 and Q2 2016, of heritage Heidelberg invested capital, and the second -- the two quarters of the second half-year, meaning Q3 and Q4, are including Italcementi.</p><p>Italcementi has increased the invested capital roughly by EUR5.5 billion out of the box after the disposals, and now half of this goes into this invested capital figure. So that's why it goes up by roughly a little bit more than EUR2 billion compared to previous year. So during the year 2017, we will see this to increase to a level of around EUR27 billion as a result of Italcementi is also only in for six months, we have a fair picture here.</p><p>And we believe that in the next year the WACC will a little bit go down as the average WACC of Italcementi is lower than the HeidelbergCement WACC and the ROIC we will see should be stable or also slightly going down. But I expect that we will continue to earn a premium on the cost of capital, and as the synergies kick in, this value gap could further increase and our contribution to value creation [could] increase.</p><p>Now let's go back to slide 31. I would like to talk a little bit about the pension obligation. Heidelberg has substantially decreased its pension obligations over the last five years. You see it on the green bars which are the calculation of the benefit -- defined benefit obligations at a constant interest rate. And you can see that the increase which you see from the balance sheet, which is shown in the gray bars, is only due to decrease in interest rates.</p><p>If you keep the interest rates stable, we have a nice decrease of EUR850 million net coming as the Company has continuously worked on the pension schemes and continuously replaced defined benefit obligations by defined contribution schemes and has closed many pension schemes for newcomers. So over time, this goes down.</p><p>The other side, the pension funds you see on page 32, there you can see that the plan assets have continuously increased from EUR3.8 billion in 2013 to EUR5 billion in 2016. This means we have a coverage rate of 85%, which is pretty good, especially in Germany, as German pension obligations are not covered by funds.</p><p>In our funds which we manage, we have achieved to again achieve a return of 18% in 2016, which we consider to be a good success. The reason is that these are more or less a maturity-matched zero bonds for our pension obligations, which increase value with decreasing interest rates.</p><p>So if the trend changes and interest rates would go up, then we expect our pension obligations to go down but also our pension fund values going down, and then we, of course, would have a negative return, so you should keep that in mind. But if we have all done all the financial engineering correctly, the gap between pension obligations and pension funds should continue to reduce.</p><p>Slide 33, net debt development, you can see that. We are currently on a leverage of 2.8, and I'm very confident that we will succeed to push that down into our target range of 1.5 to 2.5 by 2017.</p><p>Slide 34 shows the maturity profile, and I have put the coupon rate of the bonds in the bottom line, so you can see that from 2017 through 2020, quite expensive financing will go out of the balance sheet, and will be replaced by pretty cheap refinancing.</p><p>We have already paid back in January a bond of EUR1 billion at 8% interest rate and replaced the same by a 0.5% five-years bond, so alone this will reduce for 2017 our interest cost by more than EUR70 million, and that's a trend which will continue until 2020, and we expect every year to pay EUR100 million less per year for the coming years. That has a massive contribution to the net cash flow of the Company.</p><p>So that's it from my side. I think we are very well set up for the future. It's a very stable financing profile, great flexibility, and we'll see improved financial metrics in the near future. Thank you.</p><p>Dr. Scheifele, if you want to go to the outlook.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Okay. Let's just go back to the outlook, to the last two charts, chart 36 and 37. If you look a little bit to the cement demand globally, North America I think we discussed. I would also expect, like the PCA, about 3.5% growth. I would expect infrastructure to be relatively strong, due to the FAST Act, which comes now into the market, the infrastructure program Congress has already approved.</p><p>We see consumer confidence, net wealth per household, on a very high level in US. That's why we also expect residential to pick up and commercial. We would also expect that the weak markets of California and coastal Texas, mainly Houston, will come back in 2017, and the last point is when I was in Dallas, we were discussing always the issue of the oil industry, which is important for us in Houston but also in western Canada. The good news is that the fracking production in the US is up significantly, and as you know, that's why the oil price came down over the last days.</p><p>Just to give a figure, the number of oil rigs is up in North America by more than 100% per March, and we see already a clear increase in the oil well demand in our operations, in Texas Lehigh but also in western Canada and obviously that has a higher contribution margin.</p><p>UK, we see good infrastructure project. Our order book is good. We have the nuclear power plant. We have big projects here with the Thames Tideway in London and also the highway, Britain highway project of the British government, so UK should be all right. Europe, I talk modest recovery. Northern Europe, especially Norway, Sweden, Sweden we see very strong demand, with big tunnel projects also in Oslo and Stavanger, and Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine recovery, with double-digit price increases between 10% to 15%.</p><p>Africa overall is okay, except for the oil countries, where we still see significant economic weakness. That means Nigeria, Angola and Gabon and also South Africa.</p><p>And in Asia, China, we would say more or less flattish on volume, but pricing compared to last year, clearly up. Pricing now in China is about RMB230, RMB240 per tonne. That is clearly 20% up compared to last year. India, first two months, volumes were la, la, la, with the effect of the currency change of the government is still clearly visible in the economy. That will take time, because the Indians are not used to use in the local markets, to use bank accounts. Pricing in India at the moment, still flat.</p><p>Thailand, volumes okay. Price increase not implemented yet. Indonesia had weak two first months. For the first two months, market was again negative with minus 1%. It's the wet season now. It should dry out now in March, latest in April, and we keep our fingers crossed that then really the volumes have to kick in. Pricing continued, due to the market weakness, to be under pressure.</p><p>Cement, Australia, overall good. Volumes are good. Pricing in cement up AUD4, so that looks pretty good. And I think that's it a little bit. If you look on charts 37, we have commented more on our single markets. I think overall that is okay.</p><p>Maybe a comment on Africa, one of the core markets for us is Ghana -- in Ghana, the good news is that the government has now banned imports or has put a quota on cement imports. That limits the Chinese imports in a significant way, and Mr. Dangote is sending less trucks from Nigeria to Ghana, and we are strongly lobbying with the other local players that the unfair competition by subsidized exports from Nigeria is stopped in Ghana at the border, as it is already in Benin and Togo.</p><p>Okay, I think that's it, and obviously now we are ready for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question, from Berenberg, comes from the line of Robert Muir, and your line is open.</p><p>ROBERT MUIR, ANALYST, BERENBERG: Thanks very much. So two questions. First one, fairly boring, but just wanted to check on the synergies. In your pro forma bridge, you've got obviously the EUR155 million of benefit. I think at the Capital Markets Day, though, you were guiding for year-end run rates, and they correspond with the totals broadly that were shown today. So can I just confirm that the full EUR155 million should be in the numbers but also the subsequent EUR175 million in 2017 and the EUR140 million in 2018 is still a run rate? And if so, is there any guidance on the timing of these and therefore the absolute incremental benefit we should expect in 2017 and 2018 from synergies?</p><p>And then my second question, just looking across Europe, this is a broader question. Just with all the deals, and I think we've seen a consolidation event in Germany in the last couple of days as well, are you looking at a different landscape maybe across Europe? Could we see pricing power returning as it did in the US on relatively small volume gains? And with this in mind, are there any markets you would highlight in particular as interesting in that regard? Thanks very much.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Okay, Mr. Muir, hello. On the synergies, you are totally right. We stick what we said. It's EUR155 million. It's EUR175 million and then it's for 2018, what's the number? But we stick to the numbers and we give you a more detailed update in the Q1. But on the synergies, as I repeatedly said, we have these synergies all now nailed down to a person, to a precise action plan, with milestones, with defined P&amp;L savings, cash savings and implementation costs. And we run this in our system on a monthly basis, and so we are pretty confident that we will get this number.</p><p>And as I told you, if I looked at the finance costs, that number broadly will be higher, because we have also increased the targets, especially on SG&amp;A in France and in Egypt, so let's wait and see. I think on the synergy side we will see the impact.</p><p>It's difficult I understand it for you though with the like for like and pro forma and what was realized -- it's also for us not easy, but that's if you integrate two big companies, but I can tell you only you will see the numbers. The numbers are clearly coming.</p><p>Now, on Europe, you are right. There was a move from Schwenk. They bought out the CRH which is obviously positive, because Schwenk is now the number two in Germany, and Schwenk and Heidelberg, they have -- both together have a market share in the countries of Germany -- let's say Bavaria -- Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and also Frankfurt of more than 50% or 60%, so that should normally have a positive impact, because the problem with CRH plants was that they were not vertically integrated. They had no ready-mix, and they were a little bit on the standalone, so I think that's a movement.</p><p>Now, if you look around Europe, I would say for us obviously two markets are -- three markets are important. One is Italy. These markets need some more consolidation. I think you will hear the same message from Buzzi. I think we do not -- we can agree on that, and let's wait and see whether something can be improved during 2017. It's clearly on the strategic agenda of Heidelberg, and if I read the press releases of Buzzi, I think it's also on the agenda of Buzzi, so let's wait and see.</p><p>And in France, obviously, here the market has to recover. We are relatively confident on volume in France. For us, the point is that our vertical integration in ready-mix is relatively weak, and we have to improve that. And the other market then is Spain. In Spain, we still have a clear overcapacity, and also I think in Spain you will see more consolidation, maybe not by M&amp;A but more by merging of players, because in Spain obviously the overcapacity is still significant.</p><p>So I think principally you are right. You will see I think more consolidation to come in the European market. Yes.</p><p>ROBERT MUIR: Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you very much indeed. Now from Exane BNP Paribas, we now have a question from the line of Paul Roger. And your line is now open.</p><p>PAUL ROGER, ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS: Good afternoon, everybody. So I'll just have two as well. Firstly, sorry to come back on this synergy figure, this EUR155 million that you booked in 2016, wonder if it's possible to give us a bit more detail in terms of the phasing of that EUR155 million and in particular whether it was all in the second half. And then also, if you can give us some detail by region, just to understand where that EUR155 million was actually impacting the P&amp;L.</p><p>Then the second question is on Indonesia. We've just had Indocement reporting. Their Q4 margin fell to 27%. Is that a good guide for what you expect for 2017, or could it go even lower than that?</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Okay, if you looked so -- if you look to the figures, it's about -- close to EUR39 million on SG&amp;A, especially headquarter reduction in Bergamo and also in Paris, and we have in the cement operations -- we have about EUR71 million. That's mainly also due to energy optimization, reduced maintenance repair spending, lower clinker factor, etc., switching -- switching fuel mix in US, for example, from coal to gas or also in Egypt, from gas to coal. And then we have about EUR18 million in purchasing and about EUR10 million in logistics.</p><p>If you look to the countries, it's about Egypt, EUR25 million; France, also around EUR15 million to EUR20 million; Italy, about EUR17 million; India, EUR15 million. Kazakhstan, you saw that in the margin in north and Eastern Europe was significant from a low level, EUR11 million, and North America about EUR9 million. Morocco was also pretty strong, between EUR6 million to EUR10 million, and then we go smaller, Bulgaria, EUR3 million, increased EUR2 million, so it adds up. So it's split across the line.</p><p>PAUL ROGER: And in terms of the actual phasing, this all relates to the second half, does it? There's nothing from before you consolidated Italcementi there?</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Yes. I would say I -- I look to Dr. Naeger. I would say so. I would say the synergies Q4, I do not know. What was it, EUR60 million to EUR70 million? That's our guess, so that's a little bit where we are in Q4, what we did in Q4.</p><p>PAUL ROGER: Okay. Okay, yes. And then the second one is on the Indonesian margin.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Yes. The Indonesian margin, as you saw in Q4, where Q4 was very weak in Indonesia. The volumes did not come back as we expected, and margins were weak. I don't know, the 27%, is that now Indocement total or is it the cement division?</p><p>PAUL ROGER: I believe that's the total that they just reported.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: I haven't seen it, and I think that's a figure you have to see, so 27%, 25% is by average for a cement company, if you take normalized market conditions, is not a crazy number in Indonesia. The problem at the moment is that we have overcapacity to the buildup, and the market I would say nearly typically for the cement industry, you build capacity when the market is strong. When the capacity is there, the market is flat or even negative. That's what we have at the moment.</p><p>That's why we have a little bit abnormal situation, and we really expect and hope that the market now, at least in the second quarter when the rainy season is off, that then the market comes back strongly in order to get a better capacity utilization and then also to a better price-volume relationship.</p><p>PAUL ROGER: Okay. Yes, thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you very much indeed. Now, from HSBC, your next question comes from the line of John Fraser-Andrews. And your line is now open.</p><p>JOHN FRASER-ANDREWS, ANALYST, HSBC: Thank you. My two questions are firstly in Indonesia, coming back to the margin pressure that you flagged and obviously just heard what you had to say there about overcapacity. But within that margin pressure, can you just flesh out how you see that and the extent of it, given you're expecting 5% volume growth, the cost savings with the new kiln line, and how that all marries in with that margin pressure?</p><p>And then secondly, in the US, the operational leverage, could you just give some indication as to what your spare capacity is, so the growth you're expecting in the country, how much of that will come through in terms of operational leverage?</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: So now in Indonesia, I think I cannot tell you really more. We are now just the middle of March. I told you February the market was -- in January, the market was negative. In February, the market was slightly positive. The first two months, the market is -- Indonesia, total, still a minus (inaudible) and I think Jakarta the first two months was again minus 7%, minus 8%, which is very abnormal. That's really a crazy situation.</p><p>That's the one thing, and obviously if the market is lower than expected, you have additional capacity. The price pressure continued with pricing under pressure maybe compared to last year about 3% or 4%. That's the point.</p><p>On the other side, we have an increase in the coal cost in the country, but we could offset that increase by our P14, because we have significantly lower variable costs, so we could keep the other costs more or less flattish. And obviously, we have continued to reduce on fixed costs. The currency was relatively positive, because the Indonesian overall economy is relatively strong and also the macroeconomic figures, like the capital reserves, are strong. So the currency has helped us, especially on the dollar-denominated cost side.</p><p>And what was the other one? On the US, I would have to -- we have enough production capacity in order to produce especially with our Essroc plants, so we don't see any problem. I think our total sales volume for next year US is, what, 40 million tonnes, I would assume? And we still have surely spare capacity of at least 1 million or 1.5 million tonnes.</p><p>The good news about Essroc about the US is that the Essroc plants have clearly improved. We have finished the winter repair, no overspend on maintenance repair. The clinker production is clearly up compared to last year, about 120,000 tonnes, and in the first two months, the Essroc plants compared to last year are on a OI level up about $20 million. So we see a clear improving trend. That's why I'm already confident that we're going to have another strong year in the US.</p><p>So I think if you look to the US operational leverage, you see our numbers in euro. We have done last year on the full year in North America an improvement of about EUR120 million. You have to deduct about a negative result development in western Canada, which we will not have this year, which was about EUR35 million. It was about CAD40 million, so we did about EUR150 million more on OI in US.</p><p>There is no reason that we should not do the same increase again, and since we are ambitious company, we obviously target even for a higher increase, and that's why on the US we are pretty confident. Okay?</p><p>JOHN FRASER-ANDREWS: Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you very much indeed, sir. Now, from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you now have a question from Arnaud Lehmann, and your line is now open, sir.</p><p>ARNAUD LEHMANN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. My first question is regarding your 2017 full-year guidance. I believe back in February, when you had the preliminary results, I think on the conference call you were talking about mid-single-digit organic growth in EBITDA, and obviously today you're talking mid-single to double digit, so is there -- are you just being more precise or are things kind of changed or improved in the last months to make you a bit more confident about the outlook for 2017? That's my first question.</p><p>My second question is I'm just doing a quick calculation based on your pro forma EBITDA, the EUR3.2 billion, and then if I just take your guidance, let's call it 8% growth, that's getting somewhere between EUR3.4 billion and EUR3.5 billion, and you're also telling us you're going to be at 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA, so that will get us to about EUR8.6 billion of net debt, which would be about EUR400 million reduction year on year.</p><p>Is that wrong or because I'm assuming you're hoping to reduce your debt by a bit more than EUR400 million this year.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Okay, maybe I start with the outlook, Mr. Lehmann. You are right, we have been -- you know what, at the beginning of the year in February -- in January and February, when it's snowing in Europe and US, I'm also a bit careful because who knows the market now? I was traveling the last two weeks or three weeks in our operations to get a better feeling, and what you see is clearly what I told you, is that the pricing outlook in general, if we leave out maybe Indonesia and Ghana, where we have still a price pressure, it's the clear message that price-wise, I think we are maybe better on our way than what I anticipated, because I am relatively careful in the markets. You never know what's happening.</p><p>So in the US, we are clearly -- after my meeting with our sales guys, I think in the US we should get normally, if things go well, by average about $8. We will even get in North California maybe $10. In Midwest, we would expect $10 to $12 or $12, and also in the South, Georgia, Alabama, we think we will get $12. So in the US on pricing, I'm clearly optimistic. The same for Canada with [$6] in BC.</p><p>Also in Europe, you have to see, sorry, in France in the last two or three years, the price went every year down EUR2. Now we have -- we see in France until February price increase EUR0.80 per tonne. It's not a miracle, but I tell you, it's a trend change. And in Italy, prices are up.</p><p>We hope to get in Italy maybe EUR4, EUR4.50. That would be already an achievement, so we're a little bit -- Benelux, pricing is also up by about [EUR1.20]. UK is up by GBP1.50. And in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, pricing clearly above double digit, 10%, 15%. Poland is up, Czech Republic is up, Egypt is up, Morocco is up, so on the price side, there is momentum, and that's why we are a little bit -- we are a little bit let's say if you want to say -- we are more optimistic than maybe in February. That's the key message, and at the same time, if you look at the coal price, you saw that the coal forwards came down. So at the moment, also on the energy, now with the oil price, this is also not bad for us if the oil price drops.</p><p>So at the moment, I would say things are overall by and large moving in the right direction. Okay?</p><p>ARNAUD LEHMANN: Okay.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Then you asked Dr. Naeger the question on what was it?</p><p>LORENZ NAEGER: Yes, yes, if you calculate, I mean the net debt, I said we would like to push it clearly into our target range between EUR1.5 billion and EUR2.5 billion, and we printed that we want to bring it to and below EUR2.5 billion, so I think the net debt figure which you mentioned, the EUR8.6 billion, is a very conservative figure. Our ambitions are clearly higher than that, and then we have to look at the balance with the EBITDA figure, and then we see where we land by the end of the year.</p><p>But it's still a long way to go, and I think we will achieve a decent net debt figure, and then the EBITDA you know is just powered by US, etc., and so we are optimistic to achieve that goal.</p><p>ARNAUD LEHMANN: All right, thank you very much.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Okay.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you very much, sir. Now, from UBS, your next question comes from the line of Gregor Kuglitsch, and your line is now open, sir.</p><p>Oh, he's just disconnected. I beg your pardon. He just disconnected from the call there. I'm so sorry. Would you like me to move to the next question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, please.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you, and that's from JPMorgan, and it comes from the line of Rajesh Patki, and your line is now open.</p><p>RAJESH PATKI, ANALYST, JPMORGAN: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you very much. I have two questions. First one is on the guidance. I just wanted to understand whether the guidance includes any positive impact from the one-off items that you have mentioned on the slide 11, the presentation.</p><p>And the second question is a quick two-part question. What's the average interest rate that you'll be expecting for 2017, and in terms of additional ordinary reserve for 2017, what do you expect there? Is there any restructuring charges similar to 2016? Thanks.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: No. On the first question, though, we have not planned -- the guidance does not include any CO2 gains or whatever, currency and PPA bookings. So it's operational guidance. And what was the other one?</p><p>LORENZ NAEGER: The average interest rate should go down to a range of 3.5% to 4% over the whole debt, but that includes in all finance fees and amortization on you notice capitalized fees, etc., etc. It should be in that range.</p><p>RAJESH PATKI: Just following up on the first question there, I was referring more about to the change in inventories and weather in Germany. Do you expect that to reverse or --</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Sorry. I cannot predict the future. Otherwise, I would not run Heidelberg. I would just stock market -- weather is for us a big item. In our industry, weather is key. In the first quarter, weather is important. Do you have a warm winter, do you have a harsh winter and whatever? What is the flooding doing in the monsoon countries like Indonesia and India? And then the Q4 is again a weather -- the question is when does the winter come in, and that has a play on our inventories.</p><p>And in Germany, we had last year no winter at all in Europe, and this year, the winter came in end of November, so December did not take place. And the year before, we were producing until Christmas. And also in Europe, just to give you a hint for the Q1 here, Europe had a normal winter, especially in Eastern Europe, Poland, Ukraine, Romania, Czech Republic, Germany. They're covered by snow in February. That was last year not the case.</p><p>US is relatively mild. US weather is relatively okay, so you're going to see also in our Q1 results that obviously in Europe we have a winter impact, and that I cannot predict. Okay?</p><p>RAJESH PATKI: Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Okay, last question?</p><p>OPERATOR: And the last question, sir, comes from UBS, from Gregor Kuglitsch, and your line is open, sir.</p><p>GREGOR KUGLITSCH, ANALYST, UBS: Hello.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Hello.</p><p>GREGOR KUGLITSCH: Hi. So I've got two questions as well. So the first one is on your guidance. So I think if I look at your EUR175 million of EBITDA growth from synergies, you already get to 5%, so you're guiding to mid to double-digit EBITDA growth. So I guess the question really is, you talked very positively about pricing. You talked very positively about the US. I understand there's a little bit of pressure in Indonesia and Ghana, but is that really what you're saying, that those two markets are really moving down significantly, just so we can square the different elements of the guidance?</p><p>And the second question is a simple one on tax. I think you're actually guiding to a pretty low cash tax or tax rate of 25%. Is that what you think is a sustainable cash tax for the business, now that you've assessed Italcementi more after having six months of ownership? Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Okay, so I think your statement is correct here on the guidance. We have the synergies. That's clear. And then I think we have discussed in detail the markets. We expect US to be okay. I expect Western and Southern Europe to be also fine. I would expect NEECA -- that is for us Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, strong. That I see already in the first two months. They are strong markets, especially Norway, Sweden, which is important for us, high margins, high cash generation.</p><p>Then we come to Africa. Africa is the -- we're going to be better in Egypt. We're going to have a good year in Morocco, and I think there is a question mark behind Ghana. That depends very much on Dangote, how he plays. Tanzania should be all right, but overall, Turkey also, the market is okay. It's more a currency issue, and in Asia, the hot spot is Indonesia. I would expect India to be stable and go up.</p><p>China, pricing is up. Bangladesh looks okay. Australia should have another good year, so it's a little bit from our side, from our portfolio, we look a little bit to Indonesia and Ghana, but here again Mr. Kuglitsch, we talk about EBITDA. And there is -- in a capital-intense industry, there is a lot of life below EBITDA, and those businesses we own 51% or 60%, and on the cash side, we see only the dividend, whereas obviously from a cash-generating point of view, strong markets in US, in Ukraine, Northern Europe are for us very important. Because here we typically have very low tax rates, like in Norway or Sweden, or we don't pay taxes, like in the UK and in US. So that's where the cash generation comes from, and that's why we're pretty -- let's say on the cash generation we are pretty bullish.</p><p>GREGOR KUGLITSCH: Okay, thank you very much.</p><p>LORENZ NAEGER: Okay, on the tax side, I am not a big believer in deferred tax, so I prefer to look at actual tax, so even more on cash tax. And if we look on cash tax, we have two major impacts. The one is until previous year, I would say, Italcementi until 2015, Indocement was the biggest taxpayer in HeidelbergCement Group. Unfortunately, this profitability goes down, and secondly, we have participated in an asset revaluation scheme, where we have increased the value of our fixed assets and now start to depreciate tax-wise from a higher tax base. This should significantly reduce the taxes paid. In Indocement deferred tax are something completely different.</p><p>The second point is US, we still expect US to increase profitability, as you know from Dr. Scheifele. And we have still massive carry-forward losses from the financial crisis in US, so the increased profitability in US goes against profit carry-forward loss, and therefore we will not pay any taxes there.</p><p>So for the time being, Indonesia, lower tax and in US, no tax on pretty high profits, so that should keep the cash tax rate at the 25% I am guiding. But okay, we will see what the future brings, but that is currently our expectation.</p><p>In Italcementi, we still have to learn who is the real taxpayer like Morocco, with a pretty low tax rate, 10% if I'm not mistaken. Egypt does not pay. Italy does not pay. France is a high-tax country, which came in our Group, so we have to see how the structure will continue, but our current planning is that we stay with 25% cash tax ratio.</p><p>GREGOR KUGLITSCH: Thank you very much.</p><p>LORENZ NAEGER: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, that's all.</p><p>LORENZ NAEGER: That's it. Thank you very much.</p><p><person><nameText>BERND SCHEIFELE</nameText></person>: Thanks a lot for your interest. Have a good afternoon. Thank you.

As every Q4, we have the Executive Chairman, who will open the presentation with the key takeaways for the full year, and obviously the Q4. Our CEO, Jose Antonio Alvarez will address the Group and business areas review, and then our Executive Chairman will comment -- and share with you our 2018 key strategic priorities. And obviously, we'll have time as always for Q&amp;A. So without any further delay, Ana?</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, BANCO SANTANDER, S.A.: So good morning, everybody. Welcome to our results presentation for 2017. I will start by reviewing the key, I'd say, metrics that we have achieved this year. It's been a very good year. It's been actually a great year and we have achieved growth in a responsible way. Improving profitability, but also strengthening the balance sheet. You can see that the growth in loyal customers resulted in double-digit income growth. We are again one of the most efficient and profitable banks in the world, with a cost-income ratio that improved to 47%, close to 47%, and an underlying return on tangible equity of close to 12%. And this has allowed us to further improve the strength of our balance sheet, very importantly with NPLs improving, excluding Popular and also reaching a CET1 of 10.84%. If we now go to the P&amp;L in euros. You can see the strong growth in top line, customer revenues growing at 11%, with operating expenses growing at the lower rate than revenues and flat in real terms and loan loss provisions increasing by 4% compared to last year, even though the loan portfolio has increased. And as a result, underlying PBT reaching EUR 13.6 billion, that is a 20% increase over last year. Our attributable PAT for 2017, stood at EUR 6.6 billion, that's a 7% year-on-year growth. This lower growth rate is due to 2 reasons, one is some one-off items that you can see in the slide that Jose Antonio will comment in detail later on, but also to a higher tax rate in 2017. As I said, we have achieved a very good increase in our loyal customers. This is the most important part of our strategy and these customers are growing at 13%, more than 17 million. And at the same time, we are growing our digital customers by 21%. More than 25 million people are now using mobile and digital banking. I will give you a few more details at the end of this presentation. And we're helping more people bank with us in a way that is simple and personal and fair and helping businesses prosper.</p><p>The digital and loyal customer growth are having a positive income as we seen in our revenue base, especially on the fee income line, which is growing at 14%. So this gives us an underlying return on tangible equity growth of close to 12%, that's 70 basis points better than the previous year and 3 points above our peer average. One of the highest among European banks. And what's important is that most of our subsidiaries are actually improving the profitability and have higher profitability than peers. You can see that both in Europe where we're 12%, our European subsidiaries 12% return on tangible equity compared to [8% of our] peers and in the Americas, including the U.S. at 17% return on tangible equity, again aligned with our peers. And as I said, the most important thing is that we are improving in almost every single one of these countries this profitability. We continue to be one of the most efficient banks in the world. We have improved our cost income ratio and again, its below -- better than our peers by 17 points more importantly, and we have invested a lot in the last couple of years to improve the customer experience and I'm happy to report that we are now already in 7 of the 10 main countries, which represent 75% of our PBT or profit before tax. We are already Top 3 in customer satisfaction.</p><p>We said many times and we maintain that our priority is sustainable growth. And so that we will continue to manage our capital with great discipline. All of our M&amp;A transactions are meeting our announced and strict investment criteria. We improved our return on risk-weighted assets from 1.4% to 1.5% and we've generated organic capital of 53 basis points. As you can see in the slide. We have done quite a few acquisitions. So I want to stretch that if we had not done these acquisitions 19 basis points in the year, we would already be above 11%, but this were good opportunities that are helping our businesses until net-net. And after this effect, the increase is as you can see 29 basis points reaching 10.84% and on track to be above 11% in 2018.</p><p>I would like to say a few words about SantanderSpain and especially about Popular. Especially in the first few months, we reported this already. We have -- we made an agreement with Blackstone to sell 51% of our real estate asset that was EUR 30 billion nominal value. And very importantly, in November-December, we placed a loyalty bond which had close to 80% acceptance from our customers. This significantly decreases the litigation risk and I want to say that the provisions we have for those potential risks cover -- are well covered. We are well covered. But is even more important that as we manage the integration, we are managing to stabilize the business and even gained market share. The way we will track Popular is by looking at Santander and Popular together. That is the Santander Group in Spain. Between June and December of 2017, we gained 80 basis points of market share in deposits. And for the full year, we increased our revenues by above 1%. Very importantly, the return on tangible equity for Santander Spain has grown from 9% to 10%. And we're well on our way to executing the first stages of the integration. I want to say, we're doing this in a very responsible way both for our people and for our customers.</p><p>So in summary, we have met all the targets we set for 2017. Loyal and digital customers are on-track. The cost of credit continues to improve every quarter. We've improved for the past 4 years, it's close to 1.07%. This reflects our selective growth strategy and prudent risk management. We continue to improve efficiency to close to 47% and earnings per share and cash dividend per share are growing as we announced for 2017. We do continue to accumulate capital and we continue to offer one of the best returns among banks in terms of return on tangible equity, reaching 12%.Before I hand over to Jose Antonio to give you more details on the year, I would like to end by sharing with you the progress we're making for our shareholders in more detail. Earnings per share, as you can see here are growing on an underlying basis by 8%. And earnings per share as reported are also growing around 1%. Tangible net per share is stable in the year. If we had excluded foreign exchange effects, this would have been plus 14%, so even after adverse foreign exchange, were actually stable tangible net and cash dividend per share growing at 11%.We continue to track these metrics as our key shareholder metrics.</p><p>And I would like to finish by discussing where we are on our people and our communities. These are very important stakeholders for us, making sure we make progress on how our teams are working and the engagement is absolutely the most important part of our strategy. As you know, we are working on establishing a common culture across the group, encouraging our people to live by the 8 corporate behaviors. Starting in 2017, [40%] of our performance management is going [to call my] contribution, it's rewarding already our employees for how we behave. About 100,000 of our teams have been evaluated according to these new methodology. Across all markets, we have taken very important initiatives to embed the culture and the behaviors and making sure that we are doing things in a way that is more simple, and personal and fair. These are ambitious and high standards. I'm happy to report that this year, 81% of our employees agree that we behave in a way that is simple, personal and fair. That's 9 points more than last year. And finally, as I said already, we are one of the Top 3 banks to work for, in 5 countries; Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Portugal. Two countries have achieved this for the first time Brazil, Portugal. It means that we have reached our 2018 target of having 5 countries in the Top 3.</p><p>We know that our growth, our profitability and strength, as I have explained, we are making progress on this. And this is very important, so we can continue to support our community and fulfill our purpose, which is to help people and businesses prosper. This of course means that we need to do our day-to-day business well, making loans and offering mortgages but it means more than that. It means investing in many, many social programs across the bank to support communities. We have helped 1.9 million people this year. We're also helping businesses prosper supporting entrepreneurs, their engines of growth and job creation. We are launching new microcredit initiatives across Latin America. The pioneering program was in Brazil, and we're launching other initiatives in other countries.</p><p>And finally, all of these aims are underpinned by our work with universities and higher education. We have invested EUR 129 million in 2017 and launched Santander X, which is a platform to connect entrepreneurs across our country. So this is why, when we say we're responsible bank, we are actually saying something we are doing already, which is investing and tackling some of the biggest social challenges that will help people and businesses prosper. And we know we can only do that by continuing to grow in a profitable way and strengthening our bank.</p><p>So that is the introduction I wanted to make. I would now leave you with Jose Antonio to make a more detailed review of the group and the business areas, and I will come back for the closing. Thank you.</p><p>JOSi ANTONIO GARCC-A CANTERA, CFO, HEAD OF FINANCIAL DIVISION &amp; EXECUTIVE VP, BANCO SANTANDER, S.A.: Thank you Ana, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for attending this yearly results presentation. As Ana said, I'm going to start where she stops basically because I think what best reflect the 2017 is this area of profitable growth with a strong balance sheet that you have on the slide. The numbers there reflect exactly this area. We are progressing well on recurring revenues. We are gaining customers, the loyalty programs that we launched in different countries, the strategies are working well. And this is relating to volumes on one side, and to revenues in the other side. The profitability, the numbers speak by themselves. We are progressing well in a recurring way, in a consistent way that is as important as the growth is, the consistency of this growth.</p><p>Finally the strength. We give attention, strong attention to our -- to risk of the balance sheet. The risk is -- the quality of the balance sheet is improving, at the same time, we are increasing our capital risk in line with what we've been communicating to you, the capacity to generate a capital on an organic basis quarter-after-quarter.</p><p>[Not going to talk] much about the P&amp;L in itself. Ana did already. I'm going to focus you in the -- on the right side of the slide, that shows that the growth we are showing in the bottom line of the P&amp;L is consistent. We come from -- at the beginning of 2016 being generating EUR 1.6 billion a quarter. We are now without Popular EUR 1.9 billion with Popular around EUR 2 billion a quarter. This show -- and the trend is fairly consistent because it comes from the more recurrent lines of the P&amp;L, NII, plus fee income that -- as we show before.</p><p>Let me do -- play in a little bit, the extraordinary in the quarter. In the quarter, we had 2 positives, 1 coming from the disposal of Allfunds and were 25% in Allfunds. We got EUR 297 million coming from these disposal, capital gain, and we got also from the tax reform, a positive in the sales -- a positive impact in the P&amp;L of EUR 73 million in the quarter. On the negative side, extraordinary negatives. The main one is a goodwill impairment. We impair goodwill [in SCUSA] for about [EUR 500 million] in the quarter. This is the main impact in the quarter. So then, we have a net charge of EUR 382 million in the quarter, that in the year is EUR 897 million compared with EUR 417 million in 2016. You have all the</p><p>[integration] information in the Appendix in more detail.</p><p>Going to the business. This chart probably reflects what's going on in the business of Santander across different regions. Fairly consistent growth, non-recurring items of the P&amp;L. You see the net interest income grow in a consistent base, fee income also growing and this is what reflects -- exactly what we are doing and why do we think that our commercial transformation is working in a proper way, and that the loyal -- the bet we made in the loyalty plus digital strategies is you seen not only number of customers is translating straight into revenue and results.</p><p>On the cost side, while we continue to be the most efficient bank among our peers. You see, we are growing revenues more than cost in almost all the markets, and I'm going to remark especially that while after a strong effort in the U.S. last couple of years, our cost base in the U.S. is already growing in line with inflation or less than inflation that is -- that reflects properly the processing which we are in the U.S. And also remark Mexico, probably we comment also in the previous quarter. Mexico has a significant increase in cost because we are making significant investments in the quarter -- [during] the quarter, the last couple of quarters and we continue to do so, because well we need to improve over operational capabilities in the [country].</p><p>Quality, as it can be reflected as cost of credit is around 1%, which is below what we were telling you in the Investor Day and well reflect a benign credit scenario but is well spread across of what you have on the right side, all the [year] within which we are improving our cost of risk. NPLs, follow the same trend, as you can expect and you have the figures with and without Popular on this [term]. Finally, real estate. Well -- we are well ahead of our competitors in this regard and I will say 2018 will be probably last year in which we report this because we are achieving the aim of the process to normalize the situation and finishing the numbers now is EUR 5.7 billion in our balance sheet. You have the split on the right side, and this is coming to an end after the real estate -- the severe real estate crisis in Spain.</p><p>On capital, the quarter was very good. On organic basis, we generate 27 basis points in the quarter. This is not as you know, we guide you always for 10 basis points per quarter, with some volatility in this case came in the positive side just because the risk weighted assets in the quarter grew very little, and this was enough to offset the inorganic [businesses] we did in the quarter, that are already known by you, basically the acquistion of 50% of the asset management and the acquistion of 10% of SCUSA that came in the quarter along with the disposal of Allfunds, net-net is 15 basis points negative in the quarter. So overall, a very good quarter on capital generation.</p><p>Finally, we've been pretty active with TLAC eligible instruments and as I mentioned, we are already in line with MREL requirements. So we made, each ones you see in the screen and we are already compliance with required regulations. Going by geographies, you have the usual pie which we split by countries, no big change there. But you look at the right side, overall very good growth in almost all geographies. Plenty of them in double-digit, but overall very good growth with some ones having [a stellar performance] in the year. Starting with Brazil. Brazil, we had a very good year, we've been communicating to you that our franchise -- the quality of the franchise has been improving the last -- probably the last 2 or 3 years. We've been consistently telling you that our franchise was improving. You see the numbers, you see the numbers in the number of customers, digital customers, you see the volumes, we are gaining share in some of the most profitable segments in the market like consumer loans, credit cards, acquiring business. So in this segments, we're gaining share and we are consistently translating this into the figures of revenues, with good control of cost translating to a significant growth in the profits and consistent. For 2018, we remain optimistic, the macro is helping, is better, definitely than it was in 2017 and 2016 and '15 that the country was in recession. And we can expect some volatility probably in the markets coming out. There is since elections in the country, probably we can expect some margin pressure, as a result of [low risk]. But maybe some regulatory impacts here and there. But overall, we expect significant growth in volumes and better cost of credit that well [it has to] think that we can continue to deliver in that significant -- and to grow our profits in a significant way in the country.</p><p>The U.K. overall good year. So you look at [the year]. We grow NII and fee income in -- for that market that is very much a market and very competitive market in a consistent way. So we were able to translate this into the bottom line, but one-off in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter that increased in a significant way the provisions for bad loans. The quarter was a bit more complex, with NII suffering a bit for due to the SVR. SVR in mortgages and mortgage market being fairly competitive. Overall for 2018, we continue to see an environment with relatively flattish (inaudible) volumes, while margin compression probably is going to stay as it was -- depends for us in the trends on the mortgage market and we are optimistic about the fee income where we see a stronger growth than we have had in the coming years. We are confident that we're going to meet our commitments in the U.K.</p><p>Consumer finance, well, another good year, I would say, consistently gaining market share. The car market grew 3%, our production grew 11%, so we are gaining share. The last quarter normally seasonally weak on revenues and it happens already this quarter, but the trends well are very consistent and we expect to continue to deliver in line with what we're delivering with a return on risk-weighted assets in north of 2% and good return on tangible equity in the region of 16%. So for 2018, well, we expect some continuity in this business. The credit scenario continue to be very benign for this business in Europe.</p><p>Spain, well, our commercial strategy is working. You look at the numbers of loyal customers, digital customers, we are growing [plus]. We are translating these into revenues. Some of --</p><p>you see the NII been a bit weaker. In the quarter, this is due more to ALCO and GCB activity more than the retail. But overall the revenues in the year, customer revenues grew 2.4%. That is in this environment is a good outcome. We are growing well, both in deposits, mutual funds, 10% -- mutual funds 18% and we are in record territory many items, very important items consumer loans, credit cards payments acquiring. We are in record territory and gaining share on those fields. So going forward, we -- probably we are going to see in 2018, or we expect a slight growth in loans. Net interest income probably stabilizing and improving around the year and we continue to grow well in fee income and improving credit quality. That is already quite good.</p><p>In Popular, the word that probably reflect the best. Popular is stabilization of the bank. The third quarter was -- the first quarter we took over. The fourth quarter the bank was stabilized, volumes are basically flat and loans of the bank is stabilized and the 1st, in January the bank is starting to show the capacity -- more capacity to grow. Well, so I would say that the best -- what I can say to you is that we're comfortable with the [additives] we established at the time of the acquisition and this is probably -- tells you about our -- would be about the future of the bank. In the last quarter, Ana already mentioned the loyalty bond that we [sold] that was accepted by almost 80% of the customers. That is a good outcome and required a significant effort in the quarter.</p><p>So going to the other countries and Mexico, the year was very good. The return on tangible equity is almost 20%. Execution is difficult in Mexico as you --</p><p>also the P&amp;L, you see the revenue growing very well in double-digit, also cost are growing in double digit, and the [execution for duration] is quite demanding. But well, and as I said, we are growing well 24% more loyal customers, [62%] more digital customers. And what we can expect going forward is growing revenues by single-digit -- double-digit, also because we will be in this region. So we can continue to deliver a significant growth in Mexico, as we expect to do in Chile where the macro situation is [scurrying] -- a little for the better and we expect to continue to profit from this situation.</p><p>In Portugal, well, the results speak by themselves. Excellent cost management, cost went down 7%, NPLs went down 300 basis points, so very good developments in Portugal. This year, we're going to do the Popular integration that we expect to finish before the year-end.</p><p>In the U.S., overall a very good year. Yes, so on one side, we pass the CCAR. We were able to pay the [first] dividend and when you look at the units, the different units. There are 3 units. So basically a few units that we have in the country. As we [aid] the bank improving NII, not yet growing volumes, but we expect to grow volumes in 2018. BCI, the private banking -- offshore private banking performing very well. And SCUSA, well changing the risk profile for higher risk profile to lower risk profile that you see in the P&amp;L, lower NII and lower provisions and significant improvement on the operational side. So I think that in 2018, we should be able to start to show a growing and consistent results quarter-after-quarter in the U.S. So -- and this is my view for the U.S.</p><p>In Argentina, well, with Citibank integration, the unit is performing well in a country that is heading for a more stable financial situation that allow us to develop the business. And in Poland, we were growing double-digit from volumes, double-digit revenues. We stood at -- we had some one-offs like increased contribution to the [deposit to finance], some others that probably affect these results, thus reflect exactly what is going on [and the like].</p><p>Finally, Corporate Centre, only 2 areas here. We have here higher -- a more negative NII due to the TLAC issues that comes to the corporates -- [the exacts] come to the Corporate Centre and the cost of hedging the FX that also increase. So those are the main -- the 2 main impacts here on top of the non-recurring items that you have and I already explained before. Now I hand over to Ana that is going to elaborate our -- the conclusions of the presentation and the priorities.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: Thank you, Jose Antonio. I'd like to end this presentation reminding you about strategic priorities and what it is we're doing to prepare to continue to deliver profitable growth in the years ahead. So I'd like to remind also where we are -- our mission and what we want to be as a bank. What is it that Santander aims to do differently than others. And so we said already and reiterate here, our purpose is to help people and businesses prosper. We want to do things in a way that is simple and personal and fair for our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. And we aim to be the best open digital financial services platform ensuring the lasting loyalty of all our stakeholders. We have a great opportunity to connect with millions of customers and to increase the loyalty of these customers.</p><p>We see our strength and our strategy based on 3 things. First is our scale and I want to stress in-market scale. Second is how the scale joins to the diversification of markets. And these are only 10 markets where we get 97% of our profit in Europe and the Americas, which allow us to deliver predictable growth. And last but not least, the size allows us also to work ever more closely together across countries to innovate together and build a better bank for the future across the geographies, building global platforms.</p><p>Just a few words about this in-market scale and this is really important. You can see that in 5 out of our 10 core geographies, we already leader in that market. #1, if we take for example loans. In 3 countries that together have more people, the United States of America, Brazil, Mexico and Poland, we're #3 and getting closer to #2 as you've seen in our presentation in Brazil and Mexico.</p><p>In the U.K. we're #5, even though we rank second or third in some areas like mortgages. And in the U.S., we have 2 businesses. One is Santander Consumer, which is one of the top consumer finance companies and a regional bank where we are now making progress. Very importantly, we are growing, not just our loyal customers and digital customers. I want to remind you that digital customers will grow in 3 years from 15 million to 30 million, which is our target for '18. We're at 25 million this year and we've grown our total number of customers to 133 million. And again, through our global platforms, I will cover that in a few minutes. We can grow also in -- to some new markets. So the diversification of our business, and this is important, it's not just across geographies in Europe and the Americas, it's also by businesses. And this balanced mix between mature and emerging markets and a diversified client mix is what allows us to deliver predictable results through the cycle. You can see this high growth in emerging markets, but very importantly, we're growing also customer revenues and total customers, and in some areas like France, even growing in the mature markets. Again, the target is to grow profitably in all of these.</p><p>As a result, the predictability of our earnings, these numbers show over the last 20 years how we have performed against our peers in terms of quarterly earnings per share volatility. We are at 9%, that is significantly better than the second best, and we've grown our earnings by 4x, which is the third best among our peers. Again, this lower volatility in earnings means that we are much more resilient through the cycle and can deliver, and therefore need less capital. This is one of the reasons than our peers.</p><p>This predictability allows us to do 3 things. First, at the same time, which is to lend more to our customers, we've grown our loans by 11% in 2017. And our revenues by 11%, but we've also grown our loans -- we saw before, we are also growing our cash dividend per share 11% versus last year and we are accumulating capital 10.84%, which is above EUR 3 billion more in our CET1.</p><p>I'd like to spend, close a few minutes on how it is that we are working on the third part of our model, of our strength, which is innovation across the group. We are focusing on 4 areas, where we were working together to build global platforms in a responsible way. We are promoting this, working together through our corporate culture, and our behaviors, and basically, not exclusively, but mostly looking at these 4 areas, distributed ledger technology, how artificial intelligence can help us deliver better for our customers, new payment systems, and new platforms and services based on APIs, which will enable us -- already are enabling us to share our infrastructure across the group, but also with third-parties. And we are working, as I said, more and more in this line.</p><p>So in terms of payments, you can see here, Santander Pay. This is maybe the name maybe not, but this is basically an all-in-one App that will allow our retail customers to have a digital wallet, have a personal finance manager, same day international payments, and person-to-person payments. The infrastructure behind these new payment will be blockchain- based. We've been testing this since 2016 and expect to be -- it's not the first -- one of the first international bank to offer our retail customers in 4 countries, Spain, Brazil, U.K. and Poland same day or next day international or cross-border payments with full transparency on fees and FX upfront. This is very important because our customers as of today and actually, I'd say, all banking customers are getting 2 to 4 days value on these payments. It is a large market, and building this infrastructure across countries is going to allow us again to have a leading role in this new way of allowing international payment.</p><p>Second is data. We are working together across the group in an open source platform, with a team of over 100 data centers, learning from over 5 billion transactions, and obtaining very encouraging results on a large number of customers, working on 10 million customers. We are getting results in terms of lower acquisition costs, increasing loyalty by 10% to 30%, and much lower churn. We estimate, and this is an estimate that this kind of insights into customers will allow us to better service and service with more -- more services our customers and more customers and deliver around EUR 500 million additional revenues over the next few years. We're working on other areas together across the group. Also with new types of branches, which we think will be much more attractive. So we want to combine both the digital customer insights with a different type of attention in our branches throughout -- all our countries.</p><p>Another area where we're working together as a group, building a digital global platform is -- this is not a bank account, this is a payment for the unbanked. It has been launched in Brazil for several years. We're launching in several countries over the next year. Where basically, we're allowing our customers to receive transfers from third-parties and top-ups from current accounts [and might] from other people, transfers, but also, and this is very important that they can actually make withdrawals in our ATM and both Internet, web payments and physical. This is growing at a very good rate, [where the] 1 million customers, we've added 0.5 million customers over the last 12 months and increased revenues by more 2.4x.</p><p>Two other platforms we have developed over the last 12 months. We are growing very significantly. One is OpenBank. It's a 100% digital. it's not just a fully digital bank, but we are using it as a blueprint for what could be the future IT infrastructure for the Santander Group. It is one of the few digital banks that has a full stack of products. It has already 1 million customers, has grown 26% in loyal customers, and has grown deposits, and has lowered the cost of deposits in a significant way.</p><p>I'd like to say that OpenBank already is larger than [ApenBank] [Sterling] #26 and [Cedar] altogether. You can see that the other platform we're working on. This is effectively a global cash management system. Santander was not in that business. We're now building the infrastructure based on blockchain, which will be much faster and cheaper. But very importantly, we're adding many customers every month. We now have 154 multinationals on this service. We are very encouraged because this is saving not just time, but also being much more -- with a single entry point, being much more efficient for big company. And we believe, this is an area of great potential for us in the regions where we are active but we also collaborating with banks in other regions.</p><p>And so we are growing our digital customer base. It's very important. We now have 41% of our active customers at digital, and these are 2x more profitable customers. We have a number of services and the aim we have it to be where our customers are, just some examples of what we're doing through the Santander app in Spain, you can speak directly or set up a meeting with your banker from your app. So you can choose to deal with us only on digital, if you want to talk to somebody, you have your personal manager there in Brazil, in Mexico and soon in other countries. You can also talk to us through the Facebook Chatbox, with a real-time assistant. So of course, there are many things we're doing. Again, we believe very much in the combination of digital with the branches, and with the new model of branches that we are now working on.</p><p>So as a summary of all these things and examples, we are doing -- I would like to add that two years ago, we had no teams working in agile in the group. Today, we have 24% of our project being managed in what we call now agile, with thousands of people across the bank. What it means is that the volume of digital transactions and I wanted to show you '15, '16, because we really started investing and changing, transforming the bank 2 years ago. You could see that the growth was pretty let's say average, plus 7%. In just 1 year, we've gone from 4 million digital transactions per month to 10 million digital transactions, exponential growth, and this is coming from our larger countries.</p><p>Spain is at the lead with 4x more digital transactions over the last 12 months. Brazil, 3x more, U.K. 2.5x more. This is very important because today 39% of all digital transactions -- 39% of our total transactions at digital, and as you can see in the slide, 31% of our sales are digital. In some countries like the U.K., we actually, for example, opening 38% of all our current accounts online. And of course this is -- this digital activity is allowing us to reduce the cost per transaction. We get asked many times, where do you see the positive effects of what you're doing in digital. On the cost side, it's is very clear. On the customer side, as I said before, we've gone from 15 million to 25 million, 10 million more digital customers in 2 years, and our target is to reach 30 million by next year.</p><p>So I'd like to end just with a key takeaways of our results and what's 2017 has been for Banco Santander. I'd say again, it's been -- again a very strong year with a 20% growth of underlying PBT. And as Jose Antonio explained, in basically, every single country, thanks to a responsible growth. We are again, one of the most efficient and profitable banks in the world, improving efficiency and return on tangible equity. We have further improved the strength of our balance sheet, reaching 10.84% CET 1, and our scale and diversification allow us to once again deliver predictable growth. And as I just covered, working together across the group, innovating to favor our customers in an efficient way, building global platforms will open up many new opportunities for us.</p><p>And I would like to end by saying that we reiterate and are committed to delivering on all the key metrics that we announced 3 years ago and basically are confident we will deliver on all our target for 2018. So thank you very much, and Jose Antonio [certainly] we are now able to answer your questions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Jose Antonio, we have time now for live Q&amp;A. So please operator, we can proceed with the first question. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Francisco Riquel from Alantra Equities.</p><p>FRANCISCO RIQUEL, HEAD OF RESEARCH, ALANTRA EQUITIES SOCIEDAD DE VALORES, S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to focus on capital, the organic capital generation has priced positively and very strong 27 basis points, which is half of what you have generated in the full year. So -- and I would like to see if you can elaborate a bit more on these capital generation beyond the retained earnings. What is driving this capital generation, any optimization in interest weightings that including the tax reform in the U.S. here et cetera whatever. And also on the minus 8 bps of headwind in capital [if you can] give a bit more details. And then, looking also into -- on the regulatory headwinds, if you can update on the potential impacts, we should expect from IFRS 9, before -- ETA guidelines or any other regulatory changes that you may expect. Thank you.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: So in organic capital, we include the profits, minus the dividends for the year, and of course the growth in our loans. So those are the 3 main components of capital. I'm not aware that we have any big one-offs, but Jose Antonio maybe you can answer that. I don't think, we have that in the quarter, but it's been a strong quarter. So those are the 3. In other, the main thing there is FX, and valuation of our loan portfolios -- bond portfolios. So those are the components on capital. On impact of IFRS 9, [BIS 4] and EBA, we expect to be less impacted than others, but it's obviously -- in IFRS 9, we have the numbers. They're not very large. On BIS 4 and EBA, there is still some issues where we might be impacted, for example, operational risk, which we have to be defined by the local regulator. In terms of the floors, we're not impacted at all, I understand marginally, actually nothing at all I believe. So really the only uncertainty is -- how the local supervisors actually will interpret the op risk changes. But all-in-all, we expect to be much less affected than most peers in Europe.</p><p>JOSi ANTONIO GARCC-A CANTERA: Basically is what is [CRA]. In the quarter, the minus 8% is AFS basically, as Ana said. IFRS 9, we communicated to you 15 basis points 1 year ago, before Popular, with Popular is 20 basis points. And the others -- [the theme is difficult to shape, so I believe]. And the others doesn't affect us, the floor and all these things doesn't affect us.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Jose Abad from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>JOSi MARIA ABAD HERNANDEZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions from my side. The first question on capital. If you keep delivering at the run rate of 10 bps a quarter on average, you should be getting to your target of capital by year-end by Q4, Q1 next year, more or less. Once you get there, should we expect any meaningful changes in the way you allocate capital? And related to these where would minorities buybacks rank in your list of priorities. Now my second question is on FX hedging. We are entering to a couple of years, which are going to be quite eventful in Mexico, in Brazil and in the U.K. So could you give us some color please on your FX hedging strategy for the coming 2 years. And if you could link that to the previous question, actually, whether once you meet your capital target later in the year, you plan any changes to your hedging policy, given that actually taking capital is expensive and probably inefficient Thank you.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: Well, we said we want to be above 11% by the end of next year. We do have IFRS 9, and some basil effects which could slow down. But we will, and we reiterating above 11% next year. So that is important. On FX, minorities, it's not on our list right now. As we said, we are comfortable with what we have. We are not planning to list any more companies. But we also don't have plans to delist anyone at this point. On FX, as you saw there, basically the big effect this year was on balance sheet because it was year-end euro, which was minus</p><p>[14%], and that's why our tangible net was flat, in spite of that minus 14%. Next year, we do expect some effect on our P&amp;L, but we still are confident that with the profit growth, we'll deliver, as I said on all our targets for 2018. Once we get to the capital levels we want, we obviously can do 2 things. We can continue profitable growth if those returns are where we want them to be and that's something we have done both organic and some smaller inorganic, or we can increase our dividend. So those are the 2 options, and we believe Santander offers really very attractive profitable growth, and if this continues to be the case, we hope to be able to deliver that. But we were also decided to increase some of the dividend. I think, we need to wait and see.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Alvaro Serrano, from Morgan Stanley.</p><p>ALVARO SERRANO SAENZ DE TEJADA, LEAD ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions. First one is on scratching the numbers. We expect sort of big push from banking union this year. How do you think the competitive landscape is going to evolve at a pan-European level as a result, and now that you have more -- would you -- will probably have more flexibility on capital, you've proven to be very disciplined on M&amp;A. But given those competitive changes that might happened, what role do you want to play and what role do you don't want to play, basically, how do you see few years down the line, the pan-European competitive landscape. And second on NII, in particular, in developed markets, you've seen some weakness in particularly Spain and the U.K. From the presentations, I've understood that you expect -- NII both in Spain and the U.K. in 2018. In Spain, the NII is down 8.5%, the last 2 quarters accumulated. How are you going to manage flat 2018? Are you seeing something we're not seeing and similarly in the U.K., NII was down 3% quarter-on-quarter, and I think you've said flat. Can you elaborate a bit more on that? Thank you.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: Banking union, we at the moment, my belief -- our belief is that until we don't have the euro being totally transferable from north to south and among countries in Europe, and common deposits insurance, I see it's difficult, but it happens, at least with cross-border acquisition. So I would wait until that happens, but obviously, and we very keen and we said that many times, we do not want to go to new markets. So we would always look at in-market transactions, where we already have a presence. So at the moment, our strategy, as I said would be organic, focus on organic growth. There could be expansion, as I mentioned in my presentation, briefly -- if you notice, but OpenBank could decide to go to other European countries. It's absolutely ready, it's a bank that has 1 million customers, offers all products. We are now changing the core banking at OpenBank. So it would be able to go to other countries pretty fast, not just in Europe, by the way. So that is more likely to be the strategy. As of now, it's more efficient, we have a strong brand, and that is where we're going to invest our time and effort for the moment. As Jose Antonio and I mentioned, first let me say that both Spain and the U.K. delivered 10% return on tangible equity this year at the time of record low rates. And for us in Spain, the key measure is the yield curve on our mortgages which is getting a bit steeper. Its been especially hard this year. And our focus is not just on net interest income, but also on fees. And on that sense customer revenues excluding ALCO are up 2.5%.</p><p>Having said that, loan volume are beginning to grow for the first time, net lending to retail and commercial, not institutions in Spain was up [EUR 2 billion]. So that together with the better prospects for the slope of the yield curve means that we can improve that in Spain for next year. U.K. is also challenging in terms of net interest margin. We still have high SVR balances. We expect that to continue to go down next year. But again, we are managing the total revenues is going up 4%, 5% if I remember correctly in 2017 and the guidance -- what guidance are we giving for the U.K., slightly lower margins I believe, right.</p><p>JOSi ANTONIO GARCC-A CANTERA: Some margin compression still [forecast].</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: Some margin comparison for next year. But I want to stress the great job the U.K. is doing and very importantly managing with positive job. So growing revenues more than cost and what's very important is that we're working more and more together, so you cannot just see Santander U.K. or Spain. We're developing new products together. I mentioned some of the ones we're working on, and this is going to help us manage our cost and continue to invest in a very significant way in digital and improving customer experience. So again, if we can deliver these numbers with a very low rate, I am encouraged we can -- that together with the loyalty strategy, digital investment together deliver good results.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank BPI.</p><p>CARLOS PEIXOTO, ANALYST, BANCO PORTUGUC*S DE INVESTIMENTO, S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: The first one would be on the U.K. mainly on provisions. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how do you see -- how do you expect cost of risk to evolve next year? And also one other provisions in the U.K. whether do you expect the charges we've seen this year, which were around for [EUR 100 million], whether you see this is something that should come down over the next couple of years or not? And then at the same time, I was wondering if you could also shed some light on your views on the evolution of NII in U.S.A. next year? Thank you.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: U.K., cost of credit was abnormally low. The previous year at 2 basis points. This year 2017 has been 8 basis points, still very low. We do anticipate some increase for next year of the cost of credit. However, there were significant one-offs for 1 customer in Q4 and there were conduct provisions. I expect should come down for next year. So we don't expect more one-offs. Conduct has been for all banks and including us, I think also this year higher than average and so that should be coming down. But the cost of credit again from 2 basis points to 8 basis points and it should go up slightly. I don't believe we are giving any specific number on that. In terms of NII in the U.S., I believe our bank -- Santander Bank has now almost reached or is at the average of the regional banks, net interest income for the year, if I remember correctly, is at 2.9% -- 2.8%, 2.9%, that's significantly better than previous years. So we are managing margins well. Again as the U.S. recovers, a positive yield curve and slightly higher rates will help us. So we are very encouraged by the progress, not just on the regulatory front, but also on the business side. And again, I don't think, we're giving guidance on that for the U.S., but we continue to be, let's say, confident that is going to continue to get better.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Rohith Chandra-Rajan from Barclays.</p><p>ROHITH CHANDRA-RAJAN, DIRECTOR AND EQUITY ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: I had a few, please. The first one, I guess higher level. You're clearly doing quite a lots on the digital front and metrics like digital customers being 2x as profitable and transactions being 22% cheaper are clearly quite attractive. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that benefit is currently dropping through to the bottom line? And how much is being offset by I guess investment spend as you continue to build out that capability and how long that dynamic might last for? So that was the first one. Second area I wanted to explore with Brazil revenues. So there I guess, fee rate was very strong at the beginning of the year, it's still very strong 11% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, but it has been fading. Just wonder, if you could expand on the comments around that being driven by customer loyalty and activity and how much of that growth is sustainable? And I guess, with loan growth now picking up to 3% to 4% per quarter in the second half of the year, what's driving that and to what degree is that sustainable? And then the final quick area was just on provision coverage, which is down a little bit. The group level particularly driven by some I guess bigger reductions in Mexico and Brazil. Just wondering, what's making you comfortable with those lower levels of coverage in those 2 countries, please. Thank you.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: So I try to give some color on the digital strategy, because we always get the question, where is that -- where are we seeing those benefits in the P&amp;L? Where are we seeing those benefits in customers? And we would not have the numbers, we have -- if we were not investing in digital. So we're growing transactions in a very significant way -- actual overall transactions. And it's not in the slide, but I gave the number 39% of our total transactions are now digital, that's close to 40%. And the big rise in how customers are interacting with us gives us better insights into what customers want and need, but it's also lowering our cost. And of course, you're seeing that comes through in better customer experience, you've seen that we are now at 7 out of 10 countries in Top 3, you're seeing that in the cost income keeping it at [EUR 47 million] and coming down in Spain around 50% in the U.K., it would not be possible without the digital activities. So we're doing much more business with cost either coming down or flattish and you can see all of Europe is actually in real terms coming down in cost. That is already there in the numbers. This is what I was trying to explain with the examples, so you can visualize this. There is one of the most encouraging things in digital is that there are opportunities for us to become a relevant player in things like global cash management. We do not have to build a traditional infrastructure. That is why we're very, very confident that the blockchain is going to allow us to build that cross-border payment infrastructure at a fraction of the cost of what some of the global banks have done. And this is something which is real. We're working on it. As I said, in retail payments, cross-border payments, we expect to go live in the next couple of months. I mean, it's difficult to put many more numbers on that. We are working I believe on the right track and you're seeing that as I said comes through in the numbers. Brazil revenues, I guess, we are aiming to -- obviously margins will come down, rates have come down in Brazil from 14% to 7% in 1 year. So there will be tightening of margins. You're seeing some of that already, but we are aiming and I think the guidance is for double-digit loan growth for next year. And maybe Jose Antonio, you want to add something on the provision coverage or more on Brazil?</p><p>JOSi ANTONIO GARCC-A CANTERA: In Brazil, in the presentation that we have positive volumes. As Ana said, double-digit growth in volumes, some margin compression due to lower rates. Fee income is working well because we expect to continue to gather momentum and gaining market share in several process, I mentioned. Well overall, a good environment, a good outlook for Brazil. In coverage, you mentioned coverage going down in several countries. Well (inaudible) provide. It depends very much on the level of collateral we have. And so in Santander is where we have a collateral -- recoveries tend to be lower in some others tend to be higher. And depends also quarter-on-quarter on the volume of write-downs. So when you write-off more in a given quarter, gives the coverage as because you write-off those loans cover at the 100%. And as a result, mathematically the average goes down, but nothing has changed. In this regard, I will think the main message is that we are very well provided all across the board, yes.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Andrea Unzueta from Credit Suisse.</p><p>ANDREA UNZUETA, VP, CRiDIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'm going to go back to NII if you don't mind. In Spain, you mentioned that the weakness is related to the ALCO portfolio. Can you give us the details of the ALCO portfolio in Spain, both for Santander stand-alone and together with Popular? And how should we expect that to evolve going forward? And then in Brazil, you also mentioned margin pressures because of rates which we all knew, but I was wondering how the ALM contribution to NII is expected to perform going forward. Thanks.</p><p>JOSi ANTONIO GARCC-A CANTERA: We mentioned NII ALCO portfolio once we acquired Banco Popular, we took some decisions in relation with the size of the ALCO portfolio, as a result of this we reduced the ALCO portfolio and that's the reason why the ALCO portfolio was producing less revenues in the fourth quarter. We disclose the ALCO portfolio stating the combined [figure of] EUR 35 billion with a relatively short duration. The duration is pretty short. Well, you also mentioned Brazil, margin compression you have ALCO portfolio. The balance sheet of Brazil, the position is not like in our markets, so the natural position of the balance sheet is to be long, not to be short due to the fact that as you know, as you very well know, the reserve requirements on the deposit side are extremely high that in fact creates a situation that is different from other markets. And the role of the ALCO portfolio in Brazil is for example that is minor compared with the size of the NII in Brazil. So I will not -- we have some ALCO portfolio in Brazil that -- who is going to produce more revenues in 2018 than in 2017, but this is not going to be the main explanation of the terms of NII, given the percentage, the size of the ALCO portfolio. The NII coming from the ALCO portfolio compared with the total NII of the bank.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Sofie Peterzens from JP Morgan.</p><p>SOFIE CAROLINE ELISABET PETERZENS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Hi, yes, it's Sofie Peterzens from JP Morgan. I was wondering if you could just give an update on cost of risk in Brazil. We saw it going down from 455 basis points to 436 basis points and NPL also falling in Brazil. How should we think about the cost of risk going forward in Brazil? Second of all, could you remind us again of your sensitivity to higher rates across different jurisdictions? And lastly, if you could just comment a bit how you see competition from the large tech companies, given that you mentioned that it's much cheaper for you to roll out some products and becoming more Internet-based and digital. But how do you see the competition from the big tech companies such as Apple and Google? Thank you.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: I would take the last question and maybe Jone Antonio wants to take the rates and the Brazil. I understand Brazil, cost of risk for next year is expected to normalize around [400 basis]?</p><p>JOSi ANTONIO GARCC-A CANTERA: Yes, it's 400 and [some payment] is going to go down like 20 basis points or something like that but there is a change in mix.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: So, let me just comment on the large tech companies. We are collaborating with some of them, for example, Apple with, we've become the leader in mobile payments in Spain. We offered Apple Pay 1 year ahead of all the other competitors. These are our customers, so these are customers that are using Apple Pay, there's I think 350,000 using Apple Pay in Spain. So in the U.K., we're collaborating with others, so we are going to collaborate and we believe we're very well placed as long as we can maintain as we are, our place with the customers. So be where the customer wants us to be in many different devices. Again, as we build APIs and we can connect with third-parties. This is going to be increasingly easy for us to do. So we are very confident that that together with the large in-market brand and market shares we have like Brazil, Mexico, Spain and all the other countries, will allow us to compete very effectively with these large companies. They're definitely going to take a part of the business, but we also are going to be able as I said before to take business away from others and global cash management is one of the examples that I gave you, but there are others. There's a 160 million unbanked people in Brazil -- in Latin America. We're doing microcredits, we are doing financial inclusion programs, we've launched in Mexico recently. We have a very ambitious program with universities where we also banking the students and getting into the relationship early on in a customer's life. So we're working on many fronts to stay relevant, to make sure we have growth not just today, but 10 years down the road, and we are becoming increasingly digital. Again some of these examples I gave you, these are what we call the speedboat, the global platforms working across the group, and basically allowing us to invest together in new areas. So we are quite encouraged by the signs and the numbers that we've seen this year and some of them we have shared in my presentation. You want to take [the others]?</p><p>JOSi ANTONIO GARCC-A CANTERA: Well, you asked about sensitivity to higher rates in different countries and across the board, yes. So it's positive, we are -- we have a positive NII reaction in much markets, Spain, U.K., U.S., Poland, Portugal and actually Mexico. So the numbers, well it's a couple of hundred millions in -- 100 basis points in Spain, less so in U.K. and is smaller in U.S. and Poland, and Portugal because the size of the balance sheet. But while these are the position, we have a negative position to higher rates in consumer finance in Brazil, although in consumer finance we tend to be quite conservative and tend to hedge because it's relatively short run loan book 2 years on average. And we tend to -- is relatively hedged. The other question was the cost of risk in Brazil. Well, we have it with us. So when you look at the cost of risk in Brazil, it's important to take into account the change in the mix because the yield outlook [bold] although you see the cost of risk falling from close to 5% to 4.40%. At the same time, you have a significant change of mix. We grew, if I remember well, the loan book by 7%, but this is a combination of growing the consumer-related activities let's say credit cards, consumer lending and all these things in double-digit, and decreasing the ECB and the corporate book. As a result, the cost of risk went down [80] basis points, but with a significant change in mix. That's important. We expect next year to review the cost of risk, but at the same time, we still expect the mix keep changing the way that the mix did in 2017.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Ignacio Ulargui from Deutsche Bank.</p><p>IGNACIO ULARGUI, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just have 2 questions. One, if you could elaborate on the outlook for fees in Spain and then fourth quarter has been at 10% Q-on-Q growth, whether you think this is sustainable.</p><p>[Alternatively] you have offset in 2017, more than offset actually than decline in NII with fees. So what should we expect in 2018, and how do you see the cost of risk, [credit level]</p><p>you have 107 basis points this year down 11 basis points. How do you see that evolving going forward at group level, should we see similar decline in 2018? Thanks.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: Yes. So I want to stress that the increase in fees is not by increasing fees, but by increasing the number of loyal customers and you've seen this quite close relationship between those 2 numbers. And so, yes, we expect to continue to increase fees at double-digit next year based on the growth in both digital and loyal customers, and we think that is sustainable. And especially in the bigger countries, where we still have quite an upside between total customers loyal and digital customers. So in terms of revenues, we're not -- if we take net interest income and fees, we expect growth for next year, I'd say low single digit, but without being more precise. On terms of the cost of risk for next year, it's been very low, so I think, we probably stabilizing. I mean, we haven't really given much guidance, but we expect a strong economy. You've seen a good decrease in the cost of risk in Spain, 37 basis points to 33 basis points this year, that's quite low. But given the strength of the economy and our balance sheet, we think that probably we should be about the same, but again, I want to be cautious on these numbers because there well don't want to give precise numbers on these, but they will be good.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS.</p><p>IGNACIO CEREZO: Couple of questions actually, one is in the U.K., net interest income, more specifically on the lending yield, if you can give us some information on from book -- back book on mortgages. And related to these, what is the impact you're expecting from the change in the SVR rates you announced recently. And the second thing is on the U.S., obviously performance has improved a little bit in the bank. But I think, an investor update back in September, there was a possibility of a more precise or big restructuring plan in the union actually. So just asking how far are we from that possibility? Thank you.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: So I don't know if I used these words, but the U.S. in 2017 has really turned the corner. It has not just turned the corner on the regulatory and supervisory side but also on the business side. And so, we are confident, we had a good business in the U.S. We are confident we can add value in the U.S. It's an attractive market for banks. Net interest margin in a regional bank like Santander Bank is 2.9%. As you know, that is significantly more than -- I know it's a different business. But again, we can run banks efficiently with much lower margins than that, and there's a lot of things we can do together within Santander Bank and Mexico for example, and also other of our markets. So we believe the U.S. is going to do better next year. We're not going to be very precise on numbers, but we expect to continue the recovery in profits and business and do better. In terms of guidance on the U.K., front and back book, there will continue to be SVR attrition, and I'm not sure what the guidance is on going forward. But U.K. is probably the most challenging market for us next year. We said that we expect growth in every single 1 of our 10 core geographies. In the U.K., our expectation is aligned with Bank of England, around, I think [1.4%, 1.5%] GDP growth. So we will continue to work on efficiency together with other areas of the group. We'll continue to invest in digital. So we can improve customer experience and do more on that side. But there will be volumes and margins will continue to be under some pressure in the U.K.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question comes from Mario Ropero from Fidentiis.</p><p>MARIO ROPERO: The first question is regarding impairments in consumer finance, Europe. Jose Antonio said that the environment is still very benign for 2018. So I was wondering is whether or if based on the latest production that you're making, whether you think that the cost of risk is sustainable in 2018 at the current low levels or whether we should already expect some minor increases there? And then, the other question is on the 123 account in Spain. What are the triggers that would make you -- think the strategy with this product or lower the conditions on this product. Is it reaching the targets in terms of number of customers? Is it interest rates going up, please if you can share your views that will be helpful. Thank you.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: Let me take the 123 question. I mean, the strategy is not going to change. I mean, it's very important that 123 is a strategy. It's a strategy of having and developing long-term relationships of adding value to customers of transparency, of really trying to treat old customers the same, not just new customers, which was -- so this is super important. Its worked for us in the U.K. We've grown again in the U.K. after 5 years, GBP 2.5 billion in current accounts to GBP 67 billion, remember we're coming from GBP 10 billion in 2012, if I remember correctly. So we're up to more than 5 million 123 customers. Now this doesn't mean that the conditions are always going to be the same. I mean, a strategy is a strategy. But obviously depending on markets, we could change conditions. So we have done that in the case of the U.K. and in the case of Spain also. So we've lowered the threshold from</p><p>[15 to 10], but what's important is that 123 customers have 5x lower churn, have much better cost of credit, the risk is much better. They have 50% more credit cards, and this is the reason fees are increasing because we have a deeper relationship. So we are very, very satisfied, confident, that this is the right strategy, it's working for us. And again, it doesn't mean that the conditions might not sometimes over time change, and so that is the key point there. On Santander Consumer...</p><p>JOSi ANTONIO GARCC-A CANTERA: Well the year, we have probably a normally low cost of credit because we dispose some portfolios. I think was in Poland. And this net offset partially the early NII provisions we are making. But this is not going to be a big number aside from that. What we see is stable cost of risk aside from this factor, we sold some portfolios.</p><p>Thank you. We have time for just one last question, please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: We have time for just 1 last question, please.</p><p>OPERATOR: The last question comes from Stefan Nedialkov from Citi.</p><p>STEFAN ROSENOV NEDIALKOV, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just to continue on the question of fees and the loyal customers. The 10% CAGR targets that you have for 2015 and through '18. Could you please just tell us how much of that is organic versus inorganic? And when you set the target back in the days, couple of years ago, did you mean it to be completely organic growth on the retail fees side of things. I'm just asking this question because of the acquisitions you have made over the past couple of years? And secondly, when you go country-by-country, the main countries at least like Mexico, U.K., Spain, Brazil, where would you say from an operational point of view, you have the most to do in terms of building out to the loyal customer franchise. In terms of spend, say, are you done with the loyal customer-related spend in Mexico. Is that coming to an end or tapering off at some point? Similarly for Brazil. Just to give us some color from an operational point of view and I guess from a financials point of view where we are in these countries? Thank you.</p><p>ANA PATRICIA BOTC-N SANZ DE SAUTUOLA O'SHEA: So when we set the strategy back in '15, we were -- we had sold some of the core businesses in the previous years, businesses that are related really to our core customer strategy. So it's -- we were, we didn't specify would be organic or non-organic. We obviously accelerating and were above 10% in the last year. But I'd say that what's important is we're going to meet the target. Some of that is inorganic, I believe maybe a couple of points will be due to Santander Asset Management buyback. But it was not '17, it's only in '18, right? We closed now. So all the numbers and you've seen a very, very significant acceleration. I mean, what matters is that there is really a correlation between deeper relationships on fees, even though actually in many cases, the absolute fee level is coming down in many countries. I've always been very confident about organic loyalty strategy because precisely the 4 countries you mentioned is where we have the most upside. So where we do have less -- let's say, less to do with countries like Portugal or Argentina or Chile, where we are already #1, where we actually need to grow the number of customers. These are the smaller countries, where we have been a leader for longer. So where we needed to better job, and we delivering that in Mexico, Brazil, U.K. and Spain. Again, these are countries that have 400 million people, actually more than 400 million people together, and with actually we have less proportion of loyal customers, the total customers. So I'm not going to say a number, but definitely more than 5 years, we can grow organically in each one of these large countries. Where we investing most of these 3 at the moment to improve our operations -- I'm not sure that was the question, is Mexico. We've announced a very significant investment in Mexico, where we had been underinvesting for a number of years, and we're really trying to and we've increased our ROE there, return on tangible equity to 20%, close to 20% this year already. At the same time, we're investing for growth. But clearly, those are the 4 countries where we have more upside in terms of the loyalty strategy, and the digital strategy, digital customer strategy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible).

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Johan Hedberg. Please go ahead.</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG, CO-FOUNDER, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, CLX COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL): Thank you. This is Johan Hedberg, and good morning, and welcome to CLX year-end report for 2017. In the room, it's myself and Odd Bolin, CFO.</p><p>Okay, next slide. Our 2017 key metrics for growth. 2017 was a great year for CLX, with growth in both gross profit and EBITDA over 60% from last year. We delivered more than 18 billion billable transactions in 2017. To put this in perspective, given that there are 5 billion mobile users on the globe, we delivered almost 4 transactions to every mobile phone in the world during 2017, and that's the scale we reached today.</p><p>Next slide. Over the last 18 months, we focused on building scale and technical platform to support future organic and acquisitive growth. 2017, we also established many relationship with digital-native U.S.-based companies. We look forward to harvest the results in 2018. Out of the 10 biggest tech companies, we now have signed 7. Some of them are still in the implementation phase, and others have not reached their full potential.</p><p>Our goal in 2018 is to establish CLX as one of the top vendors globally in the Communications Platform as a Service space. We took major steps to finalize our next-generation platform, Nova. This project will be finalized during the first half of 2018. We also continued to invest in our product portfolio since revenues grow by more than 60% in 2017, and the company has a strong pipeline entering 2018.</p><p>2017 was a solid year for the Operator Division with good earnings. And as the as-a-service market for mobile operators and service providers continues to grow, we are well positioned for future growth in that area.</p><p>Next slide. So the key metrics for the group. In the Enterprise Division, we focus on gross profit. We measure -- the gross margin is less important since the main driver for gross margin is geographical traffic mix in what country we terminate transactions. U.S., for example, has high gross margins; and France, low. We don't want to have -- be restricted depending on the termination market and the gross margin for that.</p><p>We also use adjusted EBITDA and gross profit and OpEx per transaction to measure operational efficiency in the business. For the Operator Division, we measure revenue and EBITDA. And for Sinch and other new investment, it's gross profit growth.</p><p>Next slide, please. This illustrates the gross profit and number of transactions in our systems over time. And this also illustrates the rapid growth that CLX had for the last 18 months. For the last 2 quarters, we had to digest some of the rapid growth we saw in late 2016 and early 2017, but we're now ready to be more aggressive in the marketplace again.</p><p>Next slide, please. I will hand over this to Odd Bolin.</p><p>ODD BOLIN, CFO, CLX COMMUNICATIONS AB (PUBL): Thank you. The operational efficiency has increased -- continue to increase due to economies of scale. The gross profit is the primary bottom line driver. Revenue and gross margin are both heavily dependent, as Johan pointed out, upon the mix of terminating markets. So the key metrics for us is to measure EBITDA divided by gross profit.</p><p>And as you can see in this figure, we have seen a steady improvement in that number since mid-2016. And we believe that although there might be some further potential, we have come a long way. And in terms of operational efficiency, we are, at this point, quite satisfied with the development we've seen and the situation we have reached. Johan?</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: On next slide. So some comments on the Q4. For the Enterprise Division, EBITDA is up 26% to SEK 79.1 million compared to Q3 '17. Remaining cost in use from acquisitions are SEK 20 million to SEK 25 million in 2018. We are pleased to see that organic growth gross profit has grown 10% compared to the last quarter.</p><p>Anders Olin started on January 15 this year as COO for the Enterprise Division. Anders will focus on creating an agile commercial organization, focusing on organic growth, winning new customers and expand business with our flagship accounts.</p><p>Black Friday and the holiday season generated a lot -- high traffic volumes for us. However, the high pass-through fees in France, combined with new pass-through fees in the U.S., resulted in a 1.7 percentage points lower gross margin compared to Q3 '17.</p><p>Next slide, please.</p><p>ODD BOLIN: Well, here is an earnings bridge for the Enterprise Division, where we have tried to show how EBITDA has developed due to different factors from the fourth quarter 2015, via the fourth quarter 2016, to the fourth quarter last year. As you can see, we have divided the development of the EBITDA into acquired EBITDA, which, in 2016, came from Mblox and, in 2017, from Xura and Dialogue; organic growth; and also effects of one-off character.</p><p>These effects amounted to about SEK 19 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and they consist of a few isolated effects, the major one -- the major ones being a major customer becoming a competitor and, thus, decreasing the traffic with us considerably; and also regulatory changes in the U.K. increased cost of goods sold for us in both the U.K. and in other markets in such a way that we couldn't pass on this entire effect to our customers.</p><p>The full effects of those issues or these items became visible from Q3, although some of them started already in Q3 -- in Q2, as communicated previously. What I would like to point out is that even considering those effects of a one-off character, we have increased our quarterly EBITDA by more than SEK 15 million over the last 24 month. Johan?</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: Next slide. So we hosted an RCS event in Atlanta together with the GSMA. Google and all of the U.S. mobile operators and operators from around the globe participated, in total, more than 150 people. It was a great event for CLX to position itself as the market leader for RCS.</p><p>We also launched a hybrid SMS RCS API. This will allow customers to send RCS messages with a fallback to SMS if the mobile phone is not yet RCS compatible. RCS can replace a lot of applications with its rich feature set.</p><p>We believe RCS will make the messaging market grow a lot over the coming years. They are still in an early phase, where the standardization is not fully completed. We think that all of the mobile operators in the U.S. will have RCS live by the end of 2018. So this is a market that is developing rapidly. We are well positioned to go after this market, and we're very excited about it.</p><p>Some comments on the Operator Division in Q4. The underlying business is developing well. In this quarter, we did not have any capacity expansion projects. Capacity expansion projects are difficult to predict quarter-by-quarter. We also had some costs for third-party licenses that impacted this quarter.</p><p>We will increase investments in sales and marketing as we see the as-a-service market for mobile operators and service providers grow in the coming years, and we're well positioned to go after that marketplace. We think that 15% EBITDA margin is a good medium-term number to use for this division.</p><p>Next slide. And some comments on Q4 for Sinch and IoT. We continue to invest to increase our functionality and to invest in customer adaptation, to win large customers. Ride-sharing, in particular, is developing favorable. We continue to invest in IoT but at a moderate level, mirroring the relatively slow pace of market maturation. We expect to see some ride-sharing breakthrough, large revenues, important revenues in 2018.</p><p>Next slide. I just want to repeat our growth strategy: organic growth; upselling our installed customer base with new services; continue to expand our geographical footprint, in 2018, we will have a much more focused strategy for Asia Pacific and China; expand our product offerings; and also continue to do selective acquisitions. Odd Bolin?</p><p>ODD BOLIN: Thank you. So we're at the slide, October to December 2017. I'll not go through the figures as such in any detail, in general, because they're all in the report, and you can follow it in there. But there are a few items that I would like to elaborate on, and that's -- those are items affecting comparability and some tax and amortization issues.</p><p>So if you move to the slide that is called items affecting comparability, et cetera. First of all, in the fourth quarter 2017, items affecting comparability includes a revenue of close to SEK 12 million due to a write-down of an earnout for Xura that didn't materialize. This gives us some revenue, which makes the adjusted EBITDA higher than the reported EBITDA.</p><p>And there's nothing strange about this. It's an item that doesn't -- that affects comparability, and it has nothing to do with the underlying business. But I understand it might look a little bit strange there. It's being offset by a change in goodwill that is affecting the income statement below EBITDA. So if you look at the net profit, there is no impact.</p><p>Also in 2017, the EBIT was affected by SEK 126 million of amortization of customer and operator relationships. Those came with the acquisitions of Mblox, Xura, Dialogue and Sinch, and it's the level we expect them to stay at for the next few years.</p><p>2017 tax was affected positively, also 2017 fourth quarter tax was affected positively by SEK 87 million, giving us a positive tax rate. And those were for 2 reasons. The change in the U.S. corporate tax, that is an effect of the recent decision in the U.S. to implement the tax package, affects the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.</p><p>And also, an analysis of deferred tax assets in the U.K. has concluded that those can be capitalized to a larger extent than we originally believed after the acquisition of Mblox. But both of these have been booked as deferred tax in the income statement, affecting the tax rate.</p><p>The actual taxes paid can be seen specifically in the income statement, and those deferred tax changes has no effect on the cash flow in the period. And obviously, we will -- by using these deferred tax assets in the future, we will be able to get a better cash flow. So it's a -- from our point of view, it's a very positive development. Johan?</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: So summarizing this call with our priorities going forward for 2018. We're going to focus on increase our visibility in the CPaaS marketplace; in North America, harvest the results from the hard work in 2017 with the digital-native companies, big tech companies, and continue to grow that market unit. We have a new COO on board, create a more agile sales team focusing on organic growth.</p><p>We are splitting out Asia Pacific as a separate market unit, also including focus on China; continuing investment in sales and marketing in the Operator Division to fuel top line growth and ride on the trend that mobile operators and service provider use more as-a-service. 2018 will see the first large deals in our new service offerings and also see the first small revenues from RCS. So 2018 will be a very exciting year for CLX.</p><p>And with that, we're turning over to Q&amp;A.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Fredrik Lithell from Danske Bank.</p><p>FREDRIK LITHELL, RESEARCH ANALYST, DANSKE BANK MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Can you talk a little bit about you came back in terms of organic growth in the quarter to an 8% level? Your competitors both in the Nordics and in the U.S. are trailing at slightly higher levels. Do you do you see that you are on your way up, or is 8% on a global type of market more the levels you see in terms of organic growth going forward?</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: I think our ambitions are higher from where we are today. We definitely want to have a more aggressive organic growth rate. But I -- we are, right now, creating a more agile sales team structure. It might take some time to get that fully operational and implemented, but that's definitely our ambition.</p><p>FREDRIK LITHELL: Okay. And just another one, and then I will go back to the line. You talk about additional cost savings SEK 20 million, SEK 25 million. Could you sort of elaborate on -- you talked earlier about that you will get some cost savings out from Dialogue once you have the Nova platform in place, then you can release some employees and all that stuff. Is this on top of that, or can you sort of put that in place with the other things you have talked about earlier?</p><p>ODD BOLIN: The SEK 20 million, SEK 25 million is what we've already communicated. It's primarily due to the fact that we were going to close down the Sheffield office mid -- or midyear, end of June and, as you said, release some employees, so there is nothing new in that. But we still haven't done it because it will be done once all the migration to Nova is done, and we can actually close down the remaining parts of the Dialogue organization that is not going to be needed going forward.</p><p>FREDRIK LITHELL: But once you have done that, that's really on an OpEx level. When you have the Nova platform really up and running, and you can start to move over specific contracts onto that platform, and eventually, over maybe a 2-year horizon, you would be able to close down all the platforms. Is that going to give you other streams of savings on a COGs level? Or how should we view that?</p><p>ODD BOLIN: Well, we haven't communicated anything apart from the fact that we do expect some effects. But the closure of the other systems will happen this year mostly once we have finalized the migration. But on the COGS level, we do expect and do hope to see some effects, but we haven't, at this point, communicated any figures for that. So the SEK 20 million, SEK 25 million is the OpEx savings that we expect primarily from closing down the Sheffield office but also, to a smaller extent, some remaining effects from Xura.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will now take our next questions from Staffan Aberg from Carnegie.</p><p>STAFFAN ABERG, FINANCIAL ANALYST, CARNEGIE INVESTMENT BANK AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: First of all, on the Operator Division, you state that Q4 earnings was burdened by certain investments that you hope will -- it will deliver some return ahead. What type of investments are you talking about here? And for how long will this burden the cost base in that division?</p><p>Also, you state that you will focus on growth there, but the base assumption here would like to be that revenues should come down in 2018 from 2017, that division, but what is current run rate? Is it the level you reported in Q4?</p><p>ODD BOLIN: Regarding the cost that we have taken in the fourth quarter, those are one-off effects for licenses and services that we hope will have a positive impact on our operations going forward, not traditional investments but costs that we still hope will have an impact going forward.</p><p>Regarding the level -- revenue level that we expect to see going forward, we -- as we have communicated, we have no major capacity expansion projects in the pipeline at this point the way we had beginning of last year when we won a couple of such projects that we communicated in 2016. We do expect some capacity expansion projects to materialize, but we cannot foresee or forecast any major projects of the type we had last year.</p><p>So we do have a slightly lower starting point, but we still expect -- with the changes that are being done in the Operator Division, with the more -- with the increased focus on sales and marketing, to see a good development during the year. We haven't said anything about the actual level, though, and we are not prepared to do that at this point.</p><p>STAFFAN ABERG: But could you quantify the one-off cost you took in the Operator Division in Q4?</p><p>ODD BOLIN: We got a handful of millions Swedish krona.</p><p>STAFFAN ABERG: All right. And also, if I may, on RCS, you mentioned the potential with that, but at which point in time do you hope to see a meaningful contribution from RCS?</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: I think we'll see the first revenues this year when it's -- it depends a little bit on how fast mobile operators are implementing this. We know now that all of the mobile operators in the U.S. will have full support for RCS in 2018, so I would say that meaningful revenues could come in 2019.</p><p>STAFFAN ABERG: And how long your expectations on your clients' time to adapt? Because if the systems and the functionality is there in the U.S. by the end of this year, how long will it take for your clients to adapt?</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: I think Sprint already launched with the first couple of trial customers, so this is getting sort of a buzz in the marketplace. Of course, not all of the mobile operators are supported today, but brands are starting to think about this. The ecosystem is starting to gear up for this and starting to have a conversation with their customers about this. Exactly how fast the uptake will be is difficult to answer, but in North America, this is happening now.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Daniel Djurberg from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG, RESEARCH ANALYST, HANDELSBANKEN CAPITAL MARKETSAB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Starting with a question on the big OEM contract -- or the contract with a big handset OEM that you won last autumn. I was wondering, did this mean materially -- bring material growth, i.e. was it a big chunk of the 9% organic growth you had in the Enterprise segment? Or is it starting to ramp more or less incremental instead? That is the first question. And also if I could ask a little bit about the pricing model on the RCS, if you are more clear how we will go to market and price it as of now.</p><p>ODD BOLIN: Okay. I'll start with the handset manufacturer that you're referring to, the contract. We have seen no revenue in 2017. We expect that to start ramping up now beginning in 2018 as we have finalized the necessary development work in order to do decouplings needed for that particular customer.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: And how to think it will be now coming chunk-wise, geography by geography, or will it be like incremental, would they use others as well? How to think about the impact?</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: I think we should expect a ramp up during 2018.</p><p>ODD BOLIN: Incremental ramp-up, yes.</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: Yes.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: Okay, perfect. And then I know that you look more on the growth on gross profit that was good in the quarter rather than the gross margin trend perhaps because you can't control everything here, regulatory things, et cetera. But again, looking at the gross margin as we see in your existing markets, everything else equal, how to think on the underlying trend from a -- what you see from competition and so on, if it's starting to stabilize during '18, how to think?</p><p>ODD BOLIN: If you look at the gross margin by a terminating market, we don't see any major fluctuations. But the reason our gross margin fluctuates and the reason we don't use it as a key metric for internal operations is the fact that the traffic mix between those different terminating market is something we have limited control of.</p><p>Our major customers may decide to send more to a specific market than to another during a month, and that will impact our gross margin. But we don't see any major changes in the gross margin by market. It's an entire (multiple speakers) part of a mix.</p><p>DANIEL DJURBERG: And my final question would be on your ambition now. Do you still look for to get the share or chunk of the IoT that might rise as an integrator or on the Enterprise side for IoT as well on aggregate?</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: So we are continuing to invest in IoT and in the segment of the market that is connectivity to mobile operators. We're seeing the market uptake being a little bit slower than we predicted, but we will continue to invest at moderate levels in our IoT business.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have no further questions at this time. (Operator Instructions)</p><p>JOHAN HEDBERG: Okay. All right, so thank you for listening to our 2017 year-end report, and I wish you all a very good day.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call.

Briefly to say that, this morning, we announced full year net profit of $4.39 billion, a record high. For the fourth quarter, net profit was at $1.22 billion, also a record. And the board has proposed a final dividend of $0.60 a share and a special dividend of $0.50 per share.</p><p>So with us today, we have our CEO, Piyush Gupta; and our CFO, Sok Hui, to give us more color on the numbers. Without further ado, Sok Hui, please?</p><p>SOK HUI LIM, CFO, DBS GROUP HOLDINGS LTD: Good morning, everyone. We achieved a record profit for the full year and the fourth quarter. Full year earnings rose 4% to $4.39 billion as total income grew 4% to a new high of $11.9 billion. Broad-based growth in loans and fee income more than offset the impact of a lower net interest margin and weaker trading performance. Underlying loans rose 9%, with breadth and momentum increasing over the course of the year. Including loans from the consolidation of the ANZ retail and wealth management businesses we acquired, overall loan growth was 11%. Fee income grew 12%, which was also broad-based. Productivity gains from digitalization and cost management initiative contained expense growth to 3%.</p><p>The fourth quarter's earnings were also at a new high, rising 33% from a year ago to $1.22 billion. Total income grew 10% to stay above the $3 billion mark for the second consecutive quarter despite seasonally weaker noninterest income in fourth quarter. Business momentum was strong. Loans expanded by an underlying 3% and by 4% after the consolidation of the Taiwan operations of ANZ during the quarter. At the same time, net interest margin improved 5 basis points from the previous quarter and 7 basis points from a year ago to 1.78%. As a result, net interest income crossed $2 billion for the first time. Fee income was 23% higher, led by wealth management and investment banking.</p><p>Our balance sheet remained healthy. Nonperforming assets were stable from the previous quarter, while specific allowances for the quarter were at a more normalized 25 basis points of loans. Our liquidity was ample, with liquidity coverage ratio of 131%. Our final Common Equity Tier 1 was at 13.9%. With the recent finalization of the Basel capital rules, we are now able to ascertain that the impact on us is benign. As such, we have decided to rationalize our capital requirements. The board has suspended the scrip dividend with immediate effect. It has proposed a final dividend per share of $0.60, raising the full year payout by 55% to $0.93, as well as a special dividend per share of $0.50.</p><p>Full year net profit rose 4% to $4.39 billion. Total income also increased 4% to $11.9 billion. Higher net interest income and fee income more than offset the impact of lower trading income and higher allowances. Net interest income grew 7% or $486 million from asset volume growth, which more than offset the impact of a 5 basis point decline in net interest margin to 1.75%. Fee income rose 12% or $291 million, led by growth in wealth management, cash management and investment banking. Other noninterest income declined 18% or $342 million due to a weaker trading performance and to a net gain on fixed assets a year ago.</p><p>Expenses rose 3% or $158 million to $5.13 billion as ongoing digitalization and productivity initiatives kept cost growth. Profits before allowances increased 4% to $6.79 billion. Total allowances were 8% or $110 million higher at $1.54 billion from the accelerated recognition of the weak oil and gas support service exposures during the third quarter.</p><p>Fourth quarter net profit was (technical difficulty) higher than a year ago at $1.22 billion. Total income rose 10% to $3.06 billion as strong business momentum resulted in double-digit increases in net interest income and fee income. Net interest income grew 15% or $273 million from loan growth as well as a higher net interest margin, which rose 7 basis points to 1.78%. Fee income increased 23% or $121 million from broad-based growth, led by wealth management and investment banking. These increases were partially offset by a weaker trading performance, which resulted in a 26% or $115 million decline in other noninterest income.</p><p>Expenses rose 11% or $134 million to $1.36 billion due to higher marketing and technology cost as well as the consolidation of ANZ. Profit before allowances was 9% higher at $1.70 billion. With oil and gas exposures having been dealt with in the previous quarter, total allowances halved to a more normalized $225 million.</p><p>Compared to the previous quarter, fourth quarter earnings were 48% higher. Total income was maintained above $3 billion despite seasonally weaker noninterest income. A combined 12% or $126 million decline in fee and other noninterest income was offset by 6% or $122 million increase in net interest income from loan growth and a higher net interest margin during the quarter. Expenses rose 8% or $100 million, resulting in a 6% decline in profits before allowances of $1.70 billion. Total allowances of $225 million were 1/4 of the previous quarter, where we recognized the residual weak oil and gas support services exposures as nonperforming.</p><p>From this chart, you can see that business momentum accelerated over the course of the year, resulting in a progressive increase and year-on-year growth of total income and profit before allowances. A large part of the year's income and operating earnings growth occurred in the second half. At the same time, the growth in income and operating earnings was due fully to net interest income and fee income.</p><p>Other noninterest income was lower for each of the 4 quarters due to a weaker trading performance. The acceleration in net interest income growth was due to both net interest margin and loans. Net interest margin in the first half was lower than a-year-ago period but stabilized in the third quarter and rose in the fourth.</p><p>Loan growth had a slow start in the first quarter and progressively accelerated in the subsequent quarters. Fee income growth was also faster in the second half as both business momentum and buoyant market sentiment boosted a range of fee income activities.</p><p>Fourth quarter net interest income crossed $2 billion for the first time, rising 6% from the previous quarter and 15% from a year ago to $2.1 billion. Contributing to the strong growth was a higher net interest margin, which rose 5 basis points from the previous quarter to 1.78% as Singapore-dollar and Hong Kong-dollar loans were repriced. Net interest margin was also higher than a-year-ago period by 7 basis points in contrast to the first few quarters of 2017, where net interest margin was lower year-on-year. For the full year, net interest income was 7% higher at $7.79 billion, with most of the increase occurring in the second half.</p><p>We had underlying loan growth of $9 billion or 3% in the fourth quarter. The growth was broad-based across trade, corporate and Singapore housing loans. In addition, we consolidated $2 billion of ANZ loans in Taiwan. Including these loans, overall constant currency loan during the fourth quarter was $11 billion or 4%. For the full year, underlying loan growth was $25 billion or 9%, with the growth accelerating and broadening over the course of the year after a slow first quarter. Including the consolidation of $8 billion of loans from ANZ for the year, overall constant currency growth was $33 billion or 11% for the year.</p><p>Deposits rose 4% during the quarter and 11% from a year ago in constant currency terms to $374 billion. They included $11 billion from the consolidation of ANZ. Other funding rose $5 billion during the quarter to $41 billion from issuances of commercial papers and covered bonds. Our liquidity ratios remain well above regulatory requirements. The liquidity coverage ratio was at 131% where the net stable funding ratio exceeded the requirement of 100%.</p><p>Fourth quarter gross fee income was $734 million, 22% higher than a year ago. The growth was broad-based. Wealth management fees rose by an underlying 30% to $227 million as buoyant market sentiment and franchise growth resulted in higher sales of unit trust and other investment products. Investment banking fees doubled to $66 million from higher equity markets and fixed income activities. Transaction service fees grew 3% to $153 million as a 13% increase in cash management fees were partially offset by a decline in trade finance fees. Compared to the previous quarter's record, gross fee income was 7% lower due to seasonally lower wealth management and loan-related activities. For the full year, gross fee income was 13% higher at $2.99 billion, with the growth led by wealth management, transaction services and investment banking.</p><p>Institutional Banking full year operating performance was stable from a year ago. Total income of $5.28 billion and profit before allowances of $3.52 billion were little changed. Cash management income grew 32% to $1.11 billion as the introduction of new products and solutions using digital channels increased customer mandates across the markets we operate in. The improvement was offset by declines in treasury products and loan-related activities. Asset balances rose 6% or $15 billion to $247 billion as both trade and nontrade loans grew. Cash management deposits were 4% higher at $142 billion.</p><p>Consumer Banking and Wealth Management's full year income rose 9% to a record $4.67 billion. The growth was across all categories and led by 21% increase in investment products to $1.38 billion. Loan and deposit income grew 5% to $2.63 billion from higher housing loan and deposit volumes. Card fees were also higher.</p><p>Wealth Management customer segment income rose 25% to $2.11 billion. Assets under management grew an underlying 13% to $188 billion. Including ANZ, AUM rose 24% to $206 billion, strengthening our position as one of the top wealth management banks in the region. Income from the retail customer segment was stable at $2.56 billion. Our market share in Singapore housing loans crossed 30% during the year, and we continue to have more than 50% of Singapore-dollar savings deposit market share.</p><p>Full year treasury customer income fell 3% to $1.15 billion. A decline in income from corporate and institutional customers was offset by higher income from Wealth Management customers. Income from the Treasury Markets business segment, which reflects structuring, market-making and trading activities, fell 24% to $856 million due to lower contributions from interest rate activities. Total treasury income amounted to $2.01 billion, 13% below a year ago.</p><p>For the fourth quarter, expenses of $1.36 billion were 11% above a year ago and 8% higher than the previous quarter. The increase was due to higher technology costs, higher business-related costs, including marketing and the consolidation of ANZ. For the full year, expense growth was kept at 3% to $5.13 billion as digitalization and cost management initiatives yielded productivity gains. Staff costs and revenue-related costs were higher, in line with income and business volume growth. Technology costs were flat for the full year. The full year cost-to-income ratio was 43%, in line with guidance.</p><p>Hong Kong full year earnings rose 40% to $996 million. Total income increased by 6% to $2.22 billion as net interest income and fee income growth was offset by a decline in other noninterest income. Net interest income rose 9% or $122 million from higher loan and deposit volumes. Loans grew 16% in constant currency terms. Excluding ANZ, loans increased 15% from trade and nontrade corporate loans growth. Deposits increased 19% in constant currency terms. Excluding ANZ, deposits was 12% higher from growth in current and savings accounts. The CASA mix improved from 57% end 2016 to 61%. Net interest margin was stable at 1.74% as the benefit of higher interest rates and an improved customer mix were offset by lower loan-to-deposit ratio.</p><p>Fee income rose 19% or $96 million from broad-based growth, led by Wealth Management, including investment products and bancassurance, cash management and investment banking. Other noninterest income fell by 1/3 or $97 million due to lower treasury customer flows as well as a $45 million property disposal gain recorded in 2016.</p><p>Expenses declined 2% to $945 million. Profit before allowances rose 12% to $1.28 billion. Total allowances of $80 million were 1/4 the previous year's, which had included specific allowances for corporates with RMB derivative exposures. The 2017 allowances also included a write-back on specific provision of $57 billion from the recovery of a major loan exposure. General allowances of $75 million were taken for loan growth.</p><p>Nonperforming assets were little changed from the previous quarter at $6.1 billion. With residual weak oil and gas exposures having been recognized in the previous quarter, new NPA formation fell to $362 million, in line with the ex-oil-and-gas NPA formation over the past several quarters. The NPL ratio was unchanged at 1.7%. Specific allowances for loans for the fourth quarter totaled $206 million or 25 basis points, in line with our through-the-cycle average. The majority of the charges were for existing NPLs, including exposures in India and China.</p><p>Impact of transition to FRS 109 expected credit loss. We wrote back $5 million of general allowances in the fourth quarter, resulting in general allowance reserve of $2.62 billion as at 31st December 2017. The results amounted to the 1% of uncollateralized credit exposures we are required to maintain under MAS Notice 612. With the implementation of [FRS 109] on 1st January, 2018, our expected credit loss, the equivalent of general provisions today, was estimated to be $2.53 billion. This was $95 million lower than the 1% general provisions we had maintained.</p><p>Under MAS Notice 612, if the expected credit loss is below 1%, the difference must be held as regulatory loss allowance reserve in shareholders' funds. As such, the $95 million was transferred to the regulatory loss allowance reserve for 1st of January 2018. Going forward, under FRS 109 , specific provision charges will be the same as before. However, the charge for general provision will depend on charges to the expected credit loss from quarter to quarter. We expect these charges to be lower than the 1% general provision charge we used to take; they are likely to be more volatile.</p><p>Our capital ratios remain strong. The fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.9%, 30 basis points higher than the previous quarter from the accretion of retained earnings. Risk-weighted assets were little changed, as loan growth was offset by declines in off-balance sheet items. Our leverage ratio of 7.6% was more than twice the minimum of 3% envisaged by the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee announced the finalization of Basel III reforms on 7th of December 2017. The finalized reforms pertain to revisions to the standardized approach for calculating credit risk, market risk, credit valuation adjustments and operational risks, constraints on using internal models as well as the introduction of a risk-weighted asset output flow based on the credit standardized approach. These revisions, together with the fundamental review of the trading book, will not be implemented until 1st of January 2022. For DBS, the aggregate impact of the 2022 rule changes as well as the changes to the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk effective 1st January 2019 is fairly benign, increasing RWA by about 5% on a pro forma basis.</p><p>Given the benign impact of the Basel capital rules, the board has determined that ordinary dividends can be sustained at higher levels. The board therefore proposed a final dividend of $0.60 per share, bringing the full year ordinary dividend to $0.93, up 55% from a year ago. Barring unforeseen circumstances, we expect to pay a dividend per share of $1.20 for 2018. Our policy of increasing dividends over the longer term in line with earnings growth remains unchanged.</p><p>The board also proposed paying a special dividend of $0.50 per share together with a final dividend. The special dividend is intended to return the capital buffers that had been built up prior to the finalization of the new capital rules. The special dividend is also intended to mark the 50th anniversary of DBS this coming year. In addition, the board determined that the Scrip Dividend Scheme would not be applied to the full year 2017 final dividend as well as the special dividend.</p><p>In summary, our record full year and quarterly performance was driven by business volume growth, which more than offset the lower net interest margin and weaker trading performance. The results reflected the quality of a broad-based franchise and nimble execution.</p><p>Our pipeline continues to be healthy. Our digitalization efforts are enabling us to capture market share in developed markets, deepen our presence in emerging markets and increase overall productivity. As a result, our structural growth and returns have improved. Asset quality is benign, with NPA formation and specific allowances reverting to more normalized levels. Our liquidity and capital are strong. The significant increase in dividends reflects the quality of our earnings, the strength of our balance sheet and the improved returns we are generating from shareholders.</p><p>Thank you. I'll now hand you over to Piyush.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA, CEO &amp; EXECUTIVE &amp; NON-INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, DBS GROUP HOLDINGS LTD: Okay. Thanks, Sok Hui. As usual, I'll make a few observations, and then we can open it up for Q&amp;A. If I can have the first slide.</p><p>So I'll cover 3 things. I just want to make a couple of comments on 2017 as I look at the whole year in review, then some thoughts on capital and dividends. Obviously, that's the big news in this quarter. And then again some comments on where I see next year and how we're kicking off.</p><p>Slide. All right. So I think it's -- the most important thing to take away, if you look at last year, is our business momentum is very strong. And as you saw in Sok Hui's slide, it really kicked in, in the second half the year. Third quarter was strong; fourth quarter was even stronger. Loan growth, 9% ex ANZ, 11% with ANZ, that's pretty robust; deposit growth, in the same order of magnitude, very robust; 13% growth in fee income for the year, very robust.</p><p>Actually, for me, the fact that we delivered $4.4 billion bottom line after all the accelerated provisions we took for the oil and gas sector in the third quarter says a lot. To be able to deliver record bottom line, actually not even take a down year, after all of the cleanup of the portfolio, just reflects on the strength of the franchise.</p><p>Fourth quarter business momentum was also very good. Again, Sok Hui pointed out the 3% growth in the loan book ex ANZ, very broad-based, coming from all the usual stuff from China, real estate activity, M&amp;A activity, the mortgage book in Singapore. So very, very broadly defined.</p><p>Net interest income was up 15% on the year and for the quarter, but year-on-year. So we made about $100 million, $120 million up from the third quarter on net interest income. Our noninterest income is up 23% if you compare the quarter with the same quarter last year, and that's pretty substantial. And that reflects after a weaker trading performance. Still, the rest of the fee and commission income has been very strong.</p><p>We actually made about $120 million less than the third quarter, but that's to be expected. Our fourth quarter will always the lowest for our noninterest income. And frankly, the fact that we have a $3 billion top line in the fourth quarter, which is normally seasonally our weakest quarter, just says a lot of how strong our underlying momentum was for the quarter.</p><p>Our NIMs for the quarter was good. There's obviously due a large part of net interest income apart from the loan growth. Our quarter -- fourth quarter average is 1.78%. Our exit rate in December was actually 1.80%, 1.81%, so even stronger. Of course, SIBOR and SOR have eased off in January from the December levels. But debt notwithstanding, my anticipation is that the NIMs will continue to increase from where we are.</p><p>So what were the challenges for the year's trading? And trading was the biggest challenge. Our trading overall for the year, just the trading portion of the business, is down 24%. That's in line with the (inaudible). Our -- look at treasury activities between the customer side and the trading side, we're down 13%, and that's just smack midway of the pack. I think JP has reported 17% or 18% down, Goldman reported 13% down. But on the other hand, BAML and Citi are single-digit down, 8% to 10%. So at 13%, we are right in the middle of the pack in terms of the effects you see performance.</p><p>The good news is 2018 just kicked off to a rolling start. So the $350 million of drag we had last year on the back of treasury and trading, first of all, I don't expect another down year. So even if you had a flat year, you won't see a year-on-year delta. But in point of fact, the year has actually kicked off to a great start. So I'm optimistic.</p><p>The other thing which came up, Sok Hui pointed out, expenses in the fourth quarter were higher than you would expect, with about $100 million (technical difficulty) some of that reflects bringing on the Taiwan business from ANZ. Now if you look at the ANZ business, the overall cost-income ratio of the business is about -- when ANZ had it, the cost-income ratio of the business was close to 90%. That's why -- one of the reasons they were selling it. We think we can bring it on to our books at 55%, 60%, now that's substantially higher than the rest of our business. But even within that 55%, 60%, Singapore and Hong Kong are very low because we bring the business on with pretty much no marginal cost. We just added to our platform. But Taiwan and Indonesia are quite high. Taiwan cost-income ratio is over 80%, and Indonesia cost-income ratio is in the 60s. So as Taiwan and Indonesia come in, they actually are a drag on our overall cost-income ratio. The expenses come in higher. They're still being profitable. And they're still returns-accretive, but from a cost-income ratio prism, the cost related to the book of business we're integrating now is a high cost. So that is a part of the fourth quarter expense.</p><p>And then we also spent some money in marketing. So you'll see from my next slide, our shares are up. So we pumped some money in marketing. We have a rebranding effort going on, and we spent some money on tech. We actually did some of the tech cloud transformation projects into the fourth quarter. So there are some onetimers around that. But at the full year, we're at 43%. So it's nothing to really be overly concerned about.</p><p>But just going back to the business momentum slowly for a second. Slide. If you look at the slide, they're just quite a robust story. On mortgages, our market share is now close to 31% for Singapore, 30.8%. We had a 2.1% market share increase. Now some of that, about 1.2%, came from ANZ, but almost 1% of the increase came from organic businesses, right. So 31%, we haven't seen a 30%-plus market share in Singapore for -- ever. Very strong.</p><p>If you look at cards, cards ENR share is up from 20% to 25%, so 1/4 of the market now. Some chunk of that came from ANZ, about 3%, 3.5%. But ex ANZ, our share went up by 1.5 percentage points. And so that's quite substantial. Share of billings went up by 2% from 18% and change to 20% and change. About half of that is ANZ, about 1 percentage in the thing, but 1% of that is organic growth.</p><p>If you look at Wealth, our AUMs grew 24%, 25%. I saw the UBS announcement last week. It's in line with UBS, about the same. But if you look at our income growth, we grew 25% on income, and that's far stronger than anybody else's income growth reported so far. And our net new money for the year is very strong. We grew net new money at 60% for the year. This is ex ANZ. If we add GP, ANZ's new money, then it's like 140%, 150%, but 60% is ex ANZ.</p><p>SME was strong it turned out SME, we had 11% growth in the SME book. Cash management was strong. We have 29% growth for the year. And actually, if we look at the last 4, 5 years, we're running at 26% CAGR on cash management, which is very robust. And trade, the book turned around. So asset book is up 24%, constant currency, by almost $9 billion, $10 billion for the year. So cash, trade, mortgages, consumer, card, lending, SME, just very broad-based, robust business momentum. And a lot of it you started seeing through the back end of the year.</p><p>Slide. The other thing which -- I just thought I'd leave this slide -- we've obviously covered this just a couple of months ago in our Investor Day, but it is worth reemphasizing that we're seeing the digital impact come through in our numbers. We will actually update our digital value capture number in our annual reports. We won't give them time for now, but in the annual report, we will do an updated set. But we're tending to see market share gains. I mean, you don't get market share gains of this sort we're talking about. In -- it is the cards and mortgage, which are fairly commodity businesses, easily. So a large part of that is driven by the digitization of the business in Singapore and Hong Kong. We're seeing that.</p><p>We continue to see very good traction with Digibank and the SME distribution growth in India and Indonesia. We're just a tad short of 2 million customers in India now, as of last week. And in Indonesia, we ended the year at about 70,000-odd full savings account customers. So momentum is good.</p><p>On the back-end architecture, by the end of the year, 2/3 of our applications are now cloud-ready. By the end of this year, 2018, 90% will be cloud-ready. A chunk of that will be on a private cloud, but by the end of this year, a large part of our computation part will actually have started moving to the public cloud.</p><p>We launched the world's biggest banking API platform in November. We now have about 180 different open APIs. We have 60 API partnerships. So the ecosystem strategy is beginning to kick in quite nicely. And then obviously, the digital value capture, like I said, that's working too and we'll give you an update on that in our annual report. So that is the second big thing to me about 2017, the digitalization. It's still a watershed year. It's a seminal year in some ways in our transformation journey.</p><p>The third big thing to me about (technical difficulty) is that we cleaned up the portfolio around the offshore money. And by now, the portfolio has been relatively okay. The offshore marine thing was a overhang to the problem. So in the third quarter, we cleaned it up. Having cleaned it up, our new NPA formation for the fourth quarter actually gone back to normal levels. Our SPs, we're a tad on the high side because we recognized provisions for some old NPLs in China and India. Again, we're just trying to clean up the book as much as we can. So net-net, actually, the portfolio quality is actually looking very good from where we are.</p><p>Slide. So next is quick comment on capital and dividends. Sok Hui covered some of this slide, but she talked about this. The older Basel rule impact finalization. I earlier anticipated that we might have an impact of maybe up to 10% on RWA. As things happened and the way the rules had come out, our impact's only 5%. And this is obviously much lower than the European banks. I saw a report on SocGen yesterday saying the impact was 35%. My estimate was most European banks would see an impact of in the region of 30% to 50% on RWA. But the nature of the rules is we see some impact of about -- a little lift from the standardized listing of CCR, the counterparty credit listing. And we'll see some impact from the fundamental review of the trading book.</p><p>Though the 2 areas, we see some impact, the standardized flows have no impact on us at all. And so the 5% impact was even lower than I had anticipated. So we retained 14.3% as our core CET, end of the year. But if you will adjust for the full transition and you go full phase-in, the 13.9% is the starting-off base to look at. I've guided before that we're comfortable at around the 13% range. It could be plus, minus 0.5%, but we're comfortable at about a 13% range. And so that means that we have surplus capital. Now this is something I had said before. I do believe there's surplus capital. And as soon as we get clarity on the Basel reforms, we'll be in a position to start being more efficient with the capital usage.</p><p>So we were be able to do that, and we were sort of primed for it. Our board took stock of that. And we did these 3 things. One, we bumped up the annualized dividend to $1.20 per share. And that gives you about payout, it's north of 50%. I think it's 54%, 53%, 54% right now. And we're not committed to a payout ratio. But that's a good starting base when you get to that kind of level.</p><p>On top of that, we decided do a onetime, $0.50 dividend. And it's really to do a onetime return of the surpluses that we built up preparatory to the Basel reforms kicking in. So we did that as well. And then we decided to terminate the scrip dividend. Now as you know, we never give discount on scrip dividend for several years. So it was not dilutive in the sense, but nevertheless, we kept issuing more capital every year, effectively. So we decided to stop that. We don't need that either.</p><p>So the sum impact of all of this is that if you look at our dividend yield as of on pro forma estimates, it's about 4.5%, 4.5. So we've got back to being a fairly high yield stock at this point in time. We're not changing our dividend policy. Our policy has always been where it sits with the increasing dividend over the longer term, in line with earnings growth. And so we continue to maintain the stance. So we don't have a specific payout ratio in mind, but we will continue to be steady and stable in terms of how we think about dividends in line with the earnings growth.</p><p>Slide, all right. So a quick comment on 2018. Next slide. So again, to start with, despite the volatility in the market and the turbulence, the fundamentals of a global macro economy are very, very robust. And we all know that. The U.S. economy is strong, probably circa 3% GDP growth rate. Europe is strong, still continuous to be stable. Japan is outperforming. China is strong and steady. The rest of the region is looking good. India will see a little notch up. So I'm quite optimistic about the global macroeconomic environment. And on the back of that, we're retaining some of the guidance. We've given loan guidance at 78% in the past. We think we should be able to do that.</p><p>There are a couple of payments on the loan side. One is as the renminbi is strengthening one more time, is we opened up some offshore, onshore arbitrage, so the opportunities to do some more financing at that side. Also, the Chinese outbound investment has continued to be fairly robust. So obviously, we were in the middle of that deal flow. So that's helpful. The other thing is that Singapore mortgage book continues to be robust with all the en bloc and all of the residential things happening. We didn't see a lot of the impact of that in 2017, but in 2018, we do expect to see people coming back and for different kinds of refinancing. People were moving out of homes and moving into new homes and so on. So I'd be relatively confident about the loan guidance.</p><p>On NIM, no question. We expect to see higher NIM. It's kind of hard to give you a color on what the NIM might be. Like I said, exit rate in December was already at 1.80%, 1.81%. On the negative side, 2 things. One, that LIBOR has already run ahead of the Fed actions. So even if you wind up with 2, 3 Fed hikes, LIBOR has already ahead. So I don't think you'd see all of that flow through to LIBOR. The second is that we see the Sing dollar strengthening. And so as the Sing dollar is strengthening and the EMEA does not enter the soft market, then the pass through rate into the cyber tends to be somewhat muted. So those are negatives. The positives are that, I think, we've already guided for maybe a couple of rate hikes just given the strength of the U.S. economy. People are not talking about 3 to 4 rate hikes. So we might actually get a rate hike more than we'd anticipated. We report all of that together. I think it's safe to assume that last year, our blended NIM was 1.75%. I don't see why we won't get at least 10 basis points better than that. But it's very hard to call because there's a lot of moving parts in that NIM story.</p><p>On income, I expect to get low double-digit growth, for sure, and that includes ANZ. So we'll get the full year impact of ANZ and I told you before that's worth about $600-odd million at least in the top line. So that will kick in for this year. But the rest of the business momentum and the NIM increase will kick in as well. So we should be able to get at least low double-digit.</p><p>Cost-income ratio, actually, if I exclude the ANZ add-on, our cost-income ratio will come up by 0.5%, which is what we're guiding consistently. But because of that higher Taiwan, Indonesia business that comes on, and we're not -- and we won't go to Taiwan's expense, synergies for that upfront. So we'll be able to get a cost-income ratio, which will still be stable at 43% post the ANZ -- including the ANZ integration.</p><p>And finally, on allowances, our SP should be on the lower side of the cycle average. Cycle average is 25, 27, but I don't anticipate even getting to the cycle average. The rest of the environment is actually fairly benign. And then the expected credit loss, GP, as Sok Hui described, leads to percent, 1%. The way it works out now, any new loans we put in our book, what's called phase 1 GP, it only comes in at under 20 basis points, 18 to 20 basis points. The rest of the ECL comes from stage 2, so migration or deterioration in the portfolio through the year. Again, that's tough to call. On the stock that we have, ECL is close to 1% GP. But if you look at forecast on this, we've cleaned up our bulk, we don't have too much weakness in the portfolio. I don't anticipate a lot of downward migration in the portfolio given the overall macroeconomic environment. So my sense is you won't get anywhere near the 1% that we used to have on GP as well, but like Sok Hui said, this number depends on migration and stage 2. So it could move up and down a bit.</p><p>But bottom line when you put all of that together, we're actually quite optimistic about 2018. So top line looks good. Costs are under control. The credit environment looks fairly steady. The full impact of ANZ is kicking in. Interest rates should be robust, and all our fee income businesses are doing very well. So we're fairly confident about 2018.</p><p>Okay. Sok Hui point out 35% RWA, it was not SocGen it was ABN Amro.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. We'll be happy to take questions now. Could I request that you speak into the mic in front of you because we have a webcast going on so it just picks up the voice. Our first question is Krish.</p><p>KRISHNA GUHA, ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions from me, if I may. You've addressed the issue with what the ANZ loan book has done in terms of a cost income sense. So what about the actual credit quality of the ANZ portfolio? Now that's on your books, how does that compare to the rest of the business? Second question. No doubt you watched the Danamon transaction finally go through to MUFG. I just wondered how that feels after spending 1.5 years there. But more to the point, given how DBS' strategy has moved towards the digital and away from bricks and mortars since. Is it actually good for DBS that, that deal never happened?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Let me take the second question first. I said it several times in the last 5 years. God smiles in strange ways, and that's the bullet I'm glad we missed. If you remember, we -- when we went in and made a bid for Danamon, the rupee was trading at INR 9,000. The rupee now trades at INR 13,000. I would have taken a 40%, 50% hit on goodwill just on the currency, forget everything else. And then after that, the regulations changed: they put pricing caps, they put rate caps and so on. So yes, we are not unhappy that the deal didn't come through. But the more broader question to that, if I think this whole digital transformation which that's in there is so important, to find any bank and certainly to us that anything that would distract us from pursuing that agenda at scale, I don't think it's a good idea in the short, medium term. Even the ANZ acquisition, and we spent a long time thinking about it. Now it's a very attractive deal in financial terms, but we spent a long time thinking about it only because of how much it might distract us from the (inaudible) journey we were undertaking. We decided to do it because we thought we could handle it without putting us too far behind our agenda. As I look back, we're at least a couple of quarters behind where I would like to be, because ANZ took a lot out of the company. So I still think on balance it was a worthwhile tradeoff, but we try to do a large deal at scale, it would set us back a couple of years, and I don't think that's worth it. So I think that the window for transformation is short and with all of big tech and everybody else participating in the space, it should not be able to make the change in this period of time. You will suffer a lot more. So I think we're better off getting this done, and then you can worry about other expansion strategies in the future. The ANZ book portfolio is actually quite good. The quality of that portfolio and book is very similar to us. And since we brought it on it's not resulting in any material changes in our delinquency or in the profile of our business. They had a book of business when we acquired it, we also brought on the reserves related to the book they had. The reserves are more than adequate for any losses that we anticipate, so not expecting anything from there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Is there a second question? Jamie?</p><p>JAMIE LEE: Jamie from Business Times. You talked about how banks are kind of exiting the OMG market and there are some funds there, perhaps looking to buy some distressed loans. I mean, how do see that market? And what's DBS's position on this right now?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So let me recap what I said before. I think there are 2 parts of the sector in Singapore. One part of the sector is the part that supports deep sea development activity. I think that deep sea development activity is going to be structurally challenged for a period of time. And even though oil prices have picked up by $65, $70, I read a report that somebody might want to start looking at Brazil exploration. But when I talked to our O&amp;D producer clients, nobody has appetite to take on serious development projects at this price level. I think you have to see oil sustainably higher before people go back into North Sea, Brazil and off the Africa coast. I don't see that happening. So to my mind, that part of the industry is actually structurally embedded. And I don't think there's going to be a lot of upside in that part of the industry in the short, medium term. I think also -- I'm not smarter than anybody else, but all of the issues around peak oil and shale, so what stage electric cars is at, and peak oil, and what stage the shale come in, it's also uncertain. But net amount senses, I don't see oil going up to $80 and beyond sustainably. So I don't think deep sea will come back in my view. The rest of the industry in Singapore supports the rest of the stuff. The [channel] sea, the boats and barges, the maintenance activity of the drilling and so on, I think there's still in a cyclical downturn. So I think that part will be restructured. It will survive and come back. But the cyclical downturn is protected, and it's protected because even though oil prices have gone up, we've seen some pick-up in the charting activity. You're still not seeing the material shift change in the margins. And the reason for that is all the oil majors are just pricing to a $50 oil price. So they're still not going back and revisiting the margins of the supply change. Admittedly some pick-up, but it's not that material yet. I think it will take at least another year or so before margin pick-up comes back and the people in that part of the industry can generate enough cash flow to start servicing debt and can spin it in a sustained way. So if you look at all of the restructuring that is happening, and (inaudible) announced yesterday and [indiscernible] did this before. Marco Polo did this. Everybody is trying to minimize the cash outflow to service debt and the principal and interest and extend it out so that they get time to build cash flow margins and improvement and they can start servicing that debt. That's the nature of the restructuring that is going on. We're very active in that restructuring. On the one hand, we're conservative. We recognize all the possibility of provision. So we're not banking on that, but at the same time, we're not exiting that space. Some of these are good companies. They're clients of ours. And we're actively participating in helping these plans restructure so that they can survive and be able to participate in the industry going forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) [how do you loan the] market share cost 30%. Is it mainly from the refinancing? Or is this from new launches?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: It's actually broad-based, but a lot of it is from refinancing. We have been active in the refinancing space as well. So we also have a lot of refinancing out but refinancing in, too. And from building and the construction as well. We're not seeing the impact of the en bloc phase and the refinancing from there this year, but it will host the building under construction coming. And new bookings have been strong. Our new bookings for the quarter were over $2 billion again. Our overall new bookings for the year have been quite strong. So frankly some of that will inform our portfolio for next year as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: New bookings in terms of refinancing (inaudible)</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Everything, the new loans booked, which are not...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: More than $2 billion compared to...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: For the fourth quarter or for...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Fourth quarter. And also, can I ask for your views on the blockchain. How do you think it's going to impact the banks? And how is DBS looking into the blockchain areas? And what's your view on cryptocurrency?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Can we take some more questions related to the results? I think that's a philosophical view and I'll come back. I'll answer your question. We have views on all of this but that's obvious.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Goola?</p><p>GOOLA WARDEN: Yes. Can I just ask about the dividend payout ratio? You said that for next year, sorry, for this year, you're going to payout $1.20, about $3.1 billion [of earnings]. So that's going to be around a 54% payout (inaudible)</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: $3.1 billion is a lot of money.</p><p>GOOLA WARDEN: Yes, but it's a 54% payout of your, of this year's earnings.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Yes, that's correct. I pulled it out. Our new booking volume for the year was 12 -- over $12 billion, 21% up from 2016 to 2017. So...</p><p>GOOLA WARDEN: $12 billion?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So $12.4 billion mortgage.</p><p>GOOLA WARDEN: Just one more question about the private banking in the U.S. You've got the total AUM at $206 billion. Could you give us an idea of sort of the range of the private banking AUM [indiscernible]?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: I think all of them but as wealthy because we generate the same business and money from all of them. But if you look at what I call the high net worth, so people more than $1.5 billion, which is comparable to some of the private banks, that's $145 billion.</p><p>GOOLA WARDEN: Sing or U.S.?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Sing.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Sing dollars.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, Sing dollars. Are there any more questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Do you expect the clients in nonbearing loan ratios in 2018 -- is it correct to say this is peak?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: I'm not sure we'll get decline in the ratio. The ratio is still pretty stable. For decline in the ratio, I'll say, denominator will go up. So we might see something from that, but the numerator, I don't think we'll see a lot of recoveries or (inaudible)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can you give some color on the collateral value in offshoring? Do you think there has been stabilization?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So the number of funds actually are limited. So like I told you, in the margins that activity rate has gone up. Charter has gone up. There's some pick-up in this but the number of transactions is limited. They were very small tucks and bolts, $1 billion to $3 billion level of tucks and bolts, and that level, the prices stay roughly where they were in the previous quarter. So the prices didn't move. But just small bolts. So it's hard to see what happens. In fact, last time when we took a third quarter cleanup, we were very conservative in our collateral evaluation. So we don't expect collateral values to fall below that. Since then, oil prices have gone up and rates have gone up. So if anything, it should get firm but we don't also go back and check collateral values every other month. So I'm just telling you anecdotally from the transaction we saw in the market.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [indiscernible]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I have 2 questions. The first one is on the NIM. I think you said it's very hard to call the many moving parts this year on where you expect it to be but you also expected to grow low double-digits. Did I hear that correctly?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: The low double-digit was our total income.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So the NIM, where do you expect it to be? And what are these moving parts? And the second question maybe, you can deal with that first, is on the oil and gas. So what we've been hearing is local banks have shrunk the overall oil and gas lending to the industry. Have you dismantled the oil and gas unit actually?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Absolutely not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: That's the top that (inaudible)</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Definitely not. We just saw the papers today. [We should have] restructured [EZEON] right, and there's huge bunch the exposure to EZEON with this restructure. Everyone has a restructuring in this industry in active parts, spend all their money on the restructuring, so we couldn't have disbanded the unit [by a long chalk]. We have 100 clients plus in Singapore. We still have 100 clients plus in Singapore in the industry. On your other -- this thing on NIM, so the many moving parts (inaudible) so firstly, how many fed rate hikes are there? First moving part. I don't know. The -- if you look at the analysts and the economists, they're talking 3 to 4. If you look at the futures market, it's still pricing 2 to 3, 2.5, if you will. So it's still unclear how many rates -- does the selloff this last 3, 4 days have an impact on Fed decisions? We've had a new Fed Chairman. What is their view? So hard to call. It could be anywhere between 2 and 4 rate hikes. That's a big difference. I can't tell you what the right answer to that is. Second, even if we have Fed rate hikes, how much of that has already been factored into LIBOR and how much will pass through the LIBOR. The LIBOR is really outrun some of the Fed rate hikes already. So it's started actually, how much would flow through the LIBOR. I think part of that is a function of people expectation for what 2019 rate hikes will be, and then people expect rate hikes will hit 3 and stabilize. Then we won't see more impact in LIBOR but people expect further rate hikes in 2019 then LIBOR will continue to reflect that. Then the third is how much of that then trades down into Sing dollars. I explained before Sing dollar trade down is a function basically of exchange rate. If the Sing dollar is weakening, then there is no reason for monetary policy activity from MAS and you get almost a 90% pass-through from the Fed rate hike into the Sing dollar. But if the Sing dollar is strengthening, there is a function of how does MAS choose to intervene. If MAS choose to intervene to the soft market, then that results in one thing and if they choose to intervene into the money market, then that results in a different outcome. But net-net, if the Sing dollar strengthening, then you only get about 40% flow-through to Sing dollar, so kind of hard to call what is the view in the U.S. dollar. They're going to strengthen further? They're going to weaken? So that's the third moving part. So when you add all of these things together, how many Fed rate hikes, how much pass-through, and what is the activities into MAS and this thing. It becomes tough to say -- land on a number for what NIM might be. But like I said, the average 1 75 last year. So with all of these should be able to get at least 10 basis points around that better than that. So if I can make a guess, I would say that but it's hard to be accurate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Asheefa.</p><p>ASHEEFA SARANGI, RESEARCH ANALYST, CLSA LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'd like -- I have 3 questions. Just firstly, what's been the private banking AUM from the ANZ acquisition up to now? Secondly, if you could give more information on the net new money for all the private banking business this year in 2017 actually. And sir, what's been the impact of digitalization on your private banking business in particular, especially on the hiring front.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So the first question was the...</p><p>ASHEEFA SARANGI: AUM from the ANZ.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: AUM from ANZ?</p><p>ASHEEFA SARANGI: Yes.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: ANZ.</p><p>ASHEEFA SARANGI: Private banking.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So the high net worth portion of it is about 6 -- [Tan Shan] you want to answer it? -- 4, the high net worth portion of it is $4 billion, but the total -- that's out of the $145 billion, right. But if you take the $206 billion, then that's about -- I think it's about 17 -- do we have that number?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: [$18.7] billion</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: $18 billion. So about $18 billion out of the $206 billion and $4 billion out of the $145 billion is ANZ. Then the second question was...</p><p>ASHEEFA SARANGI: The net new money for the private banking.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So net new money is a 16% growth and they're broad based. Again, maybe [Tan Shan] will give you some more color, but we've got money from the regions we continue to do. We've got lot of money from North Asia, which is China, (inaudible) but we've also got lot new money from Europe and international businesses as well. So Tan Shan more color.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So (inaudible) fourth quarter at least (inaudible) are in decline actually for existing DBS private banking in China. There was quite a lot of organic [modification] last year. We don't know [indiscernible accurate number. We've given you the (inaudible) so hopefully that will suffice.</p><p>ASHEEFA SARANGI: Okay. One more thing. International business, especially in the Middle East? What can you [indiscernible].</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Well, we don't again disclose specific numbers from the Middle East, though our Middle East business activity we've broadened. So we're now covering Africa, which we didn't do. And we're covering some of the other regional countries in the Middle East and there's a lot more interest. So we're beginning to pick up a lot more flow from Middle East and Southern Europe coming to us. But we're also very careful about the money from, for example, we have a lot of Russian (inaudible) Serbian money which we'd like to come in. And we're just turn it away. So we're also quite disciplined about what we actually let come in.</p><p>ASHEEFA SARANGI: Yes, okay. And...</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Digitalization? The digitalization impact will be massive. So at both ends, our (inaudible) was that at the lower end we see a lot of impact from digitalization because we do online acquisition, which is 2. We're now getting 1 and 3 in part due [indiscernible] clients acquired digitally, but also a lot of self services, the clients would really be able to do bunch of activities online. And the other thing, we started seeing that not only in the mass [action] but also upmarket. So even in the private client space and so on, people got very active. Sok Hui, you want to give some more color?</p><p>SOK HUI LIM: So we have 2. One is the self service (inaudible) we are seeing a big jump now in clients doing their operating online on their mobile phones and looking online (inaudible) for example. They're also doing advertising online. So that's (inaudible) direct (inaudible) model, that should benefit us in time. So for example, today, in our (inaudible) customer. In the past, they would have to get the items on 4 different (inaudible). Today, it's is all put into their ipad. They go and see the clients, the portfolio agenda is sent. The portfolio update done, the AI helps the client and to tell the (inaudible), hey are there adjustments you need to make on the portfolio. These are what we're suggesting you do and here are the call for action. And then internally, we've rewired our internal business as well. So in the past, for example, with investment counsel and (inaudible) product. They would have to call the (inaudible) call 10, 12 different service providers. Today, it's all automated. Literally, within seconds, you can get 10 to 12 different service providers, give out their pricing. We look for the best price. We hit the trade, it's done. So all these tests automated and created approximately both gain from our productivity and also from the stickiness in the customer.</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Anecdotally, (inaudible) reveal the numbers. Our RM productivity is -- has [to top this side] in the market. Our actual productivity bar is very, very high relatively. So one of the big upside we have we saw that with Soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 G\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rale and we've seen that with ANZ that when we bring on a book and RMs, the productivity of those RMs is about half of productivity of [RRs]. And therefore, the easiest opportunity we saw (inaudible) in ANZ is to double that RM productivity. And we doubled that by giving them a broader product base to sell and putting it all the automated tools in the (inaudible) and that gives us immediate lift when we do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Jamie, did you have question? We'll give you the last.</p><p>JAMIE LEE: Can I just please another 2 questions, just a follow-up on that. Citibank says that the private banking business for them, they say that the recent market on cost-to-income ratio are about 58%. Are you lower than that?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: Yes, we are lower than that.</p><p>JAMIE LEE: Second is there's been lot of talk about climate change and there's been a lot of reports about guys -- the Federal banks funding a lot of coal plants, particularly in Vietnam and Indonesia. What is your policy in terms of funding these plants? And are there things that you're doing to change the way which you put up lending for emerging markets?</p><p>PIYUSH GUPTA: So we've actually spent a lot of time this year in 2017 revamping our sustainability agenda, especially what we call our responsible financing policy. We actually brought on a full-time officer to help us recall the policies, and appointed a full Chief Sustainability Officer as well. And so for each one of the sectors which are more environmentally vulnerable, mining is one, plantation is one, coal is one, et cetera, we've developed fairly robust policies for what we will do and what we won't do. In developing the policy, we benchmarked all the global best practices, what banks around the world are doing. So we benchmarked that and come up with a policy which is fairly consistent with global guidelines. In respect of coal, let me first start with one caveat. Remember that the bulk of energy needs in our part of the world are coal. And whether it's Indonesia or India or China or Vietnam, that's not changing between now and 2030 or 2040. Every world bank, any global report tells you that 40% plus of energy needs of the total population will still be coal driven. No matter how far these countries start converting to renewable and alternative forms of energy. And therefore, it is important to understand that you can't turn this off and turn this off overnight and you deprive</p><p>40% of people in a small town and villages in Indonesia the ability to get electricity and light. That's not necessarily a good outcome for either society or the environment. So you've got to be thoughtful about how you transition. And so it's very -- the key is how do you manage the transition arrangements in a sensible kind of way. The policy with coal that we set up, for example, is that in any developed market, where it's easy to move alternative today, we won't do anymore the same. So we put a complete stop to that. In developing markets, we certainly go to what I call -- I've been advising people not to use the term, but effectively, the dirty coal and the slightly better qualities of coal. So (inaudible) so we stopped doing the low end stuff. And in line with many of the global plans, we'll only do the better quality stuff from the end of this year. Why the end of this year? We have a couple of clients that we committed to and our style is not to pull out on clients. So we'll finish that and then we'll stop doing any of that stuff after the end of this year. And then third, we're actually starting to build a renewable portfolio. So we're consciously and actively working with our clients to do wind, to do solar, to do a whole bunch of renewables financing to shift the portfolio mix of what we have in that business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay. I'm afraid we are running out of time. So maybe we'll take some of this offline. So thank you guys for coming. We'll talk to you later. Thank you.

So good morning to everybody, and good afternoon to those who are joining from overseas.</p><p>And we're going to split this into 2 sessions or 2 parts: first one, looking at 2018 and results for that year, which I'll do now. And then I'll hand over to Bill, who will pick up on the strategy for the next 3 years.</p><p>So with that, we'll eventually get to some numbers. So just a key sort of summary, and I've got more detail on several of the line items here.</p><p>So to go through this at a high level. Overall income for the year up 5%. Costs increased 2%, so slightly lower costs in the second half than the first half and [opening up] JAWS. The credit impairment charge is a little bit higher in the fourth quarter but only a little bit and overall nearly halved on previous year. And you will recall the previous year nearly halved on the year before that, so continuing very strong progress on the impairment side. Other impairment includes some charges relating to the ship leasing business, which is part of the strategy update we have today and that we will be withdrawing from over time. And you put all of that together and the underlying profit is $3.9 billion, 28% increased year-on-year.</p><p>Below the line. Provision for regulatory matters, $900 million, which we announced last week. We have got to a point where making a provision for that is now the appropriate thing. So not fully resolved, but that is best estimate at this point in time. And then restructuring, $0.4 billion, about half of that is the final stages of the 2015 strategy. And the other half are some costs to do with the refresh of the strategy going forwards. And hence statutory profit up 6% notwithstanding the big charge on the regulatory side.</p><p>Below the P&amp;L, I think a really important line here, risk-weighted assets were actually 8% lower in the year. So we actually generated 5% more income off 8% less risk-weighted assets, which clearly is really important as we move forwards particularly in terms of required capital levels, which we'll come back to. Underlying earnings per share at $0.61, up significantly year-on-year; and hence the proposed dividend nearly double that with the previous year, albeit a year which didn't have an interim dividend in it.</p><p>So CET1 ratio at 14.2%. That would have been 14.5% but for the regulatory provision. So capital level still very strong. And all of that pulls together in terms of return on equity at 4.6%; or on a tangible basis, which we'll use moving forwards, at 5.1%. So bear in mind that was negative 3 years ago. Clearly, we need to get that up to double digit, which is a lot what we're going to talk about later.</p><p>So those are the key elements of the numbers.</p><p>This chart is just a quick reminder on the journey that we have come on income, going back to 2015. So in 2015, we had $15.4 billion of income. We then, as you will recall, went through a period of derisking and exiting, and that took essentially rebased income down to just below $14 billion. And over the last 2 years, we have built that up to the $15 billion level, with an underlying growth of $0.4 billion in the 2017 year and then the $0.7 billion in the 2018 year, so momentum picking up as we have gone through.</p><p>If I look then at the 2018 income relative to the 2017 income. That is an increase, as shown on the previous chart, of $0.7 billion. And you can see from here that, that was pretty broad based. We had the Corporate Finance income slightly down, but otherwise we had income go up across all of the product areas, with in particular Transaction Banking, albeit within Transaction Banking, Cash Management which grew over 20%, leading the way, but most of the other areas there, product areas, grew by between 3% and 7%, as you can see from that chart. So pretty broad-ranging base for the income growth.</p><p>This chart is then looking at Q4 compared with Q4 for the previous year. So at a headline level, 3% improvement, albeit if we had done it on a constant FX basis it would have been a 6% increase. So the FX conversion [in stores] has worked slightly against us. General theme, I think, similar, albeit Wealth Management on this chart is on the right-hand side. So that, as I think you'll recall, Wealth Management was very buoyant at the early part of last year and hence the Q4-on-Q4 comparisons slightly weaker on the Wealth Management side. And we've observed, as we go into 2019, we've made a solid start, but because of FX and because Wealth Management and FM were so buoyant a year ago, then the Q1 will likely be a little bit lower than it was last year. But overall 3% increase there or reported 6% on a constant currency basis.</p><p>Looking then very high level at how this comprises when looked at across the client segments.</p><p>Top left, the CIB, the corporate business, a very strong year, 6% growth on the top line, but I think more importantly we have seen the profitability increase very significantly. And the return on tangible equity has gone up from the mid 4s to the mid 7s during the period. So as we seek to get the overall returns up to the 7% level, clearly, having our biggest client segment make such a big step forward during the period is really encouraging. And we need to keep that momentum, clearly, going forwards.</p><p>On the top right. The Retail Bank is again a reasonable level of income growth but particularly strong on profit. So 18% increase in profitability. And the return on tangible equity is already at levels exceeding the 10% overall group target. So 11.8% on the Retail Bank.</p><p>Commercial Bank grew on the top line, went slightly backwards on the profit line. The year before had quite low loan impairment charges. And those have come slightly higher in 2018, so overall that has held it back on profitability. And then Private Bank, where we are continuing to rebuild that business as we have invested more in new relationship managers and systems, that has held it back to sort of breakeven, but overall momentum top line about 3% during the period.</p><p>So looking at that then from a geographic perspective instead.</p><p>The big region of GCNA, a very, very strong year; double-digit growth on the top line. And that was very wide ranging across the various markets in the region. And the profit before tax, up 22%, so a big, big profit improvement in that region. The ASA region also, particularly on the profit front, has moved forwards considerably, strong performance in Singapore particularly noteworthy. Profit before tax in the ASA region, up 97%.</p><p>The region that has been more challenged has been the AME region. Partly local economic conditions, partly foreign exchange and conversion, so overall there a slight reduction in top -- the bottom line. And then Europe and Americas, the sort of powerhouse in origination or the commercial business globally, that has seen its profit over double during the period.</p><p>So changing tack then and moving on to costs, which we've got quite a lot of focus during the course of last year. We said that we would aim to get the second half costs in line with the first half, and that is what's happened actually. With a little bit of FX benefit, we have come in slightly lower in the second half, which is the first time that has happened for a while. So I think we do have good control over the costs.</p><p>Just to look at this a little bit back in perspective. In 2015, our costs, these were all excluding bank levy, were $10.0 billion. And in the intervening period, we have absorbed reasonably considerable inflation, high regulatory costs and the amortization of the increased IT investment spend, but notwithstanding that, through the cost take-out, we said we'd take out $2.9 billion over 4 years. We took out $3.2 billion. That has resulted, over the 3-year period, in the costs being pretty much flat but whilst reinvesting, which I'm going to come on to immediately a lot more, into improving the IT architecture of the overall business. So good, positive JAWS enabled by that.</p><p>Investment front. Really key part of what we thought about in 2015 and acceptance then. We were not investing enough in the fabric of the business in IT terms. So in the 2015 and prior period, we had typically been investing below $1 billion a year. We have on the average boosted that by around half. Last year, it was actually $1.6 billion, but I think more noteworthy is the proportion of that, that is actually on things that are tangibly improving the businesses. So in the green over there you can see that, back in 2015, about $0.3 billion was on things that were improving the business rather than sort of regulatory projects. That $0.3 billion has now moved to $0.9 billion, so we have tripled that over that period of time.</p><p>The evidence of that now having a real impact in the business, I think, is strong, and we've picked out 1 or 2 data points on the right-hand side just to show that. So on the Retail Banking side, the online adoption, proportion of customers online has gone from about 1/3 to half of the business over that period of time. The CIB business, the time to onboard a new client has come down from a pretty frightening 41 days to 5 days, so huge, huge improvement there. Straight2Bank customers in the Commercial Bank, proportion of those has gone up from 38% to 58%. And the private bank; and productivity per head [out], which is another area of big focus, now nicely picking up year by year. And a lot of those very much enabled by improved systems and the investment that we have been making there.</p><p>Turning then to loan impairment. As I said earlier, loan impairment is pretty much halved last year and they've halved the year before. And in fact, they halved also the year before that, albeit off a pretty high base. So what was about $5 billion loan impairment in the 2015 year, we are now down to $0.7 billion. The proportion -- on the bottom left, the proportion of -- or the value of nonperforming loans in the total book over that period of time has halved or thereabouts. And I think the other encouraging thing here is that quite a number of the sort of indicators of the quality of the overall book are also on a continuing improving trend, in particular the early alerts which are down about 45% year-on-year. A higher proportion of the book is now corporate-grade lending, and our cover ratios are very comfortably ahead of our recovery experience. So I think overall good progress there.</p><p>The liquidation portfolio we identified in 2015 is now sufficiently small, but we'll just wrap that back into the main business and we'll no longer separate that out going forwards.</p><p>Turning to the balance sheet and asset growth. Top left here is the average interest-earning assets. And you can see again a good progression here, around 6% overall growth on the asset side, the yield on that up about 35 basis points over the course of the year. On the bottom left, you can then see the average liabilities and the bottom part there being the interest-paying liabilities and the top slice being the noninterest-bearing liabilities. So overall 2% increase.</p><p>We did not need to increase liabilities that much because we are pretty liquid. The rate we're paying on liabilities has increased, as shown on the top right, by 43 bps. We paid a little bit more during the year for those than we got back on the asset side, which is something we are very focused upon, but overall when you take the mix, the weight of the assets versus liabilities, the consequence of all of that is the NIM has gone up by 3 basis points to 1.58% and the overall increase in the net interest income 7% to $8.8 billion. On forward-looking interest rates, the 50 bps proxy we've used, moderated that down a little bit to about $200 million, which is as you would expect as we move up the rate curve.</p><p>Now risk-weighted assets and capital. I mentioned earlier the significant reduction in risk-weighted assets notwithstanding the increase in the income. So 8% reduction 2017 to 2018. About half of that comes from the improved quality of the loan book. And the other half comes from a mixture of foreign exchange, operational risk and market risk but a big area of focus. And interestingly, if you go back 3 years, we're about $45 billion less RWAs, with only slightly less income, again I think evidencing the improved quality of the overall book and the balance sheet.</p><p>Consequence of that on the CET1 ratio is 14.2% would have been 14.5% but for the regulatory provisions. And again, cast your minds back. Back in 2015, immediately pre-rights, we were at 11.5%, so a progressive build on the CET1 ratio. And that has enabled us to announce the near doubling of the dividend, so I think good progress there.</p><p>And then finally before I hand back to Bill, just a quick sort of refresh on the progress that has been made over the last 3 years, not in the sense of applauding progress but just actually saying we have got a much better base off which to now grow with this business going forwards. So if we recall back, in 2015, CET1 was then 12% or, pre the rights, 11%. The RoTE was negative at that time. We're now at 5%. Obviously, we need to go at the next 5%.</p><p>But some interesting factoids around the edges here. Top left: CIB profitability per unit of RWA is 5x higher now than it was only 3 years ago. Commercial bank, 3 years ago, was losing money. It is now profitable. The Retail Bank, the proportionate income from the Priority, more profitable clients that Bill will talk to in a minute, up from about 1/3 to about half. Investing in Wealth Management, we said back in 2015 that we needed to re-platform and basically put a more up-to-date platform in. That is now largely through what will be completed, I think, in the major markets towards the end of this year. Investing safely in Africa, a huge change in impairment costs, $550 million in the 2015 year down to $40 million in 2018. And leveraging. And this is very important, I think, as we talk more about the strategic -- strategy going forwards. In China, the income in 2016 was 22% lower than in the previous year, whereas in 2018 we are now -- despite everybody's concerns about China, we are on a decided upward trend. So 16% growth in our income in China, and we see a lot of opportunities there.</p><p>So overall, I think the platform for now taking the business up to the next level is so much stronger than it was 3 years ago.</p><p>With that, Bill, I will hand over to you.</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS, GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE &amp; DIRECTOR, STANDARD CHARTERED PLC: Great. Thanks very much, Andy. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us here.</p><p>Just to pick up where Andy left off. I'm extremely happy with the progress that we've made over the past 3 years. When we look back in 2015 and the challenges that we had: We had a reasonably clearer path to where we are today and where we know we need to be over the next 2, 3 years as well, but there were a lot of unknowns. What we've demonstrated in the meantime is that we can grow the key parts of our business that we had recognized from the outset are real competitive advantages. We've grown those businesses. They are generating high returns. We see the opportunities for continued growth, and we will exploit those. And we're going to talk about that in some detail but very happy with the progress that we've made over the past 3 years. I love where we're starting this period of refreshed strategy. I couldn't have asked for much more.</p><p>Where are we today? We're sitting here with clients that are doing more of their business with us, more of the business that we want to do with them, playing to our key strengths. They're telling us that we're easier to deal with. They like dealing with us. They stuck with us through the dark days. And we had some dark days. You saw those, and we felt them very acutely inside our bank. And we've come out of that, and we're extremely well positioned today to generate real growth over the next 3 years to get to this 10%-plus return on tangible equity that we're talking about. So I'm going to speak a little bit about our refreshed priorities. Andy is going to give some more detail, and we'll then wrap it up and get to Q&amp;A.</p><p>Just key messages, and this is what we're going to take you through today. We have some core competitive advantages. Our network business is unique. It's differentiated. And we often get the question, really? I mean, can you really prove to us that you're getting a good return on this stuff? The answer is pure and simple yes, and we'll give you some detail on that and then help you maybe fill in some of the blanks. Second is this focus on our affluent client business. This is a key differentiator for our bank. It's -- obviously it's the retail part of our business, together with our private bank. We operate in 26 retail markets with varying degrees of mix between our affluent and mass market business. And where we've got a heavy affluent focus, we're generating faster growth, higher returns. We have a differentiated Wealth Management product offering, our open architecture approach where we're not asking our suppliers to compete with our own product. We're distributing the best product for clients at any point in time. It's differentiated, and we see that in our growth. We see that in our returns. We'll talk about that, but for all the progress that we've made, we're not fully there, obviously. We're not -- and our cost of capital-plus.</p><p>And we have much more to do. And we're going to start by, obviously, investing and getting our top line growth at a sustained higher level. The second is we're going to address the drags in our portfolio, and we'll talk about this in some detail. We have a number of countries or businesses that are still generating relatively low returns, and we've got action plans for every one of those. They're achievable based on the progress that we've made in transforming so many parts of the bank, so far, but we clearly have more to do. Third is -- Andy gave some key highlights on the cost savings and efficiencies that we've driven over the past 3 years. We'll continue to be focused on efficiency, but increasingly our focus will shift to productivity, increasing the income per RM, increasing the -- decreasing the cost per unit of transaction and various other measures of productivity. And we're doing that with the help and assistance of a new Chief Operating Officer and associated organization, reengineering our process from end to end. We are extremely aggressive in terms of looking at this process, and we'll shift our focus from efficiency to productivity to drive this bottom line improvement and improvement in returns. Fourth is focus on digital. We are a very good digital bank today. We're recognized by clients and by competitors in our markets as being a leading digital bank in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We have excellent digital banking, mobile banking, online banking capabilities in retail. Our Straight2Bank platform is a benchmark in the industry for corporate clients, corporate treasury portals embedded in our corporate desktops. We can go from having digital as an enabling tool, which it has been and will continue to be, to a step further where we can actually address some of our structural challenges through digital technologies, through business model innovation, through disruption.</p><p>So Standard Chartered is in a position now to disrupt in some of our key markets where we have very valuable franchises but not very much profit and deliver that value in the form of profits in partnerships or organically, and we'll talk about that. We get this right, and we're very confident that we can, we will generate a return in tangible equity above 10% by 2021. We will produce incremental earnings, obviously, that will allow us to increase the dividend, possibly doubling over the 3-year period. And we'll have material incremental capital above that, that will be available for investment, also available for returns.</p><p>Now as we look at this investment-versus-return question. We'll spend a little bit of time on this as well. We recognize that we've got a healthy investment program today. We've made big investments for the past 3 years. And as Andy mentioned, we've got plans to maintain that high investment grade. We're taking expenses out of the system in order to further advance our investment agenda. So the things that we know we want to do, we've got a plan for. The earnings and the capital that we generate above that would have to and will be returned unless we have some new things that we can identify that are even more exciting than what we're doing today. So we've got a clear focus on getting the balance right between investment and capital return.</p><p>Now on Page 18. The rest of this presentation is going to be broken into 5 buckets, all of which I've highlighted in the first page: delivering our network, growing our affluent client business, optimizing lower-churning markets, improving productivity and transforming with digital. We've got an important circle in the middle, which is purpose and people, which is it's tough to model but it's an enormous component of what we're focusing on as a bank. We are a purposed-led organization. The purpose resonates with our colleagues, with our clients, with other stakeholders and it guides the decisions that we make. And we've invested enormously in people and will continue to. I can say today, as we sit here, we've got a clear focus on our purpose. We've got a clear understanding through the organization. We've made key investments in people, and that will remain a priority for us for the remainder of all of our time here.</p><p>Now Page 19, just hitting the financial framework high points obviously targeting this 10%-plus RoTE; reaffirming our commitment across the bank to 5% to 7% income growth, similar to guidance that we've given in the past, business by business; mentioned the $700 million of gross cost efficiencies, which will allow us to fund investment. We will manage aggregate costs below inflation. That obviously is the positive JAWS that we will need to have to get the improved returns. Revising our capital ratio target from 12%, 13% up to 13%, 14%, we think this better reflects the market expectations as we sit here today; also reflects the fact that we still have some uncertainties to absorb, most specifically the introduction of Basel IV, the resolution of outstanding matters, et cetera. We deliver this program, we will be in a position to increase the dividend potentially by 2x. And as I mentioned, we will throw off surplus capital, which will be available for reinvestment or for returning to shareholders.</p><p>Now we're going to spend a few pages now, starting on Page 20, on our network business to try to shed a bit more light on why we're so excited about this, why this is such an important part of our overall proposition.</p><p>We know that our corporate client business is generating well over half of our profits. It's been growing at a healthy clip and returns have improved substantially. The improvement has come, overwhelmingly, because of the focus on network income. This is, if we look back over the past 3 years, we see a steady increase in network income as a proportion of our overall, 10% growth in the last year; 13% return on tangible equity, so highly accretive relative to the bottom half of this chart, which is the income with our corporate clients that's more domestic, typically local lending to one degree or another. We can't get out of the local lending business altogether. It's an important part of the overall offering, but we've been reducing that steadily in favor of shifting our focus to the higher-returning, faster-growing network business. And as Andy pointed out, we've been very, very successful in increasing our income while reducing our risk-weighted assets. And that's captured in this bifurcation between network and other domestic income.</p><p>So a little bit more color and maybe draw your attention first to the point I was just making on the right. Return on risk-weighted assets for our network business is substantially higher than the return on risk-weighted assets for our domestic business. That obviously is what makes this business attractive to us. That premium is across markets, across regions. All of our regions are growing nicely, although we've had particularly rapid growth in the Greater China and North Asia region. That really is playing to the opening up of China theme, and we'll come back to that in just a moment. And we can see that the big network income drivers are Europe and Americas. It's OECD clients that really value Standard Chartered's differentiated network in Asia, Africa and the Middle East and in Greater China, again playing to the China-opening-up theme but also meaningful contributions from the ASEAN and South Asia and Africa, Middle East region.</p><p>Moving on to Page 22, a bit more granularity on this network income and some of the exponential effects of the focus that we're getting. So as we shift from having relationships that were skewed to a single market or just a couple of markets or a couple of products into client relationships where we can help provide or provide services and products in 11 or more markets, which we have many, we get a 16x multiplier in profit. So this is truly exponential. As we broaden and deepen the relationships with clients, really leveraging the maximum of our network, we get much higher income.</p><p>Looking at how this breaks down into sub client categories. About half our business is financial institutions, which has been growing very nicely for several years. And this financial institution business is everything from correspondent banking to facilitating cross-border trade, financial markets dealings, treasury services, custodial services, security services, right? This is a -- these are core Commercial Banking businesses for Standard Chartered Bank growing very nicely. Why are we generating this kind of growth from a client segment that's very mature? Obviously, the financial institution client segment is mature. Because we focus on it. It's simply because we focus on it. This is the value that we've gotten from taking a great franchise that had been underinvested and underfocused and refocusing the team. If you look at the corporate side, it's not so impressive, right? We get 3% growth, 5% growth, but that doesn't tell the whole story because, when you break that corporate component into OECD clients which are growing very nicely -- so this is this focus that we've had on delivering our outstanding network to clients in Europe, Americas, Japan, Korea, India, China. All of them have a large proportion of sophisticated global multinational companies. Give -- good growth in the OECD market but less good growth in the OECD, non-OECD client base, right? So our emerging market client base isn't growing as nicely. Those relationships tend to be a little bit more domestic, a little bit less network-oriented. And we have a higher penetration there already.</p><p>So the key message on this slide is more products, more markets, more clients, more profits. And we're focusing on the client areas where we can get that growth and we're actually delivering that. So you'll ask, is that network business really valuable? It sure is. And we're demonstrating that both in returns, in growth, in market share and client satisfaction through key differentiation.</p><p>This is an example, on Page 23, of a single client. Is -- it's a Chinese multinational corporation. We have dozens of these. We would have to have dozens of these to get the aggregate growth rate in network income that I've already highlighted, all right? So this is not just a one-off pick the nice example that happens to support the point. It is statistically one of many, has to be. Where with a single relationship, over a 3-year period, we've got more products, more markets, more deposits, better quality income, better capital efficiency, i.e. the risk-weighted assets are growing slower than the income measures and the deposit measures, leading to a 2.6x improvement in return on risk-weighted assets from 2015 to 2018. And we have many, many, many more of these opportunities to go. We've really barely scratched the surface in terms of clients in particular coming out of OCD -- OECD markets, where we have been investing.</p><p>On Page 24, I'd like to just to dwell just for a moment on China. You've seen in the growth numbers, you've seen in the network numbers that the GCNA region is central for us. It's critical for us. And it's based on our exceptionally strong position in China complemented by our exceptionally strong position in Hong Kong but not to forget also the much stronger position we have in smaller markets like Taiwan and Korea and clearly playing into the broader Chinese trade ecosystem. We believe in China. Obviously, we note the slowing down of economic activity in China. And we are fully cognizant of the risks of increased trade tensions, but despite that, we think that the outlook for China is good. We think they're taking the steps necessary to maintain economic growth at a really healthy, robust level. Wealth is accumulating. Trade is growing, and the proportion of global growth that will come from China is very high.</p><p>We are exceptionally well positioned in China. We're a leading bank in the opening up of the capital markets: #1 cross-border payments bank; #1 bank in Bond Connect, which is the facility to bring external capital into the Chinese market; #1 or certainly top tier in the internationalization of the RMB; #1 Belt and Road bank, focused on not just our relationships in China but our relationships across the Belt and Road countries, where we have 45 different -- presence in 45 different markets. So we're well positioned in China. We think China will present us with ongoing great opportunities.</p><p>If we switch Page 28 (sic) [25] and Africa and slightly different story, right? African economies are under pressure, as we know. Most of the region is in recession of one form or other right now, but despite that, our confidence that Africa has great medium-, long-term prospects is undiminished. So substantial increase in expected trade volumes as the African economies themselves open up. Very rapidly growing middle class, a demographic dividend, and growth that's still above the global average. We're exceptionally well positioned in Africa, both to generate profit in each of our African markets, which we are doing today and we think we can continue to improve profits, but these are -- this is a good, profitable region for us despite the current pressures. But in addition to that, we got -- a very important element of our differentiation for our non-African multinational corporate clients is our African business. 62% of our top clients in CIB deal with us in Africa. It's not the only reason they deal with us, but when we think about the things that differentiate Standard Chartered Bank versus other banks that have networks, not our network, have different networks, but they -- many of them deal with us because we can solve their problems in areas where they can't find anybody else but that actually has a local presence to understand the problems they have, in this case in Africa.</p><p>So a good, underlying profitable business for us, good growth opportunities and very important for the overall differentiation of our network.</p><p>So that was a quick run-through on why we believe so passionately about the value of our network business and why we're continuing to invest in it. I'd like to switch now on Page 29 to -- 26. I can't see the numbers, all right. On -- would like to switch now to the focus on our second theme, which is our affluent client population.</p><p>Like the network business, you can see we're getting the benefits of focus there. The Wealth Management, Priority clients, Premium clients, Private Banking business was a little bit less than half of our income 3 years ago. Through a focus on marketing, through a focus on technology, through a focus on the way we organize our branches, just the way we've oriented our Retail Bank, we've had a substantial improvement and increase in our Priority clients segment, growing at 8%; and very high returns, 30% return on tangible equity because, of course, it's a much less-capital-intensive business, bulk of the income coming from Wealth Management products and deposits rather than personal loans or credit cards and a clear shift in the nature of our retail business, and driving the good top line growth that we've had in retail and the good RoE improvement that we've had in retail. We'll talk about that in a little bit of detail in the following pages. We'll also talk in the separate sections about the other income. This is the mass market, obviously not an exciting story at all, 0 percent growth over the last year and over the past 3 years. Now that's better than the negative growth that we had for most of the previous 10 years, as we effectively traded our mass market business, but not good enough by a long shot. And we're going to look at how we can improve both the growth rate in retail business but also the profitability, which as you can see is slightly negative, through aggressive digitization, ongoing management of costs, ongoing management of physical infrastructure, et cetera. So -- but we'll talk about that in the coming slides. For the time being, let's just focus on wealth and the affluent client segment.</p><p>You got a measure on the left just capturing a few of the benchmarks for the profitability of this business. Obviously, it is more profitable and by any measure. And you know that we generated good growth. We talk on the right, how are we going to focus on getting this good platform that we built into hyperdrive, which is really the objective. And we think we can do that.</p><p>First is going to be continuing to evolve our customer proposition. When we think about the banking world of the future, we can imagine that there is an element of that world which is going to feel a lot like buying any consumer product. You can buy your credit cards or your personal loans the same way can buy your washing machines or your windshield wiper blades. You can go to [Alibaba, like,] or Amazon or JD.com and you can get that. Our proposition is that clients will have a different segment of their lives that they're not going to want to execute on a generic platform. And it's going to be that -- the life decisions that are important to them: how they manage their wealth, how they manage their health, perhaps how they manage the education of their family -- themselves or their family. These are life decisions. And we think that there will be a heavy human component to that business for some time to come and that people will be inclined to aggregate the kind of advice that they get on these things that are interrelated to some degree. So building out our proposition for Wealth Management products into a broader health and eventually other important life-decision-type platform will be important for us, developing personalized and contextualized investment ideas both delivered technologically, and we've made some great progress on that. But also delivered the old-fashion way, human contact, voice-to-voice, face-to-face. Our open architecture platform is an enormous differentiator for us. It's something that we'll continue to develop with more product, services delivered through that platform and clearly an increased focus on analytics. And we've just got a few of the measures of progress we've made in the past couple of years. We know that we have much, much more to go.</p><p>So just to summarize quickly on the affluent product business. It's key for us. It's growing fast. It's high-returning. We're differentiated. We're evidencing our differentiation through market share gains and customer satisfaction gains, and it will continue to be a key area of focus for us.</p><p>If I can move on to Page 29, to the optimization section of our discussion. I'm going to spend a couple of minutes on this page because it's pretty important and there's a lot on here.</p><p>The -- I'll start by saying we somewhat simplistically break the countries in which we operate into 3 buckets. The top bucket is those markets where we are a top local, universal bank. So think Hong Kong or Kenya in there. These are markets where we got a good, scaled retail business, good local Commercial Banking business and also important network countries. So both inbound, so the rest of the world dealing in those markets, but also outbound, i.e. they've got multinational corporations that need servicing for the rest of their business. We get a good return on both the domestic and the network business in those markets. And we're going to invest substantially, as we have, to generate the incremental growth that we know we can achieve.</p><p>The third bucket is countries that are pure network-focused. So think the U.S. or Europe or Japan, where we don't have a meaningful domestic business. We don't have any retail. We've got some small domestic lending. So you can see 7% is domestic business, but we know that, that domestic lending is -- in and of itself standalone is not attractive. It's a means to an end. The network business is attractive in those businesses. And it's a big chunk of our network. It's coming from these pure-network countries. So we'll do as little of the domestic business as we can. We'll focus on our -- sorry, as little of the domestic business as we can. We'll focus on the network business. We'll continue to grow that franchise, more clients and deeper.</p><p>The challenging bucket for optimization is the middle. And this is where we have a -- and we are an international bank with good network capabilities, trusted local capabilities but typically subscale. And the trusted local capabilities are typically retail. And in many cases, we've got a market share that's very small in the context of big markets. So think India, Indonesia, Korea, the U.A.E., which we're going to go into detail on the following page.</p><p>We know that the, we observe that the returns on our subscale local businesses are quite poor. The red circle here doesn't mean we're losing money. We're actually making a bit of money, but it's dragging our RoTE down materially. So it's unacceptable and it's unnecessary. And it's -- in fact, it's necessary that we correct this in order to get the overall 10%-plus return on tangible equity. The network business in these countries is good. We wouldn't want to compromise it. It's as good as it is in the rest of the network, and in some cases, there are some synergies between the local and the network business that we wouldn't want to lose either.</p><p>So we're just thinking of those 17 countries on the -- 21 countries, sorry, on the previous page. We were doing a deep dive on 4, but there's a similar story for the rest as well. The things that these 4 markets on Page 29 have in common are: One, we have good network business in each case, although we can do more. Second is we have a meaningful local retail business, but it's subscale. It's relatively small as a percentage of the markets in each of those cases. Third is we have a retail business that is skewed to the mass market rather this focus on affluent that we've seen elsewhere. And clearly, we need to address all three of those issues to get these markets up to adequate scale. Of course, there's a different approach in each market. And when we look for guidance and inspiration, we often turn to Korea. So still on this chart because, while we've dramatically improved their performance over the past 4 years, it's still a low-returning market. And as we think about how we can get to this 10%-plus RoTE, we're going to have to improve markets like Korea further. How have we done it? Focus on costs. We focus on customer proposition. We focus on liberating capital that had been trapped to one degree or other in these markets. And we've made really good progress on all 3 fronts, and we have more to do, all right? So we will continue the track in Korea.</p><p>Indonesia, slightly different story. And we've obviously had a dual focus with Permata and with our own local bank. We've identified Permata as noncore, which will allow us to focus entirely on our local banking business with some of the same themes that we've talked about before. U.A.E. and India have been going through a transformation. We have been shifting and pivoting towards affluent clients, but we have much more to go. We have focus on cost. We have more to go. We've focused on capital. We have more to go.</p><p>So each market is a little bit different. We know we can do it because we've made good progress in so many markets already. We have a few other tools that we're very happy to deploy at this point, recognizing that we've got some outstanding digital capabilities; recognizing that we've demonstrated that we're a great partner for Big Tech, for fintech, for e-commerce platforms around the world. And we've got some good experience, I mean, to set up these partnerships and run these partnerships. And we can put that into overdrive and take our relatively small retail franchise that -- but nevertheless has great value and combine that with other partners in the markets in which we operate to achieve much greater scale, perhaps owning less than 100% of the operation, but that's fine from our perspective. What we want to do is to get good, accretive -- creative accretive earnings on top of the nice value franchise that we've got. Now if we execute this agenda, we pick up 150 basis points of our RoTE. So in the progression from 5% to 10% that Andy took you through, an important part of that -- and Andy will take you through, an important part of that is the 150 basis points that come from these countries.</p><p>So we're very focused on optimizing the remaining markets in our portfolio that need optimization. We've got good tools, good plans to do that. And we're prepared to be quite creative in terms of the way that we reposition our business, innovating new business models, to get there.</p><p>Now if I could shift to Page 30, on productivity and the shift from productivity -- from efficiency, excuse me, to productivity.</p><p>The benefits are clear on the right side of the page. The progress that we've made in improving our cost of production and our income per capita are strong. As I mentioned earlier, we've got a very structured process now to go through each of our client journeys from end to end, one at a time, over the course of this year and into next year, looking for radical changes in terms of the way that we operate. So to take the good efficiency platforms that we've got and drive that through to real productivity.</p><p>And finally, if I could shift to digital for just a moment. Digital obviously is part and parcel of everything that we do. And there's an element of the digital agenda which is a set of tools to make ourselves more effective and more efficient, better customer experience and the like. And we've got a very good track record of delivering these things, and we will continue to do so. And I think we're with or ahead of the market in many regards. We're behind the market in some areas as well. There's plenty of upside, but the second broad application for digital is this business model innovation, so taking things that we do today and doing them fundamentally differently, perhaps with different partners and perhaps targeting different clients relative to the ones that we are dealing with today. And this is relatively early stage, but we've got, made some good, concrete progress. We've demonstrated that we are prepared to disrupt in some markets where we think that's the best way for us to achieve the optimal returns.</p><p>We have probably got 3 types of digital application. The circle on the top is those situations where we're deploying our own solutions. So -- and when we look in -- at the digital banks that we've rolled out to 4 countries in Africa, with another 6 scheduled for the rest of this year, these are stand-alone digital banks. It's using Standard Chartered technology developed in-house, rolled out in-house, very impactful in these markets. And we think that there's much more to go. We'll talk about that a little bit more later. Similar platforms for SMEs in India. We are applying for a virtual bank license in Hong Kong, which while we're using many technical components from third parties and partners, the package is being pulled together by Standard Chartered Bank. And we'll operate this as a separate entity. We would intend to be able to port our knowledge and competence back into the main bank as we learn from this very important business and a very important market for us.</p><p>In the lower left, we've got our ability to work with partners. I mentioned Ant Financial, this cross-border blockchain-based remittance platform which we started Philippines, Hong Kong -- or Hong Kong, Philippines, which we've rolled out to other corridors. Now we will continue to roll that out. Ant Financial has been very generous in their praise of Standard Chartered. They've labeled us an outstanding partner, the bank that they prefer to work with, technically extremely capable, able to keep pace with them side by side with good, strong commercial applications and pragmatism. So these are the kinds of partnerships that we've been able to form that are really differentiating for our customers and obviously also for the bank, but we can -- there's a couple of other examples that we've got here that we will go into in a little bit of detail.</p><p>And finally, fintechs. I mean fintechs are our friends. They feed off us. We feed off them. They give us great ideas. They give us great products and services. We've got over 500 engagements with different fintech companies. As I mentioned in earlier discussions from this podium, the fintech is a great equalizer, all right? We can go head-to-head with the biggest banks in the market or the biggest e-commerce players in the market because we have access basically to the same technology they do but through third parties. And these fintech providers are desperately keen to make sure that we're never behind a bank that perhaps is much bigger than us, with a bigger technology budget. That's exactly what we're doing. And we've become masters at working with partners and fintech companies, and we'll become even more better as we continue to roll out our digital capabilities.</p><p>No bank presentation would be complete without referral to blockchain technology, distributed ledger, artificial intelligence, machine learning, platforms and ecosystems -- so I've done it. It's all here on one slide. You can digest it all at once. Maybe the difference between what everybody else has said about these 6 things and what we're saying about these 6 things is that we're actually doing it. And we're doing it because it's kind of existential for us. If we're going to go toe to toe with the biggest players in the market, we're going to have to be faster, nimbler, more innovative and better utilizers of third-party products and partnerships. And we have many examples of all three of these things. I've listed just a few of them on this page.</p><p>If we move to Page 33. I thought it would be useful to give a little color about -- or really answering the question, why do you have different digital strategies in different markets?</p><p>Just to get to a little bit of our decision tree. So I mean the first question we ask is, is it a big market? Is the market opportunity big? Because if the market opportunity is big, then we need to throw some serious resources at it to make it work. If it's not so big, so take for example Kenya or Ghana, we're going to go digital in those markets. We're going to go digital hard, but we're going to do it with the stuff that's on our own shelf. And we've got good technology on the shelf. We deliver that through our bank first rolled out in C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, now rolled out in Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya later this quarter and the rest of Africa and then beyond over the rest of this year. We can deliver that. It's impactful. It's differentiated, relative to local offerings. It's not the cutting-edge state-of-the-art, but that's okay because we're starting in a market with less -- fewer alternatives for our clients to choose from. And we'll -- of course, we will continue to improve that offering over time.</p><p>So for those markets which are large markets but where we don't have a big market share. So again think India, Indonesia, back to the optimization slide that I went through. And there, we're also going hard digital, but digital is going to be the answer in this case. Digital is going to be the thing that gets us from subscale and under-profitable to scaled and profitable. We may need to do that with partners. And we're very happy to link up through various forms of partnership to deliver our capabilities in a differentiated way, potentially in a disruptive way, into some of these big markets where our existing profitability is quite low, all right?</p><p>The third bucket are those things where the market is scaled and we've got a good position. So think Hong Kong. The opportunities there are not to hide under a rock and hope that digital doesn't take over these markets or that the virtual banks' licenses all become irrelevant but rather to attack head-on. Now the fact is we've got a great business in Hong Kong, but we have a lower penetration of the mass market and a lower penetration of the millennial market than we do the more affluent or older people market, silver as we sometimes call it. And we'll launch our virtual bank, regulatory approval pending, focused on these segments where we're relatively underpenetrated. Now are we going to disrupt that market? Yes, I think we will. Are we going to offer a better banking proposition to those customers? Yes. I think we're going to build the best digital bank in the world that we're going to deliver to this highly sophisticated group of buyers in a very developed and sophisticated market. Customers will tell us whether we've achieved that, but it's going to be good and it's going to be differentiated. And we're going to target those segments of the market that we don't offer today, and we're going to take the best ideas from that virtual bank and port them back into the main bank.</p><p>So is there the risk of disruption of the core franchise? Yes, yes, a bit, but we're going to get much more by targeting that 81% of the market -- sorry, that 91% of the market that we don't have today. We're going to get much more from there than we're going to give up on the 9% of the market that we do have today. So very excited about this, both for the technology that we develop but also for the opportunities to generate profit in its own right in Hong Kong.</p><p>So digital, central to our bank, critically important. We're in a really good place to start and we'll continue to drive that hard.</p><p>I'm going to have to wrap up here. We've covered the 5 points on the left side of the slide. We've hit the key points of the financial framework. With that, I will hand back to Andy. And then we'll have some time for summing up and Q&amp;A later.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Okay, so on to Slide 36, just to pull that together into numbers.</p><p>So clearly, the objective here is how do we get 5% to become 10%. A little bit more detail in the couple of following slides on some of these, but we have reiterated our view that 5% to 7% income growth is what we should and will be aiming for. Costs growing below the rate of inflation. We were previously saying at inflation or below. We're saying now below the rate of inflation. And although that looks like a small block on there, I think the productivity gain that is implicit in growing the revenue block substantially more than the cost block is actually quite important here, and productivity, a core thesis going forward.</p><p>Impairment was commendably low last year, as I talked about earlier. It would be nice to think it would stay at those low levels right the way through the period. Maybe that would be a little optimistic, so we've put a slightly higher impairment charge in here, not because we're worried but just being realistic that may be the average over a multiyear period. Tax and bank levy. We have tax rates just above 30% at the moment. We see those going just below 30% over time. And bank levy basis-of-charge changes in the 2021 year, which will put our bank levy charge down below -- to below $100 million. So that will give us some benefit.</p><p>RWA optimization, I'm going to come on to in a minute but essentially saying we think that we can actually keep the growth in the RWAs below the rate of which we are growing the top line. And then importantly, with the 13% to 14% range, to the extent that we are generating excess capital over and above that, that we need in the business, we will look to return that. And I think that is probably one of the key differences between the last 3 years and the next 3 years is the last 3 years, the return on equity has been all about the R, the return bit, whereas hope for the next 3 it can be about the E and about the R as we actually manage this to the 10% level.</p><p>So if I take the income side first, split this, on the left-hand side, into the net interest income, this is Slide 37, and on the right-hand side, into fees and other income. Our strong belief is that volume growth is absolutely there for the taking, GDP growth in the markets in which we operate above global averages. And if you go back over the last 2 or 3 years, we have grown, depends upon which time period, but -- 5% to 6% on volume growth. And we see every opportunity to continue that. The mix of income, we will be pushing, as Bill has referred to, very decisively towards some of the more profitable products, more so even than in the past. That should help a little bit on the margin front. And on the liability side, which as you can see earlier there is a slight uptick in liability costs, that is very much within our sights now. We know we need to work on that. It's a core cost within the business and we need to work that down, which we will do.</p><p>Rates and margin. Interest rate benefit going forwards will likely be lower than that in the recent past but not nonexistent. There is still some upside from the -- either interest rates already rolling through or some smaller levels of interest rate increase across some markets. And then importantly, one we've not talked a lot about before but some legal entity restructuring that we've been doing in the background, not very visible. It is well progressed now. And over the 3-year period, the ability to actually put liquidity across markets and certain markets will significantly improve, and that will enable us to actually reduce some of the liability costs.</p><p>On the right-hand side, fees and other income, we've split that between consumer individuals and the corporate side of things. So the big focus, as Bill has been referring to, on affluent customers, the fact that the Wealth Management platform is being replaced, the fact that, over the last period, in fact since 2009, Wealth Management income has grown at a CAGR of about 8% over that period of time. Clearly, that is something which we are going to be really, really pushing very, very hard over the next 3-year period.</p><p>And then on the Corporate side, several opportunity areas. You can see the CIB business and its strengthening momentum during the 2018 period. The fact that we have got a lot of opportunity still sitting out there, particularly in China, which has been going strong, despite everybody's concerns about China, we are doing very well there. E-platforms and a lot of things we're doing on the distribution front give us a very good reason to believe that we can increase the income on the corporate side.</p><p>So put that all together. 5% to 7% on the average over the next 3 years is where we are setting our sights.</p><p>On costs. So $10.1 billion is where we ended up, as I said earlier, in 2018. Clearly, over the next 3-year period, we will have to absorb inflationary increases. That is a fact of life. And with the increase in the investment spend, there is a slightly higher amortization cost that actually goes through the P&amp;L, so those two would put upward pressure on the costs. What we are determined to do, however, is to drive efficiencies both on the regulatory front, some of the bigger regulatory programs now starting to come to an end. And also outside the regulatory space, a big, big focus upon third-party costs, upon locations and high-cost locations and on processes. New Chief Operating Officer David Whiteing, who's kind of really, really driving the process [for you here]. And I think it's a lens that we haven't applied as much in the past, we can do going forwards. And therefore the confidence that we can get sort of order of magnitude about $700 million out of the business.</p><p>There will be some further restructuring costs to do that, about $500 million, but our view is that we absolutely will be able to keep the costs in the business down below inflation and keep the higher level of investment that we really need to drive the business forwards.</p><p>On RWAs, $258 billion, this is Slide 39, in 2018. We absolutely expect there will be growth in the RWAs from the growth in business opportunities that are out there. And to the extent that those aren't giving us an acceptable return, we will invest the RWAs unashamedly in growing the business. However, with some of the exits, Principal Finance to roll off fully, ship leasing, et cetera, et cetera, the noncore classification of Permata, if you put that in the noncore category, then for the rest of the business there will be a reduction from those things. And optimization initiatives, there is a lot of work going on looking at the models for risk weightings, where we see further upside opportunity.</p><p>So if you put those all together, we would think that something of the order of 2% growth in risk-weighted assets will be consistent with a 5% to 7% top line growth on the business overall.</p><p>Now obviously, in 2022, so just outside the 3-year period we're talking about, Basel IV will kick in. We previously said that will be roughly 10% to 15% increase in the RWAs pre-mitigation. We now, having spent more time looking at that, think a bit more in the 5% to 10% range after some mitigation actions, but of course, by 2022, there'll be another year of profits as well to come in that period. So RWAs is going to be very, very central to the thesis going forwards, and as you've seen, a lot of progress in 2018 on that front already.</p><p>So finally, on capital, what does that mean? And capital ratio for last year, 14.2%, as I said earlier. The mathematical consequence of everything we've been talking about in terms of our financial projections will be a progressive build in the CET1 high levels. And the exits and the reclassifications of noncore will give us further potential benefit there. Ordinary dividends, obviously we are endeavoring to grow the dividends as we go forwards. And as Bill has mentioned, potentially we could get a doubling of the dividend in the period to 2021. That should still leave us with extra capital. If we can find good places to invest that to grow the business further, we will do that. To the extent that we cannot find those opportunities, we will be quite happy to look at returns back to shareholders.</p><p>So hopefully, that paints the framework of that.</p><p>With that, Bill, I'll hand back to you to close.</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: Good. Just a couple of comments by way of wrap-up, and then we'll have time for Q&amp;A.</p><p>The priorities that we set out today are really guided, as I mentioned at the outset, by our purpose and delivered by our people. That's not so visible to you from the outside. I can only tell you that it's been an enormous area of focus for us. Where this translates through to confidence ourselves is that we have instilled and we'll continue to instill a culture of excellence in our bank. We weren't uniformly demonstrating a culture of excellence, when you went back 3, 4, 5 years. And we're not uniformly demonstrating a culture of excellence today either, but it's a lot better. And we'll continue to improve as we focus on the investment in our people. We understand our responsibilities to our societies and our communities. It's a big part of what attracts people, clients to Standard Chartered Bank. We have a clear focus on our emerging markets but also bridging the third -- emerging markets to the rest of the world, doing so in a sustainable way.</p><p>We have made a big investment in our people. We will continue to. And we've made a big investment in our communities, which we will continue do. This is soft stuff that is tough to put into a model, but it's critical for our value proposition to our own colleagues, also to our colleagues -- to our clients and to other external stakeholders.</p><p>So just by way of wrap-up. I know we haven't answered all of your questions today. And we won't even in through the hour of Q&amp;A that we'll have starting now, but what we have done is put a framework out on the table with really key indicators of progress that we've made over the past 3 years. It's that progress that gives us confidence that we can deliver the next phase of our corporate development in our march towards a good, strong, sustainable level of profitability in the bank. We have a number of things that are in the works that we haven't given you detail on, which we will. And each time we have a new important initiative to call out, we'll reflect back to this presentation today exactly in the way that we did in November of 2015, when we set out a list of about 50 things that we were going to get done. And that was met with a relatively high level of skepticism. I'll tell you that we made great progress or ticked the box on 50 of those 50 things that we said we were going to do. And what we've done each time that we came back to you in every 3 months or 6 months afterwards is to say, this is what we said we were going to do. This is what we've done. Mark the progress. And we'll do the same thing here, all right?</p><p>So the confidence that I have today is vastly greater than the confidence that I had in November of 2015, when we stood up and give our first strategy refresh, because we've gotten the validation from our clients and we've gotten the validation from our colleagues. We've been able to attract some outstanding talent. We've been able to develop some great talent within. Market share is up. Income is growing. Profits are improving. Loan impairments are down. Regulatory issues are grindingly being set aside, as the progress that we've made with the New York State Department of Financial Services, the -- obviously the provision that we took last week are indications that we're making progress on these fronts, as we are on so many other things.</p><p>So I feel great about the progress we've made. I feel great about our prospects. I hope we've shared a little bit of that enthusiasm with you. We fully recognize that we're going to have to prove it and that's exactly what we intend to do.</p><p>So with that, Andy will rejoin me. We've got an hour or so for questions.</p><p>David...</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, okay. And we can start here, and then we'll go to David.</p><p>ROBERT IAN SAGE, RESEARCH ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: It's Robert Sage from Macquarie. I've just got a -- just have a couple of questions because sort of one of the things that strikes me is that you've not changed your revenue growth sort of expectations, 5% to 7%. And I think that's sort of broadly in people's numbers, but I think if you look at consensus, you're only expected to make less than 8% or something RoTE in sort of 2021. So I'm sort of wondering where the delta was arise. And I've got 2 specific questions on this. I think the first one is on the loan losses, which I think you sort of say is about 28 basis points last year. And I see from one of the slides there is an expectation that will rise between now and sort of 2021, but I think when you sort of look back to 2015, the guidance was more around sort of mid-50s. And I was wondering whether there's been a sort of a significant reduction in terms of expected credit losses as a sort of loan loss provisions moving forward? And I guess the second question is that you're still sort of -- no. Actually, you've improved your cost guidance from at or below rate of inflation to below the rate of inflation. Should we be thinking quite significantly below the rate of inflation in terms of where the consensus might be too pessimistic, do you think?</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Yes, let me take that. Loan impairment and forecasting it, as you well know, is not an easy and precise science. And as you say, we are sub 30 basis points, at the moment, we were for 2018. And we had in previous forecasts nearer 50. What is implicit if you microscopically examine the height of the bar on that is we've probably worked on something around 40 basis points as a sort of a 3-year on average. Now whether that will be right or not then, we will know in 3 years' time. And what I would say is certainly at the moment the loan book is behaving very well. The early alerts, which are usually the sort of forward indicators as to what's going on, are still improving. And therefore, given a fair wind, hopefully, we can stay at the lower levels for a period of time. However, we're trying to take a sort of 3-year-out view and hence just being a little bit more sort of thoughtful about that. And if we are too cautious, clearly it will help that leg of the numbers. The costs side, I think, is sort of more nuanced. We are both clearly wanting to keep the costs down, but we are not wanting to starve the business with investment to do the things that we have talked about going forwards. A lot of the things Bill referred to will need an element of IT enablement behind them. And to the extent that we can afford to do that, we would far prefer to be continuing to invest to improve the fabric of the business to do it. If we wanted to, for sure, we could cut it down. We could get lower costs. Whether that in the medium term will be the best thing for the business, I'm not quite so sure. So I think, for the moment, I'd be more thinking that inflation, just below, is sort of where we'll be at rather than thinking about significant cuts below that.</p><p>DAVID JOHN LOCK, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: David Lock from Deutsche. I've got 2, please. And firstly, on capital. And you're running at 14.2% and you're saying you can -- you think you can run between 13% and 14%. Very simple math, but if you grow the risk-weighted assets by 2% CAGR, you -- it looks to me like you don't actually need much more dollar billions of capital. So actually you have the right number from a dollar billions perspective today, so in which case, how should we be thinking about the earnings, frankly, over the next 3 years and what they're going to be used for? Because it doesn't strike me you need to retain very much over the next 3 years. What are the headwinds that we should be thinking about that need to be consumed? And obviously, there's this outstanding fine which I know you won't be able to talk on, but are there any other items where that capital might be used? Or is that the best way to be thinking about that capital and how it could be distributed to shareholders? And the second one is on costs. If I look at Slide 38, where you give the costs walk, and always conscious with plans like these where we're hoping for lots of income growth over the coming years, but what is the plan B? And I noticed that you've kind of cost flexed the amount of investment spend you've got. It looks relatively small on the chart, so if the income disappoints, how much can you actually flex down the investment spend to help kind of hit that RoTE target?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: Why don't I just start on the capital question? Andy will elaborate, no doubt, and cover costs. We've got a pretty healthy investment budget built in anyways. We've -- as Andy said, we've stepped up our investments and we intend to maintain that pace. And in fact, we intend to increase that, funded in part by -- or entirely but then in part more by the cost savings that we'll continue to generate. So if the earnings progression is as we hope and expect, then there will be substantial incremental capital even factoring in a dividend that we would also expect to increase over this time. Then we'll see at the time whether we have some really compelling incremental investment opportunities, so beyond what we see today. If they're there, then we won't hesitate to continue to grow our business, but if they're not there, then we won't hesitate to return that to shareholders.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Yes. I mean -- so I think, if you take the max of the guidance we've given on the top line and costs and et cetera, you will work out there is a reasonable level of capital return that is expected during the period. And that could be at a level that may be a slight difference between sort of where the consensus is at the moment; and hence why there's that slight difference, to the previous question. But you will do your own math on that. But at least we are in the position now where we can be talking about that, whereas the last 3 years clearly that has been really sort of off limits. The cost front, I'll come back to the previous point. I mean we can take the cost of -- or the amount we are investing in improving the business down if we want to do that. That is completely within our grasp because it's totally controllable. The balance, I think, is this point about what is the better thing for the medium term of the business. So in the short term, for sure, we can take some of that expense down if we want to. Our preference will be to continue to build the business and do the things we're talking about. The growth is out there to be taken in these markets. We would rather avail ourselves of that. We think that is the better way to build value in this business than to just be sort of taking the costs down progressively over time.</p><p>THOMAS ANDREW JOHN RAYNER, ANALYST, NUMIS SECURITIES LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's John Rayner from Numis. Can I have two, please? The first, on sort of normalizing to 40 basis points of impairment charge. The sort of underlying conditions which drive that possibly would also drive some positive [push at the guarantee] and RWAs might also require you to build coverage against your stage 1 and stage 2 performing assets. I wonder, have you factored those things to any extent into the overall financial targets? And I've got a second question, just on the U.S. provision in terms of what new information that you have allowed you to take that provision. And is there anything else you can add about potential non-financial penalties, or is that something that you just can't talk about at the moment?</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Yes, as I said earlier, the accuracy of forecasting a 40 bps versus 35 or 30 is clearly quite a tricky one. And what I think we're doing is saying, last year, the overall macro environment was reasonably benign and the credit book behaved very well. As we look out, there may be -- there's a little bit more stress in the system, and therefore we should err slightly on the side of caution. I suspect, if we had put the credit impairments in on that chart at exactly the same levels as last year, we'd be getting the opposite question of wasn't that all being a bit too optimistic. And so what we're hoping is that, that allows for some expansion of the business. It's -- reflects the fact that we have got good control over the credit book, but as I say, whether it is accurate to the last 2 or 3 basis points, I'm not quite sure. And on the U.S. provisioning, there are various accounting rules about where you have to be within a process to decide on provisioning. The accounting rules and where we've got to with that discussion got us to the point where it was appropriate that we should provision. It is a best estimate of an outcome. It is not the outcome itself, but it is a best estimate and hence why we've reflected it in the 2018 numbers.</p><p>MARTIN LEITGEB, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs. Could I have, first of all, a clarification just on your earlier comments on capital? And I was just wondering in terms of time line of that capital target range, thinking back obviously a couple of years ago, that we have the 13% target range with Standard Chartered and being significantly above that level, I think, immediately 3 or 4 quarters thereafter for the remainder of the period. Would you expect the bank to run within that 13% to 14% throughout the bulk of that kind of 3-year period? And do you need to wait for the annual stress testing cycle in order before you could make any consideration about the return of access capital? Or is that -- could that occur earlier? The second question is on Korea. And here I think Korea accounts for 10% of your capital consumption today. Then I think we are aware of the difficulties in taking out costs, so I just wondered if you could comment a little bit more on the levers you have to improve profitability. And I think, would you consider the optionality you could have with the business if the opportunity arises going forwards? And a third question, very short, just in terms of the legal entity optimization in Asia, I think we have seen fairly limited detail. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more how big that entity is and what kind of funding benefits could arise from that.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Shall I pick those up and you...</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: Yes. Why don't you take a run through? I'll add any color I've got.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Yes. I mean obviously, the more certainty we can get on sort of big-ticket items, the more confident we get on making sort of returns of the capital. I would hope, through the majority of the next 3-year period, we would sit within that 13% to 14% range. We're not sitting here with an endeavor to be constantly above it. And I know, since the 2015 update, we have sat constantly above it, but that was one period and we're now in a slightly different period. So hopefully, through the majority of the period, we'd be sort of in range rather than demonstrably outside of it. Korea, I suppose, 2 things on Korea. I think the returns on Korea are dependent upon 2 things. One is the operational performance, and the other is the level of capital invested in the business. And clearly the operational performance, certainly compared with 2015, has changed markedly. We lost $200 million or $300 million in 2015, and we made $200 million of profit last year. So the operational performance has improved a lot. We have started to get capital out of the business, and earlier this year, we actually got quite a big chunk more out of the business. It takes time to do that, but over the next 3 years, we would hope that we can further improve on the capital front as well. And legal entities, well, it's sort of one of those subjects where one either goes very shallow or one goes very, very deep, but suffice it to say what we're seeking to do essentially is to get the legal entities more aligned around the regions that we are running the business through, so a sort of Northern Asia, a Southern Asia and the sort of rest of the world hub. Our historic structure has not been along those lines. And by doing that, those businesses, those legal entities, which are in sort of subgroups, the ability to look at liquidity and things like that on a collective basis rather than on an individual basis is bigger. The opportunity is not in the tens of millions. It is bigger than that. I mean low hundreds, but it's not inconsequential in terms of our journey to get the RoTE up and the profits up. It's quite significant.</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: And just I'll just add a little bit of color on -- maybe on each one. On the capital, the -- we're certainly not waiting for specific incremental approvals from regulators or validation from the stress test. We passed the stress test very handily in a scenario that was pretty focused on the markets where we operate. So we're not constrained in terms of coming up with the optimal capital level by specific things like stress testing. And as Andy said, we would intend to operate within the range, not at the top of the range, not above the range but within the range. That's why we have a range. And as this -- Andy also said, we'd been in a different place the last 3 years, and we'll be in a different place for most of the next 3 years. We're going through an interesting transition right now. The Korea, as I commented in my comments earlier, it's outstanding progress. And there are some real lessons for how we operationally improved our least-well-performing or our most underperforming market 3 years ago and gotten that into the bucket of, yes, it needs some more work, but it's been pulling every single lever that we could pull. Short of the strategic alternatives that you set out and what we consider other things, well, if we can maintain this, the progress that we've achieved in Korea, then we don't need to consider other things that are not going to create value for our shareholders today. So we think we have many levers that we can pull operationally. And then obviously using some of the digital capabilities that we are also in a better position to deliver now than we were anytime over the past 3 years is a further catalyst for growth. And then finally, on the legal entities, the core of this is a recognition that the regulators in our markets, in particular the HKMA or the MAS or in different ways the Dubai International Financial Centre regulators, are more comfortable with their -- with the markets in their neighborhood than they are with markets outside their neighborhood or than somebody sitting in London would be with markets that are very, very far away and sometimes quite scary. So obviously looking at the way the stress test has played itself out over the past couple of years with a very heavy focus on a China hard landing. That's been a central feature of the stress test. When we -- and of course, we're a U.K.-domiciled bank. We'll always have to operate under the rubric of the Bank of England in that stress test. That's all there, but in terms of our ability to be a little bit more fungible with capital and liquidity within a neighborhood by reorganizing legal entities in a more hubbed way will be very additive to, as Andy says -- materially additive in terms of our ability to manage capital and cash.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: [Okay], meet me on the back here, and then I'll [go across the] obstacle course.</p><p>JAMES FREDERICK ALEXANDER INVINE, EQUITY ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE CROSS ASSET RESEARCH: It's James Invine here from SocGen. I've got two, please, one on capital and then one on revenues. The first, on capital. Bill, you mentioned that the reason for pushing up your target range to that 13%, 14% was Basel III and the conduct issue still to be resolved, so should we think that, when we get around to 2022, that range is probably going to drop back down to reflect those things disappearing? That's the first one. And then the second one, on revenues, specifically CIB. I guess, over the past few years, you've been shedding less-profitable customers and deepening the wallet share with existing customers. Are you now assuming growth in customer numbers for CIB going forwards? And how much of that is going to drive your 5% to 7% growth, please?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: Yes, so I mean our range is 13% to 14%. We think that's the right range for now. As situations change, either as market expectations change as some of the uncertainties that we continue to experience reduce, we may consider an adjustment one way or the other in that capital ratio. That's not something that we're planning on or factoring into any of our thinking today. So the 13% to 14% is -- and then operating within that range -- it's a big range. So I mean there's a lot of flex between 13% to 14% already. And we would expect to operate well within that range and drift to either side of the middle of that range as appropriate for the circumstances, yes. If that requires a [whole set of] change in the target, we'll consider that at the time. Now CIB, yes, we're absolutely growing the number of clients. So when Simon stood up here in this place 1.5 years ago, Simon Cooper, heading CIB, he identified a few initiatives that had to do with deepening our relationships with existing clients. He called it the next 100. So we have very good penetration of our top 100 clients, much less-good penetration of the next 100, which is we were too concentrated. Too concentrated in terms of credit exposures but too concentrated in terms of income as well. So we said that, the next 100, they're not new clients. And they're on the books today, but we've seen substantial growth in that group of next 100 clients, so we'd maintain the top 100 at the same time. But he had a second initiative around what he called the new 90. So these are 90 OECD customers with whom we had no banking relationship at all. I think some of the biggest names in technology or some of the biggest cross-border trading companies, some financial institutions where we had no relationship at all. And we looked at the companies' profile and the areas in which they operated and looked at what we had to offer and said these companies should be banking with Standard Chartered. And we onboarded every 1 of those 90 clients and most of the next 90 and most of the next 90 after that to -- these are onboarded, and they're producing profits at a faster rate than we thought. So absolutely a source of key growth for us is new clients, in particular coming out of the developed markets but also new clients coming out of the emerging markets who have increasing network operations, all right? These are keys. And that's what's driving that financial institution growth that I mentioned in the context of our network side. It's what driving -- it's what's driving the OECD client growth. It's both the deepening but also new clients.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: And also, so just to add to that. In the commercial business, we've added 6,000 -- just over 6,000 new clients there as well. So compared with 3 years ago, where I think we were very much sticking with the clients who were sort of tried and tested, actually we said, no, we should push the boundaries out. There are a lot of new clients who have got international service needs that fit very much what we do, many of whom don't actually know what we offer. And now really actually focusing upon that, [evidently] bringing in quite a lot more clients.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: [Over here].</p><p>IAN DAVID GORDON, HEAD OF BANKS RESEARCH, INVESTEC BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ian Gordon, Investec. Can I have two, please? Bill, on Slide 26, I was surprised when you expressed mild disappointment at the 0 percent growth in non-Priority revenues. Given that these are currently loss-making, wouldn't minus 10 be a better number? Or do you regard that as inconsistent with your growth aspirations within Priority? And then secondly, just a point of clarification on your revenue target. Have you dropped the words over time? Or is your 5% to 7% unrealistic for 2019, given the Q1-on-Q1 headwinds you called out impacting the Q1 2018 is a tough comp?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: So on the personal growth. The personal business serves a number of purposes for us. One is it's a feeder for our Priority and eventually Private Banking customers, so we want to have a big catchment area in order to drive that to that Premium and Priority income. Second, it's a big absorber of fixed costs. So yes, sure, we could just throw clients out left, right and center, but the fixed costs wouldn't come out at the same pace without structural change. So just taking a business that's subscale and assuming that you can attrite your way down to decent profitability by grinding the income number lower, it's not a good strategy. With the benefit of hindsight, that's what we did for 10 years, which is why the profitability of our retail business went from okay to poor, to bad, to really unacceptable over a period. So we have turned that around, but we know -- we're not going to get the real growth in the personal segment the old-fashioned way. So the idea of just putting us, feet on the street or using third-party sales agents to offer a product which is not particularly differentiated to the mass market and narrow the list of things that they really want is a -- is not a strategy that we think we can win. So we have to take some different approaches. And those different approaches would involve different customer propositions, different types of partnership, which will allow us to access different customers through different channels, obviously using analytics to refine the offering. But the use of analytics, the use of digital marketing and things of that nature, we think we're very good at that. We have a long way to go. We're not best in class, for sure, and certainly not at the mass market. And so we will continue to develop those capabilities, but we're not -- in the mass market we're not going to be differentiated in a substantial way all by ourselves, in some of these markets. And so we'll look at ways that we can partner with other people to achieve what we would be more challenged to achieve ourselves. And then against that backdrop, 0 percent growth isn't so good.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: And to your second question. I'm sure somewhere in the glossary it says, on average over a 3-year period but not necessarily daily.</p><p>IAN DAVID GORDON: [So you're off to a good start] then.</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: Have we mentioned that we've had a solid start to the year, Andy?</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: We have, yes.</p><p>MANUS JAMES MACGREGOR COSTELLO, FOUNDING PARTNER AND MANAGING PARTNER, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: It's Manus Costello from Autonomous. Can I just follow up on that point on retail? Because last year, at your seminar, you showed us that 1/3 of the retail business was loss-making. And I'm a bit surprised you haven't come out with a more aggressive strategy to deal with the retail business, particularly in some of those markets where your share is not big and you're facing digital challenges. So why didn't you take a more aggressive approach? And can you elaborate a bit more on a comment you made? It makes it sound as if you're going to get -- enter into some JVs or you might even consider merging those, some of those local businesses, with partners and taking minority stakes. What are you actually talking about there?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: So the -- I'm disappointed that you're disappointed about our plans. I think we've been very clear that in those -- very clear about our intent, which is in those 21 markets where we're a local -- we're an international bank with trusted local operations, that we intend to get those businesses to a level of profitability that's accretive to the group and accretive against our 10% overall return target. And the way to get there in each market will be different. We can obviously spend a lot of time going through market by market and giving a bit more detail. We picked four which were indicative of the sorts of things that we would do. One of the -- so we have many levers to pull in terms of the business as usual. We have significantly digitized our operations. So in India, for example, where we have a digital banking suite that we offer to existing and new clients, that is 0 human touch. We're close to the point of getting 80% of applicants through on a no-human-touch basis, which is an industry benchmark for more or less the best you're going to do, at least with the current technology. We've reduced the turnaround time from days to seconds. And we've reduced the costs of acquiring new clients from about $70 a client to about $7 a client, obviously enabled by the Aadhaar system which is the national identification system in India, biometrically verified, which is where we have that -- which we have in a number of our markets now. Nigeria, interestingly, was one of the first to have a national biometrically verified identification system. These, the opportunities for a step change in terms of productivity, are real, but of course, the market has access to that as well. So we have to find some differentiated ways to get to scale.</p><p>We have seen in markets like Singapore, where we've turned around and are trading market share in the mass market segment into the early signs of some good growth with very targeted product offerings, there are business-as-usual approaches to improve the profitability of these businesses. And we'll be rolling those out as well. And we already have in Korea, in Indonesia, India, U.A.E., et cetera, but it may not be enough. And it may be right for us to either leverage third-party distribution channels, so effectively putting our products on to third-party platforms for distribution much more broadly than we can today, leveraging at the same time the data and the associated analytics that come from those third-party platforms. Just having a new sales channel isn't particularly helpful. Having a new sales channel where we're leveraging our partners' access to customers' data and associated analytics, combining with our data, analytics, risk management competence, risk management experience, is an exciting proposition. Why haven't we done this yet? Why haven't we announced 5 joint ventures across 5 markets? Because we had to get our own house in order before we could be confident that we are the desirable partner that we need to be in order to generate really good, profitable, sustainable business. But having invested enormously in our foundations, digital and otherwise, over the past 3 years, we're ready to do that. And we've started to roll these things out. Some of them, we've been public about: partnerships with Ant; the consortium that we set up in Trade Finance; the digital bank that we've rolled out in Africa, which is not with partners, although we've got many partners that are providing products and services into the platform that we built in C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire and Kenya, et cetera, and Kenya when we launched.</p><p>So we've got early stages of a good track record. We put it out there really to make 2 points very clearly. One is -- Andy and I stood up in front of our group internally last year and said that we're not going to accept plans for this next round of our corporate planning period that don't have every business and every country generating positive EVA. So generating operating profits, less costs of capital, that were positive. We had many that were not positive EVA. We have accepted no plans from our own internal process that don't generate positive EVA by 2021. And it doesn't mean that we're going to succeed in every one of those plans. And every one of those plans is credible. And it's amazing how sharply the mind focuses when the instruction to the team is, you have no choice but to come up with a plan that gets us to positive EVA. And the alternatives are less attractive. So we're committed to doing this. We'll continue to report out on this. We've got a number levers that we can pull, organic and through partnership, and we intend to do that. And I hope, as we call out our progress, that we can deal with your disappointment.</p><p>MANUS JAMES MACGREGOR COSTELLO: [What] markets, [the] retail markets [have you exited]?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: We've exited 8 retail markets in the past 4 years...</p><p>MANUS JAMES MACGREGOR COSTELLO: [Why those]?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: No. We -- I said we look at every one of our businesses and ask the question, one, do we have a good route to adequate profitability. And two -- and if the answer to that is no, then two is, is it important for some other part of our business and typically important to our network business somehow. And on the back of that, we decided to exit markets like Thailand, the Philippines, other markets in -- or other business lines and times went by. There are no incremental markets that satisfy that screening that we're going through right now. And does that mean that, that will be the case for the next 3 years? Of course, not. As we've continued to review operations, progress against the plans that we've got, reassessments of the strategic importance of different markets, but for the most part, you're talking about smaller markets. And the smaller markets, [turns out, at least], these smaller markets are not our problem.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Yes. I'll just add a couple of things. There is no inherent rejection of withdrawing from smaller markets, but the facts are, if you took the 20 lowest-income markets that we had in 2015 and added them up, they were loss-making. If today you take 20 smaller markets, they are profitable. So there has actually been quite a lot going on behind the scenes. This is not a retail-only client. It is a small country client. Secondly, roughly the amount of income that we generate in those 20 smallest markets and record in-country, for every dollar recorded in-country, there is another dollar that is contributed elsewhere in the network. So it's the point about what is unique about the franchise. Could we chop the smaller markets? We should not underestimate the ability of them and demonstrable ability to actually contribute elsewhere. I think the retail bit, to the extent they're the ones that are a bit marginal, what we're doing in places like C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire where we actually say, is there a lower-cost digital approach to market? Let us give that a go and see whether actually that, on top of the physical presence, the two together, could actually change the one or two that are more marginal. Our sense is we should do that first and see where we get to with that.</p><p>FAHED IRSHAD KUNWAR, RESEARCH ANALYST, REDBURN (EUROPE) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Fahed Kunwar from Redburn. Just I had a question on your targets overall and the kind of reliance on revenue growth. Obviously, I think you talked about hitting 50 of your targets before, but the one that was missed was the RoE ultimately. And that was predicated on revenue growth. It looks like, if you look at that period, the macro kind of tailwinds from the U.S. and China [estimates] were better than they are now. So I guess, what's different this time? Why do you believe in those revenue growth targets this time versus last time when it seems like we fell a bit shy on the returns? Is there more of self-help here, the kind of capital? Is that the main point? And just to get some color on that question because I think that probably is the biggest reason why the shares probably are down right now because there is another revenue growth target plan. And just thinking about the revenue as well, the 6% constant currency Q-on-Q. Year-on-year, your Q4 was very strong versus peers. Was anything funny in that, that kind of won't roll forward? Or was that just outperformance and market share gains for the fourth quarter? And then the last question I had was on the core Tier 1. If you do 3% or 4% RWA growth over the 2%, should we be thinking that will then generate revenues greater than 7%? Or could we be in a situation where you're doing 3% RWA growth and the revenue is kind of 6% to 7%, so within the range?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: So maybe a bit on revenue growth. So when we reflect back to the scenario that we laid out in 2015, we imagined and we were quite clear about the economic environment that we imagined, and we got a few things wrong. We didn't imagine that China was going to devalue about 11 seconds after we made our presentation, but it did. And that took a lot of the wind out of the sails, in particular of our Wealth Management business at that time. We imagined a much more robust level of global economic growth, reminding ourselves we were viewed as being too cautious at the time, but it turned out we weren't cautious enough in terms of our assessment. GDP growth was about half over the first 18 months of what we had indicated in our presentation. And as a result, interest rate increases have been even slower. And also there's further reasons for that, which inflation has been more subdued than we imagined at that point. So we got a few things wrong in terms of the economic forecast, acknowledging that we weren't trying to -- or we didn't expect it to be perfect in that regard. That's a big explanation for the relatively subdued growth in the early period.</p><p>In the later period, we have hit the growth targets that -- as the economy got back on track, as China recovered, et cetera. Second thing is that we probably underestimated the amount of derisking we were going to need to do. And as Andy showed in his income walk forward, in 2015 and '16, we had a really dramatic decrease in RWAs, a decrease in income. And most of that came from our own derisking -- or not just derisking but also recognizing that we had big chunks of our capital that we're deploying to value-destroying things that weren't necessarily risky but just weren't going to generate a good return. So we probably underestimated a bit how much we needed to retrench before we could grow. You can't normalize everything away and say, hey, if you just take all the bad stuff out, we nailed it, but we can say that those were a couple things that we gave very transparent estimates of the downside. It turned out the we were wrong on each front. We have subsequently as we've sort of overcome those initial gaps, some external, some internal, we have generated that growth. We particularly generated that growth in these areas that we called out from day 1 that we were going to focus on. When I stood up here and talked about the focus on network income 3 years ago, the typical response was, one, we don't know what that is. And two, there's no evidence that it generates any value for your bank, so we're going to discount it completely. And you did discount it completely. And what we've subsequently demonstrated and what we've tried to explain today, hopefully, in a more satisfactory way is that it's actually a fantastic business that is growing very fast. Likewise, the focus on the affluent part of our business. So this good stuff that was well less than half of our bank is now well more than half of our bank, is growing at a faster rate, is generating high returns. So we saw no reason and we see no reason not to have the confidence that we can hit the 5% to 7% growth rate when we don't have these balls and chains around us that we had in the early period. And we've evidence that we can actually grow these areas. Now are there more tailwinds -- or more headwinds than tailwinds right now? Yes, possibly. Global economies are slowing. One of the advantages of being a mid-size bank operating in this environment is, if we can leverage this differentiation that we've demonstrated, we can offset a lot of -- not every possible economic headwind. I mean we're not na\u00c3\u00afve, but we can offset a lot of the headwinds that are coming or with -- the reduced tailwinds that are coming. We believe fundamentally that the big tailwind that we've got is that we operate in the most exciting markets in the world that are volatile. They'll go up and down. China will go up and down as well, but we think that structurally this is a growth opportunity for us. Structurally, we're going to acquire a greater share of a rapidly growing market. Are you going to take the quarter-on-quarter comment?</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Yes. I mean nothing that I'd particular call out on the fourth quarter. And I guess the Financial Markets business, maybe unlike some banks, actually had a good quarter. And to be fair, maybe we've underperformed in that area in prior quarters, so that was quite encouraging to see that come through. But no, there's nothing I'd particularly call out. Your other one was on -- I've lost it now -- RWA growth versus income growth. I mean, directionally, we're saying 5% to 7% and 2% RWAs. Think of that sort of relationship as being a broad proxy for what we'll be targeting going forwards.</p><p>ANDREW PHILIP COOMBS, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Andrew Coombs from Citi. If I can have a couple of follow-up questions, please. Firstly, on Slide 37 and going back to the previous question, you're talking about 2% RWA growth per annum, 4% asset growth per annum, 5% to 7% revenue growth per annum. You've been at lengths to talk about network income affluent customers, but you also do flag you're still assuming some benefit from higher rates. So how much of a tailwind is still to flow through from the previous hikes? Plus, I think going forward, you said minimal future hikes, but could you expand exactly what's in your assumptions there? So that would be my first question. And then Slide 39, the RWA growth, the 2%, you've identified $22 billion cumulative RWA reduction plans within that which -- divestments, model changes. Can you just give us an idea of the timing of when that $22 billion drops out? Because it does have implications to your capital ratio and therefore the timing of any buybacks you can do.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: So clearly, interest rate rises do take a while to actually work through fully into the system. And we've got the number that have happened over the last 6 or so months that will flow through. We've reassessed the rough estimate of what a 50 basis point increase globally would be. Previously, we've had that at about $300 million, now about $200 million, but as you rise up the interest rate curve, then you would sort of expect that. I guess, again if you look at the height of the cons very carefully, you would probably say we have taken the roll forward and what's already out there, plus, I don't -- 25, 30 bps of assumed further increase. But hopefully, we've not sort of overrated that one. On the RWAs, I mean, part of that is putting the noncore activity sort to one side. And therefore, that is sort of mathematical as of sort of today, albeit obviously, that's still within the published numbers. And the rest of the RWA reduction, I think the ship leasing is something we will roll off over a couple-of-year period. It's not something we're going to go and rush to do and set a fire sale on. And the Principal Finance business, again over the next 18 months, to the extent we have retained a small interest in that over that period of time, one would expect to see that progressively roll off the books.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER ROBERT MANNERS, CO-HEAD OF EUROPEAN BANKS EQUITY RESEARCH, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Chris Manners from Barclays. 2 questions, if I may. The first one was just on the dividend. So it was quite eye-catching to see you're going to double the dividend to roughly about $0.42 and by 2021 if all goes to plan. Can we ask -- and can I ask you a little bit about the sort of pathway of the dividend? Are you thinking about a payout ratio? Are you thinking about a certain capital level and then you top it up? Just because most of the other U.K. banks are announcing they'll do a progressive dividend and everything else gets supplemented with specials and buybacks. So that will be the first one. And the second question is on the 2021 RoTE target. I assume that's just a stat RoTE target rather than an underlying. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but when we look at your incentivization and sort of comp and payouts and things like that, is that actually linked to beating 10% RoTE? Or could you explain a little bit about that? I couldn't -- didn't have time to see it in the Annual Report this morning.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Okay, so let's just take those in order. So on the dividends: We have not tied this to a payout ratio per se, just reflecting the fact that the progression on profit will move around a little bit and being too tight. Our arithmetic, we think, is a little bit tight. What we are saying is that, as the profitability of the business improves, we will definitely see the dividend increasing with that and observing there is the potential for us to double over that period of time, i.e. we are very prepared to be returning money to shareholders. On the RoTE, we will continue to calculate that the way that we have done in the past. And you will see, when you get far enough into the Annual Report, that certain members of the senior team, some of whom are standing here, have an incentive around an 8% to 11% range over that 3-year period.</p><p>GUY STEBBINGS, ANALYST OF BANKS, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Guy Stebbings from Exane BNP Paribas. 2 questions. The first was on deposit costs, which grew quite a bit in 2018. I'm just interested in terms of the phasing of that and how much came through in the fourth quarter. And perhaps you can confirm what the Q4 NIM was versus the 1.58% for the full year. And the question was on regulatory costs, which you've called out as coming down in the future. That proved incredibly stubborn in the past. And there's always new initiatives that come along that surprise us. Are there specific chunky items you can point to that are likely to come out and gives you considerable confidence around the trajectory there?</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Yes. So on deposit costs. The middle of the year, we saw a little bit of switching out to term deposits from current accounts. By the end of the year, actually that had normalized again. So we saw sort of a slight peak of that in the middle of the year. The fourth quarter NIM was within 1 basis point of the year average NIM, so there was not a lot of difference there. Regulatory costs, you're absolutely right. They seem to have been nudging up bit by bit by bit. I think within the regulatory costs we've got compliance costs. We've got regulatory programs, and some of those programs are now basically running their sort of costs. So those, we can see coming off, hopefully. With the U.S. investigations and so on nearing a conclusion, then hopefully, a little bit of that will come out as well. So that's why we're a little bit more optimistic that we might actually be seeing the peak of the hump for a period of time, hopefully.</p><p>BENJAMIN TOMS, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ben Toms from RBC. Can you talk a little bit about the potential for a fintech disruption in Hong Kong and a little bit more detail about what Standard Chartered is doing in order to protect itself against the disruption?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: Yes. Well, we, I commented on the virtual bank license process. So there are no stand-alone digital banks in Hong Kong today. The HKMA has put an invitation for banks to apply or for companies to apply to get a new virtual bank license. A lot of criteria, but the key one is you can't have any branches. So these need to be stand-alone, separate entities that are purely digital. And we don't know who else has applied, but we can speculate. And we don't know where these companies are in their approval process, although they've suggested that the first successful applicants will be announced in the not-too-distant future, next few months. So we've worked very hard on this. We're building this bank in anticipation of getting regulatory approval. We will use the capabilities that we're building in our main business in any case. I guess that other people are taking different kinds of approaches. Some will focus on subsegments of the market, credit cards specifically, perhaps Wealth Management products in other cases. Some will focus on extensions to e-commerce platforms, where they will look primarily to finance goods that are otherwise purchased through those platforms. And we will see what creativity the market comes up with and how the HKMA decides to direct that. And we feel very good about the position that we've got with and in particular our affluent client segment, which is the driving force of our earnings and also earnings growth in Hong Kong. We think that's relatively well protected with the range of product offerings that we've got, the client relationships that we've got, the level of customer service. And we'll continue to augment that with the digital investments that we're making, some of which we will learn from and develop in the context of our virtual bank that we are developing separately. So is there possibility for some disruption in the mass part of the market? Yes, absolutely. That's -- we intend to be a disruptor in that regard. So I think we will see changes, for sure, but we -- for our core franchise, we feel pretty well protected because of the quality of the product that we are delivering today and intend to deliver in the future and because it's not obvious that, that's going to be in the sweet spot of a branchless digital bank [op at issue].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: We've got a question on the webcast and [we'll take it here].</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: A question from [a participant] on the web. Can you define what size of market opportunities that has in Retail Banking [via] digital in markets such as India, Africa or Greater Bay Area?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: Yes, I mean, Greater Bay Area, to which we didn't talk about in any details, is one extremely exciting incremental development. We know that the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, the Mayor and party secretaries of Guangdong province and Macau got together last week. They offered some policy guidelines on what this integrated market area will look like. We're talking about close to 100 million people growing much more rapidly than the average in China, with embedded free enterprise zones and the like, with the intention to effectively, one way or the other, reduce the barriers of people capital, intellectual property between Hong Kong, Macau and the rest of the Greater Bay Area in Mainland China. We're extremely well positioned for this. I mean our Hong Kong business, together with the very substantial business that we have both in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as well as several of the others smaller -- I say, smaller cities in the Greater Bay Area. We've got new cities like [Namsa] which don't exist today, which are going to house 10 million people in the next 5 years. So just to put a little bit of context into that. We're extremely well placed to provide banking services and leverage the core strength that we've got in both sides of the border. Is that a digital opportunity per se? Yes, sure, absolutely, but it's a lot more than digital, I think, from that perspective. The size of the opportunity in India and Indonesia, other markets, maybe you only have to look at the profitability of the local banks that have acquired scale. The HDFCs, the ICICIs, Axis Bank, [CS Bank], Mandiri, et cetera are very high-returning banks. They've got market shares that are above 10%, in some cases substantially above 10%. That's the wallet that we can go after. Now are we going to displace ICICI in India? Of course, not. And they've got their own offerings, and they've got something like 4,000 branches that are still relevant for big parts of that operation. But can we have a targeted offering that's zeroing in on 50 million or 100 million Indians that will be in the sweet spot of what we can develop, ideally in partnership with others, so that we've got a differentiated proposition from the outset? Yes, absolutely.</p><p>ALICE MARY TIMPERLEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Alice Timperley from Morgan Stanley. If we come back to Slide 29, where you call out the 4 key markets and the 150 bps RoTE benefit, could you perhaps just give us a bit more detail on the contribution of each of these markets more specifically? And then secondly, on asset quality, the credit grade 12 balances seem to have ticked up quarter-on-quarter. They were at $1.4 billion in Q4 versus $900 million in Q3. Is there anything to call out there?</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: So we're not going to give a lot more detail on the 4 countries. You can see from our country reporting the magnitude of the challenge in terms of the aggregate returns from each of these markets. And I've tried to be specific that our network income from these markets and the network -- the returns on network income are broadly similar to our overall CIB network income, which is the network income is higher returning and it's growing quickly in each of these 4 markets. We have a higher proportion of the income in these -- in each of these markets that comes from domestic Corporate Banking, which is ongoing optimization. This has been a big part of what Simon and team have done over the past 3 years and will continue to do. And in each of these cases we've got a retail business that's, on one side or the other, 0 in terms of operating profit, all right, but not by huge amounts, but 0 obviously is a big drag on our overall returns. And the objective in each one of those cases is to have a retail franchise at the end of the day that's generating a cost -- a return above cost of capital.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: And I'll just add. I mean, those 4 markets, 2015, lost $1 billion between them. And they made $400 million between them last year. They're not yet where we need them to be, but definitely direction of travel is good. Your CG 12 question, no, there's nothing particular I'd call out in that. It was slightly higher in the fourth quarter, but if you take the year as a whole, it was pretty much flat. So it just moves around.</p><p>EDWARD HUGO ANSON FIRTH, ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Ed Firth from KBW. First, just to clarify your answer to Chris' question. So the 10% is an underlying RoTE. Is that right? It's not an all-in RoTE. It's the first...</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: [Right].</p><p>EDWARD HUGO ANSON FIRTH: Great. And secondly, if we do see revenue growth, say, come in, I don't know, at around 3% a year or something like that or like half what you're expecting, can you still make the 10%?</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: Well, it will depend upon some factors externally, impairment, et cetera. If that is benign, then that will offset that in part. And as I said earlier, we can pull levers on the investment or the cost front. It's not our preference to do it. We can do that. And we can look at capital returns. So I think there's a variety of other things. I mean, clearly, the lower we go, the more tricky it makes it, but if we can get somewhere around the bottom of the range, I think we can achieve it. If we go below that, then we'll have to look at more actions on the cost front.</p><p>EDWARD HUGO ANSON FIRTH: But is there sort of a level we should be thinking of or the sense that you're not going to achieve it? I mean clearly, I guess, if revenues fall, then you're not going to achieve the 10%.</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: No. I would focus upon the 5% to 7% as what we are determined to achieve.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Is there anyone who hasn't had a question who would like to before I hand out seconds? All right, there you go [right here].</p><p>THOMAS ANDREW JOHN RAYNER: Yes, sorry, being greedy. Tom again. Can I just ask you about how you see the phasing of your move from 5% to 10%? Because some of those items look like they should come through as profits recover. Others look like they might be a bit backloaded. Some of the RWA optimization maybe is backloaded. I mean, what sort of interim targets have you set yourselves to try and gauge whether you're actually on track to hitting your 10% by the time that you've set? Can you add some color around that first, please?</p><p>ANDREW NIGEL HALFORD: If you look at the walk, things that will be sort of choppy in terms of timing, bank levy will be back-end loaded. Evidentially, it's 2021. And the timing of capital returns will be dependent upon sort of other factors, so that is one which will not have necessarily a sort of straight-line continuum on it. The business exits, obviously that depends a little bit in terms of how fast they go but probably slightly more back-end loaded. And on the other ones, costs will be progressive. Income, okay, it's not going to be exactly linear, but I think we should see that over a period of time. So we haven't got a specific gradient sort of in mind, but we are determined to get to the 10% by the end of the period.</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: Just a few of the other -- of the metrics that you're asking about are some of the things that we called out in terms of our areas of focus. In our CIB business, we need more clients. And it's been a good area of growth for us. We've got continued, robust aspirations for adding clients that are intending to use and in fact do use our network. We have a -- client deepening metrics that we're looking at, so this progression from 1x to 16x profitability as we get clients with more products and more markets. So we've got a very steady stream of and consistent stream of metrics around clients. On the retail side of the business, the -- one of the big areas of focus for us has been customer satisfaction. Our customer service and customer satisfaction were somewhere between okay and mediocre 3 years ago. We've invested heavily, and it's obviously shown up on the expense line, but invested heavily in customer satisfaction. And we believe that that's a leading indicator of profitability. It has been so far. So the big increase in our profits in Singapore and Taiwan, for example, coincided and immediately followed a major focus on improved customer satisfaction measured by Net Promoter Score, and other things to measure our desirability to customers. So we have a whole -- we have a scorecard, as you'd imagine. That scorecard has a couple of dozen high-level things and many dozens, as you go through business by business, of key metrics that we're looking at that, for the most part, are leading indicators. Some are lagging. I mean the financial results obviously are a lagging indicator. It's on the scorecard, you'll be happy to know, but the focus on improving our business is very granular. And we're tracking literally thousands of things down through the organization very, very rigorously. Andy and team have put in a system of both MIS but also regular reviews that are allowing us to track the leading indicators as well as lagging indicators. And to the extent that some of those key indicators go off track, then we'll course adjust, either to deploy different tactics or we'll reallocate capital in a different way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Okay, thank you. Okay...</p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS WINTERS: So I think we've just about exhausted everybody.</p><p>I'd say thanks again for making this investment in us and your time and your attention, some great questions and plenty for us to keep on working on.</p><p>As I think Andy and I have both said, we've put out a framework today, didn't expect to answer every question you've got but do expect to come back to what we said today and explain as we move our way from 5% to 10%-plus in return on tangible equity, how we are tracking against the targets we have, the progress that we're making. And we'll continue to try to be as transparent as we can.</p><p>So thanks.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

A year ago, you may remember we did our results during the Beast from the East. And this year, we've got predicted to be the hottest day on record in February. And hopefully, that's reflective, in our view, of our outlook.</p><p>In terms of the agenda, I'll run through some of the highlights and then pass over to Dan, and he will go through the financial and operating review, and then I'll come back and go through the strategy and the outlook.</p><p>So straight into the highlights.</p><p>In 2018, we've had a strong operational and financial performance, which is very pleasing as it's the first year of our next phase of our strategy, Quickening the Pace 2. I'll go through that in a little bit more detail later. But in terms of the numbers, very pleased with our like-for-like revenues, up 9%. Our buyers, which is one of the key metrics we focus on internally, up 10%, delivering an EPS of 17.5p, which has allowed us to increase the dividend by 10% up to 11p.</p><p>It's also been a busy year in terms of building out the portfolio. We've had 19 new launches. We've made 6 acquisitions, and 3 of those have been increasing our exposure to existing investments in buying more of those businesses. And with that, I'll hand over to Dan.</p><p>DANIEL P. O'BRIEN, GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR, MEMBER OF EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TARSUS GROUP PLC: Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everybody. I want to spend about 15 minutes running through the financial and operational review, and the handout you've got sets out definitions, some terms we're using this morning. And just to note that the presentation and an audio recording of this meeting will be available on our website later.</p><p>As Doug said, 2018 was another successful year for us and a very busy year. And so we'll just crack on and look at the numbers.</p><p>So starting with revenues. Normal impact here of biennials, acquisitions and foreign currency. But as always, it's the underlying revenue performance that's important, and we're really pleased with the like-for-like growth of 9%.</p><p>The trend we're seeing in our revenues is reflected in our profits, which had also grown well, and the overall profit margin staying pretty consistent, which is what we expected.</p><p>The headline tax rate of 16%, actually at the low end of our expectations, and that was due to some deferred tax losses being utilized in the year. That it's relatively low rate reflects the geographical spread of our business.</p><p>We have a strong EPS performance. Now that's after reflecting the impact of the equity raise in September last year. The EPS grew 17.5p, that is 17.5p a share, up 15% from 2016. And this has allowed us to continue our dividend growth with a 10% increase this year to 11p a share, the eighth consecutive year of dividend increase and subject to maintaining sensible levels of cover, which for us is around 2x average overall 2-year cycle. We look to maintain this progressive dividend policy.</p><p>And our financial position remains very strong. We ended the year with net debt of GBP 79 million, and that equates to gearing of 2x net debt-to-EBITDA measured over a 24-month rolling cycle. And that's back in line with our medium-term target range for gearing.</p><p>So moving on to revenues.</p><p>Last year, we had GBP 118 million of revenue. In terms of biennial events, the even years, it's a quieter year, there's GBP 26 million difference in a smaller biennial year. In 2017, we had 6 biennial events; this year, just 3: Labelexpo series in Americas, in India as well as MEBA in Dubai.</p><p>In terms of acquisitions, this year relatively small impacts relate principally to AMB and E.J. Krause, which were consolidated from the point of acquisition onwards.</p><p>You can see here of the overall impacts on revenues from foreign currency changes. These are negative GBP 3 million. The main driver here is the Turkish lira, which devalued significantly across the year. The U.S. dollar was also a small net negative against previous years. However, due to the phasing of profits across the year, the impacts on profits is less significant. It's slightly negative, but it's not material overall to the results of the group. We then have that underlying revenue growth, which is carried on our strong track record, up 9% on a like-for-like basis at constant currencies. And we finished the year with revenues of just under GBP 100 million.</p><p>This slide shows the geographical shape of our business, which we've driven through our strategy. The top pie chart on the left shows that we're now focused largely on the U.S. and Asia. We've got 2/3 of our revenues coming from the world's largest event markets, the Americas and China. The bottom pie chart shows our currency exposure remain principally exposed to the U.S. dollar with 2/3 of our 2019 revenues expected to be U.S. dollar denominated.</p><p>The map really highlights where we're deploying our resource. It's into those high-growth geographies in the Americas and Asia. And it's also an obvious point, but it's one still worth mentioning that this slide really does illustrate that we have very little exposure to Brexit.</p><p>So let's turn now to the results by geography, and we'll start with the Americas.</p><p>The biennial event here is Labelexpo Americas, the event held in Chicago. We've seen some impressive growth across the Americas segment, and that includes both the U.S. and Mexico. Some of this growth comes from acquisitions, but across the division, we had 9% like-for-like growth in the Americas. Historically, this division has been very profitable and has had good margins, and we've maintained those margins this year. And this year's pleasing as Connect has grown well, and their revenue comes in at slightly lower margins. We've also been adding resource into the U.S. team to help drive growth. So a good performance on profits from the Americas.</p><p>Just now looking at the operations in a bit more detail.</p><p>The Medical business, growth there continues overall with particularly strong performances from our preventative medicine business, which closed the year with a record show in our December event in Las Vegas, and also in our cardiovascular business. The dermatology and PAINWeek business units had a slower time in 2018. That's driven by the drug pipeline in those areas being a bit weaker. But both have improved outlook for 2019. So we're seeing the benefit of having a diversified portfolio across 4 clinical areas in Medical division, and the outlook for this unit as a whole is very -- for '19 is very good.</p><p>In OFFPRICE, our discount clothing show, it had a steady performance in what is a really tough retail environment.</p><p>In Mexico, we purchased the remaining 50% of the E.J. Krause business. We now own 100% of that. We also added Expo Restaurantes to the portfolio during the year. In trading terms, the portfolio in Mexico performed very well across the board, and the integration has gone very smoothly. We believe that Mexico has great potential and is an interesting opportunity for us, and Doug will go into that in a bit more detail later.</p><p>Our Connect business had a strong year with good growth being driven by launches, 6 new events this year, making 11 since we acquired the business. We also acquired the eTourism Summit, which performed in line with our expectations.</p><p>Finally, for the Americas, the labels event in Chicago was a fantastic event, grew really well and had a very impressive rebook rate at 83%.</p><p>Moving now to Asia. This includes the results from Southeast Asia and China. And the biennial events here are the Labelexpo event in India and also, for the first time, in Bangkok.</p><p>Revenues here have grown well across the division, like-for-like growth at 14%. And the profits here also have been strong. And again, that's pleasing because we've put resource into this division in order to drive our replication program.</p><p>Overall, China had a very good year with strong growth, as I mentioned. China now forms a more significant part of the group. Standout performances were our Hometex, our -- the Hometex store show, and also Intex, which is our joint venture with the Chinese government. Both had very strong performances, showing good like-for-like growth.</p><p>Southeast Asia also performed well with 8 launches across the region, helping to drive strong growth. The highlight of the year for that region, though, was really Bangkok, which was an outstanding launch, I mean, the best launch in Tarsus' history.</p><p>Finishing now with the results by division, going through EMEA.</p><p>The results this year are smaller without the large biennials coming through which just take place in the odd years. The revenues in this division have been hit hard by currency changes, and also the underlying revenues were down 6% on a like-for-like basis. And in terms of the profits, the division made its full profit for the year, and that decrease reflects the revenue performance and the gearing coming through.</p><p>In terms of the operations, trading in Dubai were generally solid with good performances from GESS and the smaller aerospace events. MEBA's performance was impacted by lower spending in the region on private jets, notably from Saudi customers. In Turkey, we had similar patterns to last year with the larger shows performing well. But overall, Turkish revenues were down 8% on a like-for-like basis on constant currencies. But the main story in Turkey was a very weak Turkish lira, which is down over 40% for the year. But this really demonstrates the benefit of having a diversified portfolio for the whole of Tarsus in that despite tricky conditions in Turkey, this didn't really have a material impact on the group as a whole.</p><p>So finishing off with a couple of slides on net debt.</p><p>We started the year with GBP 85 million of net debt, and we raised GBP 24 million with a share placing in September. We got the normal outflows in respect to dividends, interest and tax as well as the cash impact of exceptional items. We also have the impact of acquisitions and deferred income with payments for a total of GBP 23 million, the largest items here being the acquisitions of the 25% shares in AMB and SIUF as well as buying the remainder of Krause. We then have that very strong cash coming in from operations of GBP 30 million. And a really pleasing feature of that is the contribution we got from our joint venture companies where cash received was ahead of profits. And so we finished the end of 2018 with net debt of GBP 79 million.</p><p>Cash and net debt was in line with where we expected to be. Our gearing finished the year at 2x net debt-to-EBITDA, and this is in line with our target range of 1.5 to 2x. And that continues to be our medium-term target range for the group's gearing.</p><p>Finally, just a quick word on our bank facilities.</p><p>We increased our total facilities in December up to GBP 150 million. This comprises GBP 120 million RCF with a club of 4 banks: HSBC, and Bank of Ireland, who we've banked with for a number of years, now joined by NatWest and Citibank. We've also made our first entry into the bond markets with a GBP 30 million, 7-year, fixed interest rate sterling bond with (inaudible). This is the first-class panel of banks and provides a great platform to help with any further increases in debt capacity should we need it. The terms on our facilities are broadly similar to previous bank deals other than we now have a slightly higher gearing covenant of 3.25x. And whilst I said our medium-term target remains unchanged, this high gearing covenant does give us a little bit more flexibility in capacity in the short term. So overall, we're really pleased with these facilities in that they provide a great platform for supporting our Quickening the Pace 2 strategy.</p><p>So to conclude, a very good set of results that we're pleased with, and the results demonstrate the success of our Quickening the Pace strategy and as evidenced by that sustained dividend growth. That means we're well placed to continue our growth, and Doug will tell us more about that now.</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Thanks, Dan.</p><p>So a year ago, we announced the next phase of the strategy, Quickening the Pace 2. As we said at the time, this was evolutionary rather than revolutionary, continuing to focus on growth and building scale but building scale at the event level. And in terms of growth, continuing to focus on the 3 pillars: driving organic growth from the existing business, carrying on the replication program and, where we found good opportunities, adding to the portfolio by way of bolt-on acquisition.</p><p>So let's just take a look at the performance over the period.</p><p>What you can see in terms of revenue growth is consistent performance over the period right at the top end of our peer group. So that's very pleasing. Just to reiterate what I said in the opening remarks, for us internally, it's really buyer growth that we're excited. This shows the strength of our brands going forward, and 10% is right at the top of our own internal KPI. So very pleased with what the team has achieved in the past year.</p><p>In terms of the replication program, we've continued to find opportunities, and this also drives our acquisition strategy because we're looking for platforms that are going to continue to give us opportunities to launch products. It's not a question of just buying to increase earnings per share, it's buying where we can add value. And we continue to see opportunities within the portfolio today to launch more products. And in 2019, and we're projecting another 12 launches. So that's very encouraging.</p><p>In terms of acquisitions activity, 6 is higher than we would normally do. Three of those, as I said earlier, we're increasing our shareholdings in existing investments. But really since Informa bought UBM a year ago or announced the acquisition a year ago, we've seen the market stimulated. And I think in over 10 years, I've never seen an acquisition pipeline that we've got today as strong. So the market for the type of acquisitions that we like in terms of smaller, medium size is very strong at the moment.</p><p>So in terms of looking at the shape of the portfolio and how it's changed, I think this slide really demonstrates the active portfolio management. We bought, we've launched, we've closed, we've sold. And what's really, really encouraging for us in terms of actually demonstrating the Tarsus culture, it's entrepreneurial, it's fast moving. If it doesn't work, we move on. If it does work, we put in more resource.</p><p>And in terms of the launches and the closures, they don't quite correlate because some of the closures are from existing products before the launches. So of those 70 products that we've launched, today 70% of those are still running, so that's very encouraging, against an internal target of after 3 years of 50%.</p><p>So in terms of what this mean, a year ago I said 2017 was the inflection point. It's where we moved from investment into actually generating returns. And I'm very pleased that that's come through strongly in 2018, where nearly 7% of our revenues are being generated from these launches. 2018 is obviously the slightly smaller year, but it's still very impressive and it's contributing a sensible amount of profit at GBP 1.5 million. The Labelexpo launch in Bangkok was a major contributor to that. We're very pleased with that, one of the best launches we've done in 20 years. That event is every 2 years. It doesn't repeat in 2019. So in terms of what the schedule would look like in a year's time, I would say it probably is sort of flatter and then in '20 stepping up again as the biennials kick back in and the growth continues through into '20. So very pleasing that it's now a material part of the business financially.</p><p>In terms of the KPIs, there is nothing new here. It's still the same 3 KPIs. In terms of revenues, it's 9%; buyers, 10%, as we've said in 2018; and in earnings per share, it's actually 8%, and there's a slight adjustment there on a like-for-like basis because we have Plastimagen in Mexico, which only takes place every 18 months and actually did not take place in 2018. So very pleased that actually, we met all of our targets in '18.</p><p>In terms of looking at the business going forward, we've previously spoken about the growth drivers, and we're focused on 3: Shenzhen, Connect, labels and aerospace. And I'll go through each of those in turn now.</p><p>In terms of Shenzhen, this is going to be driven by the building of the new venue. We currently are the largest international organizer in Shenzhen, but 4 of our 5 largest shows are wall bound in the existing 100,000-meter venue that's there. The new venue is going to be 5x that size. So 500,000 square meters. The venue is scheduled to open in September of this year. I'm actually out there next week, so I'll see how it's going, but I'm led to believe that might be slightly behind. So for us, because our shows are very, very congregated in the early part of the year, it's likely that we are not going to go move and see the benefit of that space growth until '21.</p><p>In terms of the 3 major products that we have in Shenzhen, Hometex is the largest, and that show takes place next week. It's wall bound, but I'm very pleased that it's going to be up mid-single-digit in terms of revenue growth. So the team have done well to get growth out of that event, and we've got quite a sizable waiting list for when we move to the new venue.</p><p>AAITF is actually taking place as we speak. It is also wall bound in a very competitive market. Again, we're looking to grow that with the move to the venue.</p><p>And then finally, SIUF, our underwear business, continues to grow well, and we bought a majority, which allows us to move our own management in there to actually put in our normal sales and marketing systems, and we're seeing the benefit of that in a very short order with the upcoming April show growing strongly.</p><p>So Connect, a business that we acquired 2 years ago focused on the travel market, predominantly in the U.S. So we're seeing growth being driven really by a good economic situation in America and the investments that were made in hotel stock primarily in 2013 coming through onstream. We've launched a lot in this division, 11 in total. And one of the major new businesses that we launched was in the leisure market and in marketing, and the second edition of those events took place last week, I'm very pleased to see that they actually grew quite strongly from their launch events. And at the same time, we launched our first show into business travel, which, again, went well in its first outing. So we're seeing good growth. We've added a lot to that portfolio in the last 2 years, but we're continuing to see opportunities and we've got 4 new events for this year as well. So we're very pleased with the growth we're seeing coming through from Connect. And it's a classic case study of the type of business that we like. It's a platform where we could add a lot and launch a lot around it.</p><p>Moving on to Labelexpo. It is our oldest brand. It was a brand that we started Tarsus with 20 years ago, and it's coming up for its 40th anniversary. But we're continuing to see very strong growth from the big events, and the big event this year is in Europe, in Brussels, where we're seeing strong revenue growth. That's being driven primarily from the mass market adoption of digital technologies. But we're also seeing the industry continuing to innovate and move into related areas in the printing and packaging sector. And in response to that, the team have come up with a new launch program called brand print, where we're launching in 2020 4 new shows starting off in May of next year in Bangkok. And we're very excited about this opportunity to accelerate our growth from replications.</p><p>Finally, aerospace. We have the big show this year in November in Dubai, and it's very much on track to be the biggest air show in its history. And what we're also seeing is opportunities to add new components to the show. And in particular, we're seeing strong growth from 3 of those: the space sector from Cargo and from GATM, which is all about air traffic control. So the team are continuing to innovate. We're continuing to see good growth. And these are opportunities in the off years to actually run them separately. So when the air show is on, we'll run them concurrently and we'll run them separately in the off years.</p><p>And then, finally, we've added to the portfolio, which is the first time we've done this since we actually bought the Dubai business in 2007, where we bought a business from streamline where the first major show under our ownership comes up next month in Abu Dhabi, where we'll be launching the space event, which is going very strongly.</p><p>So I thought I'll just make a few remarks about Mexico and our major move there in 2018. It was the largest single acquisition that we did in 2018. And I think, again, it's a good case study of how we attack a new market. 4 years ago, we went in, in a 50-50 joint venture on the 2 largest products of E.J. Krause. E.J. Krause is the largest exhibition organizer in Mexico. That went well. And about 18 months ago, we expanded that to be 50% of their total show portfolio. It's gone well. We've got to know the portfolio. We've got to know the market. We've got to know the teams. And we moved that to be 100%. So we are now the largest organizer in Mexico.</p><p>We like Mexico principally because it's highly fragmented. Also, its close links with the U.S. help drive the portfolio that we've got, which is really being driven in 2 areas in terms of the industrial side, and a lot of that is coming from international participation from exhibitors, but also domestic demand, particularly in our foods and beauty products. We were pleased last week to announce to the trade press that actually, on our beauty product, we bought out our minority partner. We did a long-term deal with Expo Guadalajara. And also, we launched a second show, which will take place in November this year in Monterrey, which, again, is just another example of getting in there and adding value and expanding the portfolio.</p><p>So moving on now to outlook.</p><p>2019 has got off to a good start. Our bookings are strong across the portfolio. And as we stand here today, we're not seeing any cyclical economic weakness. In terms of the 3 regions, in terms of our bookings, overall we're up 10%, but it splits 8% coming out of the Americas, 8% in Asia and 12% coming out of EMEA. And that 12% is driven by 2 things: firstly, the strength of the big biennials, Dubai Airshow and Labelexpo; but also a very strong recovery from our Turkish portfolio. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the existing business. We're also seeing continued good opportunities to launch new shows, 12 that are in the pipeline, and also a strong acquisition pipeline.</p><p>So to finish off, I think what we've seen is continued good, consistent, top-of-peer group performance in 2018. It's been a good start to the first year of our Quickening the Pace 2 strategy. Got good, strong forward bookings based broadly across the portfolio. And in that confidence, I think we're signaling that with the 10% increase in the dividend.</p><p>And with that, I'd like to move on to any questions that you may have.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: So the first question, I think Ian was first. Do you want to say who you are and where you're from?</p><p>IAN RICHARD WHITTAKER, HEAD OF EUROPEAN MEDIA RESEARCH, LIBERUM CAPITAL LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sorry folks. That's (inaudible). It's Ian Whittaker from Liberum. Just 2 questions actually. First of all, if you go back to Slide 21 and you look at the sort of buyer growth versus the revenue growth, certainly over the past 4 years, so the 2 are evenly matched, whereas in previous years there was a difference. Quite a simple question. Should we just think moving forward as buyer growth being a proxy for revenue growth? Or are there anything -- any sort of other issues that you could see that could perhaps sort of disturb that relationship? And the second thing is just on the comment at the end about Turkey coming back, sort of having very good start to the year. Like, could you just give us an idea of how much the like-for-like revenue drag for the whole group came from the weakness in Turkey in 2018?</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: I'll let Dan answer the Turkey question. I'll take the buyer one. I mean, I think, as I said, it's really the best indicator of the strength of the brand, and it is a thing that we focus on the most. And I think it is a very good proxy for revenues, but also I think that it's one you've got to be careful about because it's very easy to add revenue into your business and get a big exhibition. But actually, if you dilute the density of the people on the floor, it can have quite a negative impact on how it feels. So it's one thing that we're really, really focused on in terms of making sure that the revenue and the buyers move in step. The worst-case scenario is for your revenues to move ahead of your buyer growth. If your buyers move ahead of revenue, you'll never hear any complaints from your exhibitors. So you want it that way, right.</p><p>DANIEL P. O'BRIEN: In terms of Turkey, I mean, the like-for-like revenue performance was 8% down for the year, and the currency was down 40-odd percent across the year. So combined, over 50% down. In terms of the impacts on the group, marginal, 1%, 2%, that sort of -- that kind of level. So as I mentioned, the group has grown significantly and is doing well and it's kind of grown around that. So it's -- the portfolio effect is really helping us.</p><p>IAN RICHARD WHITTAKER: Okay. Sorry, 2 follow-up questions just on that. 1% to 2%, sorry, is that of like-for-like revenue growth impacts or just a profit growth in general?</p><p>DANIEL P. O'BRIEN: On the revenue.</p><p>IAN RICHARD WHITTAKER: On the revenue, okay. And then, Doug, just in terms of your comments that are saying the worst-case scenario is revenue growth ahead of buyer growth, so therefore, sort of your strategy would be sort of seems quite conservative approach to price increases moving forward?</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Look, I think we're very sensitive to pricing. I mean, everything is transparent in our world. And I think we're in one of the few industries where all of your customers come together in one place and talk. So if you want a riot on your hands, you can actually stick the price up and see what happens. So our strategy has been sort of inflationary. But when you think about pricing, because of the forward nature of the business, we've got to be taking a view of what that is a year out, 18 months out, 2 years out. And we've averaged about 3% to 4%, which obviously is slightly ahead of inflation, and that's where I would see it sort of sticking at. I don't see 10%, and I don't see 0. It's that sort of level.</p><p>(inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Well, I still think I had never heard of you ask 2 questions rather than 3. I know you guys have 2 more follow-ups. It wasn't meant to be.</p><p>Could you give a little bit of color on the replications? It's very helpful the detail provided. But I always thought with the replication strategy. If -- I mean, you tend to know after a year or 2 if something's going to work. And then by year 3, you're starting to make money. But then it really starts to sort of push on 4 and 5. So just in terms of that pace, particularly given the large number of replications in '17 and '18, that really to me suggests a very strong platform for '21 and '22.</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And then a follow-up. I've been a long-term believer in the application of technology for exhibitions in terms of helping people find their most important customers on the exhibition floor, and also for exhibition owners to have a relationship throughout the year or a 2-year cycle rather than just at the time of an exhibition. Can you give us a little bit of color on your thoughts on that?</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Do you want to take any of those?</p><p>DANIEL P. O'BRIEN: Yes. So on replication, I mean, you're right in terms of the pattern. I mean, this sort of classic pattern is you launch and you're selling a vision or an idea. What you come around is your second version, you guys you have to show. So that's really tricky. So the key hurdle is getting to the second show, why I'm being successful. And assuming that's successful, you're right, you really start to see the benefits in years 3 and 4. So I think in terms of the patterns we saw in terms of the revenue building and the profitability building, we do see that continuing. And I think we'd hope that should the show be as successful as we expects and plan, that we should see some benefits coming through, you're right, '21 and '22. So that's a good way of thinking about it.</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: And going to the technology point, I mean, I think our industry is really in the foothills in terms of what it's doing with technology. And I think a large part of that has come from it hasn't had a burning platform that other media forms had, and it hasn't had to respond. I think that is changing. I would say it's slowly changing. But I think what we're seeing is certainly, from a marketing perspective, a lot more innovation than from a sales generation perspective. In terms of technology, it has allowed us to market to people in very difficult-to-access places. So historically, if you go back 20 years, very difficult to market in China, very difficult to market in Asia. Now that's changed dramatically. Now I think the next phase that we're seeing is no longer is it good enough to stick 20,000 people in an exhibition hall and hope something happens. So we're seeing a move to actually create those closer relationships physically at the event. And one example of that which we launched for our customers at Labelexpo in Chicago is to use a technology where companies could generate leads from people they actually hadn't interacted with in the stand. Because you go on to a stand, what generally will happen is the salesperson will swipe the badge, they know they've spoken to you, they've captured the details. But that's actually usually quite a low percentile of people who have gone on who are potentially interested in your product. And you probably find that the people who you don't really want to speak to, they actually want to speak to you. So it's a question of how do you capture all of the people who are there who might be interested in your product. So we've put in place a piece of technology where the buyers could go on and they could download information about that company's particular product. So they would touch it, and that would instantly email them PDFs about the product. What that was doing for the customer was generating a hold of leads that they didn't know about who were interested in their products. So in terms of lead generation, we had a 30% increase for our exhibitors in lead generation. So that's just sort of one example of actually how we can make that experience a lot better. And also for us, it gives us ammunition because when we're looking at rebooking, our customers say, well, I never saw anybody, et cetera, et cetera. And then you say, well, actually, you had 5,000 people who downloaded your stuff.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Is that widely (inaudible)?</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Yes. I mean, the technology exists. It's actually owned by a very large corporation. Because one of the other issues that we've got is, because tech is actually quite sort of small, the big tech companies see this as actually not a very interesting industry because actually they're not going to get the returns. So what you've got is a myriad of very, very, small, underfunded tech companies who are trying to make a living, and this particular piece of technology is actually owned by a very large company.</p><p>Fiona, I think, was first.</p><p>FIONA CATHERINE ORFORD-WILLIAMS, DIRECTOR &amp; SECTOR HEAD MEDIA, EDISON INVESTMENT RESEARCH LIMITED: It's Fiona Orford-Williams from Edison. We're talking about the enlargement of the pipeline. Historically, you've always talked about preferring to work on a partnership basis, getting to know people, all about driving the relationship. Is there a new swathe of opportunities that's coming that you're not already engaging in some respect? And then the second question, because you were talking about this remarkable sort of takeoff on the Bangkok replication, was there something special about that show in that place? Or is Bangkok a new potential really strong hub for you?</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Well, on acquisitions, I think there has been change in dynamics at play. And I think there's -- I think one cannot underestimate the impact of the UBM-Informa transaction in terms of the stimulation. And I think we're also seeing a huge amount of capital trying to get into the market and continuing to want to invest in the market. And I think the dynamics in terms of the major players has changed. So you've gone from a situation where Reed were #1 for 20-odd years and now they're not. And they hadn't made a major acquisition for 15 years and suddenly they have. Assuming that's not extraordinary because it's just when opportunities arise. Then you've got Blackstone who have spent huge amounts of money in the sector, continuing to look to build scale. So at the top end, there are some very interesting dynamics. And then in terms of opportunities, it is still a highly fragmented industry. Informa as #1 have got 6% market share. So there's lots of small, medium-sized businesses out there, but -- that are available. So I think there's a lot of those dynamics coming together. And I think it's creating new opportunities because through necessity, we've got into markets, looked for opportunities, done partnerships. And that's our preferred way of doing it. But I think there's a lot more inbound than us actually working relationships. Definitely, there's been a dynamic change in the last year. All trace back to the Informa-UBM.</p><p>In terms of Bangkok, I think this has been a -- it's been the longest overnight success ever. I mean, we've looked at that market for a long, long time. We've tried to get it right. The launch took a lot longer to get to market bluntly than I would have liked. But actually, being patient and the team executing it incredibly professionally has reaped the results. But Bangkok is a very well-established market. It's got very good infrastructure. It is seen as a key hub for that area because of its reach and its airport. And the -- we've deliberately chosen Bangkok to be the launch event of our new Brand Print because of the success we've had with Labelexpo, because of the infrastructure there and the fact that actually we could co-locate it with Labelexpo. And there's a lot of commonality in terms of the buyer groups. So again, it's the sort of dynamics changing and us responding.</p><p>Chris?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER ANTON GILES COLLETT, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Chris Collett from Deutsche. I just had 2 questions. One was a quick follow-up on your comments about the acquisition pipeline. Just wondering whether the vendors' expectations on multiples has also moved up. And then second was, have you seen any change in terms of either visitors or exhibitors internationally attending events? Or via some of your business travel events, have you seen any sort of change in people's desire to travel internationally?</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Well, I mean, let's take the last question first. In terms of travel, interestingly we had our major event in Orlando last week in terms of the leisure side, second edition, as I mentioned in the presentation. And a large component of that has been Chinese tour operators who are basically putting big groups of Chinese into the U.S. visit Florida, go to Vegas, whatever. And we saw a doubling from year 1 to year 2 of the Chinese tour operators attending that event. And I think that obviously, with the seemingly changing winds between sort of Trump and President Xi, I think that, that could be quite interesting.</p><p>And in terms of vendor multiples, in terms of the large groups, the ones that have transacted, they have been changing hands at increasing multiples. Premiums way above the quoted premiums. And that sort of variation is probably something I can't remember seeing in 26 years of being in the industry. I haven't seen that disparity of multiples. But in the small and medium-sized ones, while multiples have moved a little, they're still in that sort of 7 to sort of 9 range. So they're still at a sensible level where one can actually get value out of them. But it's the bigger portfolios that have moved.</p><p>Yes, Gareth?</p><p>GARETH RHYS DAVIES, DIRECTOR OF MEDIA EQUITY RESEARCH, NUMIS SECURITIES LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes, Gareth Davis from Numis. Two from me. Just going back to Turkey. Obviously, pretty optimistic commentary in the outlook statement there. Can you just talk about sort of international buyers? Are they coming back? Is it mainly being driven by local? I think there's been a little bit of management change in that business. So is it sort of back on the front foot in terms of -- and then just is it sort of steady-state-sized business now, Turkey, and you're not going to expand further in that market? Or is there organic potential and further sort of M&amp;A? And then secondly, just wondering if you can talk a little bit about U.S. medical and the sort of medium-term prospects there and what your sort of confidence is in being able to continue to deliver mid-single-digit kind of growth in that business.</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Well, Dan, do you want to take the medical point and I'll do the Turkey one?</p><p>DANIEL P. O'BRIEN: Yes, I mean, taking the medical first, I mean, we're feeling very good about our medical business. As I mentioned in my section, it covers 4 clinical areas. I don't think they're going to all charge ahead at equal rates. There'll be some going faster than others. But overall, they all look like having they're having a good 2019, and the longer-term outlook in terms of the importance of particularly preventative medicine in the -- in that market generally and the amount of spend that goes into medicine generally in the U.S., all the macro drivers are very positive. So we're feeling quite bullish about the prospects for that business both in terms of 2019 and longer term. And I think that's backed up by the demographics.</p><p>GARETH RHYS DAVIES: And just in terms of the competitive backdrop, I mean, I know if we went back sort of 2 to 3 years, there were a lot of low-price players who came in and caused a few issues. But it's not -- it's sort of all settled down now and, again, much more stable.</p><p>DANIEL P. O'BRIEN: Yes, I mean, that was specifically really in the antiaging congress -- conference that some -- I don't think -- that has settled down. I mean, the Las Vegas show was fantastic, really good growth in both the exhibitors and attendance. I think there is a well-established platform now for that business because it's so -- because the actual core product is so strong.</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Going to Turkey, on buyers, I mean, it's quite interesting. We've got 2 of our major events coming up in March. So that obviously gives us the confidence to make the stronger comments we've made in the outlook. And what's interesting about those 2 bigger shows, one is in the houseware market, and what we're seeing there is a reorientation of the exhibitor group. We had historically quite a large component of the exhibitor base in the March show who where importers, who will be effectively buying cheaper Chinese product and then reselling them on to retailers in Turkey. What we're seeing now is quite a massive shift in the exhibitor base who are Turkish manufacturers. So it's a made-in-Turkey type event now. Why is that? Because of the depreciation of the currency, it's very attractive in terms of the international market. And as a result, our focus on the marketing is very much bringing in more internationals as well as servicing the domestic market, which is quite a large market. But we're responding to actually how that market has changed to be heavily export orientated. And similarly, we've got Asansor, which is the largest show in the region for lifts, which doesn't sound particularly exciting, but, again, they are big manufacturers of lift components. So the show 2 years ago, one of the largest groups attending the show internationally were from Switzerland, would you believe, to -- and the reason for that is the Swiss industry were going through a massive refurbishment of their lift equipment. And again, that's the type of thing that we see that actually, quite a lot of the big buying comes out of Europe and they're sourcing products that's manufactured in Turkey.</p><p>In terms of the business, you're quite right, there's been quite a lot of change in Turkey managerially. We've gone from having multiple businesses where we've had entrepreneurs running them, whether it be on [Aeronaut] or they've owned minorities stakes. And the 3 largest of those, we now own a 100% of. So we've consolidated those 3 businesses under a professional manager, and we're seeing the benefits of that now cycling through, getting proper sales and marketing processes in place.</p><p>In terms of would we invest more money in Turkey, I don't think we would buy any more in Turkey, but we're certainly looking at continuing to actually innovate and put new product in the market. I mean, last year, we put our foot into the water with GESS in the education market. That got a very strong support from the Ministry of Education, and that's going to come back this year a lot bigger and a lot stronger with a lot more support from the government. So it's looking for areas where actually we've got expertise and we can add rather than going into sort of new markets.</p><p>Ian?</p><p>IAN RICHARD WHITTAKER: There's actually 2 follow-up questions. I -- so just something. To stakes. Sort of -- any update what's happening with the concerns happening around opioids. And suddenly slow there. That obviously had been a factor a few years back. That seems to have died down. And then the second thing, I guess, it just comes back to the sort of [Paul's] question on technology, yes, and sort of how you're using that to improve the process for the actual attendees. Yet -- are you going to follow the sort of relics approach sort of where you're saying, we're not going to look to monetize that investment, it would just help to support sort of our general price increases? Or do you think there's any scope there that you could use our technology to add on extra services that could be monetizable?</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: Yes. Do you want to take the opioid?</p><p>DANIEL P. O'BRIEN: So, I mean, the opioid crisis hasn't gone away and it won't do quickly. I mean, it actually presents an opportunity for us in terms of the PAINWeek business because if you are a doctor that wants to treat your patients and help them and you want to learn how to do it in a way that isn't going to cause problems with opioid addiction, then where you can go to learn that is PAINWeek. So we're seeing a lot of attracts to that event being around alternative ways of treating chronic pain. And so whilst some of the drug problem was around opioids, we're now seeing a lot of alterative drugs being developed and promoted to address that. So it's actually an opportunity for the business.</p><p>JAMES DOUGLAS EMSLIE: I think coming to technology, I think it's going to be a mix of things. I think that, I mean, some of the technologies we will add to get a better customer experience. So for example, at Labelexpo and at Connect, we've added in an expo bot. So basically, you can go and ask the bot basic sort of questions like what time does the conference program start, where are the toilets, et cetera. So we're actually just helping the customer experience, which is obviously something we're not charging for. But probably, sort of 2 areas where there is opportunity to add revenues would be, and we're starting to do this, is using the Connect model, using that sort of technology and understanding where actually, if you're creating value for the customers by actually making scheduled meetings, there's an opportunity to charge for that. So we've started to do that in a smaller way. But actually, if we look at 20-odd years of people trying to make money with technology in our industry, actually the only material revenues that have been made, and certainly this is our experience as well, is on education, is taking physical education and actually putting that online, and people are happy to pay for that. And the best example for us is in the medical business, where people are prepared to pay the same price of getting their education physically online. And for us, the provision of that education online is at a far higher margin because we don't have to provide the facilities and the food, et cetera, et cetera. So -- but I think education is a good area, especially where there's continuing educational regulatory reasons to do that like in medical, like in education itself, et cetera, financial.

On behalf of the Standard Bank Group Board of Directors, the group ExCo, and all of us at Standard Bank, welcome to the 2019 results presentation. A particular welcome if this is your first Standard Bank results presentation. If the Standard Bank group is new to you, we hope that this slide will be a useful summary.</p><p>The key to understanding this group of companies is our purpose: Africa is our home, we drive our growth. Everything we do emerges from this simple statement of intent.</p><p>2019 was, of course, a very difficult year for the world economy. Sub-Saharan Africa, however, continued to be a bright spot, one of the world's fastest-changing and fastest-growing regions. The regulatory and business environments for financial services in Africa also continued to develop and change rapidly over the year.</p><p>On the positive side, we welcomed the ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement and the removal of interest rate caps in Kenya. On the negative side, some central banks continued to pursue heterodox policies, an example being the Central Bank of Nigeria with their asymmetric application of cash reserving requirements. As always, navigating Africa's complexities requires local knowledge.</p><p>Growth disappointed in South Africa, to a large extent because of the pace of structural reform which was too slow. As we learned on Tuesday, South Africa grew at just 0.2% in 2019 and was in recession during the second half of the year. According to Standard Bank's economists, the direct impact of load shedding on the economy was enormous. They estimate that without load shedding, the economy would have grown at around 0.8%.</p><p>Arno will shortly discuss our numbers in detail, so I'll just make a few headline points.</p><p>Headline earnings in our banking business were up 5% to ZAR 27.2 billion. However, the group's earnings only grew by 1% to ZAR 28.2 billion, a disappointing outcome. Most of the gap between the banking activities and the group result is attributable to our 40% of the losses incurred by ICBCS.</p><p>I'd like to make a few points on this. First, this happened on our watch. The losses were incurred within ICBCS' board-approved risk appetite. Equally, though, as a 40% shareholder, we have limited influence over ICBCS nor can we simply cut our losses. In terms of our agreements with ICBC, the option to take a further shareholding is theirs. It is unlikely that ICBC will do this until such time as ICBCS is profitable. Third, we are acutely aware that shareholders' capital is far better deployed in Africa. ICBCS is off-strategy for us and outside our purpose. Fourth, we continued to have robust discussions with ICBC about the way forward for ICBCS.</p><p>We are, for the time being, satisfied with the management's actions that have been taken this year, including significant reductions in business lines and in head count. As shareholders, we agree that much closer integration of ICBCS into the ICBC Group will be required in order for this business to achieve a sustainable profit. Fifth, it is essential to see ICBCS in the context of our overall strategic partnership with ICBC, which remains of great benefit to both parties. For instance, since 2016, we have jointly supported investment banking deals worth over $3.4 billion. In 2019, CIB revenues arising from our partnership were up 24% year-on-year. PBB's revenues from Africa China Banking were up 43% on the prior year. Having said all this, our ROE of 16.8% falls well short of our target range of 18% to 20%.</p><p>Our strategy hasn't changed and is not changing. Our purpose is set in stone and shapes our choices. Our vision is to be the leading financial services organization in, for and across Africa, delivering exceptional client experiences and superior value.</p><p>Our key focus areas remain unchanged as are the value drivers we measure ourselves against. As you will see, we have again structured this presentation by our 5 value drivers. I will cover client focus, employee engagement, risk and conduct. And our CFO, Dr. Arno Daehnke, will talk about our financial outcome and our social, economic and environmental impact. I'll conclude by discussing our immediate and longer-term priorities.</p><p>Our first, and in many ways, most important value driver is client focus, which we measure in 2 ways: we measure our client experience through surveys and we measure the extent to which we enable our clients to reach their goals.</p><p>On the client survey side, satisfaction remained constant at a high level in CIB, Wealth and PBB Africa Regions. In PBB South Africa, a dip in client satisfaction followed the reconfiguration of our infrastructure. The team did well to restore client satisfaction in the second half of the year.</p><p>Measured by the extents to which we make positive differences in our clients' businesses, 2019 was another good year. We were entrusted by households, companies and governments to hold ZAR 1.3 trillion in deposits. We paid out ZAR 64 billion in interest. We enabled international trade to the value of USD 138 through letters of credit and lent ZAR 49 billion to enable people to buy homes. Across the Wealth business line, Liberty and Standard, it was our privilege to manage and administer ZAR 1.1 trillion worth of our clients' assets.</p><p>One of the things we are very pleased about this year is the rapid pace of new product releases using our digital capabilities and particularly new digital products that we have developed in partnerships. Each of these products enables us to serve our clients better and to grow our revenues in new areas. For example, our Africa China Agent Proposition and Africa China Export Proposition are partnerships with the ICBC to grow trade between Africa and China.</p><p>We have also made good progress to improve client experiences in ways that clients will never see, but that they will feel in a quicker, better and more personal experience. Some of this we've done in partnership with big tech companies, such as our cloud partnership with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Salesforce. And some of our innovations emerge from our rapidly developing internal big data and intelligent automation capabilities. We are now using more than 250 bots to simplify and accelerate our internal processes, and we have transferred more than 50 workloads from our internal servers to the cloud.</p><p>One of the strongest predictors of client satisfaction and a company's ability to generate superior returns is its level of employee engagement. The building blocks of employee engagement are 2: first, having the right skills so that one can do meaningful and rewarding work; and second, working in a welcoming, safe and inclusive workplace. We continued to concentrate on both these building blocks. For example, during 2019, we retrained 4,200 branch-based employees as universal bankers meaning that they are able to serve our clients in a more efficient and understanding way and also that their jobs are more interesting and fulfilling. We made speedy progress in making our business more inclusive, more diverse and more representative of the societies in which we work. In South Africa, we exceeded our 2019 targets for the representation of black people and black women in middle and senior management. We are now focusing on achieving greater representation of black people in top management in South Africa and on appointing more women, and particularly black women, in top management. Our group board is now more than 40% women, of which 5 are black women.</p><p>In addition to the traditional banking risks, which Arno will discuss shortly, we carefully monitor and manage 10 further emerging risk types. This morning, I'll discuss only 4 of these risk types: cyber risk, climate risk, business disruption risk and regulatory impact risk.</p><p>First, cyber risk. Cybercrime remains a major challenge. During 2019, the group's systems were subject to many cyberattacks every day. The number is quite astonishing. Constant vigilance is required. Thanks to quicker detection and responses, we were able to recover 58% of the money that our clients lost to digital fraud in 2019. This was up from 29% in 2018.</p><p>Next, business disruption risk, particularly during the first half of 2019, where a number of systems outages that took too long to repair. We recognize that prolonged systems outages severely inconvenience our clients. They undermined their trust in us and damaged our reputation. I am pleased to report that we made encouraging progress in restoring systems' capability and stability and reducing recovery time in the second half of the year. As a result, and despite the difficult first half, IT stability incidents were down 12% year-on-year.</p><p>But we are not declaring victory. We recognize that client expectations on system stability are set by the extremely stable services provided by the big tech firms. Our aspiration is to match these experiences.</p><p>Over 2019, another large source of business disruption risk was load shedding in South Africa. This year, COVID-19 may present an equal or greater risk. We have well-developed business continuity plans in place for both. Every year, in South Africa, every business faces substantial disruption risk, ultimately caused by South Africa's appalling levels of unemployment and inequality. Our commitment to supporting inclusive growth isn't a nice to have. It's an essential risk mitigant.</p><p>Turning to regulatory risk, and in addition to Africa-specific regulatory risk that I mentioned earlier, we are also concerned about the global regulation of digital finance. In our view, the guiding principle should be simple: if a company, no matter what it is called, takes deposits, makes loans, offers insurance or provides asset management, it should be regulated by the financial sector authorities as a financial sector firm.</p><p>On climate risk, we are committed to fully understanding and accurately reporting on our exposure to carbon-intensive assets in line with the TCFD principles. The Standard Bank Group supports the goals of the Paris Agreement and recognizes that climate change is a material risk to our ability to generate value for our stakeholders over time. In evaluating whether or not to fund coal-fired power generation and thermal coal mining projects, we will consider the energy situation in the region concerned, future energy demand in relation to the country's energy strategy, the country's commitments to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and technically and financially feasible and cost-effective power generation alternatives that are available in the relevant industry and country. We will comply with all the applicable laws and standards, including the Equator Principles, the IFC Environmental and Performance Standards (sic) [Environmental and Social Performance Standards] and the UN Principles of Responsible Banking. Our coal-fired power generation policy was published during the year and our thermal coal mining policy was released on SENS this morning.</p><p>Last on this slides -- on this slide, conduct. We are always mindful that we earn and maintain our license to operate every day by treating clients fairly. We were pleased by the 6% decline in the number of complaints about us referred to the Ombudsman for Banking Services in South Africa. We were even more pleased to win 2 awards from the OBS, these were best large bank for resolving banking customer complaints and the award for innovation in dispute resolution.</p><p>I now hand you over to our CFO, Arno Daehnke.</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE, GROUP FINANCIAL DIRECTOR &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, STANDARD BANK GROUP LIMITED: Good morning, everyone. It's great being here, and it's my pleasure to present the 2019 financial year results to you.</p><p>This slide illustrates the breadth and diversity of the Standard Bank franchise. The bar charts represent the client revenue we make by client type, product as well as geography.</p><p>In 2019, our fastest-growing line segments were large domestic clients as well as business banking clients. In the middle bar, you can see that transactional banking and lending remained our core revenue-generating products, but insurance, interestingly, was the fastest-growing product in 2019.</p><p>Geographically, revenues from Africa Regions increased to ZAR 35 billion, growing by 12% in constant currency and they now comprise 32% of the group's revenues, up from 30% in the last year.</p><p>As a management team, we remain committed to driving sustainable value for our investors. And this slide illustrates how we think about growth, resilience and returns to drive shareholder value. I will take you through each of these drivers now on the following slides.</p><p>Running through the group's income statement, you can see here that total income grew to ZAR 110.5 billion from ZAR 105.3 billion in the prior period, a growth rate of 5%. Net interest income growth of 6% was supported by strong loans and advances growth as well as strong deposit growth across the portfolio, however, offset slightly by declining margins. Noninterest revenue growth of 4% was driven by a strong year in Global Markets trading.</p><p>A rigorous focus on costs was maintained in 2019, resulting in cost growth of 3.7%, and therefore, delivering positive jaws of 113 basis points and a reduced cost-to-income ratio of 56.4%. This cost growth was achieved despite investments in customer experience initiatives, staff reskilling programs already mentioned by Sim as well as investments into our IT resilience and the costs associated with the infrastructure reconfiguration in our retail branch footprint in South Africa.</p><p>You can see here the 23% increase in credit impairments to ZAR 8 billion, but this was in line with our expectations off a very low base in 2018. The group's credit loss ratio therefore increased to 68 basis points, which is slightly below our 70 to 100 basis points guidance range.</p><p>Banking activities headline earnings consequently grew by 5% to ZAR 27.2 billion, which is a very pleasing performance considering the current markets.</p><p>This slide illustrates the movements in average balances for the year where you can see overall average loans grew by 8%, and within that, PBB up 6% and CIB up a pleasing 12%. Within Personal &amp; Business Banking, the mortgage portfolio grew 4% and the VAF lending portfolio grew 9% as the SA franchise turnaround gathered pace. Personal unsecured lending reflected the highest growth rate at 11%.</p><p>Within our Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, average loan growth of 12% was supported by a strong growth towards the end of 2018. And in 2019, Investment Banking grew further 7% with another record origination year of disposing ZAR 170 billion of loans supporting our clients on their growth journeys.</p><p>Average deposit balances continued a solid trajectory and PBB grew deposits by 6% and CIB by 11% with good local currency account origination and balanced growth in Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique specifically.</p><p>NII grew by 6% for the period as volume growth was offset by a slight margin reduction of 7 basis points. Endowment negatively impacted margin in 2019 by 2 basis points as positive endowments in South Africa and in Wealth International offset declining endowment benefit in Africa Regions as interest rates were cut in these markets.</p><p>Margins on lending increased in 2019 due to a changing mix in our portfolio. Lending growth in Africa Regions outpaced growth in South Africa as it has done so for the past few years, and higher-yielding unsecured lending became a bigger proportion of our book relative to the last year.</p><p>Deposit margins were squeezed by higher cash reserving requirements in Nigeria, mentioned already by Sim, and the mix impact of wholesale priced deposits growing faster than retail priced deposits.</p><p>Noninterest revenue grew 4%, supported by strong growth in trading income of 12%, an excellent performance. Fee growth remained under pressure where our largest category of fee income, and these are account transaction fees, declined 3% year-on-year and this is in line with our customers' increasing preference for convenient and more cost-effective digital channels over the traditional channels. The regulatory impact of fee caps and competitive pressures also impacted fee growth.</p><p>Fee expenses, think about card, cash as well as our loyalty program called UCount, increased 8% over the year, resulting in an increase of fees of 1% -- a net increase of fees of 1%, as shown in this graph.</p><p>Trading income picked up in the second half of 2019 on the back of increased volatility and ended up the year up 12%. Other noninterest revenue was supported by growth in the VAF fleet portfolio and increased bancassurance revenue.</p><p>I'm starting the credit discussion by looking at the balance sheet provisions for our personal and business bank. Good loan growth over the period necessitated an increase in stage 1 and stage 2 provisions, as you would expect, but this was more than offset by improvements in credit modeling by PBB and enhanced collections. Stage 3 loans have increased as a percentage of the book, mainly in the secured lending portfolios of mortgages and VAF, which necessitated an increase in stage 3 provisions. And we kept our coverage ratio at 50% as a consequence.</p><p>Turning to CIB. As you can see in the graph on the bottom left-hand side, stage 3 loans declined year-on-year to 1.6% of the book due to the write-off of a few exposures during the year. These write-offs were names where coverage ratios had been particularly high. The required coverage ratio for the remaining stage fee loans was therefore lower in 2019, which resulted in lower balance sheet provisions. We are comfortable that sufficient collateral is held against stage 3 exposures. Stage 1 and Stage 2 exposures and provisions increased in line with loan growth and also some deterioration in risk rates.</p><p>The income statements charge for credit of ZAR 8 billion increased by 23% in 2019 and resulted in a credit loss of 68 basis points, which is just below the disclosed 70 to 100 basis points guidance range.</p><p>In Personal Bank -- Personal &amp; Business Banking, the charge increased by 17% to an 89 basis point loss ratio and was driven by balance sheet growth across-the-board and elevated risk in our VAF portfolio due to the difficult economic climate in South Africa.</p><p>In CIB, the charge for credit increased by 52% off a very low base in 2018 to a 32 basis point loss ratio. In South Africa, a deterioration of corporate risk quality drove year-on-year increases, offset by recoveries. In Africa Regions, credit impairment charges increased off a low base driven by single name in payments in east and south and central regions.</p><p>Operating expenses of 3.7% should be considered relative to the weighted average inflation in the markets in which we operate of 5.1% as well as the level of investment required to transform our business for a digital future. A decline in head count and incentives supported slower staff cost growth.</p><p>As you can see here, other operating expenses increased by 6%. And within this, IT costs grew by 17% to ZAR 7.5 billion. This reflecting higher software licensing and maintenance costs, the inflationary impact of a weaker rand on the U.S. dollar, increase in cloud-related costs as well as an increase in outsourcing costs.</p><p>The adoption of IFRS 16, our new accounting standard, gave rise to an increase in depreciation and a decrease in premises costs. The net impact of IFRS 16 was not material for the group.</p><p>Unpacking the IT costs further, this slide shows the full cost of the IT function, including the ZAR 7.5 billion element we saw in the previous slide. For the year under review, as you can see here, the total IT function-related spend increased by only 5%, which is a better view of how we measure our IT costs. The CAGR in the spend over 4 years has been 7%. As our group continues to evolve and as IT becomes a bigger driver of our strategy, we expect continued investment in technology.</p><p>We also expect fewer larger projects capitalized as intangible assets, which means that over the short term, our income statement will need to support new investments as well as the amortization of previously large capitalized projects, such as our core banking replacement projects.</p><p>Other banking interests recorded a headline earnings loss of ZAR 864 million. ICBCS recorded a disappointing set of results for 2019. The loss recorded in the group's headline earnings of ZAR 1.4 billion is made up of an operating loss in this entity; a provision relating to business restructuring, which Sim already referred to; and a loss of ZAR 1.1 billion relating to a single client event, which we spoke about at our interim results. In September 2019, we recognized $163 million impairment in our stake of ICBCS, thereby reducing the carrying value from $383 million to $220 million at the time. This equated to a ZAR 2.6 billion impairment, which is reported outside of headline earnings. As Sim covered earlier, we have made meaningful progress with ICBCS management as well as the ICBC Group on how best to put the business on a path of sustainable profitability.</p><p>ICBC Argentina performed well for the 8 months prior to our exercise of option to sell our stake to the ICBC Group and delivered a headline earnings contribution from the group's 20% stake of ZAR 583 million. The sale of our stake remains subject to Chinese regulatory approvals, and we expect to reach completion in the coming months.</p><p>The financial results reported from Liberty are the consolidated results of the group's 56% investment in Liberty adjusted for deemed treasury shares. In 2019, Liberty delivered successful outcomes on their key strategic focus areas and they discussed that at the presentation in this room last week.</p><p>Liberty grew headline earnings by 23% to ZAR 3.3 billion. And the group's share of these earnings, as you can see here, amounted to ZAR 1.9 billion, up 16% on the prior year, after adjusting for the treasury shares, which I referred to earlier on.</p><p>In 2019, we actively managed our capital stack to optimize returns. During the year, we issued ZAR 1.9 billion of alternative Tier 1 capital, ZAR 1 billion Tier 2 capital in the local market and successfully placed and attractively priced in overall $400 million Tier 2 bond in the international market, thereby diversifying the group's rich capital investor base.</p><p>We have maintained our robust Basel III-compliant capital position with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 14%. During the year, we felt it prudent to maintain our capital buffers ahead of our SA sovereign downgrade, Basel III finalization, and of course, also to continue to cater for Africa Regions growth opportunities. Including the IFRS 9 phase-in impact, which should equalize in a year's time, the common equity Tier 1 ratio dipped slightly to 13.8%. Liquidity ratios are maintained in excess of Basel III requirements.</p><p>Banking return on equity dipped to 18.1%, given the capital buffers held at the center I spoke about just now and the lower CIB ROE, which I will cover a little bit later. Group return on equity was dampened by the loss incurred by ICBCS and fell to 16.8%.</p><p>You would have noted we have declared a final dividend of ZAR 5.40 per share, and thus, maintaining the same dividend per share as the final dividend declared in 2018. This resulted in a full year dividend for the -- of ZAR 9.94 per share, up 2% from the prior year.</p><p>Turning to the business line performance, and starting with Personal &amp; Business Banking South Africa where we continued to transform our business to meet our clients' changing needs. Our ability to serve our clients through digital channels took a step up in 2019. As an example, more than 1/4 of personal unsecured loans and savings and investments were originated through digital channels in 2019.</p><p>The pace of digital adoption by our South African customers continues to increase. Digital transactions increased 11% overall. Face-to-face transaction decreased by 16%. And we have rightsized our infrastructure accordingly as the data points on the slide evidence.</p><p>Branch closures in the first half of 2019 adversely impacted client experience. However, we are pleased to report that PBB SA customers have -- numbers have stabilized and client satisfaction scores have improved in the second half of the year.</p><p>In Africa Regions where cash remains an important product for us, 92% of customers are now transacting outside of the branch and we continued to roll out our infrastructure and invest in supporting structures to enable the continuation of these digitization trends. We have improved our client onboarding processes across our network and have deployed the capability for our clients to either digitally onboard themselves or onboard within minutes at one of our points of representation. Through these efforts, especially when we're using our ecosystems to onboard customers instantly in the workplace, we are seeing much higher account utilization rates as the improved onboarding process solves directly and much better for the immediate client needs.</p><p>The overall financial results for PBB for 2019 was pleasing with headline earnings up 6% to ZAR 16.5 billion. Overall revenue growth for PBB was 5% with Africa Regions now contributing almost 1/4 of PBB's revenues and this is with a steadily increasing contribution. Positive jaws of 210 basis points was achieved despite absorbing costs relating to the SA branch configuration of approximately ZAR 500 million. PBB jaws would have been nearly 3% if these once-off costs would have been excluded.</p><p>The cost-to-income ratio of PBB reduced to below 60%. PBB ROE, as you can see here, increased to a pleasing 22.4%, with the ROE in PBB Africa Regions approaching 10%.</p><p>On a geographic basis, PBB South Africa was up 2%. Africa Regions and Wealth continued to deliver very strong performance, as you can see on this slide.</p><p>In CIB, client revenues increased 7%, which was a balanced performance across our diversified franchise. As a result of ongoing Sino-U. S. trade wars, there has been a slowdown in multinational corporate clients growth. Despite this, our revenue from multinationals still grew 4%, and this remains the core part of our franchise. Domestic clients grew by 12% on the back of notable activity in South Africa, West Africa and East Africa.</p><p>From a sector perspective, we saw continued strong performance from financial institutions, underpinned by a focused effort to better serve nonbanking financial institution sectors. Growth in power infrastructure was supported by renewable energy transactions. Mining and metals growth was driven by change-in-ownership transactions as some mining majors exited South Africa. And investment into Africa Regions with Mozambique and Ghana being examples of where investment flows were particularly strong. The telecoms and media teams facilitated some key deals in South Africa and Africa Regions.</p><p>From a product lens, Global Markets posted a strong second half, resulting good finish with revenues up 7%. Our Transactional Products and Services business, which has a large Africa Regions presence compared to South Africa, was impacted by regulatory changes in markets like Nigeria as well as Zimbabwe. Revenue growth was a more muted 3% for this business. In Investment Banking, we have seen a continued demand for loans and advances, but a slowdown in knowledge fees, resulting in revenues up 2%.</p><p>CIB overcame significant headwinds to deliver headline earnings growth of 5% for the year to ZAR 11.8 billion. Cost growth of 3% led to positive jaws of 128 basis points and improved cost-to-income ratio to 53.7%. Strong growth in Investment Bank assets in Africa Regions and portfolio rating downgrades in South Africa in late 2018 drove higher capital demand, and this was a drag on ROE, which declined to 18.1%.</p><p>Global Markets earnings grew 18 -- grew 15%, apologies, for the year, supported by a strong client activity, particularly in Africa Regions. Strong lending growth in Investment Banking supported NII and earnings growth. Headline earnings for TPS were down 13%. The regulatory headwinds experienced in some of our key markets, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza had a significant impact on TPS relative to the business units -- to the other business units in CIB. TPS performance was further adversely impacted by a spike in credit losses in East Africa and in South and Central Africa. Included in operating expenses for TPS is also material operational risk loss in East Africa, which should not occur -- reoccur. Over the last 5 years prior to 2019, the TPS business has reported compound earnings growth of 9%, and we are confident that the business will resume operating performance in line with the previous trends.</p><p>Analyzing the results by region, it can be seen that SBSA grew by 4% while Africa Regions grew by 5% or 9% on a constant currency basis.</p><p>SBSA income grew by 2%, and cost growth was tightly contained also to 2%. The credit loss ratio ended at a similar position to the last year. And a more favorable effective tax rate resulted in headline earnings increasing by 4%. ROE expanded for SBSA to 16.9% for the year.</p><p>We are expecting a downgrade of the SA sovereign to junk status, and we are absorb -- positioned to absorb the funding impact which is likely to arise thereof. This will continue to mean a difficult operating environment for SBSA.</p><p>Turning now to Africa Regions. Given that this region grew by 15% for the first half in 2019, it is evident that a meaningful slowdown in earnings growth occurred in the second half. The slowdown arose from regulatory headwinds in revenue generation, negative endowment impact in key markets and credit impairments in CIB already referred to. While these impacts are unfortunate, we are encouraged by continued strong balance sheet growth in Africa Regions with lending growing by 15% and our deposits growing by 10% in constant currency. While Africa Regions' contribution to banking headline earnings remained at 31%, their contribution to revenue growth increased from 30% in 2018 to 32% of the group's revenue in 2019. These trends bode well for future strong earnings growth from this region.</p><p>ROE in Africa Regions was dampened by capital injections in C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire, DRC, Ghana and Tanzania and higher risk-weighted assets given sovereign downgrades, particularly in Zambia, for example, and healthy increases in lending and trading activities.</p><p>In East Africa, we saw strong revenue growth at 14% constant currency, dampened by credit provisions and operational risk losses, but assisted by increasing shareholding in Kenya, which resulted in headline earnings growth of 16% in 2019 in constant currency terms.</p><p>South and central region generated good revenue growth of 12%, but experienced trade impairments in mining and construction sectors. The operating environment in Zimbabwe was incredibly difficult in 2019, and this country now qualifies as a hyperinflation economy and we have adjusted our accounts accordingly.</p><p>We were delighted to list our Namibian subsidiary in the last quarter of 2019. This IPO was executed in a persistent recession in this market and with a high proportion of BBBEE participation.</p><p>West Africa revenue growth of 9% in constant currency was pleasing given increased cash reserving costs, which Sim referred to, and other regulatory changes in Nigeria. Credit impairments in the region appear elevated year-on-year given the write-backs in the first half of 2018. Headline earnings increased a pleasing 16% in constant currency in this region.</p><p>This slide sets out our medium-term financial targets, which you will be familiar with. You will notice we have not altered our medium-term targets. And while we are cognizant of the immediate and significant headwinds facing the global economy, we deem it too early to adjust the targets now.</p><p>In the medium term, we anticipate that balance sheet growth in Africa Regions should continue to outpace that in South Africa, and NII should outpace NIR. We expect revenue headwinds, but we will continue to manage costs lower to deliver positive jaws. The credit loss ratio should remain at the lower end of our target range of 70 to 100 basis points. Over the medium term, we remain committed to delivering sustainable earnings growth and a return on equity in our 18% to 20% target range.</p><p>We are committed to driving sustainable and inclusive growth across Africa. To achieve this, we must ensure that the clients we bank, the projects, partnerships and infrastructure developments we finance create net positive social, economic and environmental impacts. These considerations are front and center when we make our daily business decisions.</p><p>Considering the nature of our business and the needs of the geographies in which we operate, we have selected those risks which are most relevant to us and where we can have the biggest impact. We have groups and defined them as our 7 SEE impact areas, as you can see on the slide. We measure our progress in terms of the inclusion in the sustainability indices listed below.</p><p>On this slide, we have shown some of the demonstrable progress that we have made in 4 of our 7 impact areas. I will just briefly summarize 2 examples.</p><p>In line with our SEE impact of Africa trade and investment, we partnered with ICBC in China to help African importers and exporters build direct relationships with suppliers and buyers in China. In November last year, we hosted 90 export-ready clients from 6 African countries at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai. We help our clients navigate complex and bureaucratic Chinese regulations, language barriers and volatile markets, and importantly, we match our clients with trusted importers from within the client base of ICBC. By acting as a reliable facilitator for these activities, we unlocked a trade corridor to drive Africa's growth, a great example of how we're driving our purpose.</p><p>Another example is in Uganda, which has, as you would know, one of the lowest electrification rates in Africa. New off-grid affordable energy solutions have the potential to leapfrog old-fashioned electricity grids to electrify households and businesses.</p><p>In alignment with our SEE objective of driving infrastructure development, we provided finance to one of the world's leading off-grid pay-as-you-go companies based in Kenya, and you would know that this company is called M-KOPA. As part of this transaction, our colleagues in Uganda teamed up with M-KOPA to install solar solutions in 22 schools spread across the country. Clean energy solutions for schools on the continent tick many boxes for us as an organization supporting Africa's growth.</p><p>I remind you that we are committed to being more than a provider of financial services and products. We are a catalyst for economic change in our countries of operation, and we strive to make life better for our fellow Africans.</p><p>I will now hand over to Sim to conclude.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Thank you, Arno. Global economic growth is expected to remain slow and downside risks will persist, for example, COVID-19 could disrupt global supply chains and overwhelm Africa's fragile public health systems. Trade tensions could escalate again. Eskom's operational performance could deteriorate further. The South African government could be unable to keep its fiscal promises.</p><p>Our economists have developed scenarios in which COVID-19 spreads moderately or widely beyond China. In the moderate scenario, China's economic growth would fall by around 1 percentage point this year, the world economy would grow around 0.5 percentage points more slowly and South Africa's growth would be 0.1 percentage points lower than a pre-COVID-19 baseline.</p><p>In the more severe scenario, China's growth would fall 1.6 percentage points, the world would fall 1.1 percentage points and South Africa is 0.3 or 0.4 percentage points.</p><p>We currently forecast 0.4% growth for South Africa in 2020, which incorporates the impact that we foresee from COVID-19.</p><p>More positively, we think that the pace of structural reform in South Africa and South Africa's electricity industry has finally picked up and that Eskom is now under better management. There should also be some expansion of generation capacity this year. Further, even if power cuts are as bad as last year, the impact on growth might be somewhat less severe owing to the lower base and because households and firms have had more time to adjust.</p><p>We're also hopeful that much of the Rest of Africa will continue to grow relatively fast. This year, we think that average GDP, weighted by our capital allocation in our Africa Regions countries, will grow just under 4%, rising to 5% in the medium term. That's an attractive proposition, and we are sure that there are very few other firms that can offer their investors or their clients' access to this well-balanced and robust portfolio of markets.</p><p>If we are right about the macros, then the medium- and longer-term future for Africa-focused financial services companies is likely to be bright. But there's another much bigger if. The future is only likely to be bright for us if we can remain relevant and competitive in a rapidly changing and digitizing world. We have thought hard about what we need to do to ensure that we're able to win in our chosen markets over the medium and longer term.</p><p>We have concluded that there are 4 things we need to do over the medium term. We need to ensure that our clients remain at the center of everything that we do. This means that we have to keep improving our client experience scores in all our established areas. But it also means that we have to change and extend the range of products and services that we offer. And it means that we must offer this extended range of services with the speed, agility, reliability and extent of personalization that people have come to expect from the leading digital companies.</p><p>Our next priority is to combine digital technology and human skill to offer an integrated and comprehensive set of products and services, building a platform and creating ecosystems. Here is one example from the Corporate &amp; Investment Banking division. As Mozambique booms over the next decade, we are not thinking only of banking the energy majors. Rather, our intention is to construct a network of relationships, that is, an ecosystem, that will enable the government, firms and people of Mozambique to achieve their aspirations for rapid, fair, inclusive and sustainable human development. Our ecosystem will bring together insurance and health providers, wealth management and education providers and lenders and homebuilders. In doing this, we will simultaneously fulfill our purpose and profit from a larger share of Mozambique's growth.</p><p>Here's another example from our PBB and Wealth business units. We don't just want to be the bank or insurer that funds and protects your home, we want to orchestrate the whole system of goods and services that meet the human need for somewhere safe and comfortable to live. And home services should be just the start. We already provide a range of home services and a concierge service for our high net worth clients. Digital technology is making it possible for us to extend this proposition and work with a wide range of partners, from the largest big tech firms to the smallest SMEs, to do the same for millions of customers.</p><p>These imperatives imply the need for big changes to our infrastructure and resources, which is our third medium-term priority. As you have heard this morning, we have already substantially reconfigured our retail infrastructure and offerings in South Africa. We will continue to simplify and update our structure and to make ourselves much more open to a range of partnerships.</p><p>I won't dwell on the fourth medium-term priority, which is to create social, economic and environmental value. As Arno has shown, we think that when we are doing our jobs right, SEE emerges organically. SEE value, therefore, is both a good thing in itself and an excellent test of our commercial relevance.</p><p>What do these medium-term priorities add up to? Well, over the long term, we want to become a truly human and truly digital services company, not just financial services, services. We will understand our clients deeply through long-term relationships built on mutual respect, trust and empathy. And we will efficiently and effectively deliver exactly the services, solutions and opportunities people need to achieve growth, prosperity and fulfillment over the course of their lives. Our technology will be efficient, robust and secure. We will process mostly in the cloud and most clients will be serviced predominantly online. Our technology will embrace and empower innovation and will be underpinned by our comprehensive data and strong data analytics.</p><p>So that's the big picture and the long-term ambition. But of course, long-term ambitions are realized by disciplined and detailed execution right here and now.</p><p>These are our top priorities for 2020. We will deliver consistently excellent client experiences in order to grow market share and revenues, particularly here in South Africa.</p><p>The absolute bedrock of this system is system stability, and I can assure you that this is the top item on our agenda every single day.</p><p>We will continue to accelerate our digitization in partnership with our cloud providers and other big techs and by continuing to develop and roll out new digital services.</p><p>We will continue to shift capital and other resources to Africa Regions.</p><p>We will remain determined to deliver strong positive jaws. Importantly, this isn't just saving for its own sake. We are getting more automated, leaner and more agile.</p><p>Finally, we will make progress in returning our ROE closer to our target range.</p><p>With that, ladies and gentlemen, I will open up for questions, starting first with the webcast.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: What about the conference call?</p><p>OPERATOR: We have 2 questions on the conference call. The first question is from James Starke of SBG Securities.</p><p>JAMES STARKE, ANALYST, SBG SECURITIES (PROPRIETARY) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Two questions from my side. Firstly, just on fees and commissions, up 1%. I wonder if you could give some context on breaking that down between how much of the compression came from lower pricing and what the volume component was there.</p><p>And then if we turn to your outlook for IT amortization, you've mentioned the cloud. Just trying to get a sense of what it means for what your outlook is compared to, at the moment, around ZAR 2.5 billion. Where does that go to from here? And if there's any risk of impairment around existing IT CapEx that's been put in place.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Okay. Arno, have you got them?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: My mic on? Yes, Sim. I'll answer your question first -- second question first, James. On the amortization charge, we expect that increase to around ZAR 3 billion and level off there off the current levels. We do, on a biannual basis, impairment tests on all our intangibles. And to the extent that the intangibles are redundant and not fit for purpose, we obviously are applying the accounting standards, which means we have to write them off. And in the period under review, you would have noticed we wrote off around ZAR 230 million of IT intangibles, and we can give you the details in our one-on-one discussions on that.</p><p>On the fee and commission revenue, you asked specifically on the volumes. We have some data points in the PBB section of the analyst booklet and you would see that our volumes continued to be strong, specifically our digital volumes. And it is really driven, as I indicated off the podium, from the transition of traditional channels into digital channels, which obviously are much more cost effective for the clients, but less revenue accretive for us.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Harry Botha of Avior Capital Markets.</p><p>HARRY BOTHA, BANKS ANALYST, AVIOR CAPITAL MARKETS (PTY) LTD.: Just 2 quick questions, please. First, on ICBCS. Is there any further downside risk from the single name that had a big impact in 2019? And when would you expect breakeven for this business, is it in the next year or 2 for ICBCS?</p><p>And then in terms of deploying capital into Africa Regions, could you give us a sense of which country specifically you're looking at in the next 3 years?</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Okay. Arno, do you want to take both?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Yes. On ICBCS, we understand there's no further downside risk. This position obviously has been carefully audited externally and the $200 million loss relating to that single client exposure is what we believe is the appropriate provision for that.</p><p>On the Africa Regions, we are certainly interested in considering some of the minority opportunities where we can still buy out minorities, for example, in Kenya is an example where we can go up to 75% shareholding. We also are looking at the WAEMU region as well as the Ethiopian region.</p><p>Was that all, Harry? Did I miss anything on ICBCS?</p><p>HARRY BOTHA: The guidance for breakeven?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Yes. In the next year or 2. You sort of called it right there.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Then we have no further questions on the conference call.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Thank you so much. Shall we open it up in Rosebank, any questions? If you don't mind raising your hand, there are microphones roving. And if you could please identify yourself. I can't see the people from here, the lights are too bright. I think there's a hand. Yes.</p><p>CHARLES L. RUSSELL, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Charles Russell from Citi. Also 2 questions from my side. If you could perhaps just elaborate on the ZAR impact of the Zimbabwe hyperinflation accounting.</p><p>And then the second point or question would be on the head count reduction. It looks like you've reduced head count by another 1,200 people in the second half. Could you break that up into retrenchments and natural attrition and also across the various disciplines, branch, IT or any other areas? And if you could also allocate a retrenchment cost to the retrenchment components in the second half piece.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Arno, do you want to...</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Okay.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: I think there's 3 there.</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Yes. On the ZAR impact in headline earnings actually was fairly immaterial. However, one needs to look through, we had to adjust for nonmonetary items, specifically property, which was an uplift for the group and then obviously we adjusted for the earnings at the revised closing exchange rate, which was much weaker at 16.8% to the outages to the U.S. dollar. So the net impact of those 2 was a fairly minor impact for the group overall. Charles, so that's on Zim.</p><p>On the head count, there were no large retrenchment programs in the second half. The branch rationalization was in the first half. The reduced head count in the second half to what you're referring to is mostly due to national attrition across all the areas, both the corporate function areas as well as the business unit areas. And there were no severance package costs related to that in the second half of materiality for the group.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Anybody else? I think there's a hand here. You can press the button. Yes.</p><p>CLEM GOEMANS;THE INVESTMENT ANALYSTS SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA: It's Clem. May I first of all compliment you and honor on a very comprehensive and meaningful presentation. I think you've taken us into your -- a picture of the bank as it is in Africa, and I found it very interesting and informative.</p><p>I have some questions, if I may. Your slide on Page 36 in your strategic targets. If I heard you or Arno correctly, you're indicating or expecting that your credit loss ratios will remain at the lower end of your range of 70 to 100.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Yes.</p><p>CLEM GOEMANS;THE INVESTMENT ANALYSTS SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA: Now given the economic climate in which we are and the news that came out earlier this week of another bank has credit loss experience, how, pardon the word, realistic is that expectation?</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: I would say it's realistic, but maybe to give Arno a break, can I ask maybe Zweli and Kenny just to give some color to why we're confident that we will remain within 70 to 100 basis points, just break it up to PBB and CIB. Do you want to start, Kenny, as the younger of the 2?</p><p>KENNY FIHLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANKING (CIB), STANDARD BANK GROUP LIMITED: No. I like that very much. Thank you very much, Sim. I mean our sort of guidance range for the credit loss ratio is not changing for a very simple reason that despite the current economic hardship that we're experiencing and the spike in our impairment, we are still at the bottom of the current guidance range. Within CIB, that range is 40 to 60 bps. Our customer credit loss ratio is at 40 bps. So there's effectively enough room to accommodate further impairment without necessarily breaching the guidance range. I think that's the reason why we're sticking with it. We think we've got sufficient room to accommodate further impairment, if at all, without necessarily having to breach that guidance range.</p><p>ZWELI MANYATHI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF PERSONAL &amp; BUSINESS BANKING GROUP, STANDARD BANK GROUP LIMITED: It's Zweli here. So from a PBB perspective, we've got a range of between 100 bps and 120 bps, and at the moment, we're sitting at 89. And we watch the credit origination very, very tightly. We regularly do deep drills across different businesses to make sure that we understand the risks that we were importing. And we are comfortable that with all of this, we should be -- we should not breach the 120 bps.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Is there anything else, Clem?</p><p>CLEM GOEMANS;THE INVESTMENT ANALYSTS SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA: Interesting. Looking at Slide 17 where I saw the average balances per individual, if I'm correct, for Personal Banking and Corporate Banking. I'm surprised to see the average per head or customer in Personal being higher than in Corporate. You must have some very wealthy and a fairly high number of depositors and also borrowers.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Can I ask Arno just to explain?</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Yes. Clem, I'll just clarify that. These are the average gross loan for the entire year, not per client. So it's the average for the year, not the average loan to a client. So you have to see it in that context.</p><p>CLEM GOEMANS;THE INVESTMENT ANALYSTS SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA: Okay. Alright. Then if I may, one further point, on your employee engagement on Slide 10 where you reported on -- engaged 4,200 people in training and whatever. Now that's against your total complement of the order of 55,000 (inaudible) me to the total. It is a very small proportion, and I know one needs to start with small steps. Would you like to indicate how you see this going? And I can tell you of my own experience, as I've mentioned in the past, with your lower level staff, and I find it very hard to accept that they're either engaged or committed or knowledgeable. And forgive me for those very harsh words.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: No, they are harsh but they're said in very gentle terms, so we will take them. But I'll ask Funeka if she could please address the 4,200 and perhaps, Sharon, if you could embellish if Funeka leaves any gaps just to cover the 52,000, what we do for our staff.</p><p>FUNEKA MONTJANE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF PBB SOUTH AFRICA, STANDARD BANK GROUP LIMITED: Thank you, sir. So in South Africa, as part of the work that we've done to -- under reconfiguration of our branches, one of the significant things that we've done was to relook at the nature of the work that actually happens at branches and realize that 65% of the job descriptions are aligned purely to servicing very specific products. We've had a look at that and have relooked at all of those job descriptions and have asked people to look after a whole full suite of solutions for customers and not only from a servicing perspective, but from a growth perspective. So to that end, every single person in our branch infrastructure as well as in our call center has been asked to go back to school, to go and get a qualification, which is an equivalent of an NQF 5, which entails classroom learning as well as e-learning and about 6, 7 months of practical training to make sure that people have actually -- can apply what they have learned. It has entailed quite a significant sacrifice of productivity because what that has meant is, on average, 2 weeks a month our people are out on training and we have to bring in extra people to deal with what happens. But it's basically in recognition of the fact that because of digitization, the nature of work has changed. Our client queries are much more complex and the work is a lot more tilted towards growth as 99% of servicing is in branch, so -- is on digital.</p><p>The very important thing here is to say, this is only the beginning and we expect this to be an ongoing issue. And the 4,200 is simply the first cohort. The next cohorts, we have to watch that we can digest -- we don't chew more than we can digest. So once the first cohort comes out, which is a 12- to 18-month program, we will bring the next cohort to start through. But this is what we believe is the right response for helping our people deal with the reality of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. A vast majority of our jobs have been taken over by -- basically, a machine is doing that work. We have to figure out new jobs that are suitable for people and train them accordingly.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Just because it's such an important question, can I ask Sharon just a very brief overview of what we're doing in training and preparing our people for the future?</p><p>SHARON TAYLOR, GROUP HEAD OF HUMAN CAPITAL, STANDARD BANK GROUP LIMITED: Thank you, Sim, and thank you, Clem, for the question. I think Standard Bank has got a long and proud history of investment in its people. And certainly, development of our people is one of our core values, which you'll see we hold very dear. I don't have the exact number with me, but I think the group's training spend for 2019 financial year across the total global footprint is in the order of ZAR 800 million. So there's a significant investment that we make in staff development. You'll see potentially one of the other stats on that slide was more than 200,000 digital learning videos accessed by employees. So I would not like to create the impression that the 4,200 are the only people we touch. We touch almost every single staff member every year because we have a very big compliance training requirements that our license is dependent on. So there's an enormous range of training that takes place with staff across-the-board to deal with both regulatory issues as well as upskilling for the current job, and to the point that Sim is making, with a very clear focus on building the skills that staff need for the future. So I think the 4,200 should be seen in the context of the front-line capability that we were developing that needed a very specific skill refresh in line with the PBB strategy going forward. So I hope that answers the question.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Your very last one, Clem?</p><p>CLEM GOEMANS;THE INVESTMENT ANALYSTS SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA: Yes. Sure -- no, that's fine. May I make a comment? First of all, thank you for those replies. My recent experience, and this goes back quite a while, is that the problem in my experience lies in supervision and management. In my younger days, and that was a very, very long time ago, one could not do anything and -- or issue anything unless one supervisor had reviewed and signed off what one had done. And if one was then advised to interact with the client or the user on that basis, that supervisor made sure that you had the right response. That's the first thing. The second thing is, I would suggest you also keep a very close and broad look at your recruitment and your skill levels for recruitment. And that's enough.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Thank you very much, Clem. We'll take those comments to heart. Thank you. Any further questions? I call for -- yes?</p><p>WARREN THOMPSON: It's Warren Thompson from -- Warren, Business Day. Just wanted to talk to you about Slide 24 in relation to the IT spend and your stated strategy, obviously, as this migration takes place, the cloud and cloud delivery. The biggest component is the kind of light gray, which refers to IT licenses, maintenance and related costs. Obviously, a big increase year-on-year and then a fairly large annual growth in that line item. Could you give any guidance on how that evolves in the years ahead?</p><p>And also, how the composition of your IT spend changes as you migrate more and more of your offering and your delivery to the cloud in terms of are you looking at more annuity -- U.S. dollar annuity-based contracts with your service providers, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Arno will take that one.</p><p>ARNO DAEHNKE: Okay. So Page 23 gives some details of what's specifically in that IT line of ZAR 7.5 billion of why that has grown, and you heard me on the podium talking through those components. Going forward, we make the point that we have to continue to invest in technology. And we think an overall cost growth, just to look at the overall IT spend, mid to high single digits is probably what we're going to be spending going forward.</p><p>The composition of that will change, as you say so. There will be less spend on physical machines, much more on cloud processing. And in the short term, there's a short overlap. Thereafter, obviously, the cloud processing takes over much more dominantly. And that is, in the long term, a much more effective and cheaper way of processing our technology. As you can imagine, you mentioned the technology landscape is extremely fluid. And year-on-year, I think we're talking to you about a slightly different makeup of this. So it will be difficult to project this now at 5 years out to how it's going to be because we continue to adjust our technology to what is being required.</p><p>The dollar-based spend, absolutely. We do hedge some of the dollar costs on a net basis, looking at our dollar revenues vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis our dollar expenses. So you will only always see the dollar costs in this specific item here.</p><p>Did I answer your questions?</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: Do we have any further questions in...</p><p>BRUCE WILLIAMSON;INTEGRAL ASSET MANAGEMENT;CIO: It's Bruce Williamson, Integral Asset Management. Do you think there's anything that the private banking sector are not doing that has prompted the government to think about establishing a state bank? And where's the conflict and where's the sort of competition?</p><p>SIMPIWE KENNETH TSHABALALA: I think, first of all, South African policy on the financial sector and banking is very, very clear. It follows world best practice. We're at the cutting-edge of the implementation of Basel. We continue to be highly rated by international bodies, including The World Economic Forum. So there's no market failure, I would submit. That's the first proposition.</p><p>The second one, policymakers want greater inclusion, but they want greater inclusion at some cost, and somebody has to pay for that. The levels of inclusion required are not -- cannot reasonably be expected to be paid for by commercial banks and their shareholders, and therefore, the authorities have decided that they want to establish a state bank to cover that policy imperative.</p><p>Our view is that it's perfectly legitimate to do that. Other countries have got very large and successful state banks. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, for example, is a policy bank and the state bank. Our only requirement, and in fact, it's a demand, and I use the word advisedly, is that such institutions be regulated like all other financial institutions, in other words, requirements for capital, liquidity, risk management frameworks and so forth because you don't want to put depositors at risk and you also don't want to put the system at risk. We speak candidly with authorities on this, and our views are well known to them. We wish them luck. We, I'm sure, will be competing with them in the market. And one only hopes that they will not be forced into risky ventures as is the case with many state banks globally. And the world is littered with failed state banks because of the conflict between commercial imperatives and policy imperatives.</p><p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, you've been a very kind and cooperative audience. Thank you for your attention. Please, would you join us for refreshments outside? And for those on the line, have a good day.

Perfect. Well, welcome, everyone. Good morning, and thank you for all of you who managed to join us in person, and welcome to everyone on the webcast on the call, and good evening to all our Australian investors.</p><p>Today is a little bit of a special day because it's the first set of results for Virgin Money, combining both CYBG and Virgin Money under the rebranded Virgin Money UK PLC.</p><p>I think we'll split it into 4 headings today. We're expecting to take no longer than 40 minutes and followed by Q&amp;A. I will walk you through some of the highlights of the past year, then Ian will take you through some of the financial results. Then I'll ask Lucy Dimes, our Group Business Transformation Officer and the newest member of our leadership team, to talk to you about the next steps in our integration, but more importantly, what Lucy is doing together with Ian and Fraser, to deliver the broader business transformation. Finally, I'll come back and share my views on the outlook for the business in the years ahead.</p><p>So before I address the highlights of the year, some of which you will see here, I would like to take a moment to recognize that this has been a tough year for our investors. We have announced a statutory loss today after absorbing the PPI provision, and our performance has also been hindered a little by a weaker macro environment and, as you know, margin pressures due to ring-fencing and mortgage competition.</p><p>Whilst the macro environment is one challenge we all face, I was personally very frustrated at the scale of provisions that had to be set aside for the final phase of PPI. I mean I think while most banks suffered in a similar manner, and I know that's of cold comfort to our shareholders. But I think, as you know, it's something that's kind of outside of our control, but the consequences of the size of the provision are very real for our investors.</p><p>Now we are at the passing of the time of our deadline and we've committed to remediating our customers -- or eligible customers in a timely manner, and I think you mustn't forget that customers have suffered here, too. But this legacy issue, which has been very frustrating for our customers and our shareholders, should now be fading into the past.</p><p>With regards to provisions, we have assessed a good proportion of the PPI information requests, which have given rise to the provision in Q4. I think I'm confident that the provisions we have taken -- I'm confident in the provisions we've taken because we're dealing with the results of claims processing that we control. So it's much more we control rather than trying to estimate the incoming volume of information requests, which was much more difficult to control. However, I'll leave it to Ian to take you through our detailed assumptions on this subject a little bit later.</p><p>We've also taken the difficult decision to suspend our dividend in 2019. Again, this is disappointing for our shareholders, but we felt that this was an appropriately conservative decision to take in the circumstances. That being said, we will reconsider our dividends for 2020, in line with normal practice.</p><p>However, notwithstanding the provision and the discussion, I believe that our robust capital position with a CET1 ratio of 13.3% provides us with sufficient capital and resources to deliver on our strategy.</p><p>If I can now maybe turn to the underlying performance of the business. Overall, I'm very pleased that we've delivered a resilient operating performance, and that's despite several complex headwinds in the marketplace. Our income has held up well, I mean, I think in the face of a very competitive environment. And whilst our NIM declined due to continued pressure from the mortgage book churn, we do anticipate a stabilization of that NIM as we move into 2020. Obviously, the markets that we're operating in, as you know, still carry a degree of volatility, and therefore, uncertainty.</p><p>If you look at our 3 lines of business, they've all performed well, and we've seen good growth across the portfolio with above-market asset growth in business and personal and, as we've highlighted, disciplined growth in mortgages. And importantly, at the same time, our asset quality has remained resilient and stable.</p><p>I think as you've heard us say before, our business lending is sector-driven and we're supported by 300-plus relationship managers with an average of 14 years' experience. And this sector expertise is very important in maintaining the quality of the business lending that we originate. And it is worth remembering, I suppose, especially in the context of today's climate, that we do not lend to high street retail or to commercial real estate. Similarly, most of our growth in unsecured lending is driven by Virgin Money's more affluent, higher quality credit card book. And in personal loans, we have seen good growth in our salary-deducted loan offering through our salary finance joint venture.</p><p>And we've also, in the past year, talked a lot about our liability strategy, and it was encouraging to see that the overall deposit growth of 4.6% was strong and partly achieved through good growth in our lower cost relationship deposits. Ian will talk more about that later.</p><p>Apart from the growth and the funding of the business, a key part of our strategy is the ability to achieve this growth whilst managing to reduce costs. We have delivered GBP 53 million in run rate net cost savings this year, and our 2019 costs are within guidance. Encouragingly as well, we remain on track to deliver our overall envelope of our cost target, which is less than GBP 780 million by the end of 2022.</p><p>The integration program is going well, it's on track. And I was especially pleased that we're able to complete the Part VII process faster than we had initially expected. And that means that we're now able to move forward on the integration of our customer platforms, which as you know, supports our cost-saving and other commercial ambitions.</p><p>As I've said, the leadership team and I particularly have been quite frustrated by the PPI outcome, but we haven't let it distract us and we remain focused on the strength of our underlying business. I think that we have delivered well on the initiatives this year, which are -- where the outcome was in our control. For example, we've completed the process of the acquisition of Virgin Money, including the Part VII approval. We've achieved IRB accreditation and announced, as you know, our medium-term strategy and targets at our Capital Markets Day.</p><p>In parallel, we also developed our strong technology platform and product capabilities. And for example, we executed joint ventures with Aberdeen Standard Life and Salary Finance and launched the GoCompare utility switching capability.</p><p>While Aberdeen Standard Life's still in its early stages, Salary Finance was responsible for around 25% of our growth in personal loans during the year. Our utility app, it's interesting, it's proven a demand for what we'd call beyond banking services and has saved in the pilot test an average of GBP 290 per customer. And this GoCompare capability will actually be included in our new Virgin Money app launch in December, which we'll talk about in a minute.</p><p>From an internal perspective, I'm actually quite proud of the way the organization came together to deliver our purpose and values. More than 2,000 of our colleagues have input into this work, which is now being embedded in literally everything that we do. And the success of that initiative has had a positive impact on the critical mission of integrating our 2 cultures, which we can evidence by our engagement score of 76% for the combined group. And that is after all of the work we did on integration and everything else.</p><p>As I said, also, I think this has been a good year for delivery on key initiatives, but we've also, at the same time, had to address substantial material legacy issues, which as I've said, are now coming to a close.</p><p>In addition to all of that work, we had the Part VII approval, and we had to manage 2 entirely separate banks plus 4 brands during that period. And the combination of these activities actually drew quite heavily on the management resources. And that being said, I think we're now in a position where the bank is at an inflection point. We -- in the next few years, the leadership team will be able to focus on delivering our targets that we've talked about rather than managing legacy issues or the complexity of an acquisition. We'll be, in simple terms, managing 1 bank with 1 brand, 1 technology platform and a culture defined by our agreed purpose and values and the overall envelope of a clearer strategy to deliver double-digit returns for our shareholders.</p><p>To understand the details of how we'll do this, let me now hand you over to Ian to review our financial performance. Thank you.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH, GROUP CFO &amp; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, VIRGIN MONEY UK PLC: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone and good evening to those listening in from Australia, it's good to be talking to you again.</p><p>So I think this snapshot of the first year of the combined business tells a pretty good story of the operating performance of the business and early progress against the strategy we announced on the 19th of June this year. Now I won't stray too far out of my comfort zone by talking about nonfinancial measures here, I'll leave that to my colleagues. But suffice to say that we're very focused on winning in the key battleground of customer experience, and our people are up for the fight.</p><p>We saw good growth in business and personal lending while taking a measured approach to the mortgage market. And we grew deposits faster than lending, supported by good growth in our all-important relationship deposit balances. We hit our net interest margin guidance and delivered positive jaws with a strong performance on costs. We saw a higher cost of risk year-on-year, and we explained that at the interim that it was due to a combination of asset mix, IFRS 9 and a return to normalized levels of impairment.</p><p>However, the surge in PPI towards the end of the financial year was a real kick in the teeth and tipped us into making a loss for 2019. But the KPI that I draw attention to on this page is our underlying return on tangible equity of 10.8%. That's a pretty good outcome from the core business. Now I know that it's underlying, but I think it's a relevant benchmark, given the clear path to converging underlying and statutory profits by 2022.</p><p>And now I'll take you through the numbers in a bit more detail. The core business operating performance has been solid. We hit all of our operating targets, and I think that we're more than holding our own in the testing environment. Macro, competition, legacy and the requirement to run 2 separate banks made for a demanding year. But against that backdrop, we offset income pressure with a good cost outturn, ahead of where we planned to be, and this drove positive jaws. Impairment charges increased as anticipated, and that drove underlying PBT below last year's number. And all of our underlying efficiency, return and earnings KPIs are solid.</p><p>One point I should mention here, though, is the bank levy, as I won't talk about it in anywhere else. The acquisition of Virgin Money brought us within scope of the bank levy for the first time. It's not a number we can really influence, it's a tax. I'm just not allowed to put it in the tax line. And it's going to be with us until either the government decides the banks have done their bit or hell freezes over. So -- however, it's not a big number for us unlike the other major banks, and it doesn't grow much bigger in the foreseeable future.</p><p>As you're aware, we had significant exceptional costs related to the acquisition integration of Virgin Money and very disappointing legacy conduct where we took additional PPI provisions of GBP 385 million at the year-end, giving total PPI costs of GBP 415 million for the year. There are some big numbers here, GBP 804 million in aggregate, driving the loss for the year. But if you take a step back, there are more than GBP 500 million of charges here that we just don't expect to see again.</p><p>Our TNAV per share reduced by 11p. We saw a net TNAV build in the year, even after substantial acquisition integration costs that was overwhelmed by PPI.</p><p>At the interims, we talked about how a portion of restructuring and acquisition costs are one-off in nature. And as we can see here, the second half was all about restructuring and the unwind of acquisition accounting adjustments. I'll explain later the basis of the restructuring costs incurred in the year. We did more than we planned. And the acquisition accounting unwind was lower in the second half because we see lower attrition in lending and we've gone a bit faster on TFS repayment. The important thing to emphasize is that for both items overall or rather the overall cost estimate has not changed even if the phasing is a little different than planned.</p><p>Since we made our announcement on the range of potential additional PPI costs in early September, we've done a great deal of work to settle on our estimate of the provision at GBP 385 million. And I'm going to walk through how we've landed on this number.</p><p>We think this is a realistic and sensible estimate, and the estimation risk in setting this provision is lower than it has ever been. In September, we highlighted that there were 2 key drivers of the costs: one was the rate at which information requests were expected to convert to claims; and two, the time and cost to process the claims. And each of those was a major uncertainty at that stage.</p><p>The work we've done in the last 3 months has indicated a conversion rate of 9% on the 410,000 information requests we received. I'll let the auto cue resolve itself and go back to old school. One second.</p><p>So the work we've done in the last few months has indicated a conversion ratio of 9% on the circa 410,000 information requests received, and that's around the middle of the range we estimated.</p><p>We deployed some smart technology to eliminate duplicate requests and to sort through more than half of the residual IR population looking for PPI markers. Right, normal service has resumed. This saved us around GBP 25 million of IR processing costs compared to our original estimate. And where we couldn't process the IRs digitally, we undertook further sampling.</p><p>We've developed an operational plan that's been approved by the regulator to process the requests and resultant claims between now and the end of September 2020, and that has allowed us to firm up our estimate of operational costs. So what we're working with now is a fixed number of outstanding claims to process, an IR population that has been well scrubbed to establish a conversion rate and a clear operational plan to process the claims. The major assumptions that we use to assess PPI claims costs, such as uphold rates, redress amounts and costs to do, are well understood and stable. And we're not baking in any improvement to these values.</p><p>The main source of information risk -- estimation risk in the past where we got it wrong, there's been a number of complaints coming through the door. That door is now closed, and the principal source of estimation risk is a rate at which the 325,000 IRs we're currently working through convert into actual complaints that we have to remediate. So that's the GBP 175 million bucket.</p><p>Now the digital processing has already identified the number of complaints to be validated for over half of the population, meaning that the estimation risk remains on the 150,000 that we couldn't process digitally. However, our sampling gives us a good level of confidence that our assumptions are appropriate. And while the conclusion of PPI has been unexpectedly painful for our shareholders and the company, it feels that we're putting this damaging legacy item behind us, and we can focus wholly on delivering the strategy and generating good returns to shareholders on a statutory basis.</p><p>So turning to business performance. Deposit growth outstripped lending this year, and the funding engine is in good shape ahead of the launch of our new Virgin Money propositions. The blended average cost of deposits increased by 10 basis points, and around half of that was down to the base rate increase in August 2018 and the other half due to mix.</p><p>We've chopped a lot of wood on the wholesale funding front this year. We've issued RMBS, covered bonds, senior unsecured and Tier 2 debt. And we've paid down GBP 1.3 billion of TFS. And the blended average cost of wholesale funding has increased year-on-year reflecting higher rates, including 25 bps on TFS balances and a slightly richer mix.</p><p>At the interims and in more depth at Capital Markets Day, we talked about our focus on growing relationship deposits. It's a key part of our strategy to grow our base of loyal, engaged, lower cost deposit balances and helping to underpin our margin. We set ourselves a target of delivering high single-digit CAGR in relationship deposits. As you can see, and this is before we've launched our new Virgin Money propositions, we have grown our relationship deposit strongly this year with 7.1% overall and a particularly strong performance in business banking.</p><p>We've called out the blended average cost of these deposits here to highlight, first of all, that it's around 1/3 of the total deposit costs and around 1/5 of the current marginal cost of retail term money.</p><p>Now our business deposit growth includes around GBP 160 million of balances recruited by the RBS incentivized switching scheme. And although we're performing relatively well ourselves, I think it's fair to say that the scheme has got off to a disappointingly slow start. You'll recall that the requirement for increasing competition was to switch 120,000 customers away from RBS in '18 months, so by October 2020. And in the first 7 months of the scheme, only 18,000 customers have switched. Now we've picked up a decent share of those switches, around 20%, in line with what we were targeting. And we're really pleased with the quality of those customers who've also brought in around GBP 100 million of lending. And it looks like we're over-indexing on the larger, more valuable customers, and that makes sense because we have the capability to match what RBS offers. And that's really the critical point. We're focused on recruiting meaningful balances much more than the number of customer switches.</p><p>And while we've got line of sight to further potential switches in the pipeline of balances, the scheme really needs to pick up the pace or there's a serious risk that it will fall short of the all-important competition objective. As you can imagine, we're working as best we can with the BCR and RBS to drive this scheme harder.</p><p>So the picture on lending is exactly what we painted at Capital Markets Day: strong growth in personal, continued progress in business lending and measured growth in mortgage balances. The personal division saw good growth in cards and personal loan balances, levering our strong cards platform, the substantial improvements in digital PL acquisition and the launch of our JV with Salary Finance.</p><p>Underlying growth in the business book, stripping out the balances recruited from RBS via the switching scheme, was 3.3%.</p><p>Now turning to margin. The moving parts in our net interest margin are clear. The average yield on the mortgage book reduced by 12 basis points year-on-year, and that's the now familiar story of the impact of mortgage market competition. In contrast, we have seen the average yield on the business portfolio increase by 23 basis points, a combination of rate and pricing improvements. Similarly, we've seen a strong increase in the yield on personal lending, driven mainly by cards where we've benefited from acquiring a more seasoned book with stronger cash yield.</p><p>And as we saw a few slides earlier, we absorbed an increase in deposit costs last year, a function of the August 2018 base rate increase and our deposit mix. And that reduced our net interest margin to 166 basis points in line with our guidance.</p><p>So turning to next year. We expect our net interest margin to be relatively resilient through FY '20, and let me explain why. The 2 key drivers of NIM reduction in 2019 were mortgages and deposits, and we don't expect either of these to play such a big part in the 2020 NIM evolution. Competition in the U.K. mortgage market and the squeeze on margins has dominated the conversation about NIM for the past few years. And really, the key impact has been back to front book compression with new business coming on at lower rates than the balances rolling off, and growing our mortgage book aggressively in that environment compounds the problem. And we've argued for some time that our book is less exposed to this effect going forward. And this chart on the left, which shows the impact of mortgage churn on our margin, supports that argument.</p><p>So just to be clear, the purple yield line on the top represents the yield on those balances, which churned or redeemed in the period and were effectively repriced at the front book rate, which is the red line below. And this is the most relevant comparison because that's what drives the margin impact. Through 2018 and 2019, the top of bank NIM pressure eased a little because the gap between back and front yields has narrowed and because net lending growth has been dialed back. In 2020, we expect the gap to be even smaller. And recalling the expression that Hugh used at Capital Markets Day, \"We're not straining for growth in mortgages.\" As a result, we don't expect further NIM compression -- further significant pressure on our NIM this year from mortgage competition. In 2019, the biggest delta in our NIM related to deposits. And similarly, we're not expecting a repeat. Half of the increase in 2019 was due to the base rate, and we're not expecting to see a base rate rise anytime soon.</p><p>The other half related to mix. We grew strongly in savings, and that increased the blended average cost of deposits. We expect the mix of deposit growth in 2020 to be more helpful. With a stronger proportion of lower cost relationship deposits alongside our savings growth.</p><p>The third project driver in the NIM evolution is the tailwind of changing our asset mix. Now that had a positive impact in 2019, and we expect to see more of the same in 2020.</p><p>And finally, and this is what makes the guidance for 2020 harder to call, is the impact of the rate environment, and in particular, the short end of the yield curve. Right now, that's not very helpful. The narrowing of the gap between base and LIBOR that we've seen over the last few months as the market has elected to price-in the possibility of rate cut has hurt us. And in Q4 of 2019, it probably cost us a couple of basis points on NIM.</p><p>We think that the outcome of the general election will be a critical driver of interest rate expectations. We're not calling it either way, just to be clear. Our track record in predicting what the electorate will do is somewhat patchy. But whatever outcome we get is likely to set a new path for interest rates. Accordingly, we're guiding to a range for 2020 NIM of 160 to 165 basis points with a base case somewhere in the middle of that range. And to be clear, that assumes that current market conditions and the interest rate environment persist.</p><p>One note of caution for all of you out there, it should be clear that the way we expect NIM to evolve driven by mix will mean a gradual build over the year. As ever, we're guiding to an annual outcome, and you shouldn't be surprised if the quarterly results are a little lumpy. I've already mentioned the unhelpful impact of the rate environment on the Q4 exit rate, for example.</p><p>On fee income, I wanted to draw a couple of key points out at this point. Performance in the year and a reminder of some impacts going on the fee base going into next year. Business fee income is going well. We saw this as a growth area from broadening our offering and growing our customer base, and it's good to see that coming through. The year-on-year increase is down to a better all-round performance. Gavin's guys have really knuckled down. And the introduction of the new business debit card during the year that has had great traction.</p><p>Personal fee income continues to be under pressure though, and that's a familiar story across the industry. We've reduced fees on a number of items over the years. And last year, we saw significant reduction in charges for returned items alongside lower account fees. Although this was partly offset by higher interchange fees from the VAA card base. We also saw lower fees from our investment business. As soon after the acquisition, we reduced our asset management charges, and that was really necessary as Virgin Money was somewhat out of the market.</p><p>Looking into next year, we'll see business fees go from strength to strength, but there'll be further pressure on the personal fee base as we'll reduce our overdraft fees, along with everyone else in the industry.</p><p>And a final heads up is a reminder that the sale of the unit trust business to the joint venture with Aberdeen Standard means we now recognize our share of the JV profits rather than the full income and expenses of that business.</p><p>So turning to the costs. We've made excellent progress on costs this year, bringing the OpEx base down from GBP 998 million to GBP 942 million. We delivered on our market guidance despite a 4-month delay in completion of the investment JV, meaning we outperformed on core costs. One of the key drivers, of course, was integration synergies, and we outperformed here too landing GBP 60 million of run rate cost synergies against our plan of GBP 50 million with net synergies after the incremental brand license fee of GBP 53 million.</p><p>The costs to do incurred in the year were GBP 156 million. These were higher than planned because we brought GBP 38 million of restructuring costs forward into 2019, while the related run rate benefits of GBP 30 million were not crystallized last year. They won't be recognized until later in 2020.</p><p>The accelerated cost pertaining to the announcement at the end of September, 12 months early, of the consolidation of our operating locations and the closure of 3 major offices, Edinburgh, Norwich and Merrion Way in Leeds, along with the related FTE exits. We decided that giving our colleagues clarity as early as possible was the right thing to do, and announcing the closures meant we had to provide for the costs.</p><p>Now that we've completed the Part VII process, integration will switch gears. 2019 was all about going after the low-hanging fruit, delayering senior management, reducing investment spend, managing our supplier base. In 2020 and '21, we'll be integrating customer platforms and operations, deduplicating and refreshing the branch network. And at the same time, we'll be bringing the customer proposition to life under one brand.</p><p>We'll maintain our momentum, delivering GBP 50 million of additional run rate synergies in 2020. But it's important to note that the initiatives are weighted to the second half of the year, especially the branch cost savings, and that limits the in-year benefits. We're, therefore, guiding that we expect our operating expenses to be less than GBP 900 million next year with a very strong exit rate into 2021.</p><p>We're also reaffirming our estimate of the aggregate restructuring and rebranding costs at GBP 360 million. And just to remind everybody, the rebrand costs are GBP 60 million all-in, and we expect to incur most of that in 2020. So you know our track record on costs, and we're off to a strong start with a very clear path to our 2022 cost target.</p><p>Our net cost of risk increased to 21 basis points year-on-year, and we talked about what was driving this at our interims. And I think the drivers of the increase were clearly understood back then, and hopefully, the full year picture is consistent with what I said at the time. It's really all about business and personal. The mortgage book continues to see negligible losses.</p><p>In business, what you can see is a return to more normal levels of gross cost of risk after an unusually benign 2018. And in some respects, compared to the run rate in the first half was probably still a little underweight in 2019. Our business portfolio continues to perform well and notwithstanding the more uncertain economic environment.</p><p>Cost of risk and unsecured has increased by 83 basis points over the last 12 months. And there are several contributors here, and none of them any cause for concern. We've seen a seasoning of the cards book over the last 18 months or so, as new business rolls through into more mature cohorts. And then there's the IFRS 9 effect. Now IFRS 9 was implemented in the VM book at the start of 2018 and in the CYB book from 1 October 2018. And IFRS 9 accelerates the recognition of provisions, especially the unsecured lending without changing the overall lifetime losses. And we said at the interims that we estimated that more than half of the increase in unsecured cost of risk stems from the implementation of IFRS 9.</p><p>Asset quality is in good shape across the board, and we're not seeing signs of increasing stress in any of our portfolios. We've maintained our tight underwriting discipline throughout. And actually, the quality of business we've been writing in 2019 has been, on average, better than in previous years.</p><p>Credit conditions remain relatively benign. And the macro drivers of credit stress, such as interest and unemployment rates, are still quite subdued. But some commentators are worried about a weaker economic outlook. And in response, we've increased our Brexit-related reserves, and our book is well provisioned.</p><p>Turning to capital. We generated 77 basis points of CET1 before exceptional charges, pretty much enough to cover the restructuring acquisition costs. Our PPI accounted for 172 basis points to CET1. Now we've been clear on the outlook for these exceptional items, and that should help show the path to healthy free capital generation. The leverage ratio remains strong. We're comfortably ahead of the game on meeting our 2020 MREL requirement of 21.5%.</p><p>So after absorbing PPI, the group remains well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 13.3%. We're above our medium-term operating level of circa 13%, and hold a substantial buffer to our CRD IV minimum requirement to 11%. Remember, that includes a reduction of 60 basis points to our Pillar 2A requirement compared to the CMD picture.</p><p>Nevertheless, given the substantial absorption of capital by additional PPI costs, the Board has reexamined the group's strategy and capital requirements. We expect to be net capital-generative from 2021, as the burden of exceptional charges is substantially reduced and the benefits of cost reduction and other actions are realized. That's driven a focus on 2020 and the need to conserve capital in the short term and the consideration of a full range of organic and inorganic options to enhance the group's capital position.</p><p>Accordingly, the Board has determined that it would be prudent to suspend the ordinary dividend for 2019, but no other inorganic capital action is considered necessary.</p><p>After taking this action, the Board considers that the group's capital position is robust and provides sufficient capacity to execute the strategy and deliver on the performance targets for 2022. And all other things being equal, we would expect to recommence ordinary dividends in 12 months' time. However, the Board will decide on the resumption dividends later in 2020 having regard to capital generation and other pertinent factors at that time.</p><p>So to finish up, the group remains on track to deliver on its medium-term targets. In 2020, we expect to deliver a net interest margin between 160 and 165 basis points. We will reduce our underlying operating expenses below GBP 900 million and operate with a CET1 ratio of circa 13%. As discussed, we'll reconsider the capacity for ordinary dividends in FY '20, and it's our current expectation to recommence dividend payments at the end of financial year '20.</p><p>Today, we're also reaffirming the strategy and targets for 2022, including our intention to deliver a statutory RoTE of more than 12%.</p><p>So I hope my remarks have helped shine a light on our performance, and I guess I'll find out when we get to Q&amp;A.</p><p>In the meantime, I'll hand over to Lucy. Lucy?</p><p>LUCY DIMES, GROUP BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION OFFICER, VIRGIN MONEY UK PLC: Thank you, Ian. Good morning to everyone in London, and good evening to those of you joining from Australia. I'm delighted to be here presenting to you today.</p><p>I joined the group back in July at what is an incredibly exciting time for the bank. To begin with, I'd like to take a few minutes to explain my background, which I hope will reinforce why David appointed me to the role of Group Business Transformation Officer.</p><p>The majority of my career has been spent in technology services businesses. I spent a large chunk of my career in British Telecom. And in my last role as the Managing Director of Group &amp; Openreach Service Operations, I led a transformation program, which realized GBP 100 million of annualized cost savings. And before that, I led the group's strategic partnering program. I then held roles at Equiniti as the Chief Operating Officer; at Fujitsu as the CEO for the U.K. and Ireland; and most recently, I was the CEO for EMEA at UBM, where I led the growth strategy, which is focused on digitizing and transforming the business.</p><p>So you may recall that at the last Capital Markets Day, we talked about our 4 stages of development since we IPO-ed and since we acquired Virgin Money: to simplify, to digitize, to integrate and to transform.</p><p>So having exited from NAB and delivered IRB and built the new iB digital platform, the initial stages of simplifying and digitizing our business are now largely complete. And so our focus has shifted to integration and transformation.</p><p>My role is to execute the transformation work streams, which underpin both the GBP 200 million of net cost savings and our broader strategic growth objectives.</p><p>The first of these is to leverage the iB platform, our modern, scalable digital platform, which we have invested in over the last few years. The second is to support the development of a bigger, bolder Virgin Money brand by bringing the strengths of the 2 businesses together and leveraging the power and the reach of that iconic Virgin brand. David will talk a bit more about this later, so I won't steal his thunder just now.</p><p>Next, to drive those significant synergies, we need to deliver the integration of the 2 banks. And finally, we need to establish a much more agile, disruptive digital change capability and take advantage of the unique partnership opportunities available to us through the wider Virgin Group as well as other innovative complementary partners. And importantly, we will deliver all of this within the cost envelope we've previously announced.</p><p>So as I mentioned just now, the real prize from our business transformation will be delivering leading customer experiences that support our growth ambitions. The foundation for this is our digital iB platform, which is the strategic platform for all of our products and services. And because of its modular LEGO brick architecture, we can now take a much more modern, agile approach to innovation.</p><p>We're, therefore, creating a disruption hub in Newcastle, which will bring together multidisciplinary teams from across the business to rapidly design and deliver new product features and app enhancements. Now this will create a new way of working within the group, which we expect to permeate the entire bank over time. And we'll be launching this in January, and we're building a capability that will scale to around 200 to 300 people by the end of 2020.</p><p>We will combine this with our unique partnering model, leveraging the Virgin family that we're now part of and commercial partners, such as GoCompare and Salary Finance, to deliver an improved customer experience.</p><p>Our hub initiative is the icing on the cake of a transformation agenda that underpins GBP 200 million of net cost savings, and as Ian has already mentioned, the GBP 53 million of run rate net cost savings we've delivered in 2019.</p><p>I'd now like to take you through the detail of what we said we would do, what we've done so far and what we're doing next. The first, organizational design related to the deduplication of senior management roles, so executives, nonexecutives, senior managers. We've achieved half of the synergies in 2019. And with FSMA Part VII now complete, we can operate as a single bank, which will release the remaining roles to deliver a further GBP 20 million of savings.</p><p>We also commenced the central costs work stream in 2019 and achieved just under half of the expected synergies. For example, through procurement savings and the closure of the Virgin Money London office. And in September, we also announced our end-state location strategy and are now progressing the 3 office closures in Edinburgh, Norwich and Leeds over the next 2 years. And we'll also progress further procurement and sponsorship savings to complete this work stream.</p><p>With Part VII complete, the operational work stream is also now able to progress at pace, and we made a good start on this last year, achieving GBP 12 million of the GBP 45 million of expected savings. And we're now focused on realizing the remainder of the 1,500 role synergies across back office, middle office and functional areas.</p><p>Now some of these roles are dependent on technology enablers such as platform closures and process automation, but a significant proportion will exit in 2020 and then with the remainder in 2021. The smallest of the integration work streams is network efficiency, which is the consolidation of the branch network, and this is also on track. For the benefit of doubt, there are no changes to our network efficiency program or our head count reductions. We are simply progressing with the original plan we announced at the time of the transaction.</p><p>The fifth work stream, digital and change is now up and running and will see us truly leverage the platform that we've built supported by a disruption hub capability. For example, we'll drive digital channel adoption and customer self-service to significantly reduce printing and postage costs as well as introducing a strategic sourcing approach that will enable us to consolidate our supplier base from 2,000 today to 1,000 over time.</p><p>These initiatives will help us deliver a highly efficient cost base and also give me the confidence in our ability to deliver our sub GBP 780 million cost base in 2022. And importantly, we will also deliver a faster and better innovation capability and unique supply side and go-to-market partnerships, creating the platform for us to really disrupt the status quo.</p><p>I'll finish there and now hand over to David, who will talk you through the outlook for next year and beyond. Thank you.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Thanks, Lucy. Great job. Great. Thank you, Lucy. There's a lot in there. I think it can be very clear to you that we will maintain the focus on integration and cost management relentlessly. But we also want to transform our business from a customer perspective. So let me talk to you a little bit about our focus on that in the medium term.</p><p>We've talked for the last few years about how we're transforming our technology platform. And as you know, iB is now built, and all of our customers and products and services will soon be on 1 platform. And what that means is we'll soon be able to operate with a single open API technology platform that will support the development of new propositions and the integration of our fintech partners across the next year. If you look at that, that's a tremendously strong capability. But also given the competitive dynamics in the marketplace, we need to be able to deliver new experiences and propositions in weeks, not months or years, and we need to have the same innovation capability as any competitor, small or large. The creation of the disruption hub that Lucy has talked about will allow us to do this, and it is the investment in our iB platform that has made that possible.</p><p>I think it's important, though, to do far more than improve processes. We want to create world-class experiences. And the acquisition of Virgin Money has given us the ability to deliver what I think are unique solutions, which combine a great brand, which we know for it -- which is known for its service, our innovative technology that we built and value for money propositions and national distribution. But if you stand back, what I think is truly unique is that we will be able to offer access to up to 25 Virgin Group companies. And just to be clear, this is not just theory. We already operate the Virgin Atlantic credit card partnership. And that has delivered over 130,000 valuable customer accounts.</p><p>And that's the first part of the story. But we also want to further improve the value outcome for customers by combining a group-wide loyalty program with value-based propositions. What does that mean? Not only will our customers get value on the acquisition of a product, but they will also earn loyalty points and benefits across the products when they use them. And we are working very closely with the Virgin Group on the development of that group-wide loyalty and rewards program, and I expect we will deliver our initial propositions during the first half of 2020.</p><p>We are also making good progress on a number of propositions for our mortgage business as highlighted by Hugh in our Capital Markets Day, and the first of these will also launch in the first half of 2020.</p><p>It's also important to remember, it's not just the retail business that we're focused on, as part of our launch, we will announce a full-capability business current account in the first half of next year, and Gavin's team are busy working on that.</p><p>It's also interesting because as we launch the Virgin Money brand nationally, we will benefit from the halo effect of being part of the broader Virgin Group. And specifically, we're going to be taking part in the 50th anniversary of the Virgin brand, yes, it's 50 next year, makes us all feel quite old. And we'll be working with a lot of the other Virgin companies, and this allows us to combine our presence and impact in core Northern cities like Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds. So when you're in those locations, you have a massive presence as an employer and as a brand.</p><p>I'll give you an example. We'll have a number of joint events, and we're talking to specifically Virgin Atlantic and others. But they will demonstrate that the brand of the company and the diversity of that brand across every one of our key locations, and it will also allow us to market each other's products in many of those locations.</p><p>Now as we go national, we're launching the Virgin Money brand, of course, and it will have its traditional red look and feel. However, we will be deploying a contemporary version of the brand for different segments of the markets, and that will really demonstrate the power and the flexibility of the brand across our business.</p><p>It's going to be a pretty busy year ahead, but we're starting to deliver on the benefits of the acquisition right now. So our first Virgin Money national product launches next week. The Virgin Money current account will be available and will include all of the B app features, which now has a current NPS of 52, and there are a lot more elements included in it as well. We think the combination of the innovative B digital platform and the Virgin brand will be a great start. And I would think it's better than most that I can see in the market, if not all.</p><p>In addition to our product and proposition launches, of course, we will convert 3 of our flagship branches into our new Virgin Money concept stores in Manchester, Birmingham and London. So they will be a very, very visible high street brand presence. In line with the current account launch, the rebranding process will also begin in December with the rebranding of B to Virgin Money and the launch of a new Virgin Money current account app to complement the recently launched Virgin Money credit card app. So a lot of things happening.</p><p>One of the most important aspects of this activity is the innovative branding and marketing campaigns that will be delivered, and you will see those start in January and be pretty much on all the time after that. I'm pretty excited about what we'll be delivering. And internally, in the bank, the whole bank is actually eager to see us move from the past to the future now that we have permission to integrate this brand.</p><p>We are now moving into a phase of delivery. I think we've been planning a lot, but it is now a delivery phase. And over the next couple of years, we will roll out the complete rebranding of all of our products, propositions, technology platform and physical locations.</p><p>So as we stated at the Capital Markets Day, as a bank we have the trust and the product and service capability of a major bank, combined with the ability to innovate and particularly with customer experiences like fintechs can. As the market develops, though, we're also working with other non-Virgin partners and service providers because we think there are other propositions with great value for money from -- for our customers that we could develop. We will update further on those kinds of discussions as we develop them throughout 2020.</p><p>But at its core, I firmly believe that Virgin Money is unique in the marketplace. I mean we will be the only bank that can offer value through a broad range of banking and nonbanking services with integrated discounts, points and loyalty-based offerings. And we'll deliver all of those services as 1 bank with a single technology platform, 1 brand, and it's a fintech and partnership-friendly platform, and this will be supported by the disruption hub that Lucy discussed and will deliver world-class customer experiences. That's pretty unique in the marketplace.</p><p>In short, it's now time to deliver on our ambitions for Virgin Money. And as I look at all of this, I'm absolutely confident that we will deliver and that our purpose of making you happier about money will guide us in our ambition to disrupt the status quo. But critically, being successful will allow us to deliver sustainable returns to both our existing and new investors and will ensure great outcomes for all of our broader stakeholders.</p><p>So thank you. I will close there, and we will now turn to questions. I think we're going to start with questions in the room, Andrew, and then we will pass mics around, and then we will come on to the call and to the webcast shortly after. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: I think we have one right here. We'll get to you next.</p><p>ROHITH CHANDRA-RAJAN, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Rohith Chandra-Rajan, Bank of America. Your revenue expectations for next year are very much predicated on growth, particularly in business and personal lending. And I guess, we've seen some evidence of that certainly in the second half of this year. So business looks like it was growing in the second half, annualized around 11%, consumer at 22%. And that's really, I guess, before the integration takes hold, although in business, there was some Williams &amp; Glyn or RBS -- sorry, benefit. So I was just wondering if you could scale your aspirations in terms of volume growth for next year because that seems to be the key thing in terms of the revenue outlook, both in net interest income and fees.</p><p>And then secondly, just to understand, I think it was the left-hand side of Slide 16, in terms of your mortgage expectations for next year. And I think the margin outlook is pretty clear, relatively flat is your expectation. But then the bottom chart there seemed to imply sort of new lending and kind of refinancing, offsetting one another, so relatively flat mortgage book. So just really to try and get your sense of growth in business, personal and mortgages for next year.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Sure. Do you want to take that, Ian?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. Thanks, Rohith. So I think you've called the direction of travel correctly. It is my favorite expression, actually, that Hugh used at Capital Markets Day, which is, \"We're not straining for growth in mortgages.\" And our ambition there is principally to retain our market share. We don't expect to see much growth in the mortgage market next year. And so I would expect us to hold our own and not much more than that. And that, as I say, means that we're going to see that easing of pressure on the NIM from mortgage business.</p><p>As far as the rest of our businesses and the outlook overall, we said that we would expect to grow above market, and that's -- that remains our guidance. I think that I wouldn't read too much into the sort of half-on-half growth rates in business. It's a fairly lumpy profile given -- or has been a fairly lumpy profile and because it depends on customer drawdowns and repayments, those sorts of things. But that broad trajectory of sort of 4.5% or so, is the right number to focus on. And personal is important to us.</p><p>So our guidance is above-market growth. And you can see what we think about what we're going to be doing in mortgages. And I think that the direction of travel for our other key businesses is clear.</p><p>ROHITH CHANDRA-RAJAN: And could I just follow up then in terms of balancing growth aspirations and capital returns? So you said that your expectation is to, all else being equal, resume the dividend next year, but you don't expect to be capital-generative until 2021. Just trying to square those 2 things.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: So I guess, first of all, what I'd point to is in addition to the sort of generation of capital from earnings, we've shown ourselves to be pretty good RWA husbandry and managing that side of the book. So I think the important thing is the Board will look at capital generation, a whole bunch of other things. And I would expect -- I'd like to manage expectations at the sort of modest levels in terms of our assumption, so I'm not particularly concerned about that.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: I think we have 2 over here, just by the post. Thank you.</p><p>FAHED IRSHAD KUNWAR, RESEARCH ANALYST, REDBURN (EUROPE) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Fahed Kunwar from Redburn. Just wanted to understand, I think, on Slide 45, there's a hedge slide where you talk about a kind of increase in your hedge portfolio. But the number that seems most important, just so I make sure I understand this, is the net NII booked from the hedge is GBP 30 million. Is that correct?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes, that's correct.</p><p>FAHED IRSHAD KUNWAR: Okay. And so for other banks, obviously, the steep in the yield curve is a reduction of a negative. But for yourselves, if you do get a steep in yield curve, should we think about incrementally positive NII coming from that hedge portfolio, considering you're basically booking hardly any your hedge income right now? That was my first question.</p><p>My second question was on other operating income. So half-on-half, it was quite a big decline in other operating income. I appreciate you gave some color. But was any of the kind of reduction that expected in 2020, did any of it come into that reduction in the second half of the year? Or what was behind that reduction? Should we assume kind of that's the run rate going forward?</p><p>And the last question, just on the -- the funding cost plans are a big component to your flat margin guidance going forward. If the RBS kind of incentivization plan is going slower, from memory, the business current account benefit was kind of the deposit benefit upfront and the personal current accounts were going to come later on in the plan. Should we assume that if that's going slower, then that funding cost benefit takes longer to come through because the business current account isn't quite going as fast as you expected?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Okay. Thanks, Fahed. So yes, you're spot on in terms of your hypothesis on hedge income, and the impact of a steepening yield curve would be helpful for us. I think the OOI position half-on-half, I guess, what you saw through the second half was the impact -- in terms of sort of real business, the impact of the asset management fee. We reduced that from 1 January. So that came through much more strongly in the second half. And some other bits and pieces in there. We saw a slightly stronger first half, say, from business. We earn some chunky fees sometimes on customer business there.</p><p>So in terms of how we see that going forward, I think the things to bear in mind is the -- being fee from the investment business are now out and we have the impact as we flagged around GBP 10 million on high cost of credit. So I think factoring those into your expectations for next year alongside the full year performance is the right way to look at it.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: I think, John, just beside you. Along here.</p><p>JOHN CRONIN, FINANCIAL ANALYST, GOODBODY STOCKBROKERS, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's John Cronin from Goodbody. Just 2 from myself. One is, again, going back to the unsecured lending growth, you've mentioned clearly most of -- or much of that is coming through the affluent credit card customer base that was Virgin Money's book that you acquired. But can you speak a little about what's happening in the rest of that book in terms of unsecured personal lending product and what kind of growth rates you're experiencing there and also in terms of credit quality?</p><p>And secondly, going back to Lucy's presentation, on Slide 25, you mentioned big tech and fintech partnerships. Just wondering more broadly in the context of this disruption you speak about, anything we can be expecting on a near-term or a medium-term view in terms of such partnerships that would be transformational for your personal business.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Sure. Thanks, John. I'll waffle on about unsecured growth, and then Lucy can come in with the partnership piece.</p><p>I think -- so cards continues to do well, and we understand the quality of that business and the quality of the platform. I think that there's an additional feature this year that is important to understand, which is that we've seen, certainly in percentage terms, really strong growth in personal loans. Now it's off a very low base, so a couple of hundred million on a GBP 750 million base. But that's coming from 2 places. The first is, as we've talked about, the launch of Salary Finance. And we're really, really pleased with that and the progress that we've made. And then the second is we've talked for a long time about lack of capability in personal loans. And that was the thing that was holding us back, both from a sort of cost-to-acquire perspective but also just that sort of risk management and the risk of negative selection. If you're not really good with the aggregators, you get some of the poorer bits of business. So we've worked very hard at that. And in particular, at our aggregated proposition, we've become much more competitive there in terms of being able to win business via aggregators. And so our personal loan business has really gone from strength to strength this year.</p><p>It's good quality. I mean the asset quality measures of arrears and all those sorts of things are in good shape. But importantly, the things that we look at in bringing that business on, so affordability and customer indebtedness are all really good compared to previous years. And that's what we've been looking for, as I say, to avoid that negative selection. And then finally, we also look at sort of the probability of default in those lines and again, much stronger than business we've written in the past. So our growth in personal has been both on the cards and the -- on the unsecured personal loan side but really happy with the quality.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: And Lucy?</p><p>LUCY DIMES: Yes. And in terms of the partnerships, we can't announce anything today, but the -- we've got lots of conversations going on. The focus of our near-term activity is the Virgin Group because, obviously, there's fantastic opportunities there. We have other conversations happening on the supply side and the go-to-market side. And I guess, the key point is probably that we're feeling very attractive as a partner. We've got a great brand. We've got the agility now to do things quickly with the disruption hub. Our platform is easy to bolt things on to. So I think more to come in this space, but nothing that we can announce exactly at this moment.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: But nice try, John.</p><p>LUCY DIMES: He told me (inaudible)</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: We'll come to one here, and then we'll come over here.</p><p>CHARMSOL YOON, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST OF UK AND EUROPEAN BANKS, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Charmsol from UBS. Regarding your NIM guidance, did you assume liquid asset to decrease or increase? So when I look at your Slide 42, it says you will probably [issue] GBP 3 billion to GBP 3.5 billion of wholesale. And then there will be a GBP 1.8 billion, in Slide 43, to mature, which will give GBP 1.2 billion to GBP 1.7 billion net increase in wholesale funding. And then there will be probably some TFS repayments. I was just wondering whether -- how that will affect your liquid asset position.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Sure.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. Charmsol, lots of detail in your question there. I think the answer is a pretty simple one. So we're carrying quite high levels of liquidity at the moment. Two reasons. We run high on liquidity throughout 2019 because we were waiting for Brexit to happen. And so it still hasn't happened, so we're still holding that. And we also have a specific stock of liquidity to manage the risk of the Part VII. So our customers have until the end of January to determine whether or not they want to withdraw. Withdrawal levels at the moment are extremely low, but we're holding some additional liquidity for that. Once that period has passed, we'll iron that out through the course of the year.</p><p>CHARMSOL YOON: So your NIM guidance doesn't assume that liquid asset position to materially decrease, and hence, it'll rise, correct?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: No, the NIM guidance -- I mean, we expect to be able to reduce our stock of liquidity, and we have baked that into our NIM guidance. So there's no more upside to come in any material [whatsoever].</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: I think we had one over here.</p><p>BENJAMIN TOMS, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ben Toms from RBC. PDI seems to be coming to an end. And it -- but it turned out to be a bigger problem than initially expected. Do you have any view about the recent Treasury Select Committee paper on push payment fraud? Do you think this is an issue? And have you run any numbers internally about it?</p><p>And secondly, consensus expects cost, I think, for 2020, around GBP 880 million. Are you comfortable with that? Or would you prefer if it was closer to the GBP 900 million?</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Do you want to take that, Ian?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Okay.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: So we're not concerned about exposure to push payment fraud is the short answer. We -- we're not going to talk numbers and things at the moment, but we don't have a concern there.</p><p>In terms of consensus, look, I'll reiterate our guidance. We said below GBP 900 million. And we've been pretty good at managing our costs down against that guidance through the year. So I'm going to stick with what we've got out there.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Behind? I think you had one -- you had your hand up here.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER CANT, PARTNER, UNITED KINGDOM AND IRISH BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: It's Chris Cant from Autonomous. I just wanted to ask about EIR. I was looking at your accounting policy disclosures on Page 54 of your release, and it's something that's been topical with some of your peers recently. So I note that you say you assume 83% of SVR customers will fully repay within 2 months or remortgage. If that was to move to 90%, you'd have a GBP 20 million EIR adjustment. I haven't spotted this disclosure before if you've given it previously, but I find it quite interesting. Are you trying to flag that there's a potential EIR adjustment coming, which is something that some of your larger peers have been flagging, is a feature for them in 4Q results which will be your 1Q? That would be the first question.</p><p>And second question, also on EIR, you've also given some commentary around the Virgin card book in terms of the EIR again. Is that something that's building up again? So obviously for Virgin Money stand-alone EIR and the accrual on the balance sheet became a huge topic. When you acquired it, you essentially wrote that balance off. Is that balance now rebuilding? And how large is it today? How large would it be in, say, a year's time? Just wondering if that topic is going to come back around again.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Sure. Thanks, Chris. So the short answer on mortgage EIR is no. I mean the disclosures are there to be helpful. Our SVR balances are both a very small proportion of our book and also pretty stable now. And the key thing that we look at when thinking about mortgage EIR is what's the average period at which mortgage customers spend in SVR, and it's less than 2 months. So no, we're not -- first of all, we think we're pretty prudent on mortgage EIR, and we're not flagging a risk of an adjustment. I think it's -- seems to be a bigger challenge for other people.</p><p>On cards EIR, yes. The balance will build. We zeroed it out at the acquisition. But of course, if you continue to write balance transfer business, 0 rate balance transfer business, it will build again. It is -- it's pretty small. It never gets to the levels that Virgin Money had on a stand-alone basis. So we think it's just deemphasized now, really. And that's because, first of all, in terms of the scale of it compared to our income and our capital base, so very different from the old sort of Virgin Money stand-alone days. And secondly, I think we've got a much more seasoned and a broader book. So we're recruiting balances -- we're recruiting customers on the [BT] product but also on all-round cards, on retail cards, VAA, all those other things. So it's, as I say, deemphasized going forward.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Over here, coming this side? And we'll come to you after that.</p><p>JENNIFER ALEXANDRA COOK, ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jenny Cook from Exane. I just had one on your mortgage maturity profile because I find it quite surprising that for most of this last quarter, you can get a cheaper 5-year fixed rate product for yourselves versus a 2-year fixed rate product. So I was just wondering why you've got negative term premium on your mortgage rates. If you could shed any rationale on why this is the case that would be quite useful.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. Jenny, just let me come back to you on that one. We'll pick that one up off-line because I agree with you that it would seem slightly [anonymous], but I'll come back to you.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Can you pass the mic in front of you? Thank you very much.</p><p>MARTIN LEITGEB, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Martin Leitgeb here from Goldman Sachs. Just maybe a little bit more broader on the mortgage space. I was just wondering if you could elaborate what kind of trends you're seeing in terms of competition. I mean what we can see, obviously, from an external perspective, some players are trying to increase their share of mortgages, but equally there's others dropping out. So it seems to be fairly balanced at this stage. I was just wondering if this is what you are seeing or if you're seeing any discernible change in terms of trends.</p><p>And the second question, more on deposits and the outlook for the average cost of deposits of Virgin Money U.K. going forward. And I think you highlight the important -- the importance of relationship balances in order to drive down the costs over time. I was just wondering if you could shed a little bit of light how we should think about the launch of the new Virgin Money current account product going forward, at what kind of pace of takeup or how should we think about this kind of cost of deposits evolving as this relationship balance, hopefully, get a boost -- a meaningful boost from the new product.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Great. Thank you. I think that from a general mortgage perspective, we've seen a stabilization, if a little bit. We've seen some players losing volume and then cutting their rates. Most recently, I think Nationwide did some of that behavior. But the aggregate behavior of the scale of the market has stabilized a little bit. You've seen a number of small players come out. And I think that's a lot to do with having a monoline business. You don't have the diversity of your liability and asset management around different margins or different businesses. So there has been a softening of the market in terms of those people stepping out. And I think we've seen a calmer, and it seems like the future will be more of that rather than more of the past.</p><p>And then on the deposit side, I mean yes, most of what we do with the Virgin will be the same with what we've done before, it was a linked savings account, which drives a lot of that.</p><p>Do you want to make a comment on that?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Martin. On deposit costs and things, and you've reminded me, I didn't answer all of Fahed's question. So we -- the way we thought about deposit cost is, first of all, the -- in the shorter term, the real advantage is the recruitment of business deposit balances. And I guess, what I'd point to there is the growth of relationship deposits in -- on the business side, Fahed, has been nearly 15% without the benefit of RBS. So I think you're right. RBS will take longer. I think we'll do what we set out to do, but it takes a bit longer. But what's brilliant is that Gavin's guys are out there growing that deposit base without that tailwind already. So I think that -- first of all, that gives us a bit of confidence, Martin, that certainly, in the year ahead, with business being that sort of engine of low-cost deposits, both BAU and RBS, I think that will be a big contributor.</p><p>I think on the proposition side, and we talked about this, the sort of the personal proposition, depositors get a pretty poor deal from high street banks at the moment. And I think that we'll offer something pretty compelling, and that sort of blended average cost of those deposits is going to be far lower than the savings products that we offer savings in [term]. So I think that helps underpin cost of deposits going forward, which we just don't expect to see the increase that we saw in 2019.</p><p>I think what's also telling is what's happening out in terms of deposit pricing. So even the famous Marcus products are reducing in price. And we're just tweaking some of our pricing on deposits at the moment, bringing some of our savings products more in line with current market rates. And that should also provide a bit of a following wind on deposit costs.</p><p>But the key thing for us, sort of medium term over the next 2 to 3 years, is to really get that engine of growth going in terms of recruiting personal customers with a fantastic proposition that will deliver costs of deposits that are lower than the average today.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Should we go -- Andrew, is there any calls on...</p><p>ANDREW DOWNEY, HEAD OF IR, VIRGIN MONEY UK PLC: Yes, we've got some on the phone.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: I'm just going to take one more here, Andrew, before you do that.</p><p>SHAILESH MANSUKHLAL RAIKUNDLIA, ANALYST, PANMURE GORDON (UK) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. It's Shailesh Raikundlia from Panmure Golden. A couple of questions, if I may. Just a follow-up on the sort of EIR with the credit card book. Obviously, the -- you had a big dry down at the time of the acquisition. I was just wondering behaviorally if that's changed. And is there any scope of that? Or is it a bit early at this moment in time for the EIR to be written back at some stage given the fact that it had -- you had a 7-year sort of behavioral sort of maturity rather than the 5 year that you've assumed now?</p><p>And secondly, on the cost of risk, I'm just looking at the fact that your underlying cost of risk was about 27 basis points, and then you had specific releases of 5 basis points. I'm just sort of wondering whether the run rate is more like the 27 basis points or where we are with that.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. Thanks, Shailesh. So in terms of the sort of EIR assumptions, we're sticking with 5 years. We think that's a much better place to be. But while that sounds much more prudent in line with the market, and it is, we also got a real benefit from sort of starting the clock again. And if you look at our -- a chunk of our improvement in unsecured yields is that we were able to recognize that something approaching 40% of the Virgin Money credit card book is now post promo and, therefore, earning cash interest, which made for a stronger overall yield. So I'm very happy that the assumptions are in the right place that we use, not proposing to sort of turn that out further or anything like that. I don't think we should do that, I don't think we need to do that. The business is in great shape.</p><p>On cost of risk, that delta between gross and net, we're not -- we don't expect that to close particularly because a lot of that reflects recoveries. And in particular, with -- in unsecured, we see annual recoveries because we undertake debt sales and other things. So that is what sort of nets us down. And so I'm not concerned that somehow we're exposed to that higher line.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Okay. Thank you. Do we have a question on the call?</p><p>ANDREW DOWNEY: Who was on the phone? I think we've got Ed Henning first</p><p>OPERATOR: Yes, we have 3 questions registered. We have Ed Henning from CLSA.</p><p>EDMUND ANTHONY BIDDULPH HENNING, RESEARCH ANALYST, CLSA LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of things for me. Firstly, the Capital Markets Day was 5 months ago. You've talked about the progress or the -- all the guidances in line. Has there been anything better or worse in your experience in that 5 months that you've achieved so far?</p><p>And then the second one on that, you mentioned at the Capital Markets Day, you're rolling out, obviously, a new business current account and a personal loan all in the first half. And on Slide 28, you talk about business lending and business credit cards. What's the rough thinking on the timing of rolling out those new products?</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Do you want to take the first one, Ian, and I'll follow on?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. So better or worse, Ed. Short term, I think we've got a -- as I said in my remarks, a certainly unhelpful short-term interest rate environment. As I say, let's see where that goes when we get into the new year. I think there are many arguments for suggesting that sort of U.K. interest rates are going to have to rise over time, but let's just see when that happens. And I think that just puts a bit of pressure on to the margin environment. But as we've highlighted, we've got good reasons to believe that our NIM will be resilient into next year.</p><p>In terms of just what's going on in the rest of the business, I think we're doing pretty well despite market uncertainty. And one of the things that we look at coming into a day like this is our pipeline and our pipeline in business banking is really good. And it's kind of off how sort of customers are somewhat defining the conventional wisdom of uncertainty around Brexit and other things. We're still seeing our customers doing business, and that gives me, certainly, some comfort.</p><p>I think the mortgage market is going to be quite quiet next year. Certainly, the roll into Christmas, which is traditionally quite strong, the December report has pushed pretty hard to put business on in the last quarter of the year, that sort of thing. I think that's been quieter than we've seen for a number of years.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Thanks, Ian. And Ed, it's David. Just on the business current account. I think the -- we can never be exact, but we really want to have that in, in the first half of the year. I think what we want to have is we start with December with the current account and we do the big branches and we roll into, hopefully, having the Virgin Money loyalty program, and then we'd like to have the business current account, debit card and credit card all launched around that time. I'm sure some of my team will be hating me saying that. But that is now an announcement, guys, so get on with it.</p><p>But seriously, I think the issue is we want to tie them together, so the current account and the retail side, and the SME, if you recall, our SME is S, the smaller side, and there's a fungibility between the personal and the business. So we want to take advantage of that and then deploy the Virgin loyalty program. So our ambition is to have all of that locked-in, in the first half of the year, Ed.</p><p>EDMUND ANTHONY BIDDULPH HENNING: Okay. That's great. And just one follow-up, Ian. You know you've talked a lot about -- today about mortgage growth and business growth in personal or that business and personal are above system, and mortgage is roughly around system. What are your expectations for system next year?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Sorry, expectations for system, was that?</p><p>EDMUND ANTHONY BIDDULPH HENNING: Yes, across the 3: business, personal and mortgages.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. So we'll -- we can flick the exact sort of predictions to you, but we are currently expecting to see a flat mortgage market, similar growth in business, a couple of percentage points and a slightly more subdued personal lending. I forget exactly what system growth was for this year, but slightly more subdued, so.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Thanks, Ed. I think we have 2 more questions on line. So we go to the next one.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Victor German from Macquarie.</p><p>VICTOR GERMAN, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: I just wanted to ask also a question on margins first. And Ian, kind of started to answer that question. I just was hoping to get a little bit more detail. If I look at product margin, it looks like you obviously have seen a meaningful decline in mortgage margins, which you're hoping to arrest next period. But one of the products that we've seen quite good performance in terms of margins was unsecured where you've seen ongoing increases in that spread. I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color. It sounds like part of the reason behind it is because you're getting less customers in interest-free period and more actually interest paying period. Just interested in -- if you can give us sort of some numbers around kind of how this thing's evolved and whether you expect that trend to continue into next period.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. Thanks, Victor, good to hear from you. So I guess, if we look at what drove the increase in unsecured, first of all, you're right. A lot of that was the stronger yield from the credit card book, stronger cash interest yield. So we're not going to see a repeat of that going into next year to -- certainly to that same magnitude. But we are expecting to see some continued improvement but not at the scale we saw '18 into '19.</p><p>Another feature of the '18 into '19 increase that I think is margin accretive is that -- is in personal loan side. So on the one hand, you've got still a very competitive unsecured personal loan market with headline rates around the 3% mark. Where we've seen a good chunk of our growth, though, is in Salary Finance, and that is at much better rates than you're seeing on the aggregator sites. To a certain extent, that -- it's kind of twice what we're seeing in terms of headline market rates. So I think we're enriching the mix there. And that's a really good stream of lending for us. So I would expect to see a better average customer yield on our personal lending into next year but not as big a step-up as we saw '18 into '19.</p><p>VICTOR GERMAN: And also, on the structural hedge -- and I know that you talked earlier around this issue already, but I'm just sort of wondering, if rates were to stay kind of at current levels, assuming no changes from here, presumably -- or given that you've got a 5-year structural hedge, rates are still lower than they were over the average -- over that period, so I'm just wondering, as we go into 2020, is structural hedge supposed to be a drag to margin? And are you able to give us sort of -- presumably, it is in your guidance, if you can give us any color on that, that would be very useful.</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: So yes, Victor, it is -- the sort of current interest rate environment is factored into our guidance. So we're not assuming in that guidance that the world gets any better or anything of that nature. So definitely, what's happening on the sort of structural hedge impact is baked in. We're kind of expecting, therefore, the contribution from the structural hedge to be flattish into next year, so no major benefit from that. And that's because, first of all, the -- and Fahed made the point. Was it Fahed? I can't remember who was asking about structural change. But it is sort of -- it's less of an issue for us. Our yield -- average yield of structural hedge balances is lower, and we topped up at lower rates. So that -- again, it's all about that sort of back-to-front compression piece.</p><p>So we think that the impact of structural hedge, baking in the current interest rate environment, is pretty flat through 2020, and that's what we've put into our guidance.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Thank you, Victor.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from Joseph Dickerson of Jefferies.</p><p>JOSEPH DICKERSON, HEAD OF EUROPEAN BANKS RESEARCH &amp; EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's also on the structural hedge. And sorry to bludgeon you with questions on the structural hedge, it sounds like on this call. I guess just incremental to the other 2 questions on it, the average balance increase, about GBP 2.5 billion year-on-year, can you give us a sense for how much more capacity there is to take that up from the current GBP 24 billion?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. Thanks, Joe. So the -- what lies behind that increase is when we took over Virgin Money, we brought in some of their administered rate deposit balances into the structural hedge -- into the scope of the structural hedge. So that's the increase. We don't see scope for significant increases in what was structural hedging going forward. So we should see it pretty stable year-on-year.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Okay. Andrew, is that...</p><p>ANDREW DOWNEY: Yes, I've just got one on the webcast. So there's a question from Guy Stebbings. He's asked, basically, why haven't we adjusted the management buffer, given that the Pillar 2A came down? Is this because you want to hold some extra headroom for the integration and with an eye on stress testing into next year?</p><p>IAN STUART SMITH: Yes. Thanks, Guy. So gosh, part of me just goes, \"We've just absorbed 172 basis points for the PPI charge. Let's pause for breath.\" But it is a fair question because when we were talking about our sort of medium-term aspiration, it was to hold a 1% to 1.5% buffer.</p><p>I think, Guy, you've called it right. We've absorbed a shock to our capital base. We've turned the business upside down to make sure that we can still do what we set out to do after absorbing that shock, and we feel good about it. But I think it helps to carry a little extra cushion into next year just as we work through what, as I highlighted, is a year of sort of flat in terms of capital generation, before we start to generate excess capital in 2021. So it feels like a good sort of pause at the moment, and let's talk about it next year.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH DUFFY: Okay. I think we've come to the end of our timing, and we've covered all the questions. And thank you, everyone, online, on the webcast and in the room. And see you next year or sooner.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Eight of the 10 funds with the biggest inflows for the week were ETFs, while nine of the 10 have a U.S. geographic focus. Withstanding downward pressure from chip makers due to concerns about soft smartphone chip sales, two of the top three funds have semiconductor mandates.<br/><br/>Despite having the second highest number of companies missing earnings estimates during the first quarter,   Utility Sector Funds   chalked up their largest weekly inflow since June of 2017. In addition to the relatively soft earnings,   Utility Sector Funds   are contending with higher interest rates that encourage yield seeking investors to rotate back to low risk Treasuries.<br/><br/>Financial Sector Funds   experienced the largest outflow this week. It was the third time in the past four weeks this group has suffered net redemptions. With European and Chinese banks facing the prospect of less liquidity and tighter regulations, and the US Treasury yield curve flattening, investors are starting to take the profits that have accumulated since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump in 4Q16.<br/><br/>Industrial Sector Funds   experienced fresh outflows\u2014their third in the past four weeks\u2014as warnings about global growth and future corporate earnings weighed on investors assessing this historically cyclical sector.<br/><br/>Cameron Brandt is Director of Research for <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.epfr.com/\">EPFR Global</url> , an <url normalizedValue=\"https://financialintelligence.informa.com/\">Informa Financial Intelligence</url> company.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLTMNG-382466</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLTMNG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S8Y-7811-DY2V-D368-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"332\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wealth Management</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 9, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

That's already a regulatory requirement for cable operators.</p><p>\"This could be achieved through a licensing system, binding agreements or regulations with administrative monetary policies,\" the report said.</p><p>Despite pushback from foreign online platforms that said they were already investing and contributing to the creative ecosystem, Yale said \"the majority insisted on binding measures to ensure funding remains available for Canadian content in the face of market failures.\"</p><p>Yale's 57-page interim report updates what the panel has heard from stakeholders. Final recommendations are expected in January.</p><p>As such, the report is really a summary of findings. But still, it gives clues to what is top of mind with the legislative review panel, and where they may be going with their ultimate recommendations to government. That includes the issue of maintaining local news content in Canada.</p><p>\"Many interested parties commented on the devastating effect that the transfer of advertising revenue to digital platforms has had on the Canadian media environment,\" said the report. \"This is particularly on the business models of print media, private broadcasters, and to a lesser extent, the public broadcaster.\"</p><p>The revenue migration has affected the ability of legacy publishers and broadcasters to produce local content.</p><p>\"They emphasized the survival of local media to the vitality of democratic debate, especially in an era of media consolidation and misinformation.\"</p><p>The CBC was also singled out by interested parties who recognized the \"fundamental\" role the public broadcaster played in Canadian culture.</p><p>More stable funding mechanisms, and even increased funding for the CBC to levels comparable to funding of public broadcasters in other countries has been suggested as a solution. However, the private sector media said the CBC should not be in competition with them, especially for advertising revenue. That was true also for Indigenous media, said the report.</p><p>\"As the findings show, we now have broad agreement in the sector that short-term measures are needed to ensure foreign digital services are doing their part,\" said Directors Guild of Canada executive director Dave Forget. \"We call on both the government and the commission to act.\"</p><p>The panel also acknowledged that \"almost all interested parties\" had advocated that there should be equity in the application of sales taxes between Canadian and foreign companies.</p><p>\"They submitted this would put an end to the competitive disadvantage currently faced by Canadian companies, which also have obligations with respect to the creation and distribution of Canadian content.\"</p><p>But Yale said the so called \"Netflix tax\" requiring online digital platforms to collect sales taxes similar to other Canadian companies was outside the scope of the \"communications legislative framework.\"</p><p>Former heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly had also said earlier that it was up to the finance ministry to enforce the tax regulations.</p><p>Looking at the issue of Canadian content in the digital age is not the only mandate of the committee.</p><p>Reducing barriers to telecommunications networks, revamping the regulatory framework and looking at the rights of digital consumers are part of the framework.</p><p>The last issue is particularly charged, with an election on the horizon.</p><p>\"Digital platforms have considerable power regarding what information is presented to Canadians as news and fact,\" said the report. \"This can lead to the removal of credible sources of news and the rapid dissemination of misinformation.\"</p><p>Some suggestions the panel is looking at include more regulation on digital platforms and improving digital literacy to combat fake news.</p><p>Privacy is another issue with consumers in danger of \"having their personal information used in ways that may cause personal or collective harm.\"</p><p>Placing foreign digital platforms under the authority of regulators such as the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the privacy commissioner or the competition bureau are some ways the panel are looking at ensuring regulation.</p><p>Network security and reliability are also part of the discussion. Investments are needed to address security risks and to defend against cyber attacks.</p><p>\"Critical infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to threats carried over telecommunications networks,\" said the report.</p><p>Some of the recommendations will come too late for the ongoing issues facing the Trudeau government. The Liberals have said they will decide before the election whether to allow Chinese equipment maker Huawei to supply equipment for Canada's new cellular networks amid concerns of spying.</p><p>Not everyone was happy with the interim report. Watchdog group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting called the release a \"non-event,\" saying the Liberal government had taken too long to address overhauling digital services.</p><p>\"Every day that passes is another day for Netflix to profit and steal market share from Canadian competitors, thanks to inexplicable inaction from Canadian politicians and regulators,\" said Daniel Bernhard, spokesperson for the group.</p><p>Reshaping the nation's broadcasting and telecommunications laws was never going to be an easy task. But given the level of disruption in the industry this will not be a short-term fix.</p><p>The panel read through 2,085 formal submissions and letters, including holding 12 conferences across Canada.</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Canada urged to respond faster as digital landscape evolves</p><p>'Smarter' rules would ensure all digital players pay for CanCon, panel told</p><p>\"We must think not about what will serve Canada and Canadians well for the next few years, but for the next full generation at least,\" Yale said in a speech at the Canadian Telecom Summit in Mississauga last month.</p><p>\"Our horizon cannot be restrained to the next election or the next rollout of new technologies,\" she said. \"It must be cast further ahead.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

That includes the issue of maintaining local news content in Canada.</p><p>\"Many interested parties commented on the devastating effect that the transfer of advertising revenue to digital platforms has had on the Canadian media environment,\" said the report. \"This is particularly on the business models of print media, private broadcasters, and to a lesser extent, the public broadcaster.\"</p><p>The revenue migration has affected the ability of legacy publishers and broadcasters to produce local content.</p><p>\"They emphasized the survival of local media to the vitality of democratic debate, especially in an era of media consolidation and misinformation.\"</p><p>The CBC was also singled out by interested parties who recognized the \"fundamental\" role the public broadcaster played in Canadian culture.</p><p>More stable funding mechanisms, and even increased funding for the CBC to levels comparable to funding of public broadcasters in other countries has been suggested as a solution. However, the private sector media said the CBC should not be in competition with them, especially for advertising revenue. That was true also for Indigenous media, said the report.</p><p>\"As the findings show, we now have broad agreement in the sector that short-term measures are needed to ensure foreign digital services are doing their part,\" said Directors Guild of Canada executive director Dave Forget. \"We call on both the government and the commission to act.\"</p><p>The panel also acknowledged that \"almost all interested parties\" had advocated that there should be equity in the application of sales taxes between Canadian and foreign companies.</p><p>\"They submitted this would put an end to the competitive disadvantage currently faced by Canadian companies, which also have obligations with respect to the creation and distribution of Canadian content.\"</p><p>But Yale said the so called \"Netflix tax\" requiring online digital platforms to collect sales taxes similar to other Canadian companies was outside the scope of the \"communications legislative framework.\"</p><p>Former heritage minister M\u00e9lanie Joly had also said earlier that it was up to the finance ministry to enforce the tax regulations.</p><p>Looking at the issue of Canadian content in the digital age is not the only mandate of the committee.</p><p>Reducing barriers to telecommunications networks, revamping the regulatory framework and looking at the rights of digital consumers are part of the framework.</p><p>The last issue is particularly charged, with an election on the horizon.</p><p>\"Digital platforms have considerable power regarding what information is presented to Canadians as news and fact,\" said the report. \"This can lead to the removal of credible sources of news and the rapid dissemination of misinformation.\"</p><p>Some suggestions the panel is looking at include more regulation on digital platforms and improving digital literacy to combat fake news.</p><p>Privacy is another issue with consumers in danger of \"having their personal information used in ways that may cause personal or collective harm.\"</p><p>Placing foreign digital platforms under the authority of regulators such as the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the privacy commissioner or the competition bureau are some ways the panel are looking at ensuring regulation.</p><p>Network security and reliability are also part of the discussion. Investments are needed to address security risks and to defend against cyber attacks.</p><p>\"Critical infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to threats carried over telecommunications networks,\" said the report.</p><p>Some of the recommendations will come too late for the ongoing issues facing the Trudeau government. The Liberals have said they will decide before the election whether to allow Chinese equipment maker Huawei to supply equipment for Canada's new cellular networks amid concerns of spying.</p><p>Not everyone was happy with the interim report. Watchdog group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting called the release a \"non-event,\" saying the Liberal government had taken too long to address overhauling digital services.</p><p>\"Every day that passes is another day for Netflix to profit and steal market share from Canadian competitors, thanks to inexplicable inaction from Canadian politicians and regulators,\" said Daniel Bernhard, spokesperson for the group.</p><p>Reshaping the nation's broadcasting and telecommunications laws was never going to be an easy task. But given the level of disruption in the industry this will not be a short-term fix.</p><p>The panel read through 2,085 formal submissions and letters, including holding 12 conferences across Canada.</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Canada urged to respond faster as digital landscape evolves</p><p>'Smarter' rules would ensure all digital players pay for CanCon, panel told</p><p>\"We must think not about what will serve Canada and Canadians well for the next few years, but for the next full generation at least,\" Yale said in a speech at the Canadian Telecom Summit in Mississauga last month.</p><p>\"Our horizon cannot be restrained to the next election or the next rollout of new technologies,\" she said. \"It must be cast further ahead.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.
