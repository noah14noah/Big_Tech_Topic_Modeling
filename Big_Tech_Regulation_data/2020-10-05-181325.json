White House  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus is out with a tweet.  In his place, General  John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Focus on fundamentals.   The Dow closes at a record, despite all the chaos in the capital.  But at  what point will Washington start to really matter to investors?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Up in smoke.  The FDA wants to make cigarettes less addictive, and  that burned a hole in a handful of tobacco stocks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, July  28th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Developments out of Washington late this afternoon.  President Trump's  chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is out.  </p><p>The president broke the news in his favorite way, over Twitter, writing,  quote: I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary  John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff.  He is a great American, and a  great leader.  John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security.   He's been a true star of my administration.  </p><p>Mr. Priebus is the former Republican Party chairman, and he clashed with  other officials in the White House, including the new director of  communications, Anthony Scaramucci. </p><p>John Harwood joins us tonight on the phone from Washington.  </p><p>John, welcome, good to be with you.  </p><p>How big a surprise, John, is Priebus' departure?  And how big a surprise is  the appointment of Kelly as chief of staff?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  Well,  I think the departure of Reince Priebus wasn't a surprise.  The timing was  a surprise.  I had been talking to people during the day who were saying,  you know, sometime in the next couple of weeks, certainly by Labor Day, so,  that wasn't unexpected.  </p><p>John Kelly had been rumored as a candidate for the job.  So had other  people, including Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive.   Deena Powell, also formerly from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).  </p><p>And the real question is what does this mean?  How does it change the  functioning of the White House?  Most things from the Trump administration  have revolved around the president personally, not his aides, but we'll see  whether General Kelly can bring a greater amount of discipline.  </p><p>HERERA:  What more -- what changes, other changes, might be possible?  For  instance, Mr. Bannon was targeted recently by Mr. Scaramucci.  What do you  see ahead, John?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  It is very difficult to predict this administration to say the  least.  The most conspicuous potential change that has been signaled is the  departure of the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Now I don't know if  that's actually going to happen.  The president has suggested as much. </p><p>I had a -- someone close to Trump tell me today they expected Bannon to  stay.  But I don't think you could make a heavy bet on any of this.  </p><p>One thing I think is interesting, though, I was talking to an ally of Paul  Ryan, the House speaker, who said that the departure of Priebus is  essentially un-tethering the Trump White House from the Republican party  and, in fact, predicted that the next phase of the Trump presidency may be  to go to war against the Republican Congress and blame them for his  problems.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, he was Mr. Priebus, certainly, part of the Republican Party  establishment, former chairman of the party.  So what could this change  mean, not only for the operation of the White House, John, but for the  president's policy agenda?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Well, if General Kelly can bring a greater amount of focus and  discipline to the White House, and to the president, for that matter, it is  possible that they could have a better experience with tax reform, which is  the next big reform than they have had with health care reform.  Obviously,  a lot of the problems on health care were inherent to that issue, and I  think a lot of the responsibility lies with the Congress, and not with  President Trump. </p><p>But, General Kelly is not experienced in politics.  And one of the  advantages of having Reince Priebus there was, in fact, you're trying to  get an agenda through with Republicans on Capitol Hill.  And, General Kelly  does not have any track record of doing that.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right, John Harwood, thanks very much, working late on the  weekend night.  John Harwood in Washington.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, while the drama in Washington continues, Wall Street is  blocking out the noise and staying squarely focused on the fundamentals.   Earnings and global growth are all supporting stocks, which saw the Dow  Jones Industrial Average close at a new high.  The blue chip Dow index  advanced 33 points to 21830, the Nasdaq lost seven and the S&amp;P 500 fell  three.  For the week, the Dow was the big winner.  </p><p>Bob Pisani has more on what's driving the market.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The stock market has a  high class problem right now.  An awful lot is going right.  </p><p>First and foremost, earnings have been strong.  We're past the halfway  mark.  Earnings are up more than 10 percent year over year.  Revenues are  up 5 percent.  </p><p>Estimates are strong for the third quarter, as well.  Valuations are  higher, all right.  But the margins are comfortable as long as there is  earnings growth and the economy is improving.  </p><p>And the global economy has been improving.  Money is flowing into European  stocks this year.  The credit markets are in great shape.  Defaults are  low.  And a recession, nowhere on the horizon. </p><p>Next, the dollar's been dropping, providing a tailwind for exporters.  And  rates are low.  And the Fed's reiterated this week that rates will stay low  for a long time and nobody's expecting a rate hike until December.  </p><p>All right.  What could go wrong with this?  Yes, Washington's a mess.  But  the markets don't care as long as tax cuts are somewhere on the horizon.   In 2018 has proven good enough so far.  There's definitely some kind of  premium in the market for a tax cut but we don't know how big this premium  is.  </p><p>Another issue that is sort of puzzling market watchers is geopolitical  risk.  Today, the North Koreans fired a missile into the Sea of Japan but  the markets shrugged it off.  Janus's Bill Gross said earlier this week  that a significant geopolitical event like North Korea would usually carry  a higher risk premium.  But so far, that hasn't been the case. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So what, if anything, will it take for the market to turn its  attention to Washington in a more focused way?  </p><p>Jeff Moore is senior analyst at Global Risk Insights and he joins us now to  discuss.  </p><p>Jeff, how can the stock market and bond markets be so Zen when Washington  is so not?  </p><p>JEFF MOORE, SENIOR ANALYST, GLOBAL RISK INSIGHTS:  Well, I think that the  precedent was set a long time ago as far as the character of this  administration, and the interplay between the White House and Congress, so  there's a little bit of a de-sensitivity issue as far as how that  translates into market risk.  But I think it's going to take something  substantial and maybe some outside the domestic scene to actually introduce  some of that volatility.  </p><p>HERERA:  Would that be -- or might that be North Korea?  </p><p>MOORE:  I think so.  But more than North Korea's actions, I think more  importantly, judged by the market is going to be the reactions of the Trump  administration.  Any escalation as far as military action on the Korean  peninsula will be something that introduces a spike in volatility, that  could really unravel a lot of the complacency that's been going on in the  market so far.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Spike in volatility would be the most favorable outcome it might  well seem, if something big happens on the Korean peninsula.  </p><p>Let's talk a little bit about the GOP agenda.  I don't want to just call it  the Trump agenda.  A big part of it seems to have, for now, gone down in  flames on health care.  It is no easy push to push tax reform through.   Infrastructure, immigration, there are a lot of things standing out there  which of those has the potential to move the needle marketwise one way or  another?  Or the most potential, I should say.  </p><p>MOORE:  Yes, I think tax reform probably has the most potential of actually  following through, because you probably have a high level of consensus  among Congress and the White House of getting some tax reform policies  pushed through and signed into law.  But the question is, how they're able  to do that, when they've got a second or third on the list behind health  care, which so far has been a debacle?  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, Jeff, we just had John Harwood on the phone, and he  mentioned that he was hearing from sources that the next move by the White  House may be to go after Congress, because of the lack of movement on  things like health care.  If we start to get mutiny between Congress and  the administration, what do you think Wall Street's reaction would be to  that sort of a development?  Hypothetical at this point, certainly.  </p><p>MOORE:  Yes.  I think outside of some foreign policy issue that creeps up  and escalates, that open mutiny between Congress and the Trump  administration, if the Trump administration were to go after the Republican  Party, and the Republican majorities in Congress, that could really  escalate to the point of investors really coming to terms with some of  these agenda items, there are possibilities of actually getting passed  really, really sinking.  </p><p>And to this point, none of that has actually been passed through Congress,  and you would think the markets would have reacted negatively to that  already.  But, this kind of open political warfare between the White House,  and Congress, being of the same political party, would be really something  that causes investors to question where this is going as far as economic  policy standpoint.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right, Jeff.  Have a nice weekend.  Jeff Moore with Global  Risk Insights.  </p><p>HERERA: To the economy now, which rebounded this spring after a weak start  to the year.  Gross domestic product for the second quarter was 2.6  percent.  And while that was more than double the revised economic output  of the first three months of the year, it was slightly below expectations.   Consumers ramped up their spending, and businesses invested more on  equipment.  Inflation, though, retreated and wage growth decelerated,  despite an economy that's considered to be at or near full employment.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It was the best week of the year for oil prices, after rising  today for a fifth straight session.  Domestic crude up more than 8 percent  this week, as crude and gasoline inventories fell more than expected and  Saudi Arabia said it would reduce future oil output.  That alleviated some  oversupply concerns. </p><p>But the price of oil varied widely in the second quarter.  That hurt  ExxonMobil's results but not doing much damage really to Chevron's quarter.   Shares of the country's two oil producers moved in opposite direction.   Chevron (NYSE:CVX) the best performing Dow stock today, Exxon the worst.  </p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Investors weren't  expecting much from ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM).  That's why this earnings miss  really stings.  The wide range in crude prices is partially to blame even  though they were higher than they were a year ago.  </p><p>The other reason is weak performance from Exxon's exploration and  production business.  The downstream business, that's refining, was  stronger but weak here in the United States. </p><p>CEO Darren Woods said the company's job is, quote, to grow long-term value  by investing in our integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed  regardless of market conditions.  Since Woods took over on January 1st,  succeeding Rex Tillerson, who is now secretary of state, Exxon has faced  accusations of sanction violations, probes into whether the company hid  data on climate change and questions of how it would grow oil output. </p><p>It's a slightly different story for rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the second  largest U.S. driller behind Exxon.  It's swung to a profit thanks to higher  expected output from its wells even as returns from its refining business  shrank.  </p><p>What will be key for both companies is how they proceed going forward with  oil just under $50 a barrel, do they keep drilling or do they pare back and  allow prices to stabilize? </p><p>The U.S. is the swing producer right now. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, profit and performance should mean fewer headaches  for American airlines, right?  Well, that's not really the case.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Billions of dollars in market cap went up in smoke.  Shares of the  big tobacco companies fell after the FDA said it wants to cut nicotine and  cigarettes to non-addictive levels.  Such a move would represent a sweeping  federal effort to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages  to carry health warnings.  Altria and British American Tobacco were hit  hard.  </p><p>Aditi Roy has the details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Nearly 90  percent of all adult smokers started the habit before they were 18.  And  then became hooked.  </p><p>That's the premise of the Food and Drug Administration's sweeping new plan  to regulate tobacco and nicotine.  </p><p>DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER:  We need to take a fresh look at  nicotine itself.  </p><p>ROY:  The goal is to save lives.  In a statement announcing the news, the  agency said: Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today  will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.  The agency also  reports a direct health care and lost productivity costs stemming from  tobacco use, add up to nearly $300 billion.  </p><p>To meet its goal, the FDA wants to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to  non-addictive levels and will take measures that will, quote, make tobacco  products less toxic, appealing and addictive.  </p><p>GOTTLIEB:  But if the other chemical compounds in tobacco and in the smoke  created by setting tobacco on fire that directly and primarily cause the  illness and death, not the nicotine.  </p><p>ROY:  In other words, the FDA commissioner says by curbing the nicotine,  more people will quit smoking and won't be exposed to the more harmful  elements of cigarettes.  Upon the news, shares of cigarette stocks like  Altria and British American Tobacco plummeted.  </p><p>But some analysts say the regulations could help the market for cigarette  alternatives.  Some tobacco companies like Altria are developing less  harmful products like smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes.  </p><p>JOE AGNESE, CFRA ANALYST:  I think the economics aren't as good right now,  but as the market develops, and perhaps with these changes, there will be a  greater push and acceleration of growth in electronic cigarettes that  longer-term the economics could improve.  </p><p>ROY (on camera):  He adds companies have some time before the regulations  would take effect.  Before the plan can go into motion, the FDA will have a  public comment period.  It's unclear when that will start or how long that  will take.  Then the agency will evaluate the comments before finalizing  the plan.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  American Airlines reported better than expected earnings for the  second quarter.  Like other carriers, demand is strong at the world's  biggest airline and that is pushing up average fares, fees and overall  revenue.  Meanwhile, the company's CEO says American is not backing off its  fight to stop the growth of Persian Gulf carriers in the U.S. </p><p>Phil LeBeau reports from Fort Worth, Texas, where American is  headquartered.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For  American airlines business is taking off, thanks to strong demand and a  industry leading ability to drive greater passenger revenue.  In fact,  revenue per available seat mile is up almost 6 percent.  In part because  about half of the American passengers who buy a basic economy ticket are  paying more to upgrade to a main cabin seat where they have more options to  choose from.  </p><p>DOUG PARKER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  We had revenue growth,  unit revenue growth of almost 6 percent.  More than the industry is up.   It's evidence to us that the investments we're making in our product and  our people are working.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  For Parker, the profit and performance his team posted last  quarter should mean fewer headaches for American.  But that's not happening  thanks to Qatar Airways.  The Middle East carrier wants to buy up to 10  percent of American, even though Parker has repeatedly criticized Qatar for  using government subsidies to expand flights to the U.S., a practice that  Parker says has hurt American and other U.S. carriers </p><p>PARKER:  We'll see where this all ends up, but the reality is, those three  carriers are subsidized by their governments, and they're competing against  American Airlines, and other U.S. carriers, in an unfair way and it  shouldn't be allowed.  </p><p>LEBEAU:  While American pushes back against Qatar, its core business  remains strong, with a healthy economy driving demand, and international  travel not slowing down.  </p><p>(on camera):  And even as costs rise due in part to new labor contracts,  Doug Parker believes American is poised to fly even higher as it heads into  the remainder of this year. </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Fort Worth, Texas. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Merck (NYSE:MRK) tops expectations, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The pharmaceutical company said cost cuts and strong demand for its top  selling cancer drug Keytruda led to the higher than expected earnings.   Merck (NYSE:MRK) also said the international cyber attack back in June  which disrupted its manufacturing operations would, indeed, cut into  profits for the remainder of this year.  The company did, however, raise  its sales outlook.  Shares rose slightly to $64.11. </p><p>Goodyear said higher raw material costs and weaker demand for tires hurt  results in the latest quarter.  Despite seeing a drop in profit, the  company reported earnings that were in line with estimates.  But sales  missed the mark.  The company also cut its outlook for the entire unit  sales, and segment operating income.  Shares fell more than 8 percent to  $32.51.  </p><p>The furniture and electronics rental company Aaron's (NYSE:AAN) reported a  better than expected rise in sales as the company kept a tight lid on cost  and benefited from growth in its progressive leasing division.  Earnings  also beat analyst expectations and shares took off, rising 17 percent to  $47.54.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Magellan Health missed estimates as the health care company said  it experienced pricing pressure in two of its commercial accounts.  Revenue  however edged higher and was stronger than expected.  Shares of Magellan  Health off more than 3.5 percent on the session at $75.90.  </p><p>And the online real estate broker Redfin went public on the Nasdaq today.   The company offered more than 9 million shares at $15 apiece.  Redfin  shares -- look what they did? -- soaring 44 percent in their debut.  They  closed the day at $21.70.  </p><p>HERERA:  A quarter of the S&amp;P 500's climb this year is due to five stocks - - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Google's parent Alphabet, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Our market monitor says  some of those big tech names are ones you may want to own.  This is his  first appearance as our market monitor guest, though he has been on the  program before.  </p><p>We welcome back, Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager that BMO Global Asset  Management.  </p><p>Ernesto, nice to see you again.  Welcome.  </p><p>ERNESTO RAMOS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BMO GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  Let's get right to your picks.  You pick Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  You  say they have yet to enter the hot new markets such as virtual reality,  original content, and things like that.  </p><p>RAMOS:  Yes, indeed.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is essentially an iPhone maker,  and they are tapping that market very well.  But, they've not yet really  realized the full potential of other areas of the market that they have  products that they're bringing to market. </p><p>So, we think they have potential for growth in new areas, and they still  have a magnificent cash cow in their iPhone, and the new iPhone 8 release  in September will be a pretty big event similar to what the iPhone 6  release was a couple of years ago.  So, we think the stock is trading at  below market valuation is a very good pick for both its valuation, and its  growth characteristics.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Ernesto, your second choice is another tiny little company that  nobody's heard of that also begins with the letter A.  </p><p>RAMOS:  That's the flip to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), I'm  sure you're talking about.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You bet.</p><p>RAMOS:  And that stock is valued through the roof but it's growth is just  incredible.  They've posted, I can't remember off the top of my head, how  many consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent sales growth and the earnings  fluctuate simply as a function of how much they're investing back into  their business on any given quarter.  So -- </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, that number last night didn't bother you at all?  </p><p>RAMOS:  No.  What we're looking at is the top line growth, and the  disruption that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is bringing to markets, you know, they  started as an online book seller, or actually online book seller but  selling physical books, then they went into other areas of the market, and  now, they're basically trying to enter any area where the consumer might  want to spend money, they want to be present there.  </p><p>HERERA:  Right.  </p><p>RAMOS:  And Jeff Bezos is succeeding pretty much at anything he tries.  So,  we're excited about this company, despite the very rich valuation.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  Let's quickly move on to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now a major  player in cloud.  They've really shifted their business model consistently.</p><p>RAMOS:  Well, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is sort of a hybrid between Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  They're disruptors in the sense  that they're adapting their business out of the legacy software and  computers into the iCloud, and in particular the hybrid iCloud where users  cannot only tap into the iCloud but leverage their existing infrastructures  to combine the both, which is most of the companies in the U.S., such as  our own company --</p><p>HERERA:  OK.  </p><p>RAMOS:   -- still in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) world and now we have access  to iCloud and that is a new area and they're doing it very well.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Ernesto, thank you.  Ernesto Ramos with BMO Global  Asset Management.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, they're young, they're hip and they're fuelling the  growth of, would you believe it, the RV market.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The treasury secretary tonight sent an update as to when the  country will reach its debt limit.  That new date is September 29th.  Steve  Mnuchin says the nation will run out of cash to meet its obligations on  that date.  </p><p>HERERA:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) improperly charged more than 570,000 auto  loan customers for auto insurance they did not need or were not told about.   The bank debited the borrower's bank accounts for that coverage.  Members  of the military on active duty were among those harmed.  The bank will make  $80 million in payments to compensate customers.  </p><p>Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was fined $180 million last year for opening as many  as 2 million accounts without customers' permission.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Get your motor running.  More RVs are heading out on the highway  these days.  But it's not retirees who are looking for adventure.  </p><p>Landon Dowdy tells us about the new crop of drivers hitting the road from  Petaluma, California.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LANDON DOWDY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Kyle  Miller is 32 years old and is on his second RV.  He grew up camping and  takes his young family on the road every month in the summertime.  </p><p>KYLE MILLARD, MILLENNIAL RV OWNER:  We picked this one because it has a  bunk house system in the back as well as the outside kitchen.  So, it's  something we can grow family-wise.  </p><p>DOWDY:  A record 9 million U.S. households now own an RV according to the  recreation vehicle industry association.  The industry has traditionally  relied on retirees to drive growth.  But now, younger buyers are getting  behind the wheel.  </p><p>NICOLE WALSH, RV OWNER:  It just allows us to come together in a different  way in sort of this, as you can see, see how we are in a fun way.  But we  also save money, so we can do some things that we might not otherwise get  to do if we stayed in a hotel.  </p><p>KRISTIN BETTENCOURT, RV OWNER:  When we come for Thanksgiving,  specifically, we have probably four to five trailers that come.  And we all  book spots right by each other.  And then we have a couple family members  who like to come but don't have trailers, so they get cabins so that they  can still be with us and enjoy the trip, too.  </p><p>DOWDY (on camera):  Younger buyers are opting more for towable trailers and  come to camp grounds like this one here in California, wine country, to  really experience the outdoor lifestyle trend.  </p><p>(voice-over):  And that has campground owners like Chris Wood investing in  things like Wi-Fi and communal areas for millennials to mingle.  </p><p>CHRIS WOOD, CAMPGROUND OWNER:  For the millennial generation, you know,  we're looking at space here on the campground which was set up for pot  lucks and bingo halls 30 years ago.  And we're setting it up for what we  call third spaces, something kind of like your Starbuckses and stuff.</p><p>DOWDY:  New data shows June towable shipments topped 20 percent year over  year, while motor homes were up a more modest 6 percent. </p><p>RV makers like Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) are taking note of the towable  takeover, offering new models tailored to entry level buyers and updated  with new technology.  </p><p>BOB MARTIN, CEO, THOR:  It's upgrading the electronics.  It's just adding  the features that they're used to.  So a lot of the RVs are compatible to,  you know, an iPhone.  You know, a lot of the app-based things that run your  AC, your awning, your jacks when you get there.  Just makes it easier to  camp.  </p><p>DOWDY:  Martin telling me that once buyers get RV-ing in their blood, they  get hooked.  Still analysts warn that while millennials are showing  interest in RV-ing, it's too early to know if those young buyers will drive  the industry like the boomers did.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Landon Dowdy, Petaluma, California.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me, as well.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.  We'll see you back here Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

White House  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus is out with a tweet.  In his place, General  John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Focus on fundamentals.   The Dow closes at a record, despite all the chaos in the capital.  But at  what point will Washington start to really matter to investors?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  Up in smoke.  The FDA wants to make cigarettes less addictive, and  that burned a hole in a handful of tobacco stocks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, July  28th.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Developments out of Washington late this afternoon.  President Trump's  chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is out.  </p><p> The president broke the news in his favorite way, over Twitter, writing,  quote: I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary  John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff.  He is a great American, and a  great leader.  John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security.   He's been a true star of my administration.  </p><p> Mr. Priebus is the former Republican Party chairman, and he clashed with  other officials in the White House, including the new director of  communications, Anthony Scaramucci. </p><p> John Harwood joins us tonight on the phone from Washington.  </p><p> John, welcome, good to be with you.  </p><p> How big a surprise, John, is Priebus' departure?  And how big a surprise is  the appointment of Kelly as chief of staff?  </p><p> JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  Well,  I think the departure of Reince Priebus wasn't a surprise.  The timing was  a surprise.  I had been talking to people during the day who were saying,  you know, sometime in the next couple of weeks, certainly by Labor Day, so,  that wasn't unexpected.  </p><p> John Kelly had been rumored as a candidate for the job.  So had other  people, including Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive.   Deena Powell, also formerly from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).  </p><p> And the real question is what does this mean?  How does it change the  functioning of the White House?  Most things from the Trump administration  have revolved around the president personally, not his aides, but we'll see  whether General Kelly can bring a greater amount of discipline.  </p><p> HERERA:  What more -- what changes, other changes, might be possible?  For  instance, Mr. Bannon was targeted recently by Mr. Scaramucci.  What do you  see ahead, John?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  It is very difficult to predict this administration to say the  least.  The most conspicuous potential change that has been signaled is the  departure of the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Now I don't know if  that's actually going to happen.  The president has suggested as much. </p><p> I had a -- someone close to Trump tell me today they expected Bannon to  stay.  But I don't think you could make a heavy bet on any of this.  </p><p> One thing I think is interesting, though, I was talking to an ally of Paul  Ryan, the House speaker, who said that the departure of Priebus is  essentially un-tethering the Trump White House from the Republican party  and, in fact, predicted that the next phase of the Trump presidency may be  to go to war against the Republican Congress and blame them for his  problems.  </p><p> HERERA:  Well, he was Mr. Priebus, certainly, part of the Republican Party  establishment, former chairman of the party.  So what could this change  mean, not only for the operation of the White House, John, but for the  president's policy agenda?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  Well, if General Kelly can bring a greater amount of focus and  discipline to the White House, and to the president, for that matter, it is  possible that they could have a better experience with tax reform, which is  the next big reform than they have had with health care reform.  Obviously,  a lot of the problems on health care were inherent to that issue, and I  think a lot of the responsibility lies with the Congress, and not with  President Trump. </p><p> But, General Kelly is not experienced in politics.  And one of the  advantages of having Reince Priebus there was, in fact, you're trying to  get an agenda through with Republicans on Capitol Hill.  And, General Kelly  does not have any track record of doing that.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right, John Harwood, thanks very much, working late on the  weekend night.  John Harwood in Washington.</p><p> HERERA:  Well, while the drama in Washington continues, Wall Street is  blocking out the noise and staying squarely focused on the fundamentals.   Earnings and global growth are all supporting stocks, which saw the Dow  Jones Industrial Average close at a new high.  The blue chip Dow index  advanced 33 points to 21830, the Nasdaq lost seven and the S&amp;P 500 fell  three.  For the week, the Dow was the big winner.  </p><p> Bob Pisani has more on what's driving the market.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The stock market has a  high class problem right now.  An awful lot is going right.  </p><p> First and foremost, earnings have been strong.  We're past the halfway  mark.  Earnings are up more than 10 percent year over year.  Revenues are  up 5 percent.  </p><p> Estimates are strong for the third quarter, as well.  Valuations are  higher, all right.  But the margins are comfortable as long as there is  earnings growth and the economy is improving.  </p><p> And the global economy has been improving.  Money is flowing into European  stocks this year.  The credit markets are in great shape.  Defaults are  low.  And a recession, nowhere on the horizon. </p><p> Next, the dollar's been dropping, providing a tailwind for exporters.  And  rates are low.  And the Fed's reiterated this week that rates will stay low  for a long time and nobody's expecting a rate hike until December.  </p><p> All right.  What could go wrong with this?  Yes, Washington's a mess.  But  the markets don't care as long as tax cuts are somewhere on the horizon.   In 2018 has proven good enough so far.  There's definitely some kind of  premium in the market for a tax cut but we don't know how big this premium  is.  </p><p> Another issue that is sort of puzzling market watchers is geopolitical  risk.  Today, the North Koreans fired a missile into the Sea of Japan but  the markets shrugged it off.  Janus's Bill Gross said earlier this week  that a significant geopolitical event like North Korea would usually carry  a higher risk premium.  But so far, that hasn't been the case. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  So what, if anything, will it take for the market to turn its  attention to Washington in a more focused way?  </p><p> Jeff Moore is senior analyst at Global Risk Insights and he joins us now to  discuss.  </p><p> Jeff, how can the stock market and bond markets be so Zen when Washington  is so not?  </p><p> JEFF MOORE, SENIOR ANALYST, GLOBAL RISK INSIGHTS:  Well, I think that the  precedent was set a long time ago as far as the character of this  administration, and the interplay between the White House and Congress, so  there's a little bit of a de-sensitivity issue as far as how that  translates into market risk.  But I think it's going to take something  substantial and maybe some outside the domestic scene to actually introduce  some of that volatility.  </p><p> HERERA:  Would that be -- or might that be North Korea?  </p><p> MOORE:  I think so.  But more than North Korea's actions, I think more  importantly, judged by the market is going to be the reactions of the Trump  administration.  Any escalation as far as military action on the Korean  peninsula will be something that introduces a spike in volatility, that  could really unravel a lot of the complacency that's been going on in the  market so far.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Spike in volatility would be the most favorable outcome it might  well seem, if something big happens on the Korean peninsula.  </p><p> Let's talk a little bit about the GOP agenda.  I don't want to just call it  the Trump agenda.  A big part of it seems to have, for now, gone down in  flames on health care.  It is no easy push to push tax reform through.   Infrastructure, immigration, there are a lot of things standing out there  which of those has the potential to move the needle marketwise one way or  another?  Or the most potential, I should say.  </p><p> MOORE:  Yes, I think tax reform probably has the most potential of actually  following through, because you probably have a high level of consensus  among Congress and the White House of getting some tax reform policies  pushed through and signed into law.  But the question is, how they're able  to do that, when they've got a second or third on the list behind health  care, which so far has been a debacle?  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, Jeff, we just had John Harwood on the phone, and he  mentioned that he was hearing from sources that the next move by the White  House may be to go after Congress, because of the lack of movement on  things like health care.  If we start to get mutiny between Congress and  the administration, what do you think Wall Street's reaction would be to  that sort of a development?  Hypothetical at this point, certainly.  </p><p> MOORE:  Yes.  I think outside of some foreign policy issue that creeps up  and escalates, that open mutiny between Congress and the Trump  administration, if the Trump administration were to go after the Republican  Party, and the Republican majorities in Congress, that could really  escalate to the point of investors really coming to terms with some of  these agenda items, there are possibilities of actually getting passed  really, really sinking.  </p><p> And to this point, none of that has actually been passed through Congress,  and you would think the markets would have reacted negatively to that  already.  But, this kind of open political warfare between the White House,  and Congress, being of the same political party, would be really something  that causes investors to question where this is going as far as economic  policy standpoint.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right, Jeff.  Have a nice weekend.  Jeff Moore with Global  Risk Insights.  </p><p> HERERA: To the economy now, which rebounded this spring after a weak start  to the year.  Gross domestic product for the second quarter was 2.6  percent.  And while that was more than double the revised economic output  of the first three months of the year, it was slightly below expectations.   Consumers ramped up their spending, and businesses invested more on  equipment.  Inflation, though, retreated and wage growth decelerated,  despite an economy that's considered to be at or near full employment.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  It was the best week of the year for oil prices, after rising  today for a fifth straight session.  Domestic crude up more than 8 percent  this week, as crude and gasoline inventories fell more than expected and  Saudi Arabia said it would reduce future oil output.  That alleviated some  oversupply concerns. </p><p> But the price of oil varied widely in the second quarter.  That hurt  ExxonMobil's results but not doing much damage really to Chevron's quarter.   Shares of the country's two oil producers moved in opposite direction.   Chevron (NYSE:CVX) the best performing Dow stock today, Exxon the worst.  </p><p> Jackie DeAngelis has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Investors weren't  expecting much from ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM).  That's why this earnings miss  really stings.  The wide range in crude prices is partially to blame even  though they were higher than they were a year ago.  </p><p> The other reason is weak performance from Exxon's exploration and  production business.  The downstream business, that's refining, was  stronger but weak here in the United States. </p><p> CEO Darren Woods said the company's job is, quote, to grow long-term value  by investing in our integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed  regardless of market conditions.  Since Woods took over on January 1st,  succeeding Rex Tillerson, who is now secretary of state, Exxon has faced  accusations of sanction violations, probes into whether the company hid  data on climate change and questions of how it would grow oil output. </p><p> It's a slightly different story for rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the second  largest U.S. driller behind Exxon.  It's swung to a profit thanks to higher  expected output from its wells even as returns from its refining business  shrank.  </p><p> What will be key for both companies is how they proceed going forward with  oil just under $50 a barrel, do they keep drilling or do they pare back and  allow prices to stabilize? </p><p> The U.S. is the swing producer right now. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, profit and performance should mean fewer headaches  for American airlines, right?  Well, that's not really the case.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Billions of dollars in market cap went up in smoke.  Shares of the  big tobacco companies fell after the FDA said it wants to cut nicotine and  cigarettes to non-addictive levels.  Such a move would represent a sweeping  federal effort to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages  to carry health warnings.  Altria and British American Tobacco were hit  hard.  </p><p> Aditi Roy has the details.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Nearly 90  percent of all adult smokers started the habit before they were 18.  And  then became hooked.  </p><p> That's the premise of the Food and Drug Administration's sweeping new plan  to regulate tobacco and nicotine.  </p><p> DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER:  We need to take a fresh look at  nicotine itself.  </p><p> ROY:  The goal is to save lives.  In a statement announcing the news, the  agency said: Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today  will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.  The agency also  reports a direct health care and lost productivity costs stemming from  tobacco use, add up to nearly $300 billion.  </p><p> To meet its goal, the FDA wants to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to  non-addictive levels and will take measures that will, quote, make tobacco  products less toxic, appealing and addictive.  </p><p> GOTTLIEB:  But if the other chemical compounds in tobacco and in the smoke  created by setting tobacco on fire that directly and primarily cause the  illness and death, not the nicotine.  </p><p> ROY:  In other words, the FDA commissioner says by curbing the nicotine,  more people will quit smoking and won't be exposed to the more harmful  elements of cigarettes.  Upon the news, shares of cigarette stocks like  Altria and British American Tobacco plummeted.  </p><p> But some analysts say the regulations could help the market for cigarette  alternatives.  Some tobacco companies like Altria are developing less  harmful products like smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes.  </p><p> JOE AGNESE, CFRA ANALYST:  I think the economics aren't as good right now,  but as the market develops, and perhaps with these changes, there will be a  greater push and acceleration of growth in electronic cigarettes that  longer-term the economics could improve.  </p><p> ROY (on camera):  He adds companies have some time before the regulations  would take effect.  Before the plan can go into motion, the FDA will have a  public comment period.  It's unclear when that will start or how long that  will take.  Then the agency will evaluate the comments before finalizing  the plan.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  American Airlines reported better than expected earnings for the  second quarter.  Like other carriers, demand is strong at the world's  biggest airline and that is pushing up average fares, fees and overall  revenue.  Meanwhile, the company's CEO says American is not backing off its  fight to stop the growth of Persian Gulf carriers in the U.S.</p><p> Phil LeBeau reports from Fort Worth, Texas, where American is  headquartered.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For  American airlines business is taking off, thanks to strong demand and a  industry leading ability to drive greater passenger revenue.  In fact,  revenue per available seat mile is up almost 6 percent.  In part because  about half of the American passengers who buy a basic economy ticket are  paying more to upgrade to a main cabin seat where they have more options to  choose from.  </p><p> DOUG PARKER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  We had revenue growth,  unit revenue growth of almost 6 percent.  More than the industry is up.   It's evidence to us that the investments we're making in our product and  our people are working.  </p><p> LEBEAU:  For Parker, the profit and performance his team posted last  quarter should mean fewer headaches for American.  But that's not happening  thanks to Qatar Airways.  The Middle East carrier wants to buy up to 10  percent of American, even though Parker has repeatedly criticized Qatar for  using government subsidies to expand flights to the U.S., a practice that  Parker says has hurt American and other U.S. carriers </p><p> PARKER:  We'll see where this all ends up, but the reality is, those three  carriers are subsidized by their governments, and they're competing against  American Airlines, and other U.S. carriers, in an unfair way and it  shouldn't be allowed.  </p><p> LEBEAU:  While American pushes back against Qatar, its core business  remains strong, with a healthy economy driving demand, and international  travel not slowing down.  </p><p> (on camera):  And even as costs rise due in part to new labor contracts,  Doug Parker believes American is poised to fly even higher as it heads into  the remainder of this year. </p><p> Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Fort Worth, Texas. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Merck (NYSE:MRK) tops expectations, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The pharmaceutical company said cost cuts and strong demand for its top  selling cancer drug Keytruda led to the higher than expected earnings.   Merck (NYSE:MRK) also said the international cyber attack back in June  which disrupted its manufacturing operations would, indeed, cut into  profits for the remainder of this year.  The company did, however, raise  its sales outlook.  Shares rose slightly to $64.11. </p><p> Goodyear said higher raw material costs and weaker demand for tires hurt  results in the latest quarter.  Despite seeing a drop in profit, the  company reported earnings that were in line with estimates.  But sales  missed the mark.  The company also cut its outlook for the entire unit  sales, and segment operating income.  Shares fell more than 8 percent to  $32.51.  </p><p> The furniture and electronics rental company Aaron's (NYSE:AAN) reported a  better than expected rise in sales as the company kept a tight lid on cost  and benefited from growth in its progressive leasing division.  Earnings  also beat analyst expectations and shares took off, rising 17 percent to  $47.54.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Magellan Health missed estimates as the health care company said  it experienced pricing pressure in two of its commercial accounts.  Revenue  however edged higher and was stronger than expected.  Shares of Magellan  Health off more than 3.5 percent on the session at $75.90.  </p><p> And the online real estate broker Redfin went public on the Nasdaq today.   The company offered more than 9 million shares at $15 apiece.  Redfin  shares -- look what they did? -- soaring 44 percent in their debut.  They  closed the day at $21.70.  </p><p> HERERA:  A quarter of the S&amp;P 500's climb this year is due to five stocks - - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Google's parent Alphabet, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Our market monitor says  some of those big tech names are ones you may want to own.  This is his  first appearance as our market monitor guest, though he has been on the  program before.  </p><p> We welcome back, Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager that BMO Global Asset  Management.  </p><p> Ernesto, nice to see you again.  Welcome.  </p><p> ERNESTO RAMOS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BMO GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thank you.  </p><p> HERERA:  Let's get right to your picks.  You pick Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  You  say they have yet to enter the hot new markets such as virtual reality,  original content, and things like that.  </p><p> RAMOS:  Yes, indeed.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is essentially an iPhone maker,  and they are tapping that market very well.  But, they've not yet really  realized the full potential of other areas of the market that they have  products that they're bringing to market. </p><p> So, we think they have potential for growth in new areas, and they still  have a magnificent cash cow in their iPhone, and the new iPhone 8 release  in September will be a pretty big event similar to what the iPhone 6  release was a couple of years ago.  So, we think the stock is trading at  below market valuation is a very good pick for both its valuation, and its  growth characteristics.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Ernesto, your second choice is another tiny little company that  nobody's heard of that also begins with the letter A.  </p><p> RAMOS:  That's the flip to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), I'm  sure you're talking about.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  You bet.</p><p> RAMOS:  And that stock is valued through the roof but it's growth is just  incredible.  They've posted, I can't remember off the top of my head, how  many consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent sales growth and the earnings  fluctuate simply as a function of how much they're investing back into  their business on any given quarter.  So -- </p><p> MATHISEN:  So, that number last night didn't bother you at all?  </p><p> RAMOS:  No.  What we're looking at is the top line growth, and the  disruption that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is bringing to markets, you know, they  started as an online book seller, or actually online book seller but  selling physical books, then they went into other areas of the market, and  now, they're basically trying to enter any area where the consumer might  want to spend money, they want to be present there.  </p><p> HERERA:  Right.  </p><p> RAMOS:  And Jeff Bezos is succeeding pretty much at anything he tries.  So,  we're excited about this company, despite the very rich valuation.  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.  Let's quickly move on to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now a major  player in cloud.  They've really shifted their business model consistently.</p><p> RAMOS:  Well, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is sort of a hybrid between Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  They're disruptors in the sense  that they're adapting their business out of the legacy software and  computers into the iCloud, and in particular the hybrid iCloud where users  cannot only tap into the iCloud but leverage their existing infrastructures  to combine the both, which is most of the companies in the U.S., such as  our own company --</p><p> HERERA:  OK.  </p><p> RAMOS:   -- still in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) world and now we have access  to iCloud and that is a new area and they're doing it very well.  </p><p> HERERA:  On that note, Ernesto, thank you.  Ernesto Ramos with BMO Global  Asset Management.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Coming up, they're young, they're hip and they're fuelling the  growth of, would you believe it, the RV market.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  The treasury secretary tonight sent an update as to when the  country will reach its debt limit.  That new date is September 29th.  Steve  Mnuchin says the nation will run out of cash to meet its obligations on  that date.  </p><p> HERERA:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) improperly charged more than 570,000 auto  loan customers for auto insurance they did not need or were not told about.   The bank debited the borrower's bank accounts for that coverage.  Members  of the military on active duty were among those harmed.  The bank will make  $80 million in payments to compensate customers.  </p><p> Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was fined $180 million last year for opening as many  as 2 million accounts without customers' permission.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Get your motor running.  More RVs are heading out on the highway  these days.  But it's not retirees who are looking for adventure.  </p><p> Landon Dowdy tells us about the new crop of drivers hitting the road from  Petaluma, California.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LANDON DOWDY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Kyle  Miller is 32 years old and is on his second RV.  He grew up camping and  takes his young family on the road every month in the summertime.  </p><p> KYLE MILLARD, MILLENNIAL RV OWNER:  We picked this one because it has a  bunk house system in the back as well as the outside kitchen.  So, it's  something we can grow family-wise.  </p><p> DOWDY:  A record 9 million U.S. households now own an RV according to the  recreation vehicle industry association.  The industry has traditionally  relied on retirees to drive growth.  But now, younger buyers are getting  behind the wheel.  </p><p> NICOLE WALSH, RV OWNER:  It just allows us to come together in a different  way in sort of this, as you can see, see how we are in a fun way.  But we  also save money, so we can do some things that we might not otherwise get  to do if we stayed in a hotel.  </p><p> KRISTIN BETTENCOURT, RV OWNER:  When we come for Thanksgiving,  specifically, we have probably four to five trailers that come.  And we all  book spots right by each other.  And then we have a couple family members  who like to come but don't have trailers, so they get cabins so that they  can still be with us and enjoy the trip, too.  </p><p> DOWDY (on camera):  Younger buyers are opting more for towable trailers and  come to camp grounds like this one here in California, wine country, to  really experience the outdoor lifestyle trend.  </p><p> (voice-over):  And that has campground owners like Chris Wood investing in  things like Wi-Fi and communal areas for millennials to mingle.  </p><p> CHRIS WOOD, CAMPGROUND OWNER:  For the millennial generation, you know,  we're looking at space here on the campground which was set up for pot  lucks and bingo halls 30 years ago.  And we're setting it up for what we  call third spaces, something kind of like your Starbuckses and stuff.</p><p> DOWDY:  New data shows June towable shipments topped 20 percent year over  year, while motor homes were up a more modest 6 percent. </p><p> RV makers like Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) are taking note of the towable  takeover, offering new models tailored to entry level buyers and updated  with new technology.  </p><p> BOB MARTIN, CEO, THOR:  It's upgrading the electronics.  It's just adding  the features that they're used to.  So a lot of the RVs are compatible to,  you know, an iPhone.  You know, a lot of the app-based things that run your  AC, your awning, your jacks when you get there.  Just makes it easier to  camp.  </p><p> DOWDY:  Martin telling me that once buyers get RV-ing in their blood, they  get hooked.  Still analysts warn that while millennials are showing  interest in RV-ing, it's too early to know if those young buyers will drive  the industry like the boomers did.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Landon Dowdy, Petaluma, California.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me, as well.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.

White House Chief of Staff <person><nameText>Reince Priebus </nameText></person>is out with a tweet. In his place, <person><nameText>General John F. Kelly, </nameText></person>the homeland security secretary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Focus on fundamentals. The Dow closes at a record, despite all the chaos in the capital. But at what point will Washington start to really matter to investors?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Up in smoke. The FDA wants to make cigarettes less addictive, and that burned a hole in a handful of tobacco stocks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, July 28th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Developments out of Washington late this afternoon. President Trump`s chief of staff, <person><nameText>Reince Priebus, </nameText></person>is out.</p><p>The president broke the news in his favorite way, over Twitter, writing, quote: I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/<person><nameText>Secretary John F. Kelly </nameText></person>as White House chief of staff. He is a great American, and a great leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He`s been a true star of my administration.</p><p>Mr. Priebus is the former Republican Party chairman, and he clashed with other officials in the White House, including the new director of communications, Anthony Scaramucci.</p><p>John Harwood joins us tonight on the phone from Washington.</p><p>John, welcome, good to be with you.</p><p>How big a surprise, John, is Priebus` departure? And how big a surprise is the appointment of Kelly as chief of staff?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, I think the departure of <person><nameText>Reince Priebus </nameText></person>wasn`t a surprise. The timing was a surprise. I had been talking to people during the day who were saying, you know, sometime in the next couple of weeks, certainly by Labor Day, so, that wasn`t unexpected.</p><p><person><nameText>John Kelly </nameText></person>had been rumored as a candidate for the job. So had other people, including Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive. Deena Powell, also formerly from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).</p><p>And the real question is what does this mean? How does it change the functioning of the White House? Most things from the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>have revolved around the president personally, not his aides, but we`ll see whether General Kelly can bring a greater amount of discipline.</p><p>HERERA: What more -- what changes, other changes, might be possible? For instance, Mr. Bannon was targeted recently by Mr. Scaramucci. What do you see ahead, John?</p><p>HARWOOD: It is very difficult to predict this administration to say the least. The most conspicuous potential change that has been signaled is the departure of the Attorney General <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions. </nameText></person>Now I don`t know if that`s actually going to happen. The president has suggested as much.</p><p>I had a -- someone close to Trump tell me today they expected Bannon to stay. But I don`t think you could make a heavy bet on any of this.</p><p>One thing I think is interesting, though, I was talking to an ally of Paul Ryan, the House speaker, who said that the departure of Priebus is essentially un-tethering the Trump White House from the Republican party and, in fact, predicted that the next phase of the Trump presidency may be to go to war against the Republican Congress and blame them for his problems.</p><p>HERERA: Well, he was Mr. Priebus, certainly, part of the Republican Party establishment, former chairman of the party. So what could this change mean, not only for the operation of the White House, John, but for the president`s policy agenda?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, if General Kelly can bring a greater amount of focus and discipline to the White House, and to the president, for that matter, it is possible that they could have a better experience with tax reform, which is the next big reform than they have had with health care reform. Obviously, a lot of the problems on health care were inherent to that issue, and I think a lot of the responsibility lies with the Congress, and not with President Trump.</p><p>But, General Kelly is not experienced in politics. And one of the advantages of having <person><nameText>Reince Priebus </nameText></person>there was, in fact, you`re trying to get an agenda through with Republicans on Capitol Hill. And, General Kelly does not have any track record of doing that.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right, John Harwood, thanks very much, working late on the weekend night. John Harwood in Washington.</p><p>HERERA: Well, while the drama in Washington continues, Wall Street is blocking out the noise and staying squarely focused on the fundamentals. Earnings and global growth are all supporting stocks, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average close at a new high. The blue chip Dow index advanced 33 points to 21830, the Nasdaq lost seven and the S&amp;P 500 fell three. For the week, the Dow was the big winner.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more on what`s driving the market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The stock market has a high class problem right now. An awful lot is going right.</p><p>First and foremost, earnings have been strong. We`re past the halfway mark. Earnings are up more than 10 percent year over year. Revenues are up 5 percent.</p><p>Estimates are strong for the third quarter, as well. Valuations are higher, all right. But the margins are comfortable as long as there is earnings growth and the economy is improving.</p><p>And the global economy has been improving. Money is flowing into European stocks this year. The credit markets are in great shape. Defaults are low. And a recession, nowhere on the horizon.</p><p>Next, the dollar`s been dropping, providing a tailwind for exporters. And rates are low. And the Fed`s reiterated this week that rates will stay low for a long time and nobody`s expecting a rate hike until December.</p><p>All right. What could go wrong with this? Yes, Washington`s a mess. But the markets don`t care as long as tax cuts are somewhere on the horizon. In 2018 has proven good enough so far. There`s definitely some kind of premium in the market for a tax cut but we don`t know how big this premium is.</p><p>Another issue that is sort of puzzling market watchers is geopolitical risk. Today, the North Koreans fired a missile into the Sea of Japan but the markets shrugged it off. Janus`s Bill Gross said earlier this week that a significant geopolitical event like North Korea would usually carry a higher risk premium. But so far, that hasn`t been the case.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: So what, if anything, will it take for the market to turn its attention to Washington in a more focused way?</p><p>Jeff Moore is senior analyst at Global Risk Insights and he joins us now to discuss.</p><p>Jeff, how can the stock market and bond markets be so Zen when Washington is so not?</p><p>JEFF MOORE, SENIOR ANALYST, GLOBAL RISK INSIGHTS: Well, I think that the precedent was set a long time ago as far as the character of this administration, and the interplay between the White House and Congress, so there`s a little bit of a de-sensitivity issue as far as how that translates into market risk. But I think it`s going to take something substantial and maybe some outside the domestic scene to actually introduce some of that volatility.</p><p>HERERA: Would that be -- or might that be North Korea?</p><p>MOORE: I think so. But more than North Korea`s actions, I think more importantly, judged by the market is going to be the reactions of the <person><nameText>Trump administration. </nameText></person>Any escalation as far as military action on the Korean peninsula will be something that introduces a spike in volatility, that could really unravel a lot of the complacency that`s been going on in the market so far.</p><p>MATHISEN: Spike in volatility would be the most favorable outcome it might well seem, if something big happens on the Korean peninsula.</p><p>Let`s talk a little bit about the GOP agenda. I don`t want to just call it the Trump agenda. A big part of it seems to have, for now, gone down in flames on health care. It is no easy push to push tax reform through. Infrastructure, immigration, there are a lot of things standing out there which of those has the potential to move the needle marketwise one way or another? Or the most potential, I should say.</p><p>MOORE: Yes, I think tax reform probably has the most potential of actually following through, because you probably have a high level of consensus among Congress and the White House of getting some tax reform policies pushed through and signed into law. But the question is, how they`re able to do that, when they`ve got a second or third on the list behind health care, which so far has been a debacle?</p><p>HERERA: You know, Jeff, we just had John Harwood on the phone, and he mentioned that he was hearing from sources that the next move by the White House may be to go after Congress, because of the lack of movement on things like health care. If we start to get mutiny between Congress and the administration, what do you think Wall Street`s reaction would be to that sort of a development? Hypothetical at this point, certainly.</p><p>MOORE: Yes. I think outside of some foreign policy issue that creeps up and escalates, that open mutiny between Congress and the <person><nameText>Trump administration, </nameText></person>if the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>were to go after the Republican Party, and the Republican majorities in Congress, that could really escalate to the point of investors really coming to terms with some of these agenda items, there are possibilities of actually getting passed really, really sinking.</p><p>And to this point, none of that has actually been passed through Congress, and you would think the markets would have reacted negatively to that already. But, this kind of open political warfare between the White House, and Congress, being of the same political party, would be really something that causes investors to question where this is going as far as economic policy standpoint.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right, Jeff. Have a nice weekend. Jeff Moore with Global Risk Insights.</p><p>HERERA: To the economy now, which rebounded this spring after a weak start to the year. Gross domestic product for the second quarter was 2.6 percent. And while that was more than double the revised economic output of the first three months of the year, it was slightly below expectations. Consumers ramped up their spending, and businesses invested more on equipment. Inflation, though, retreated and wage growth decelerated, despite an economy that`s considered to be at or near full employment.</p><p>MATHISEN: It was the best week of the year for oil prices, after rising today for a fifth straight session. Domestic crude up more than 8 percent this week, as crude and gasoline inventories fell more than expected and Saudi Arabia said it would reduce future oil output. That alleviated some oversupply concerns.</p><p>But the price of oil varied widely in the second quarter. That hurt ExxonMobil`s results but not doing much damage really to Chevron`s quarter. Shares of the country`s two oil producers moved in opposite direction. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) the best performing Dow stock today, Exxon the worst.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Investors weren`t expecting much from ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). That`s why this earnings miss really stings. The wide range in crude prices is partially to blame even though they were higher than they were a year ago.</p><p>The other reason is weak performance from Exxon`s exploration and production business. The downstream business, that`s refining, was stronger but weak here in the United States.</p><p>CEO Darren Woods said the company`s job is, quote, to grow long-term value by investing in our integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed regardless of market conditions. Since Woods took over on January 1st, succeeding Rex Tillerson, who is now secretary of state, Exxon has faced accusations of sanction violations, probes into whether the company hid data on climate change and questions of how it would grow oil output.</p><p>It`s a slightly different story for rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the second largest U.S. driller behind Exxon. It`s swung to a profit thanks to higher expected output from its wells even as returns from its refining business shrank.</p><p>What will be key for both companies is how they proceed going forward with oil just under $50 a barrel, do they keep drilling or do they pare back and allow prices to stabilize?</p><p>The U.S. is the swing producer right now.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, profit and performance should mean fewer headaches for American airlines, right? Well, that`s not really the case.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Billions of dollars in market cap went up in smoke. Shares of the big tobacco companies fell after the FDA said it wants to cut nicotine and cigarettes to non-addictive levels. Such a move would represent a sweeping federal effort to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages to carry health warnings. Altria and British American Tobacco were hit hard.</p><p>Aditi Roy has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nearly 90 percent of all adult smokers started the habit before they were 18. And then became hooked.</p><p>That`s the premise of the Food and Drug Administration`s sweeping new plan to regulate tobacco and nicotine.</p><p>DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER: We need to take a fresh look at nicotine itself.</p><p>ROY: The goal is to save lives. In a statement announcing the news, the agency said: Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use. The agency also reports a direct health care and lost productivity costs stemming from tobacco use, add up to nearly $300 billion.</p><p>To meet its goal, the FDA wants to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels and will take measures that will, quote, make tobacco products less toxic, appealing and addictive.</p><p>GOTTLIEB: But if the other chemical compounds in tobacco and in the smoke created by setting tobacco on fire that directly and primarily cause the illness and death, not the nicotine.</p><p>ROY: In other words, the FDA commissioner says by curbing the nicotine, more people will quit smoking and won`t be exposed to the more harmful elements of cigarettes. Upon the news, shares of cigarette stocks like Altria and British American Tobacco plummeted.</p><p>But some analysts say the regulations could help the market for cigarette alternatives. Some tobacco companies like Altria are developing less harmful products like smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes.</p><p>JOE AGNESE, CFRA ANALYST: I think the economics aren`t as good right now, but as the market develops, and perhaps with these changes, there will be a greater push and acceleration of growth in electronic cigarettes that longer-term the economics could improve.</p><p>ROY (on camera): He adds companies have some time before the regulations would take effect. Before the plan can go into motion, the FDA will have a public comment period. It`s unclear when that will start or how long that will take. Then the agency will evaluate the comments before finalizing the plan.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: American Airlines reported better than expected earnings for the second quarter. Like other carriers, demand is strong at the world`s biggest airline and that is pushing up average fares, fees and overall revenue. Meanwhile, the company`s CEO says American is not backing off its fight to stop the growth of Persian Gulf carriers in the U.S.</p><p>Phil LeBeau reports from Fort Worth, Texas, where American is headquartered.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For American airlines business is taking off, thanks to strong demand and a industry leading ability to drive greater passenger revenue. In fact, revenue per available seat mile is up almost 6 percent. In part because about half of the American passengers who buy a basic economy ticket are paying more to upgrade to a main cabin seat where they have more options to choose from.</p><p>DOUG PARKER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES: We had revenue growth, unit revenue growth of almost 6 percent. More than the industry is up. It`s evidence to us that the investments we`re making in our product and our people are working.</p><p>LEBEAU: For Parker, the profit and performance his team posted last quarter should mean fewer headaches for American. But that`s not happening thanks to Qatar Airways. The Middle East carrier wants to buy up to 10 percent of American, even though Parker has repeatedly criticized Qatar for using government subsidies to expand flights to the U.S., a practice that Parker says has hurt American and other U.S. carriers</p><p>PARKER: We`ll see where this all ends up, but the reality is, those three carriers are subsidized by their governments, and they`re competing against American Airlines, and other U.S. carriers, in an unfair way and it shouldn`t be allowed.</p><p>LEBEAU: While American pushes back against Qatar, its core business remains strong, with a healthy economy driving demand, and international travel not slowing down.</p><p>(on camera): And even as costs rise due in part to new labor contracts, Doug Parker believes American is poised to fly even higher as it heads into the remainder of this year.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Fort Worth, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Merck (NYSE:MRK) tops expectations, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The pharmaceutical company said cost cuts and strong demand for its top selling cancer drug Keytruda led to the higher than expected earnings. Merck (NYSE:MRK) also said the international cyber attack back in June which disrupted its manufacturing operations would, indeed, cut into profits for the remainder of this year. The company did, however, raise its sales outlook. Shares rose slightly to $64.11.</p><p>Goodyear said higher raw material costs and weaker demand for tires hurt results in the latest quarter. Despite seeing a drop in profit, the company reported earnings that were in line with estimates. But sales missed the mark. The company also cut its outlook for the entire unit sales, and segment operating income. Shares fell more than 8 percent to $32.51.</p><p>The furniture and electronics rental company Aaron`s (NYSE:AAN) reported a better than expected rise in sales as the company kept a tight lid on cost and benefited from growth in its progressive leasing division. Earnings also beat analyst expectations and shares took off, rising 17 percent to $47.54.</p><p>MATHISEN: Magellan Health missed estimates as the health care company said it experienced pricing pressure in two of its commercial accounts. Revenue however edged higher and was stronger than expected. Shares of Magellan Health off more than 3.5 percent on the session at $75.90.</p><p>And the online real estate broker Redfin went public on the Nasdaq today. The company offered more than 9 million shares at $15 apiece. Redfin shares -- look what they did? -- soaring 44 percent in their debut. They closed the day at $21.70.</p><p>HERERA: A quarter of the S&amp;P 500`s climb this year is due to five stocks - - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google`s parent Alphabet, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Our market monitor says some of those big tech names are ones you may want to own. This is his first appearance as our market monitor guest, though he has been on the program before.</p><p>We welcome back, Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager that BMO Global Asset Management.</p><p>Ernesto, nice to see you again. Welcome.</p><p>ERNESTO RAMOS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BMO GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Let`s get right to your picks. You pick Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). You say they have yet to enter the hot new markets such as virtual reality, original content, and things like that.</p><p>RAMOS: Yes, indeed. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is essentially an iPhone maker, and they are tapping that market very well. But, they`ve not yet really realized the full potential of other areas of the market that they have products that they`re bringing to market.</p><p>So, we think they have potential for growth in new areas, and they still have a magnificent cash cow in their iPhone, and the new iPhone 8 release in September will be a pretty big event similar to what the iPhone 6 release was a couple of years ago. So, we think the stock is trading at below market valuation is a very good pick for both its valuation, and its growth characteristics.</p><p>MATHISEN: Ernesto, your second choice is another tiny little company that nobody`s heard of that also begins with the letter A.</p><p>RAMOS: That`s the flip to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), I`m sure you`re talking about.</p><p>MATHISEN: You bet.</p><p>RAMOS: And that stock is valued through the roof but it`s growth is just incredible. They`ve posted, I can`t remember off the top of my head, how many consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent sales growth and the earnings fluctuate simply as a function of how much they`re investing back into their business on any given quarter. So --</p><p>MATHISEN: So, that number last night didn`t bother you at all?</p><p>RAMOS: No. What we`re looking at is the top line growth, and the disruption that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is bringing to markets, you know, they started as an online book seller, or actually online book seller but selling physical books, then they went into other areas of the market, and now, they`re basically trying to enter any area where the consumer might want to spend money, they want to be present there.</p><p>HERERA: Right.</p><p>RAMOS: And Jeff Bezos is succeeding pretty much at anything he tries. So, we`re excited about this company, despite the very rich valuation.</p><p>HERERA: OK. Let`s quickly move on to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now a major player in cloud. They`ve really shifted their business model consistently.</p><p>RAMOS: Well, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is sort of a hybrid between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). They`re disruptors in the sense that they`re adapting their business out of the legacy software and computers into the iCloud, and in particular the hybrid iCloud where users cannot only tap into the iCloud but leverage their existing infrastructures to combine the both, which is most of the companies in the U.S., such as our own company --</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>RAMOS: -- still in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) world and now we have access to iCloud and that is a new area and they`re doing it very well.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, Ernesto, thank you. Ernesto Ramos with BMO Global Asset Management.</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, they`re young, they`re hip and they`re fuelling the growth of, would you believe it, the RV market.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The treasury secretary tonight sent an update as to when the country will reach its debt limit. That new date is September 29th. Steve Mnuchin says the nation will run out of cash to meet its obligations on that date.</p><p>HERERA: Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) improperly charged more than 570,000 auto loan customers for auto insurance they did not need or were not told about. The bank debited the borrower`s bank accounts for that coverage. Members of the military on active duty were among those harmed. The bank will make $80 million in payments to compensate customers.</p><p>Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was fined $180 million last year for opening as many as 2 million accounts without customers` permission.</p><p>MATHISEN: Get your motor running. More RVs are heading out on the highway these days. But it`s not retirees who are looking for adventure.</p><p>Landon Dowdy tells us about the new crop of drivers hitting the road from Petaluma, California.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LANDON DOWDY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Kyle Miller is 32 years old and is on his second RV. He grew up camping and takes his young family on the road every month in the summertime.</p><p>KYLE MILLARD, MILLENNIAL RV OWNER: We picked this one because it has a bunk house system in the back as well as the outside kitchen. So, it`s something we can grow family-wise.</p><p>DOWDY: A record 9 million U.S. households now own an RV according to the recreation vehicle industry association. The industry has traditionally relied on retirees to drive growth. But now, younger buyers are getting behind the wheel.</p><p>NICOLE WALSH, RV OWNER: It just allows us to come together in a different way in sort of this, as you can see, see how we are in a fun way. But we also save money, so we can do some things that we might not otherwise get to do if we stayed in a hotel.</p><p>KRISTIN BETTENCOURT, RV OWNER: When we come for Thanksgiving, specifically, we have probably four to five trailers that come. And we all book spots right by each other. And then we have a couple family members who like to come but don`t have trailers, so they get cabins so that they can still be with us and enjoy the trip, too.</p><p>DOWDY (on camera): Younger buyers are opting more for towable trailers and come to camp grounds like this one here in California, wine country, to really experience the outdoor lifestyle trend.</p><p>(voice-over): And that has campground owners like Chris Wood investing in things like Wi-Fi and communal areas for millennials to mingle.</p><p>CHRIS WOOD, CAMPGROUND OWNER: For the millennial generation, you know, we`re looking at space here on the campground which was set up for pot lucks and bingo halls 30 years ago. And we`re setting it up for what we call third spaces, something kind of like your Starbuckses and stuff.</p><p>DOWDY: New data shows June towable shipments topped 20 percent year over year, while motor homes were up a more modest 6 percent.</p><p>RV makers like Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) are taking note of the towable takeover, offering new models tailored to entry level buyers and updated with new technology.</p><p>BOB MARTIN, CEO, THOR: It`s upgrading the electronics. It`s just adding the features that they`re used to. So a lot of the RVs are compatible to, you know, an iPhone. You know, a lot of the app-based things that run your AC, your awning, your jacks when you get there. Just makes it easier to camp.</p><p>DOWDY: Martin telling me that once buyers get RV-ing in their blood, they get hooked. Still analysts warn that while millennials are showing interest in RV-ing, it`s too early to know if those young buyers will drive the industry like the boomers did.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Landon Dowdy, Petaluma, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me, as well. Have a great weekend, everybody.

White House  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus is out with a tweet.  In his place, General  John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Focus on fundamentals.   The Dow closes at a record, despite all the chaos in the capital.  But at  what point will Washington start to really matter to investors?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  Up in smoke.  The FDA wants to make cigarettes less addictive, and  that burned a hole in a handful of tobacco stocks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, July  28th.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Developments out of Washington late this afternoon.  President Trump's  chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is out.  </p><p> The president broke the news in his favorite way, over Twitter, writing,  quote: I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary  John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff.  He is a great American, and a  great leader.  John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security.   He's been a true star of my administration.  </p><p> Mr. Priebus is the former Republican Party chairman, and he clashed with  other officials in the White House, including the new director of  communications, Anthony Scaramucci. </p><p> John Harwood joins us tonight on the phone from Washington.  </p><p> John, welcome, good to be with you.  </p><p> How big a surprise, John, is Priebus' departure?  And how big a surprise is  the appointment of Kelly as chief of staff?  </p><p> JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  Well,  I think the departure of Reince Priebus wasn't a surprise.  The timing was  a surprise.  I had been talking to people during the day who were saying,  you know, sometime in the next couple of weeks, certainly by Labor Day, so,  that wasn't unexpected.  </p><p> John Kelly had been rumored as a candidate for the job.  So had other  people, including Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive.   Deena Powell, also formerly from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).  </p><p> And the real question is what does this mean?  How does it change the  functioning of the White House?  Most things from the Trump administration  have revolved around the president personally, not his aides, but we'll see  whether General Kelly can bring a greater amount of discipline.  </p><p> HERERA:  What more -- what changes, other changes, might be possible?  For  instance, Mr. Bannon was targeted recently by Mr. Scaramucci.  What do you  see ahead, John?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  It is very difficult to predict this administration to say the  least.  The most conspicuous potential change that has been signaled is the  departure of the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Now I don't know if  that's actually going to happen.  The president has suggested as much. </p><p> I had a -- someone close to Trump tell me today they expected Bannon to  stay.  But I don't think you could make a heavy bet on any of this.  </p><p> One thing I think is interesting, though, I was talking to an ally of Paul  Ryan, the House speaker, who said that the departure of Priebus is  essentially un-tethering the Trump White House from the Republican party  and, in fact, predicted that the next phase of the Trump presidency may be  to go to war against the Republican Congress and blame them for his  problems.  </p><p> HERERA:  Well, he was Mr. Priebus, certainly, part of the Republican Party  establishment, former chairman of the party.  So what could this change  mean, not only for the operation of the White House, John, but for the  president's policy agenda?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  Well, if General Kelly can bring a greater amount of focus and  discipline to the White House, and to the president, for that matter, it is  possible that they could have a better experience with tax reform, which is  the next big reform than they have had with health care reform.  Obviously,  a lot of the problems on health care were inherent to that issue, and I  think a lot of the responsibility lies with the Congress, and not with  President Trump. </p><p> But, General Kelly is not experienced in politics.  And one of the  advantages of having Reince Priebus there was, in fact, you're trying to  get an agenda through with Republicans on Capitol Hill.  And, General Kelly  does not have any track record of doing that.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right, John Harwood, thanks very much, working late on the  weekend night.  John Harwood in Washington.</p><p> HERERA:  Well, while the drama in Washington continues, Wall Street is  blocking out the noise and staying squarely focused on the fundamentals.   Earnings and global growth are all supporting stocks, which saw the Dow  Jones Industrial Average close at a new high.  The blue chip Dow index  advanced 33 points to 21830, the Nasdaq lost seven and the S&amp;P 500 fell  three.  For the week, the Dow was the big winner.  </p><p> Bob Pisani has more on what's driving the market.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The stock market has a  high class problem right now.  An awful lot is going right.  </p><p> First and foremost, earnings have been strong.  We're past the halfway  mark.  Earnings are up more than 10 percent year over year.  Revenues are  up 5 percent.  </p><p> Estimates are strong for the third quarter, as well.  Valuations are  higher, all right.  But the margins are comfortable as long as there is  earnings growth and the economy is improving.  </p><p> And the global economy has been improving.  Money is flowing into European  stocks this year.  The credit markets are in great shape.  Defaults are  low.  And a recession, nowhere on the horizon. </p><p> Next, the dollar's been dropping, providing a tailwind for exporters.  And  rates are low.  And the Fed's reiterated this week that rates will stay low  for a long time and nobody's expecting a rate hike until December.  </p><p> All right.  What could go wrong with this?  Yes, Washington's a mess.  But  the markets don't care as long as tax cuts are somewhere on the horizon.   In 2018 has proven good enough so far.  There's definitely some kind of  premium in the market for a tax cut but we don't know how big this premium  is.  </p><p> Another issue that is sort of puzzling market watchers is geopolitical  risk.  Today, the North Koreans fired a missile into the Sea of Japan but  the markets shrugged it off.  Janus's Bill Gross said earlier this week  that a significant geopolitical event like North Korea would usually carry  a higher risk premium.  But so far, that hasn't been the case. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  So what, if anything, will it take for the market to turn its  attention to Washington in a more focused way?  </p><p> Jeff Moore is senior analyst at Global Risk Insights and he joins us now to  discuss.  </p><p> Jeff, how can the stock market and bond markets be so Zen when Washington  is so not?  </p><p> JEFF MOORE, SENIOR ANALYST, GLOBAL RISK INSIGHTS:  Well, I think that the  precedent was set a long time ago as far as the character of this  administration, and the interplay between the White House and Congress, so  there's a little bit of a de-sensitivity issue as far as how that  translates into market risk.  But I think it's going to take something  substantial and maybe some outside the domestic scene to actually introduce  some of that volatility.  </p><p> HERERA:  Would that be -- or might that be North Korea?  </p><p> MOORE:  I think so.  But more than North Korea's actions, I think more  importantly, judged by the market is going to be the reactions of the Trump  administration.  Any escalation as far as military action on the Korean  peninsula will be something that introduces a spike in volatility, that  could really unravel a lot of the complacency that's been going on in the  market so far.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Spike in volatility would be the most favorable outcome it might  well seem, if something big happens on the Korean peninsula.  </p><p> Let's talk a little bit about the GOP agenda.  I don't want to just call it  the Trump agenda.  A big part of it seems to have, for now, gone down in  flames on health care.  It is no easy push to push tax reform through.   Infrastructure, immigration, there are a lot of things standing out there  which of those has the potential to move the needle marketwise one way or  another?  Or the most potential, I should say.  </p><p> MOORE:  Yes, I think tax reform probably has the most potential of actually  following through, because you probably have a high level of consensus  among Congress and the White House of getting some tax reform policies  pushed through and signed into law.  But the question is, how they're able  to do that, when they've got a second or third on the list behind health  care, which so far has been a debacle?  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, Jeff, we just had John Harwood on the phone, and he  mentioned that he was hearing from sources that the next move by the White  House may be to go after Congress, because of the lack of movement on  things like health care.  If we start to get mutiny between Congress and  the administration, what do you think Wall Street's reaction would be to  that sort of a development?  Hypothetical at this point, certainly.  </p><p> MOORE:  Yes.  I think outside of some foreign policy issue that creeps up  and escalates, that open mutiny between Congress and the Trump  administration, if the Trump administration were to go after the Republican  Party, and the Republican majorities in Congress, that could really  escalate to the point of investors really coming to terms with some of  these agenda items, there are possibilities of actually getting passed  really, really sinking.  </p><p> And to this point, none of that has actually been passed through Congress,  and you would think the markets would have reacted negatively to that  already.  But, this kind of open political warfare between the White House,  and Congress, being of the same political party, would be really something  that causes investors to question where this is going as far as economic  policy standpoint.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right, Jeff.  Have a nice weekend.  Jeff Moore with Global  Risk Insights.  </p><p> HERERA: To the economy now, which rebounded this spring after a weak start  to the year.  Gross domestic product for the second quarter was 2.6  percent.  And while that was more than double the revised economic output  of the first three months of the year, it was slightly below expectations.   Consumers ramped up their spending, and businesses invested more on  equipment.  Inflation, though, retreated and wage growth decelerated,  despite an economy that's considered to be at or near full employment.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  It was the best week of the year for oil prices, after rising  today for a fifth straight session.  Domestic crude up more than 8 percent  this week, as crude and gasoline inventories fell more than expected and  Saudi Arabia said it would reduce future oil output.  That alleviated some  oversupply concerns. </p><p> But the price of oil varied widely in the second quarter.  That hurt  ExxonMobil's results but not doing much damage really to Chevron's quarter.   Shares of the country's two oil producers moved in opposite direction.   Chevron (NYSE:CVX) the best performing Dow stock today, Exxon the worst.  </p><p> Jackie DeAngelis has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Investors weren't  expecting much from ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM).  That's why this earnings miss  really stings.  The wide range in crude prices is partially to blame even  though they were higher than they were a year ago.  </p><p> The other reason is weak performance from Exxon's exploration and  production business.  The downstream business, that's refining, was  stronger but weak here in the United States. </p><p> CEO Darren Woods said the company's job is, quote, to grow long-term value  by investing in our integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed  regardless of market conditions.  Since Woods took over on January 1st,  succeeding Rex Tillerson, who is now secretary of state, Exxon has faced  accusations of sanction violations, probes into whether the company hid  data on climate change and questions of how it would grow oil output. </p><p> It's a slightly different story for rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the second  largest U.S. driller behind Exxon.  It's swung to a profit thanks to higher  expected output from its wells even as returns from its refining business  shrank.  </p><p> What will be key for both companies is how they proceed going forward with  oil just under $50 a barrel, do they keep drilling or do they pare back and  allow prices to stabilize? </p><p> The U.S. is the swing producer right now. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, profit and performance should mean fewer headaches  for American airlines, right?  Well, that's not really the case.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Billions of dollars in market cap went up in smoke.  Shares of the  big tobacco companies fell after the FDA said it wants to cut nicotine and  cigarettes to non-addictive levels.  Such a move would represent a sweeping  federal effort to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages  to carry health warnings.  Altria and British American Tobacco were hit  hard.  </p><p> Aditi Roy has the details.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Nearly 90  percent of all adult smokers started the habit before they were 18.  And  then became hooked.  </p><p> That's the premise of the Food and Drug Administration's sweeping new plan  to regulate tobacco and nicotine.  </p><p> DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER:  We need to take a fresh look at  nicotine itself.  </p><p> ROY:  The goal is to save lives.  In a statement announcing the news, the  agency said: Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today  will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.  The agency also  reports a direct health care and lost productivity costs stemming from  tobacco use, add up to nearly $300 billion.  </p><p> To meet its goal, the FDA wants to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to  non-addictive levels and will take measures that will, quote, make tobacco  products less toxic, appealing and addictive.  </p><p> GOTTLIEB:  But if the other chemical compounds in tobacco and in the smoke  created by setting tobacco on fire that directly and primarily cause the  illness and death, not the nicotine.  </p><p> ROY:  In other words, the FDA commissioner says by curbing the nicotine,  more people will quit smoking and won't be exposed to the more harmful  elements of cigarettes.  Upon the news, shares of cigarette stocks like  Altria and British American Tobacco plummeted.  </p><p> But some analysts say the regulations could help the market for cigarette  alternatives.  Some tobacco companies like Altria are developing less  harmful products like smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes.  </p><p> JOE AGNESE, CFRA ANALYST:  I think the economics aren't as good right now,  but as the market develops, and perhaps with these changes, there will be a  greater push and acceleration of growth in electronic cigarettes that  longer-term the economics could improve.  </p><p> ROY (on camera):  He adds companies have some time before the regulations  would take effect.  Before the plan can go into motion, the FDA will have a  public comment period.  It's unclear when that will start or how long that  will take.  Then the agency will evaluate the comments before finalizing  the plan.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  American Airlines reported better than expected earnings for the  second quarter.  Like other carriers, demand is strong at the world's  biggest airline and that is pushing up average fares, fees and overall  revenue.  Meanwhile, the company's CEO says American is not backing off its  fight to stop the growth of Persian Gulf carriers in the U.S.</p><p> Phil LeBeau reports from Fort Worth, Texas, where American is  headquartered.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For  American airlines business is taking off, thanks to strong demand and a  industry leading ability to drive greater passenger revenue.  In fact,  revenue per available seat mile is up almost 6 percent.  In part because  about half of the American passengers who buy a basic economy ticket are  paying more to upgrade to a main cabin seat where they have more options to  choose from.  </p><p> DOUG PARKER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  We had revenue growth,  unit revenue growth of almost 6 percent.  More than the industry is up.   It's evidence to us that the investments we're making in our product and  our people are working.  </p><p> LEBEAU:  For Parker, the profit and performance his team posted last  quarter should mean fewer headaches for American.  But that's not happening  thanks to Qatar Airways.  The Middle East carrier wants to buy up to 10  percent of American, even though Parker has repeatedly criticized Qatar for  using government subsidies to expand flights to the U.S., a practice that  Parker says has hurt American and other U.S. carriers </p><p> PARKER:  We'll see where this all ends up, but the reality is, those three  carriers are subsidized by their governments, and they're competing against  American Airlines, and other U.S. carriers, in an unfair way and it  shouldn't be allowed.  </p><p> LEBEAU:  While American pushes back against Qatar, its core business  remains strong, with a healthy economy driving demand, and international  travel not slowing down.  </p><p> (on camera):  And even as costs rise due in part to new labor contracts,  Doug Parker believes American is poised to fly even higher as it heads into  the remainder of this year. </p><p> Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Fort Worth, Texas. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Merck (NYSE:MRK) tops expectations, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The pharmaceutical company said cost cuts and strong demand for its top  selling cancer drug Keytruda led to the higher than expected earnings.   Merck (NYSE:MRK) also said the international cyber attack back in June  which disrupted its manufacturing operations would, indeed, cut into  profits for the remainder of this year.  The company did, however, raise  its sales outlook.  Shares rose slightly to $64.11. </p><p> Goodyear said higher raw material costs and weaker demand for tires hurt  results in the latest quarter.  Despite seeing a drop in profit, the  company reported earnings that were in line with estimates.  But sales  missed the mark.  The company also cut its outlook for the entire unit  sales, and segment operating income.  Shares fell more than 8 percent to  $32.51.  </p><p> The furniture and electronics rental company Aaron's (NYSE:AAN) reported a  better than expected rise in sales as the company kept a tight lid on cost  and benefited from growth in its progressive leasing division.  Earnings  also beat analyst expectations and shares took off, rising 17 percent to  $47.54.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Magellan Health missed estimates as the health care company said  it experienced pricing pressure in two of its commercial accounts.  Revenue  however edged higher and was stronger than expected.  Shares of Magellan  Health off more than 3.5 percent on the session at $75.90.  </p><p> And the online real estate broker Redfin went public on the Nasdaq today.   The company offered more than 9 million shares at $15 apiece.  Redfin  shares -- look what they did? -- soaring 44 percent in their debut.  They  closed the day at $21.70.  </p><p> HERERA:  A quarter of the S&amp;P 500's climb this year is due to five stocks - - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Google's parent Alphabet, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Our market monitor says  some of those big tech names are ones you may want to own.  This is his  first appearance as our market monitor guest, though he has been on the  program before.  </p><p> We welcome back, Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager that BMO Global Asset  Management.  </p><p> Ernesto, nice to see you again.  Welcome.  </p><p> ERNESTO RAMOS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BMO GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thank you.  </p><p> HERERA:  Let's get right to your picks.  You pick Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  You  say they have yet to enter the hot new markets such as virtual reality,  original content, and things like that.  </p><p> RAMOS:  Yes, indeed.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is essentially an iPhone maker,  and they are tapping that market very well.  But, they've not yet really  realized the full potential of other areas of the market that they have  products that they're bringing to market. </p><p> So, we think they have potential for growth in new areas, and they still  have a magnificent cash cow in their iPhone, and the new iPhone 8 release  in September will be a pretty big event similar to what the iPhone 6  release was a couple of years ago.  So, we think the stock is trading at  below market valuation is a very good pick for both its valuation, and its  growth characteristics.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Ernesto, your second choice is another tiny little company that  nobody's heard of that also begins with the letter A.  </p><p> RAMOS:  That's the flip to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), I'm  sure you're talking about.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  You bet.</p><p> RAMOS:  And that stock is valued through the roof but it's growth is just  incredible.  They've posted, I can't remember off the top of my head, how  many consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent sales growth and the earnings  fluctuate simply as a function of how much they're investing back into  their business on any given quarter.  So -- </p><p> MATHISEN:  So, that number last night didn't bother you at all?  </p><p> RAMOS:  No.  What we're looking at is the top line growth, and the  disruption that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is bringing to markets, you know, they  started as an online book seller, or actually online book seller but  selling physical books, then they went into other areas of the market, and  now, they're basically trying to enter any area where the consumer might  want to spend money, they want to be present there.  </p><p> HERERA:  Right.  </p><p> RAMOS:  And Jeff Bezos is succeeding pretty much at anything he tries.  So,  we're excited about this company, despite the very rich valuation.  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.  Let's quickly move on to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now a major  player in cloud.  They've really shifted their business model consistently.</p><p> RAMOS:  Well, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is sort of a hybrid between Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  They're disruptors in the sense  that they're adapting their business out of the legacy software and  computers into the iCloud, and in particular the hybrid iCloud where users  cannot only tap into the iCloud but leverage their existing infrastructures  to combine the both, which is most of the companies in the U.S., such as  our own company --</p><p> HERERA:  OK.  </p><p> RAMOS:   -- still in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) world and now we have access  to iCloud and that is a new area and they're doing it very well.  </p><p> HERERA:  On that note, Ernesto, thank you.  Ernesto Ramos with BMO Global  Asset Management.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Coming up, they're young, they're hip and they're fuelling the  growth of, would you believe it, the RV market.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  The treasury secretary tonight sent an update as to when the  country will reach its debt limit.  That new date is September 29th.  Steve  Mnuchin says the nation will run out of cash to meet its obligations on  that date.  </p><p> HERERA:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) improperly charged more than 570,000 auto  loan customers for auto insurance they did not need or were not told about.   The bank debited the borrower's bank accounts for that coverage.  Members  of the military on active duty were among those harmed.  The bank will make  $80 million in payments to compensate customers.  </p><p> Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was fined $180 million last year for opening as many  as 2 million accounts without customers' permission.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Get your motor running.  More RVs are heading out on the highway  these days.  But it's not retirees who are looking for adventure.  </p><p> Landon Dowdy tells us about the new crop of drivers hitting the road from  Petaluma, California.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LANDON DOWDY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Kyle  Miller is 32 years old and is on his second RV.  He grew up camping and  takes his young family on the road every month in the summertime.  </p><p> KYLE MILLARD, MILLENNIAL RV OWNER:  We picked this one because it has a  bunk house system in the back as well as the outside kitchen.  So, it's  something we can grow family-wise.  </p><p> DOWDY:  A record 9 million U.S. households now own an RV according to the  recreation vehicle industry association.  The industry has traditionally  relied on retirees to drive growth.  But now, younger buyers are getting  behind the wheel.  </p><p> NICOLE WALSH, RV OWNER:  It just allows us to come together in a different  way in sort of this, as you can see, see how we are in a fun way.  But we  also save money, so we can do some things that we might not otherwise get  to do if we stayed in a hotel.  </p><p> KRISTIN BETTENCOURT, RV OWNER:  When we come for Thanksgiving,  specifically, we have probably four to five trailers that come.  And we all  book spots right by each other.  And then we have a couple family members  who like to come but don't have trailers, so they get cabins so that they  can still be with us and enjoy the trip, too.  </p><p> DOWDY (on camera):  Younger buyers are opting more for towable trailers and  come to camp grounds like this one here in California, wine country, to  really experience the outdoor lifestyle trend.  </p><p> (voice-over):  And that has campground owners like Chris Wood investing in  things like Wi-Fi and communal areas for millennials to mingle.  </p><p> CHRIS WOOD, CAMPGROUND OWNER:  For the millennial generation, you know,  we're looking at space here on the campground which was set up for pot  lucks and bingo halls 30 years ago.  And we're setting it up for what we  call third spaces, something kind of like your Starbuckses and stuff.</p><p> DOWDY:  New data shows June towable shipments topped 20 percent year over  year, while motor homes were up a more modest 6 percent. </p><p> RV makers like Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) are taking note of the towable  takeover, offering new models tailored to entry level buyers and updated  with new technology.  </p><p> BOB MARTIN, CEO, THOR:  It's upgrading the electronics.  It's just adding  the features that they're used to.  So a lot of the RVs are compatible to,  you know, an iPhone.  You know, a lot of the app-based things that run your  AC, your awning, your jacks when you get there.  Just makes it easier to  camp.  </p><p> DOWDY:  Martin telling me that once buyers get RV-ing in their blood, they  get hooked.  Still analysts warn that while millennials are showing  interest in RV-ing, it's too early to know if those young buyers will drive  the industry like the boomers did.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Landon Dowdy, Petaluma, California.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me, as well.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.  We'll see you back here Monday.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

White House  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus is out with a tweet.  In his place, General  John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Focus on fundamentals.   The Dow closes at a record, despite all the chaos in the capital.  But at  what point will Washington start to really matter to investors?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  Up in smoke.  The FDA wants to make cigarettes less addictive, and  that burned a hole in a handful of tobacco stocks.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, July  28th.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Developments out of Washington late this afternoon.  President Trump's  chief of staff, Reince Priebus, is out.  </p><p> The president broke the news in his favorite way, over Twitter, writing,  quote: I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary  John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff.  He is a great American, and a  great leader.  John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security.   He's been a true star of my administration.  </p><p> Mr. Priebus is the former Republican Party chairman, and he clashed with  other officials in the White House, including the new director of  communications, Anthony Scaramucci. </p><p> John Harwood joins us tonight on the phone from Washington.  </p><p> John, welcome, good to be with you.  </p><p> How big a surprise, John, is Priebus' departure?  And how big a surprise is  the appointment of Kelly as chief of staff?  </p><p> JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (via telephone):  Well,  I think the departure of Reince Priebus wasn't a surprise.  The timing was  a surprise.  I had been talking to people during the day who were saying,  you know, sometime in the next couple of weeks, certainly by Labor Day, so,  that wasn't unexpected.  </p><p> John Kelly had been rumored as a candidate for the job.  So had other  people, including Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive.   Deena Powell, also formerly from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).  </p><p> And the real question is what does this mean?  How does it change the  functioning of the White House?  Most things from the Trump administration  have revolved around the president personally, not his aides, but we'll see  whether General Kelly can bring a greater amount of discipline.  </p><p> HERERA:  What more -- what changes, other changes, might be possible?  For  instance, Mr. Bannon was targeted recently by Mr. Scaramucci.  What do you  see ahead, John?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  It is very difficult to predict this administration to say the  least.  The most conspicuous potential change that has been signaled is the  departure of the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Now I don't know if  that's actually going to happen.  The president has suggested as much. </p><p> I had a -- someone close to Trump tell me today they expected Bannon to  stay.  But I don't think you could make a heavy bet on any of this.  </p><p> One thing I think is interesting, though, I was talking to an ally of Paul  Ryan, the House speaker, who said that the departure of Priebus is  essentially un-tethering the Trump White House from the Republican party  and, in fact, predicted that the next phase of the Trump presidency may be  to go to war against the Republican Congress and blame them for his  problems.  </p><p> HERERA:  Well, he was Mr. Priebus, certainly, part of the Republican Party  establishment, former chairman of the party.  So what could this change  mean, not only for the operation of the White House, John, but for the  president's policy agenda?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  Well, if General Kelly can bring a greater amount of focus and  discipline to the White House, and to the president, for that matter, it is  possible that they could have a better experience with tax reform, which is  the next big reform than they have had with health care reform.  Obviously,  a lot of the problems on health care were inherent to that issue, and I  think a lot of the responsibility lies with the Congress, and not with  President Trump. </p><p> But, General Kelly is not experienced in politics.  And one of the  advantages of having Reince Priebus there was, in fact, you're trying to  get an agenda through with Republicans on Capitol Hill.  And, General Kelly  does not have any track record of doing that.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right, John Harwood, thanks very much, working late on the  weekend night.  John Harwood in Washington.</p><p> HERERA:  Well, while the drama in Washington continues, Wall Street is  blocking out the noise and staying squarely focused on the fundamentals.   Earnings and global growth are all supporting stocks, which saw the Dow  Jones Industrial Average close at a new high.  The blue chip Dow index  advanced 33 points to 21830, the Nasdaq lost seven and the S&amp;P 500 fell  three.  For the week, the Dow was the big winner.  </p><p> Bob Pisani has more on what's driving the market.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The stock market has a  high class problem right now.  An awful lot is going right.  </p><p> First and foremost, earnings have been strong.  We're past the halfway  mark.  Earnings are up more than 10 percent year over year.  Revenues are  up 5 percent.  </p><p> Estimates are strong for the third quarter, as well.  Valuations are  higher, all right.  But the margins are comfortable as long as there is  earnings growth and the economy is improving.  </p><p> And the global economy has been improving.  Money is flowing into European  stocks this year.  The credit markets are in great shape.  Defaults are  low.  And a recession, nowhere on the horizon. </p><p> Next, the dollar's been dropping, providing a tailwind for exporters.  And  rates are low.  And the Fed's reiterated this week that rates will stay low  for a long time and nobody's expecting a rate hike until December.  </p><p> All right.  What could go wrong with this?  Yes, Washington's a mess.  But  the markets don't care as long as tax cuts are somewhere on the horizon.   In 2018 has proven good enough so far.  There's definitely some kind of  premium in the market for a tax cut but we don't know how big this premium  is.  </p><p> Another issue that is sort of puzzling market watchers is geopolitical  risk.  Today, the North Koreans fired a missile into the Sea of Japan but  the markets shrugged it off.  Janus's Bill Gross said earlier this week  that a significant geopolitical event like North Korea would usually carry  a higher risk premium.  But so far, that hasn't been the case. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  So what, if anything, will it take for the market to turn its  attention to Washington in a more focused way?  </p><p> Jeff Moore is senior analyst at Global Risk Insights and he joins us now to  discuss.  </p><p> Jeff, how can the stock market and bond markets be so Zen when Washington  is so not?  </p><p> JEFF MOORE, SENIOR ANALYST, GLOBAL RISK INSIGHTS:  Well, I think that the  precedent was set a long time ago as far as the character of this  administration, and the interplay between the White House and Congress, so  there's a little bit of a de-sensitivity issue as far as how that  translates into market risk.  But I think it's going to take something  substantial and maybe some outside the domestic scene to actually introduce  some of that volatility.  </p><p> HERERA:  Would that be -- or might that be North Korea?  </p><p> MOORE:  I think so.  But more than North Korea's actions, I think more  importantly, judged by the market is going to be the reactions of the Trump  administration.  Any escalation as far as military action on the Korean  peninsula will be something that introduces a spike in volatility, that  could really unravel a lot of the complacency that's been going on in the  market so far.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Spike in volatility would be the most favorable outcome it might  well seem, if something big happens on the Korean peninsula.  </p><p> Let's talk a little bit about the GOP agenda.  I don't want to just call it  the Trump agenda.  A big part of it seems to have, for now, gone down in  flames on health care.  It is no easy push to push tax reform through.   Infrastructure, immigration, there are a lot of things standing out there  which of those has the potential to move the needle marketwise one way or  another?  Or the most potential, I should say.  </p><p> MOORE:  Yes, I think tax reform probably has the most potential of actually  following through, because you probably have a high level of consensus  among Congress and the White House of getting some tax reform policies  pushed through and signed into law.  But the question is, how they're able  to do that, when they've got a second or third on the list behind health  care, which so far has been a debacle?  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, Jeff, we just had John Harwood on the phone, and he  mentioned that he was hearing from sources that the next move by the White  House may be to go after Congress, because of the lack of movement on  things like health care.  If we start to get mutiny between Congress and  the administration, what do you think Wall Street's reaction would be to  that sort of a development?  Hypothetical at this point, certainly.  </p><p> MOORE:  Yes.  I think outside of some foreign policy issue that creeps up  and escalates, that open mutiny between Congress and the Trump  administration, if the Trump administration were to go after the Republican  Party, and the Republican majorities in Congress, that could really  escalate to the point of investors really coming to terms with some of  these agenda items, there are possibilities of actually getting passed  really, really sinking.  </p><p> And to this point, none of that has actually been passed through Congress,  and you would think the markets would have reacted negatively to that  already.  But, this kind of open political warfare between the White House,  and Congress, being of the same political party, would be really something  that causes investors to question where this is going as far as economic  policy standpoint.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right, Jeff.  Have a nice weekend.  Jeff Moore with Global  Risk Insights.  </p><p> HERERA: To the economy now, which rebounded this spring after a weak start  to the year.  Gross domestic product for the second quarter was 2.6  percent.  And while that was more than double the revised economic output  of the first three months of the year, it was slightly below expectations.   Consumers ramped up their spending, and businesses invested more on  equipment.  Inflation, though, retreated and wage growth decelerated,  despite an economy that's considered to be at or near full employment.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  It was the best week of the year for oil prices, after rising  today for a fifth straight session.  Domestic crude up more than 8 percent  this week, as crude and gasoline inventories fell more than expected and  Saudi Arabia said it would reduce future oil output.  That alleviated some  oversupply concerns. </p><p> But the price of oil varied widely in the second quarter.  That hurt  ExxonMobil's results but not doing much damage really to Chevron's quarter.   Shares of the country's two oil producers moved in opposite direction.   Chevron (NYSE:CVX) the best performing Dow stock today, Exxon the worst.  </p><p> Jackie DeAngelis has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Investors weren't  expecting much from ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM).  That's why this earnings miss  really stings.  The wide range in crude prices is partially to blame even  though they were higher than they were a year ago.  </p><p> The other reason is weak performance from Exxon's exploration and  production business.  The downstream business, that's refining, was  stronger but weak here in the United States. </p><p> CEO Darren Woods said the company's job is, quote, to grow long-term value  by investing in our integrated portfolio of opportunities that succeed  regardless of market conditions.  Since Woods took over on January 1st,  succeeding Rex Tillerson, who is now secretary of state, Exxon has faced  accusations of sanction violations, probes into whether the company hid  data on climate change and questions of how it would grow oil output. </p><p> It's a slightly different story for rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the second  largest U.S. driller behind Exxon.  It's swung to a profit thanks to higher  expected output from its wells even as returns from its refining business  shrank.  </p><p> What will be key for both companies is how they proceed going forward with  oil just under $50 a barrel, do they keep drilling or do they pare back and  allow prices to stabilize? </p><p> The U.S. is the swing producer right now. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, profit and performance should mean fewer headaches  for American airlines, right?  Well, that's not really the case.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Billions of dollars in market cap went up in smoke.  Shares of the  big tobacco companies fell after the FDA said it wants to cut nicotine and  cigarettes to non-addictive levels.  Such a move would represent a sweeping  federal effort to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages  to carry health warnings.  Altria and British American Tobacco were hit  hard.  </p><p> Aditi Roy has the details.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Nearly 90  percent of all adult smokers started the habit before they were 18.  And  then became hooked.  </p><p> That's the premise of the Food and Drug Administration's sweeping new plan  to regulate tobacco and nicotine.  </p><p> DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER:  We need to take a fresh look at  nicotine itself.  </p><p> ROY:  The goal is to save lives.  In a statement announcing the news, the  agency said: Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today  will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.  The agency also  reports a direct health care and lost productivity costs stemming from  tobacco use, add up to nearly $300 billion.  </p><p> To meet its goal, the FDA wants to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to  non-addictive levels and will take measures that will, quote, make tobacco  products less toxic, appealing and addictive.  </p><p> GOTTLIEB:  But if the other chemical compounds in tobacco and in the smoke  created by setting tobacco on fire that directly and primarily cause the  illness and death, not the nicotine.  </p><p> ROY:  In other words, the FDA commissioner says by curbing the nicotine,  more people will quit smoking and won't be exposed to the more harmful  elements of cigarettes.  Upon the news, shares of cigarette stocks like  Altria and British American Tobacco plummeted.  </p><p> But some analysts say the regulations could help the market for cigarette  alternatives.  Some tobacco companies like Altria are developing less  harmful products like smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes.  </p><p> JOE AGNESE, CFRA ANALYST:  I think the economics aren't as good right now,  but as the market develops, and perhaps with these changes, there will be a  greater push and acceleration of growth in electronic cigarettes that  longer-term the economics could improve.  </p><p> ROY (on camera):  He adds companies have some time before the regulations  would take effect.  Before the plan can go into motion, the FDA will have a  public comment period.  It's unclear when that will start or how long that  will take.  Then the agency will evaluate the comments before finalizing  the plan.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  American Airlines reported better than expected earnings for the  second quarter.  Like other carriers, demand is strong at the world's  biggest airline and that is pushing up average fares, fees and overall  revenue.  Meanwhile, the company's CEO says American is not backing off its  fight to stop the growth of Persian Gulf carriers in the U.S.</p><p> Phil LeBeau reports from Fort Worth, Texas, where American is  headquartered.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For  American airlines business is taking off, thanks to strong demand and a  industry leading ability to drive greater passenger revenue.  In fact,  revenue per available seat mile is up almost 6 percent.  In part because  about half of the American passengers who buy a basic economy ticket are  paying more to upgrade to a main cabin seat where they have more options to  choose from.  </p><p> DOUG PARKER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  We had revenue growth,  unit revenue growth of almost 6 percent.  More than the industry is up.   It's evidence to us that the investments we're making in our product and  our people are working.  </p><p> LEBEAU:  For Parker, the profit and performance his team posted last  quarter should mean fewer headaches for American.  But that's not happening  thanks to Qatar Airways.  The Middle East carrier wants to buy up to 10  percent of American, even though Parker has repeatedly criticized Qatar for  using government subsidies to expand flights to the U.S., a practice that  Parker says has hurt American and other U.S. carriers </p><p> PARKER:  We'll see where this all ends up, but the reality is, those three  carriers are subsidized by their governments, and they're competing against  American Airlines, and other U.S. carriers, in an unfair way and it  shouldn't be allowed.  </p><p> LEBEAU:  While American pushes back against Qatar, its core business  remains strong, with a healthy economy driving demand, and international  travel not slowing down.  </p><p> (on camera):  And even as costs rise due in part to new labor contracts,  Doug Parker believes American is poised to fly even higher as it heads into  the remainder of this year. </p><p> Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Fort Worth, Texas. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Merck (NYSE:MRK) tops expectations, and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The pharmaceutical company said cost cuts and strong demand for its top  selling cancer drug Keytruda led to the higher than expected earnings.   Merck (NYSE:MRK) also said the international cyber attack back in June  which disrupted its manufacturing operations would, indeed, cut into  profits for the remainder of this year.  The company did, however, raise  its sales outlook.  Shares rose slightly to $64.11. </p><p> Goodyear said higher raw material costs and weaker demand for tires hurt  results in the latest quarter.  Despite seeing a drop in profit, the  company reported earnings that were in line with estimates.  But sales  missed the mark.  The company also cut its outlook for the entire unit  sales, and segment operating income.  Shares fell more than 8 percent to  $32.51.  </p><p> The furniture and electronics rental company Aaron's (NYSE:AAN) reported a  better than expected rise in sales as the company kept a tight lid on cost  and benefited from growth in its progressive leasing division.  Earnings  also beat analyst expectations and shares took off, rising 17 percent to  $47.54.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Magellan Health missed estimates as the health care company said  it experienced pricing pressure in two of its commercial accounts.  Revenue  however edged higher and was stronger than expected.  Shares of Magellan  Health off more than 3.5 percent on the session at $75.90.  </p><p> And the online real estate broker Redfin went public on the Nasdaq today.   The company offered more than 9 million shares at $15 apiece.  Redfin  shares -- look what they did? -- soaring 44 percent in their debut.  They  closed the day at $21.70.  </p><p> HERERA:  A quarter of the S&amp;P 500's climb this year is due to five stocks - - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  Google's parent Alphabet, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Our market monitor says  some of those big tech names are ones you may want to own.  This is his  first appearance as our market monitor guest, though he has been on the  program before.  </p><p> We welcome back, Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager that BMO Global Asset  Management.  </p><p> Ernesto, nice to see you again.  Welcome.  </p><p> ERNESTO RAMOS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BMO GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thank you.  </p><p> HERERA:  Let's get right to your picks.  You pick Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  You  say they have yet to enter the hot new markets such as virtual reality,  original content, and things like that.  </p><p> RAMOS:  Yes, indeed.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is essentially an iPhone maker,  and they are tapping that market very well.  But, they've not yet really  realized the full potential of other areas of the market that they have  products that they're bringing to market. </p><p> So, we think they have potential for growth in new areas, and they still  have a magnificent cash cow in their iPhone, and the new iPhone 8 release  in September will be a pretty big event similar to what the iPhone 6  release was a couple of years ago.  So, we think the stock is trading at  below market valuation is a very good pick for both its valuation, and its  growth characteristics.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Ernesto, your second choice is another tiny little company that  nobody's heard of that also begins with the letter A.  </p><p> RAMOS:  That's the flip to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), I'm  sure you're talking about.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  You bet.</p><p> RAMOS:  And that stock is valued through the roof but it's growth is just  incredible.  They've posted, I can't remember off the top of my head, how  many consecutive quarters of 20-plus percent sales growth and the earnings  fluctuate simply as a function of how much they're investing back into  their business on any given quarter.  So -- </p><p> MATHISEN:  So, that number last night didn't bother you at all?  </p><p> RAMOS:  No.  What we're looking at is the top line growth, and the  disruption that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is bringing to markets, you know, they  started as an online book seller, or actually online book seller but  selling physical books, then they went into other areas of the market, and  now, they're basically trying to enter any area where the consumer might  want to spend money, they want to be present there.  </p><p> HERERA:  Right.  </p><p> RAMOS:  And Jeff Bezos is succeeding pretty much at anything he tries.  So,  we're excited about this company, despite the very rich valuation.  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.  Let's quickly move on to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now a major  player in cloud.  They've really shifted their business model consistently.</p><p> RAMOS:  Well, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is sort of a hybrid between Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  They're disruptors in the sense  that they're adapting their business out of the legacy software and  computers into the iCloud, and in particular the hybrid iCloud where users  cannot only tap into the iCloud but leverage their existing infrastructures  to combine the both, which is most of the companies in the U.S., such as  our own company --</p><p> HERERA:  OK.  </p><p> RAMOS:   -- still in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) world and now we have access  to iCloud and that is a new area and they're doing it very well.  </p><p> HERERA:  On that note, Ernesto, thank you.  Ernesto Ramos with BMO Global  Asset Management.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Coming up, they're young, they're hip and they're fuelling the  growth of, would you believe it, the RV market.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  The treasury secretary tonight sent an update as to when the  country will reach its debt limit.  That new date is September 29th.  Steve  Mnuchin says the nation will run out of cash to meet its obligations on  that date.  </p><p> HERERA:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) improperly charged more than 570,000 auto  loan customers for auto insurance they did not need or were not told about.   The bank debited the borrower's bank accounts for that coverage.  Members  of the military on active duty were among those harmed.  The bank will make  $80 million in payments to compensate customers.  </p><p> Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was fined $180 million last year for opening as many  as 2 million accounts without customers' permission.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Get your motor running.  More RVs are heading out on the highway  these days.  But it's not retirees who are looking for adventure.  </p><p> Landon Dowdy tells us about the new crop of drivers hitting the road from  Petaluma, California.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LANDON DOWDY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Kyle  Miller is 32 years old and is on his second RV.  He grew up camping and  takes his young family on the road every month in the summertime.  </p><p> KYLE MILLARD, MILLENNIAL RV OWNER:  We picked this one because it has a  bunk house system in the back as well as the outside kitchen.  So, it's  something we can grow family-wise.  </p><p> DOWDY:  A record 9 million U.S. households now own an RV according to the  recreation vehicle industry association.  The industry has traditionally  relied on retirees to drive growth.  But now, younger buyers are getting  behind the wheel.  </p><p> NICOLE WALSH, RV OWNER:  It just allows us to come together in a different  way in sort of this, as you can see, see how we are in a fun way.  But we  also save money, so we can do some things that we might not otherwise get  to do if we stayed in a hotel.  </p><p> KRISTIN BETTENCOURT, RV OWNER:  When we come for Thanksgiving,  specifically, we have probably four to five trailers that come.  And we all  book spots right by each other.  And then we have a couple family members  who like to come but don't have trailers, so they get cabins so that they  can still be with us and enjoy the trip, too.  </p><p> DOWDY (on camera):  Younger buyers are opting more for towable trailers and  come to camp grounds like this one here in California, wine country, to  really experience the outdoor lifestyle trend.  </p><p> (voice-over):  And that has campground owners like Chris Wood investing in  things like Wi-Fi and communal areas for millennials to mingle.  </p><p> CHRIS WOOD, CAMPGROUND OWNER:  For the millennial generation, you know,  we're looking at space here on the campground which was set up for pot  lucks and bingo halls 30 years ago.  And we're setting it up for what we  call third spaces, something kind of like your Starbuckses and stuff.</p><p> DOWDY:  New data shows June towable shipments topped 20 percent year over  year, while motor homes were up a more modest 6 percent. </p><p> RV makers like Thor Industries (NYSE:THO) are taking note of the towable  takeover, offering new models tailored to entry level buyers and updated  with new technology.  </p><p> BOB MARTIN, CEO, THOR:  It's upgrading the electronics.  It's just adding  the features that they're used to.  So a lot of the RVs are compatible to,  you know, an iPhone.  You know, a lot of the app-based things that run your  AC, your awning, your jacks when you get there.  Just makes it easier to  camp.  </p><p> DOWDY:  Martin telling me that once buyers get RV-ing in their blood, they  get hooked.  Still analysts warn that while millennials are showing  interest in RV-ing, it's too early to know if those young buyers will drive  the industry like the boomers did.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Landon Dowdy, Petaluma, California.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me, as well.  Have a great  weekend, everybody.

Shares of big technology names fell hard on reports the government may be looking at more antitrust investigations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Time to cut?  More and more on Wall Street are convinced an interest rate cut needs to happen soon, and one Fed president seems to agree.  But more ominous, the street also thinks we might be headed for a recession.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  And the plane truth.  Another problem for Boeing`s 737 including the MAX, but the company stands by its word that it is making progress fixing the plane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, June 3rd.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>It was a back-and-forth kind of day on Wall Street, a tug of war between the outlook for interest rates and the prospects for technology.  The Nasdaq was especially hit hard today on reports the government is looking at possibly targeting some big tech names with antitrust investigations.</p><p>It started with a \"Wall Street Journal\" report saying the justice department is getting ready to take on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) then got hit when \"The Journal\" said the FTC would look into how the social media giant affects digital competition.  \"The Washington Post (NYSE:WPO)\" then jumped in and said the FTC might look into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  And not to be outdone, \"Reuters\" said the justice got the jurisdiction to investigate Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and their practices.</p><p>And late in the day, a House committee said that it was going to launch a bipartisan investigation into competitiveness in the digital markets.</p><p>It`s too early to say whether any of these stories are going to pan out, but the stocks were hit and they were hit hard in today`s trade.</p><p>HERERA:  So let`s bring in John Freeman to discuss what regulation could mean for some of these big companies.  He`s an equity analyst at CFRA Research.</p><p>Welcome.  Nice to have you here, John.</p><p>JOHN FREEMAN, CFRA RESEARCH EQUITY ANALYST:  Well, thank you very much.  Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  It`s a diverse group of companies.  They`re all in the tech space, of course, but they all do very different things.  So, how would regulation apply?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you know, looking at historical perspective the way it applied to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), there are certain remedies, you know, the fines and so forth.  Those are really immaterial, but for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) the big one was, of course, debundling the browser from the operating system, Windows, which actually didn`t really affect, you know, that much in my opinion.  But the real one was keeping Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in a box in terms of M&amp;A.  Couldn`t use all of its profit and market caps here to acquire companies to expand into adjacent markets.</p><p>So, fast forward to now, I think that kind of similar but with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), for example, it`s very strange.  I mean, how do you, you know, debundle a search algorithm?  You would have very strange unintended consequences.  I don`t think -- I don`t think it`s really even possible.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as well.  I kind of scratch my head, obviously you can break it up into Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) I suppose.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But the big thing is that all of these companies will be in an M&amp;A box.  They won`t be able to use their market cap and their cash to buy companies to get into adjacent markets.</p><p>So, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) --</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), there are those who feel that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a stranglehold on the app market with its App Store and how much it charges and how much it does not allow some companies in with their developments.  But just today with their announcement, it seems like they`re starting to change the way they`re going to deal with that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, it`s very interesting.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is definitely getting ahead of this regulation I think in a smarter way than the others.  However, the App Store, you know, at this point I don`t think that the app store, you know, is a huge -- that the bundling of the App Store -- if they opened up the App Store to third party providers, I don`t think at this point it would really affect, you know, sales of iPhones or tablets.  Matter of fact, it might even enhance it at this point.</p><p>So, for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) I don`t think it`s going to be --</p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- as big of a deal.  The thing really intriguing about the House Judiciary, you know, press release or announcement was the third point that they made, that they were going to look at the regulations themselves, the antitrust regulations themselves, to see --</p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- if there are changes that could, you know, impact -- that would basically keep the monopolistic power of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and so forth in check.</p><p>HERERA:  We watch that --</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think that`s the dark horse and a scarier thing.</p><p>HERERA:  OK.  John Freeman with CFRA Research, thank you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now to interest rates.  St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said today that a rate cut may be warranted soon.  That`s a quote.  Bullard cited global trade tensions and weak inflation in the U.S., and many on Wall Street seemed to agree.  The interest rate futures market may have already priced in several cuts this year.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman tells us, the street is also looking at something far worse.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Several forecasters are now convinced the U.S. economy is headed for recession as a result of existing and threatening tariffs from the Trump administration.</p><p>Citing rising trade protectionism, forecasters responding to a new survey from the National Association for Business Economics, put the chance of recession next year at 60 percent, up from just 15 percent this year.  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) wrote in a report, quote, if trade tensions continue to escalate, we believe the global cycle will be in recession in three quarters.</p><p>Even the president`s own economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, indirectly said the new tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy.</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS CHAIRMAN:  I can say if folks are tuning up their models to work on it today, I think one of the things you see especially in the near term, the impacts are much larger on Mexico than the U.S.  And I think the intent of this is to solve a very, very important problem that the president is focused on.</p><p>LIESMAN:  And the consensus has quickly changed from no interest rate cuts this year from the Federal Reserve to general agreement to multiple cuts as bond yields have fallen sharply.</p><p>ROGER ALTMAN, EVERCORE EXEC. CHAIRMAN:  You look at the ten year, 2.10 in round numbers.  You look at the obvious reversal of the outlook for the Fed in terms of market expectations, those are all bear signs.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Altman`s company said in a report, we now see a base case in which the fed will reluctantly cut ties three times in November.  Market prices priced in a rate cut as soon as July and agree with Evercore that multiple cuts are on the way.</p><p>The question is whether they`re ready to cut interest rates so soon as saying it`s on hold for an extended period.  If it does, markets have to wonder if rate cuts are the height economic answer to tariff hikes.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Adding to those concerns, trade tensions.  Steve mentioned the tariffs and Mexico, and over the weekend, China issued a so-called white paper outlining its positions in its dispute with the U.S.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing with more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  China released its white paper, its second policy paper on the trade conflict with the United States, and it listed the three things that it wants to see before Beijing will come to the negotiating table.  First, the U.S. needs to remove all tariffs imposed since last year on Chinese goods, be realistic about the size of Chinese purchases of U.S. products and ensure there is balance in the text of the deal.  Otherwise, the white paper was highly critical of the U.S.`s tactics and put all of the blame for the failed talks on Washington.</p><p>In the meantime, Beijing says it will fight the trade war to the end.  Tariffs on American goods kicked in this weekend.  Beijing outlined its criteria for its unreliable entity`s list, the black list for foreign firms and individuals, and state media said Federal Express (NYSE:EXPR) is under investigation from mishandling packages for Huawei, the Chinese company banned by the U.S. government.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is under attack by state and social media here.  The Communist Party`s \"People Daily\" ran a commentary saying: FedEx (NYSE:FDX), no one can help you if you break the law.</p><p>Another communist party paper, \"The Global Times\", today posted a report guessing which American companies met the first two criteria to be on the black list, companies that cut ties with Huawei and violate market rules for non-commercial purposes.  It`s suggesting Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, are trade tensions and weak global growth setting us up for possible interest cuts or worse, a recession?</p><p>Joining us to talk about it, Mark Avallone is the president of Potomac Wealth Advisers.</p><p>Mark, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MARK AVALLONE, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS PRESIDENT:  Good to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The bond market`s job is to anticipate.  And right now, it anticipates a slowdown.  So, interest rates have gone down.</p><p>But the Fed typically waits for evidence of a slowdown before it moves.  Is it possible the Fed this time will cut rates just because the bond market anticipating a slowdown?</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well, it`s something they`re looking at.  But, remember, first quarter GDP was over 3 percent in the U.S.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>AVALLONE:  And the Fed in the fourth quarter last year, just a few months ago, was raising rates.  So, I think to expect them to cut in June is just a little much.  I think the only thing we might see in direction of accommodation is maybe a tone or a change in the projection of what they`re letting the markets get a hint of and get an idea, but I don`t see a rate cut in June.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Now the backdrop is also slowing global growth.  The Fed has to look at that as well, does it not?  European banks are having issues and their economies are not doing well.</p><p>AVALLONE:  Yes, well, we`ve had slowing European financials and tough sledding over there for some time.  But certainly with the tariff talk and the trade skirmishes that we`re having around the globe, it`s bringing down growth further.</p><p>And that is a concern especially when the German bund is yielding negative 20 compared to our rate.  So, the Fed is going to be pressured to look at a global slowdown and they are looking at that and will process that.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But, again, what you seem to be saying is you think it`s premature for the Fed funds future market, the interest rate market, to anticipate maybe a 50 percent possibility of a cut in September and a 97 percent possibility of a cut in December.  You think that`s premature?</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well, I think that`s premature because that`s September and December.  I`m concerned about the talk of June rate cuts.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>AVALLONE:  June is not going to happen.  That`s way too soon.</p><p>I think they`re going to look at what the trade talk progress is.  Remember, if we get even a little trade deal, some positive news and those tariffs go away, even if the deal is watered down, the markets are going to like that.  If we can get some normalcy, I think that helps growth here as well as in China.  I think that keeps the Fed away from raising rates.</p><p>I think it`s a wait and see game for China for the most part right now.</p><p>HERERA:  And very quickly, if you`re a long-term investor, what do you do in this ever changing environment?</p><p>AVALLONE:  Well, you can tweak with the low rates and to dividend stocks but really those are minor adjustments.  People should not be reacting to headlines.  You should have your plan in place before the news changes because these ups and downs are inevitable.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mark Avallone with Potomac Wealth Advisors -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>AVALLONE:  Good to be here.</p><p>HERERA:  As concerns of a slowdown continue, interest rates have fallen sharply and that means mortgage rates have fallen as well.  Add to that, the possibility of rate cuts and things are looking up for home buyers.</p><p>But as Diana Olick tells us, another group likely to benefit from the rate drop are people looking to refinance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mortgage rates have come down more than 1/4 of a percentage point in just two weeks.  Now that may not sound like a lot, but it can make a big difference for homeowners and home buyers.  The average rate on the 30-year fixed is now solidly in the 3 percent range, around 3.9 percent, but it was up over 5 percent in the last fall and in the mid 4s through the much all important spring housing market.</p><p>There are now about 5.9 million borrowers who could drop their rates by at least 75 basis points through a refinance.  This is an increase of 2 million people in just the past month according to Black Knight, a mortgage software company.  That`s the largest population of eligible candidates in nearly three years and represents an aggregate of $1.6 billion in potential monthly savings.</p><p>Per borrower, it`s about $271 a month.  For home buyers, any savings on that monthly payment is crucial given today`s high home prices.  Also, lower rates help more buyers not just afford the loan but qualify for the loan.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  To the markets now.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, it was a tug of war between rate cuts, talk, and tech worries.  And tech worries won out.  The Nasdaq was the big drag.  The Dow actually eked out a four-point gain but those tech names took the Nasdaq down by more than 1.5 percent or 120 points.  The S&amp;P was down about seven.</p><p>HERERA:  Manufacturing activity in may fell to its lowest level in 2-1/2 years.  The closely watched Institute for Supply Management`s reading fell to 52.1, its lowest since October of 2016.  And while anything above 50 shows expansion, the ISM chairman said the may number shows manufacturing is struggling in the face of weak global demand.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  On the flip side, new vehicle sales in the U.S. for major automakers, at least those that still report monthly sales, they ticked higher in May, thanks to a stronger economy and an optimistic fueling demand.  It`s the first positive month, by the way, of 2019.</p><p>HERERA:  Up next, Boeing`s CEO weighs in on his company`s latest issue with its 737 aircraft.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) were under pressure again today after the FAA said that there is a new problem with 737 jets.  And Boeing`s CEO was out there again today reiterating that the company is making progress fixing the grounded 737 MAX.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It`s another problem for Boeing`s 737.  This time, it involves faulty parts with the slants on the front of wings of certain 737s, including some NG models and the 737 MAX.</p><p>The issue will be fixed while the MAX is grounded, but it`s yet another black eye for the company`s beleaguered airplane.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, BOEING CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  This particular issue around the slide tracks is a well understood one and one that we`ll work our way through quickly.  There`s just something that we`re going to stay very coordinated with our customers.  We know it`s important and we want to minimize the disruption to our customers.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Boeing (NYSE:BA) is not sure when the plane will take off again.  Muilenburg says the software fix for the plane`s flight control system is being tested in a simulator and an application for recertification could come soon.  And while some question if he should stay on the job given the controversy, Muilenburg says he`s the right man to lead Boeing (NYSE:BA).  And he also knows the 737 MAX is now considered so unsafe by many travelers that they refuse to fly it ever again.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  I`ve heard those comments.</p><p>LEBEAU:  What`s your reaction when you hear people saying, I`m not getting on it?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, first of all, we deeply regret the impact.  We`re sorry for the lives that were lost.  This will always be with this company, I can tell you that.  It weighs heavily on us every day.</p><p>And when I hear that he is comments from the traveling public, as you might guess, I spend a lot of time in airports.  I`ve heard these comments.  And they are -- they`re tough.  They wear on us deeply as a company.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Weighing on the minds of investors is when Boeing (NYSE:BA) will resume production of the MAX and restore the production rate from its reduced level of 42 per month to its previous level of 52 per month.</p><p>The production level for the MAX is crucial, as is the backlog of orders for the plane.  And while there have been no cancellations since it was grounded in mid-March, over that same time frame there has not been a single new order for a 737 MAX.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Humana (NYSE:HUM) squashes any deal talks with Centene (NYSE:CNC), and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>In an SEC filing, Humana (NYSE:HUM) said it will not make an offer to merge with health insurer Centene (NYSE:CNC).  Humana (NYSE:HUM) said it was making an exception to its policy of not commenting on rumors.  Centene (NYSE:CNC) shares tumbled more than 10 percent to $51.82.</p><p>Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) will be selling itself to the German ship making company Infineon.  The proposed deal is worth $10 billion and would make the combined company the world`s largest provider of chips to the automotive sector.  Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) shares jumped nearly 24 percent to $22.07.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Apparel company PVH has signed a five-year licensing deal with GIII to produce and distribute the Calvin Klein women`s collection here in North America.  PVH says that the agreement will support its strategy to build a successful women`s jeans wear business with GIII`s marketing expertise.  And PVH shares were up about 3 percent to $87.73.  GIII shares rose a fraction to $25.79.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) announced a multi-year deal with Samsung.  The chipmaker will license its graphics technologies to Samsung for use in mobile devices and smart phones.  Also, Samsung will pay AMD royalties and licensing fees.  AMD shares rose a fraction to $27.58.</p><p>HERERA:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) kicked off its annual developer`s conference today with more than 5,000 people from nearly 100 countries expected to attend, and the company has a lot riding on it.</p><p>Josh Lipton is in San Jose to tell us why it matters to investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  Welcome to WWDC 2019.</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Apple`s CEO Tim Cook`s mission today was simple but critical, convince millions of developers all around the world that they should keep spending their time and money creating apps for his products, not the competition.  In part, he made that case by noting that consumer adoption rates for his operating system is much higher than a competition, meaning Google`s Android operating system.</p><p>COOK:  Eighty-five percent of iOS customers are on the latest release.  And in fact, iOS 12 has been installed on more systems than any version of iOS ever.  Now that`s in stark contrast to the latest offering from those other guys, which was released by iOS 12, they only had 10 percent adoption.</p><p>LIPTON:  To win over developers today, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced new features, apps and tools.  For example, the company unveiled new technology that lets developers more easily bring apps they create for the iPad to the Mac.  That makes their lives a lot simpler, and means a lot more apps could be coming to the Mac platform.</p><p>This all matters a lot for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors because they pin so much hope on Apple`s faster growing, higher margin services business.  A big, important part of that business?  The App Store representing an estimated 35 percent of that services segment.</p><p>So, Cook needs to keep these developers happy and loyal and creating compelling experiences for his users if that broader services segment is going to keep humming.  There are challenges for the App Store, however.  The U.S. Supreme Court recently handed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a legal set back, allowing antitrust suits against the App Store to proceed.  Plaintiffs argue that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) monopolizes the market, a criticism that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) flatly rejects.</p><p>And just today, \"Reuters\" report that the U.S. Department of Justice was given jurisdiction to include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as part of a broader antitrust probe.</p><p>But the bottom line for developers today here is this.  Where can they make money?  They know consumers spend a lot of money on the App Store, an estimated $47 billion last year alone, nearly double what was spent on apps from rival service Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Play.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Jose, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And up next, the $150 billion market in the fight against cancer.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Finally, tonight, the world`s biggest cancer research meeting is underway in Chicago.  The American Society of Clinical Oncology, better known as ASCO, brings together more than 40,000 doctors, researchers and medical executives to discuss everything new in the fight to beat cancer.</p><p>Meg Tirrell is there in Chicago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stacey Tinianov`s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer six years ago.  As her mom started treatment, Stacey got some news of her own.</p><p>STACEY TINIANOV, SIX-YEAR BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR:  Four months later, I had my very own mammogram and I was diagnosed with breast cancer.</p><p>TIRRELL:  A mother of two, Tinianov had just turned 40.  She says what she learned in those four months between her mother`s diagnosis and her own taught her how to advocate for herself.</p><p>TINIANOV:  I am a six-year breast cancer survivor.</p><p>TIRRELL:  She`s now become an advocate for others as well, part of an important group who attends the world`s cancer research conference, ASCO, or the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting.  It`s where thousands of cancer doctors and researchers converge each year to discuss the latest advancements in treating cancer.</p><p>RICK PAZDUR, FDA`S ONCOLOGY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE:  A lot of these newer therapies are directed towards who`s going to benefit the most.  And, really, they fulfill an unmet medical need.  Some of these patients have had very marginal therapies and this really provides really some needed therapeutic resources to patients, especially those that don`t have really other therapies.</p><p>TIRRELL:  Updates at the conference also move stocks of pharmaceutical and biotech companies.  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Mirati Therapeutics both soared on an update from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) that looked particularly encouraging in lung cancer.</p><p>Biotech company Iovance saw its stock rise on enthusiasm for a personalized treatment for melanoma when other drugs had stopped working.</p><p>MARIA FARDIS, IOVANCE BIOTHERAPEUTICS:  We`re very pleased to be able to see that TIL technology, which is our tumor infiltrating lymphocyte, is able to offer them a 38 percent response rate in this extremely late line patient population which doesn`t have any alternative.</p><p>The patients have run through Keytruda, as you know what it is.  Sometimes all the checkpoints have explored on them.  They have seen anti-CTLA-4, which is another class of drugs.  If they have a BRAF mutation, they`ve seen BRAF and/or mix.

The Nasdaq was especially hit hard today on reports the government is looking at possibly targeting some big tech names with antitrust investigations.</p><p>It started with a \"Wall Street Journal\" report saying the justice department is getting ready to take on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) then got hit when \"The Journal\" said the FTC would look into how the social media giant affects digital competition. \"The Washington Post (NYSE:WPO)\" then jumped in and said the FTC might look into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). And not to be outdone, \"Reuters\" said the justice got the jurisdiction to investigate Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and their practices.</p><p>And late in the day, a House committee said that it was going to launch a bipartisan investigation into competitiveness in the digital markets.</p><p>It`s too early to say whether any of these stories are going to pan out, but the stocks were hit and they were hit hard in today`s trade.</p><p>HERERA: So let`s bring in John Freeman to discuss what regulation could mean for some of these big companies. He`s an equity analyst at CFRA Research.</p><p>Welcome. Nice to have you here, John.</p><p>JOHN FREEMAN, CFRA RESEARCH EQUITY ANALYST: Well, thank you very much. Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA: It`s a diverse group of companies. They`re all in the tech space, of course, but they all do very different things. So, how would regulation apply?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, you know, looking at historical perspective the way it applied to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), there are certain remedies, you know, the fines and so forth. Those are really immaterial, but for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) the big one was, of course, debundling the browser from the operating system, Windows, which actually didn`t really affect, you know, that much in my opinion. But the real one was keeping Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in a box in terms of M&amp;A. Couldn`t use all of its profit and market caps here to acquire companies to expand into adjacent markets.</p><p>So, fast forward to now, I think that kind of similar but with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), for example, it`s very strange. I mean, how do you, you know, debundle a search algorithm? You would have very strange unintended consequences. I don`t think -- I don`t think it`s really even possible.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as well. I kind of scratch my head, obviously you can break it up into Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) I suppose.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: But the big thing is that all of these companies will be in an M&amp;A box. They won`t be able to use their market cap and their cash to buy companies to get into adjacent markets.</p><p>So, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) --</p><p>GRIFFETH: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), there are those who feel that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a stranglehold on the app market with its App Store and how much it charges and how much it does not allow some companies in with their developments. But just today with their announcement, it seems like they`re starting to change the way they`re going to deal with that.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, it`s very interesting. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is definitely getting ahead of this regulation I think in a smarter way than the others. However, the App Store, you know, at this point I don`t think that the app store, you know, is a huge -- that the bundling of the App Store -- if they opened up the App Store to third party providers, I don`t think at this point it would really affect, you know, sales of iPhones or tablets. Matter of fact, it might even enhance it at this point.</p><p>So, for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) I don`t think it`s going to be --</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- as big of a deal. The thing really intriguing about the House Judiciary, you know, press release or announcement was the third point that they made, that they were going to look at the regulations themselves, the antitrust regulations themselves, to see --</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- if there are changes that could, you know, impact -- that would basically keep the monopolistic power of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and so forth in check.</p><p>HERERA: We watch that --</p><p>FREEMAN: I think that`s the dark horse and a scarier thing.</p><p>HERERA: OK. John Freeman with CFRA Research, thank you.</p><p>FREEMAN: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now to interest rates. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said today that a rate cut may be warranted soon. That`s a quote. Bullard cited global trade tensions and weak inflation in the U.S., and many on Wall Street seemed to agree. The interest rate futures market may have already priced in several cuts this year.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman tells us, the street is also looking at something far worse.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Several forecasters are now convinced the U.S. economy is headed for recession as a result of existing and threatening tariffs from the Trump administration.</p><p>Citing rising trade protectionism, forecasters responding to a new survey from the National Association for Business Economics, put the chance of recession next year at 60 percent, up from just 15 percent this year. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) wrote in a report, quote, if trade tensions continue to escalate, we believe the global cycle will be in recession in three quarters.</p><p>Even the president`s own economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, indirectly said the new tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy.</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS CHAIRMAN: I can say if folks are tuning up their models to work on it today, I think one of the things you see especially in the near term, the impacts are much larger on Mexico than the U.S. And I think the intent of this is to solve a very, very important problem that the president is focused on.</p><p>LIESMAN: And the consensus has quickly changed from no interest rate cuts this year from the Federal Reserve to general agreement to multiple cuts as bond yields have fallen sharply.</p><p>ROGER ALTMAN, EVERCORE EXEC. CHAIRMAN: You look at the ten year, 2.10 in round numbers. You look at the obvious reversal of the outlook for the Fed in terms of market expectations, those are all bear signs.</p><p>LIESMAN: Altman`s company said in a report, we now see a base case in which the fed will reluctantly cut ties three times in November. Market prices priced in a rate cut as soon as July and agree with Evercore that multiple cuts are on the way.</p><p>The question is whether they`re ready to cut interest rates so soon as saying it`s on hold for an extended period. If it does, markets have to wonder if rate cuts are the height economic answer to tariff hikes.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Adding to those concerns, trade tensions. Steve mentioned the tariffs and Mexico, and over the weekend, China issued a so-called white paper outlining its positions in its dispute with the U.S.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing with more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: China released its white paper, its second policy paper on the trade conflict with the United States, and it listed the three things that it wants to see before Beijing will come to the negotiating table. First, the U.S. needs to remove all tariffs imposed since last year on Chinese goods, be realistic about the size of Chinese purchases of U.S. products and ensure there is balance in the text of the deal. Otherwise, the white paper was highly critical of the U.S.`s tactics and put all of the blame for the failed talks on Washington.</p><p>In the meantime, Beijing says it will fight the trade war to the end. Tariffs on American goods kicked in this weekend. Beijing outlined its criteria for its unreliable entity`s list, the black list for foreign firms and individuals, and state media said Federal Express (NYSE:EXPR) is under investigation from mishandling packages for Huawei, the Chinese company banned by the U.S. government.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is under attack by state and social media here. The Communist Party`s \"People Daily\" ran a commentary saying: FedEx (NYSE:FDX), no one can help you if you break the law.</p><p>Another communist party paper, \"The Global Times\", today posted a report guessing which American companies met the first two criteria to be on the black list, companies that cut ties with Huawei and violate market rules for non-commercial purposes. It`s suggesting Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, are trade tensions and weak global growth setting us up for possible interest cuts or worse, a recession?</p><p>Joining us to talk about it, Mark Avallone is the president of Potomac Wealth Advisers.</p><p>Mark, good to see you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MARK AVALLONE, POTOMAC WEALTH ADVISORS PRESIDENT: Good to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The bond market`s job is to anticipate. And right now, it anticipates a slowdown. So, interest rates have gone down.</p><p>But the Fed typically waits for evidence of a slowdown before it moves. Is it possible the Fed this time will cut rates just because the bond market anticipating a slowdown?</p><p>AVALLONE: Well, it`s something they`re looking at. But, remember, first quarter GDP was over 3 percent in the U.S.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>AVALLONE: And the Fed in the fourth quarter last year, just a few months ago, was raising rates. So, I think to expect them to cut in June is just a little much. I think the only thing we might see in direction of accommodation is maybe a tone or a change in the projection of what they`re letting the markets get a hint of and get an idea, but I don`t see a rate cut in June.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Now the backdrop is also slowing global growth. The Fed has to look at that as well, does it not? European banks are having issues and their economies are not doing well.</p><p>AVALLONE: Yes, well, we`ve had slowing European financials and tough sledding over there for some time. But certainly with the tariff talk and the trade skirmishes that we`re having around the globe, it`s bringing down growth further.</p><p>And that is a concern especially when the German bund is yielding negative 20 compared to our rate. So, the Fed is going to be pressured to look at a global slowdown and they are looking at that and will process that.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But, again, what you seem to be saying is you think it`s premature for the Fed funds future market, the interest rate market, to anticipate maybe a 50 percent possibility of a cut in September and a 97 percent possibility of a cut in December. You think that`s premature?</p><p>AVALLONE: Well, I think that`s premature because that`s September and December. I`m concerned about the talk of June rate cuts.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>AVALLONE: June is not going to happen. That`s way too soon.</p><p>I think they`re going to look at what the trade talk progress is. Remember, if we get even a little trade deal, some positive news and those tariffs go away, even if the deal is watered down, the markets are going to like that. If we can get some normalcy, I think that helps growth here as well as in China. I think that keeps the Fed away from raising rates.</p><p>I think it`s a wait and see game for China for the most part right now.</p><p>HERERA: And very quickly, if you`re a long-term investor, what do you do in this ever changing environment?</p><p>AVALLONE: Well, you can tweak with the low rates and to dividend stocks but really those are minor adjustments. People should not be reacting to headlines. You should have your plan in place before the news changes because these ups and downs are inevitable.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mark Avallone with Potomac Wealth Advisors -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>AVALLONE: Good to be here.</p><p>HERERA: As concerns of a slowdown continue, interest rates have fallen sharply and that means mortgage rates have fallen as well. Add to that, the possibility of rate cuts and things are looking up for home buyers.</p><p>But as Diana Olick tells us, another group likely to benefit from the rate drop are people looking to refinance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mortgage rates have come down more than 1/4 of a percentage point in just two weeks. Now that may not sound like a lot, but it can make a big difference for homeowners and home buyers. The average rate on the 30-year fixed is now solidly in the 3 percent range, around 3.9 percent, but it was up over 5 percent in the last fall and in the mid 4s through the much all important spring housing market.</p><p>There are now about 5.9 million borrowers who could drop their rates by at least 75 basis points through a refinance. This is an increase of 2 million people in just the past month according to Black Knight, a mortgage software company. That`s the largest population of eligible candidates in nearly three years and represents an aggregate of $1.6 billion in potential monthly savings.</p><p>Per borrower, it`s about $271 a month. For home buyers, any savings on that monthly payment is crucial given today`s high home prices. Also, lower rates help more buyers not just afford the loan but qualify for the loan.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: To the markets now.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, it was a tug of war between rate cuts, talk, and tech worries. And tech worries won out. The Nasdaq was the big drag. The Dow actually eked out a four-point gain but those tech names took the Nasdaq down by more than 1.5 percent or 120 points. The S&amp;P was down about seven.</p><p>HERERA: Manufacturing activity in may fell to its lowest level in 2-1/2 years. The closely watched Institute for Supply Management`s reading fell to 52.1, its lowest since October of 2016. And while anything above 50 shows expansion, the ISM chairman said the may number shows manufacturing is struggling in the face of weak global demand.</p><p>GRIFFETH: On the flip side, new vehicle sales in the U.S. for major automakers, at least those that still report monthly sales, they ticked higher in May, thanks to a stronger economy and an optimistic fueling demand. It`s the first positive month, by the way, of 2019.</p><p>HERERA: Up next, Boeing`s CEO weighs in on his company`s latest issue with its 737 aircraft.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) were under pressure again today after the FAA said that there is a new problem with 737 jets. And Boeing`s CEO was out there again today reiterating that the company is making progress fixing the grounded 737 MAX.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s another problem for Boeing`s 737. This time, it involves faulty parts with the slants on the front of wings of certain 737s, including some NG models and the 737 MAX.</p><p>The issue will be fixed while the MAX is grounded, but it`s yet another black eye for the company`s beleaguered airplane.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, BOEING CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: This particular issue around the slide tracks is a well understood one and one that we`ll work our way through quickly. There`s just something that we`re going to stay very coordinated with our customers. We know it`s important and we want to minimize the disruption to our customers.</p><p>LEBEAU: Boeing (NYSE:BA) is not sure when the plane will take off again. Muilenburg says the software fix for the plane`s flight control system is being tested in a simulator and an application for recertification could come soon. And while some question if he should stay on the job given the controversy, Muilenburg says he`s the right man to lead Boeing (NYSE:BA). And he also knows the 737 MAX is now considered so unsafe by many travelers that they refuse to fly it ever again.</p><p>MUILENBURG: I`ve heard those comments.</p><p>LEBEAU: What`s your reaction when you hear people saying, I`m not getting on it?</p><p>MUILENBURG: Well, first of all, we deeply regret the impact. We`re sorry for the lives that were lost. This will always be with this company, I can tell you that. It weighs heavily on us every day.</p><p>And when I hear that he is comments from the traveling public, as you might guess, I spend a lot of time in airports. I`ve heard these comments. And they are -- they`re tough. They wear on us deeply as a company.</p><p>LEBEAU: Weighing on the minds of investors is when Boeing (NYSE:BA) will resume production of the MAX and restore the production rate from its reduced level of 42 per month to its previous level of 52 per month.</p><p>The production level for the MAX is crucial, as is the backlog of orders for the plane. And while there have been no cancellations since it was grounded in mid-March, over that same time frame there has not been a single new order for a 737 MAX.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Humana (NYSE:HUM) squashes any deal talks with Centene (NYSE:CNC), and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>In an SEC filing, Humana (NYSE:HUM) said it will not make an offer to merge with health insurer Centene (NYSE:CNC). Humana (NYSE:HUM) said it was making an exception to its policy of not commenting on rumors. Centene (NYSE:CNC) shares tumbled more than 10 percent to $51.82.</p><p>Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) will be selling itself to the German ship making company Infineon. The proposed deal is worth $10 billion and would make the combined company the world`s largest provider of chips to the automotive sector. Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) shares jumped nearly 24 percent to $22.07.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Apparel company PVH has signed a five-year licensing deal with GIII to produce and distribute the Calvin Klein women`s collection here in North America. PVH says that the agreement will support its strategy to build a successful women`s jeans wear business with GIII`s marketing expertise. And PVH shares were up about 3 percent to $87.73. GIII shares rose a fraction to $25.79.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) announced a multi-year deal with Samsung. The chipmaker will license its graphics technologies to Samsung for use in mobile devices and smart phones. Also, Samsung will pay AMD royalties and licensing fees. AMD shares rose a fraction to $27.58.</p><p>HERERA: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) kicked off its annual developer`s conference today with more than 5,000 people from nearly 100 countries expected to attend, and the company has a lot riding on it.</p><p>Josh Lipton is in San Jose to tell us why it matters to investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: Welcome to WWDC 2019.</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Apple`s CEO Tim Cook`s mission today was simple but critical, convince millions of developers all around the world that they should keep spending their time and money creating apps for his products, not the competition. In part, he made that case by noting that consumer adoption rates for his operating system is much higher than a competition, meaning Google`s Android operating system.</p><p>COOK: Eighty-five percent of iOS customers are on the latest release. And in fact, iOS 12 has been installed on more systems than any version of iOS ever. Now that`s in stark contrast to the latest offering from those other guys, which was released by iOS 12, they only had 10 percent adoption.</p><p>LIPTON: To win over developers today, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced new features, apps and tools. For example, the company unveiled new technology that lets developers more easily bring apps they create for the iPad to the Mac. That makes their lives a lot simpler, and means a lot more apps could be coming to the Mac platform.</p><p>This all matters a lot for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors because they pin so much hope on Apple`s faster growing, higher margin services business. A big, important part of that business? The App Store representing an estimated 35 percent of that services segment.</p><p>So, Cook needs to keep these developers happy and loyal and creating compelling experiences for his users if that broader services segment is going to keep humming. There are challenges for the App Store, however. The U.S. Supreme Court recently handed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a legal set back, allowing antitrust suits against the App Store to proceed. Plaintiffs argue that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) monopolizes the market, a criticism that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) flatly rejects.</p><p>And just today, \"Reuters\" report that the U.S. Department of Justice was given jurisdiction to include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as part of a broader antitrust probe.</p><p>But the bottom line for developers today here is this. Where can they make money? They know consumers spend a lot of money on the App Store, an estimated $47 billion last year alone, nearly double what was spent on apps from rival service Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Play.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Jose, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And up next, the $150 billion market in the fight against cancer.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Finally, tonight, the world`s biggest cancer research meeting is underway in Chicago. The American Society of Clinical Oncology, better known as ASCO, brings together more than 40,000 doctors, researchers and medical executives to discuss everything new in the fight to beat cancer.</p><p>Meg Tirrell is there in Chicago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stacey Tinianov`s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer six years ago. As her mom started treatment, Stacey got some news of her own.</p><p>STACEY TINIANOV, SIX-YEAR BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR: Four months later, I had my very own mammogram and I was diagnosed with breast cancer.</p><p>TIRRELL: A mother of two, Tinianov had just turned 40. She says what she learned in those four months between her mother`s diagnosis and her own taught her how to advocate for herself.</p><p>TINIANOV: I am a six-year breast cancer survivor.</p><p>TIRRELL: She`s now become an advocate for others as well, part of an important group who attends the world`s cancer research conference, ASCO, or the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. It`s where thousands of cancer doctors and researchers converge each year to discuss the latest advancements in treating cancer.</p><p>RICK PAZDUR, FDA`S ONCOLOGY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE: A lot of these newer therapies are directed towards who`s going to benefit the most. And, really, they fulfill an unmet medical need. Some of these patients have had very marginal therapies and this really provides really some needed therapeutic resources to patients, especially those that don`t have really other therapies.</p><p>TIRRELL: Updates at the conference also move stocks of pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Mirati Therapeutics both soared on an update from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) that looked particularly encouraging in lung cancer.</p><p>Biotech company Iovance saw its stock rise on enthusiasm for a personalized treatment for melanoma when other drugs had stopped working.</p><p>MARIA FARDIS, IOVANCE BIOTHERAPEUTICS: We`re very pleased to be able to see that TIL technology, which is our tumor infiltrating lymphocyte, is able to offer them a 38 percent response rate in this extremely late line patient population which doesn`t have any alternative.</p><p>The patients have run through Keytruda, as you know what it is. Sometimes all the checkpoints have explored on them. They have seen anti-CTLA-4, which is another class of drugs. If they have a BRAF mutation, they`ve seen BRAF and/or mix. So, these are all available care for metastatic melanoma and they have tried all of those already.</p><p>TIRRELL: For Tinianov, the conference is an opportunity to talk to the people working in cancer.</p><p>TINIANOV: I`m also to have a hard conversation that say for as much hand clapping and pat on the backing that`s going on, when we make a discovery, we still have 117 people dying every day from metastatic breast cancer.</p><p>TIRRELL: And she says it gives her a chance to say thank you for the progress that`s been made.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell in Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for watching.</p><p>And we`d like to remind you, this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth.

There  are more job openings than there are available workers.  And that's never  happened before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  What's brewing?  Starbucks  (NASDAQ:SBUX) will start its next chapter without the man who turned it  into a household name and at a time when the company faces a number of  challenges.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Death of an icon.  Kate Spade turned a small handbag company into  a global brand.  Today, she was found dead in her Manhattan apartment.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, June  5th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you good evening, everybody.  </p><p>During an otherwise quiet day on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite closed  at a record and we'll have more on that coming up.  </p><p>But we begin tonight with a significant moment in our economic history.  We  learned today that right now, there are more available jobs than there are  people out of work.  That is something the American economy has never  experienced before.  </p><p>The Labor Department's latest report shows that there are a record 6.7  million job openings in April, while the number of available workers was  6.4 million.  That is the first time that has happened since the government  began tracking job openings back in 2000.  </p><p>Now, to put this in perspective, when the Great Recession ended nine years  ago this month, there were about six unemployed people for every job  opening at that time.  And it's just the latest sign that the U.S. is  facing an historically tight labor market.  </p><p>HERERA:  And, Bill, those positive numbers on the jobs market come  alongside some sobering news on the state of social security.  Costs for  that program will exceed its income this year for the first time since  1982, forcing the program to dip into its trust fund to cover benefits.  It  is estimated that those reserves will be depleted by the year 2034 and  Social Security will no longer be able to send full benefits.  </p><p>The report also said that Medicare's hospital insurance fund will be  depleted in 2026.  That is three years earlier than anticipated.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, a new report says leading CEOs are a little less  optimistic than they have been.  According to the latest survey from the  Business Roundtable, many are concerned about the direction of trade policy  right now.  </p><p>Kayla Tausche has detailed for us from Washington.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For the first time  since Donald Trump was elected president, a quarterly reading of confidence  among CEO has fallen.  The survey conducted by the Business Roundtable  showed that expectations for the next six months for hiring, capital  investment, sales, and U.S. GDP all declined.  One major reason: trade.   Ninety-five percent of executives citing White House trade policy as a  moderate or serious risk.  </p><p>Business Roundtable CEO Josh Bolton and chair, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon told  reporters they'd advise the White House against tariffs and protectionist  policies to no avail.  One hundred and thirty-two CEOs responded to the  survey during the middle two weeks of May, when the White House was  negotiating trade deals on NAFTA and with China, two fronts where friction  has only increased in the weeks since.  </p><p>NEC director Larry Kudlow said the U.S. may pursue separate deals with  Canada and Mexico to replace the current trilateral deal, and a White House  team in Beijing reportedly rebuffed an offer from China to buy $70 billion  in U.S. energy and crops.  </p><p>Here's White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.  </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Our focus is on  making sure we get good deals.  I'm not here to make an announcement on  what those look like, but he's going to continue pushing forward to make  sure that he gets the best deal for American workers.  </p><p>TAUSCHE:  A campaign promise turning into a C-suite headache.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  On Wall Street, as we mentioned, the Nasdaq closed at a fresh  record, helped by shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).   And while tech stocks powered ahead, the rest of the market struggled for  gains.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13 points.  The Nasdaq was up  31 and the S&amp;P $ 500 gained two points, nearly two.  </p><p>Now, some say the market is facing some pretty tough hurdles and investors  want to know if those hurdles can be cleared.  So, Mike Santoli takes a  look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stock market bulls  have plenty to be proud of after two months of hard-won progress, but they  still have a bit more to prove.  The S&amp;P 500 index is up more than 6  percent since early April, grinding higher through a thicket of concerns,  including trade tensions, rising interest rates, increasing inflation  pressures and fears of new regulation on tech giants.  </p><p>The slow climb has taken the index right up to a key threshold.  The 27.50  level has capped earlier rallies and where a nasty drop occurred in mid- March.  This is a pretty natural area for the index to stall for a while as  investors assess the underlying strength of the economy and the potential  danger of trade policy moves and the Federal Reserve's rate-boosting  campaign.  </p><p>The leadership of the market remains sturdy, but selective.  The Nasdaq is  fully recovered from the correction that started in January, and it's back  at a fresh all-time high.  Small company stocks are also at a new record.   These are positives for the bull case, but also a reminder that the drivers  of the market's comeback have been narrow.  </p><p>Only three major sectors, tech, consumer discretionary, and energy have  outperformed the S&amp;P 500 as a whole since the index was last at its current  level nearly three months ago.  The momentum in corporate profits has been  powerful.  The only question being how much growth will slow into 2019.  </p><p>The latest little push higher for stocks coincided with a pullback in oil  prices and an easing back of bond yields, on more soothing talk from the  Fed and a flutter of global market turbulence that sent investors to the  shelter of treasuries.  </p><p>And so, as the market heads for the higher end of its choppy 2018 range,  and new economic reports continue to show impressive strength, the next  test for the bulls might come as those ten-year treasury yields make  another run above 3 percent and the Fed has its say next week.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p>We begin with video game maker Take Two Interactive, which was downgraded  from outperform at BMO Capital Markets.  The analyst there cites high  expectations for an upcoming video game release which it says could  disappoint.  Price target: $116.  The stock fell a fraction to $113.26.  </p><p>Meanwhile, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) shares were downgraded to neutral from  buy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).  The analyst cites China's decision to  suspend construction of new solar farms and to cut subsidies.  Price target  now $63 and that stock fell more than 5.5 percent today to $58.24.  </p><p>HERERA:  And Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is also making a call on  Weightwatchers, rating the company a buy in new coverage.  The analyst says  the stock could rise another 20 percent from current levels.  The price  target is $95.  The stock was up 8 percent today to $85.93.  </p><p>Shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were upgraded to buy from neutral  at Citi.  The analyst cites rising oil prices and a potential increase in  production growth this year and next.  The price target is $97.  The stock  closed up a fraction to $85.51.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  The woman who created an iconic accessories empire that made her  name synonymous with trendy handbags was found dead today in her Manhattan  apartment.  Designer Kate Spade was 55 years old.  The cause of death is  being reported as a suicide.  </p><p>Our Courtney Reagan now has more on her influence in the fashion world and  the legacy she leaves behind.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The retail and  fashion industries are mourning the loss of the designer known as Kate  Spade.  They've launched her original eponymous handbag brand Kate Spade in  1993.  </p><p>Twenty-five years ago, Kate Spade, the brand, begun with six utilitarian  hand bags and a variety of colors.  The brand was the first premium  American handbag maker to use nylon for its base material.  </p><p>Kate Spade, her husband, and partners sold their majority stake to Neiman  Marcus (NYSE:MCS) in 1999 for around $34 million, and the remaining stake  in 2006 for $59 million.  </p><p>The Kate Spade brand has only grown.  After changing ownership several  times, Tapestry, which also owns Coach (NYSE:COH) and Stuart Weitzman,  bought the Kate Spade brand for nearly $2.5 billion last year, eleven years  after spade sold her are remaining stake in the company she founded.  </p><p>The Kate Spade brand is still known today for its bright colors, feminine,  whimsical aesthetic, and kitschy marketing.  Kate Spade handbags, shoes,  accessories and clothing are sold around the world, bringing in more than  $1 billion in annual sales.  </p><p>Two years ago, she, along with her husband, Andy Spade, and the duo's  original two other business partners, launched a new handbag and shoe  brand, Frances Valentine, around the same time she changed her name to Kate  Valentine.  Frances Valentine also shares colorful shoes and handbags in  department stores, boutiques and online, globally, with that still familiar  aesthetic that Kate Spade is known for, but with higher prices because of  production in Italy and Spain.  </p><p>No official word from Frances Valentine on its future after the death of  its founder.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, America's most  famous coffee chain embarks on a whole new chapter.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  As we reported last night, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) executive  chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down from the company he helped to  build.  Andrew Ross Sorkin broke the story and spoke to Mr. Schultz today  about his next act.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We're here in  Seattle where we sat down exclusively with Howard Schultz, the outgoing  executive chair of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) who announced plans to step down  from the company he said among other things that he may pursue in the  future, public service, which, of course, has fueled speculation he could  run for president in 2020.  I asked him directly about that prospect.  </p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, STARBUCKS:  There's a lot of things I  can do as a private citizen other than run for the presidency of the United  States, and let's just see what happens.  I've got lots of things I'm  thinking about.  I'm writing a book.  It's only been 24 hours.  </p><p>But we've talked many times about how concerned I am about the country, our  standing in the world, and I think there's many things I can do as a  private citizen to advance the cause of the promise of the country.  </p><p>SORKIN:  While he said he has not made a decision yet about what he's going  to do in the future, he did have a number of views on public policy.  </p><p>SCHULTZ:  Ronald Reagan in 1986 passed an immigration bill as a Republican  president, so why can't we come together, move the ideology out, and do  what's in the interest of American people?  Seventy percent of the American  people want a good immigration policy.  Seventy percent of the American  people want the kind of policy and legislation that takes the guns of war  out of the American people's neighborhoods.  I mean, it just doesn't make  sense to me.  </p><p>SORKIN:  Intriguingly, he had a fascinating take on how to think about  today's economy and the stock market.  </p><p>SCHULTZ:  I think it's very wrong to use the stock market as a proxy for  the U.S. economy.  Interest rates are going up, and if I had to make a bet,  and I'm not an economist, I don't believe that the stock market is going to  continue to grow at the level it has between now and 2020.  You're going to  see a sea change.  </p><p>So, listen, the economy is strong.  I give President Obama credit for that.   I give President Trump some credit for that.  But you also have systemic  problems in the country, the likes of which we have not had in a long time.  </p><p>SORKIN:  Howard Schultz stepping off the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stage but  probably not stepping out of the headlines.  </p><p>I'm Andrew Ross Sorkin for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT in Seattle.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) investors aren't too happy about  the departure of Howard Schultz.  The news sent shares of the stock lower  in trading today.  No doubt those same investors want to know what is next  for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and how the company plans to overcome a number  of challenges.  </p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) has that part of the story for us tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's a new era for  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), as founder and executive chairman Howard Schultz  steps away from the brand he made into a household name over the past 30- plus years.  </p><p>SCHULTZ:  Please come in.  </p><p>ROGERS:  Now, the focus is on Kevin Johnson, the company's CEO who has been  at the helm since last year.  The two men worked closely together and  analysts say the move presents an opening for Johnson to step out of  Schultz' shadow.  </p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, MORNINGSTAR SENIOR RESTAURANT ANALYST:  I think this will be an  opportunity for Kevin to really show himself and that he doesn't  necessarily need to rely strictly on Howard and, you know, frankly, can  leverage the experience and talents of the rest of the team.  </p><p>ROGERS:  Schultz' departure comes at a time when the competition for  consumer dollars is fierce as companies from Dunkin Donuts to McDonald's  (NYSE:MCD) are offering steeper values on coffee.  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)  is focused on mobile as well as the consumer experience with its reserve  bars and roasteries in Seattle and Shanghai, with openings in Milan and New  York later this year.  </p><p>Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is also in the midst of an ever growing push into  China, where it opens a new store once every 15 hours.  A big challenge on  Johnson's plate, increasing same store sales in the U.S. which has been  stagnant.  Experts say Johnson needs to focus on innovation and technology.  </p><p>HOTTOVY:  I think that they need to iron out the mobile order platform and,  you know, make that -- and improve the experience in the stores.  I think  once they start to do that, I think that the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) brand,  you know, will kind of right the ship there.  </p><p>ROGERS:  Another bright spot in the leadership change, the appointment of  Myron Ullman to executive chairperson who turned around struggling retailer  JCPenney not once, but twice in the past.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Well, it has been reported by \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" that  Howard Schultz may consider a run for the presidency in 2020, and Andrew  Ross Sorkin addressed that earlier in our program.  Well, today, Home  Depot's co-founder and philanthropist Ken Langone said that if more people  with business experience get involved in politics, it's a good thing.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN LANGONE, HOME DEPOT CO-FOUNDER:  Howard Schultz, Jamie Dimon, Mike  Bloomberg, if we get those kind of people to say, hey, he won and I can  win, we're going to dramatically open the pool of talent for people to  become president.  And by the way, that's great.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  And that got us thinking about how business backgrounds could play  a role in public office.  </p><p>Joining us to talk about that is Jeffery Sonnenfeld, management professor  and senior associate dean for leadership studies at Yale School of  Management.  </p><p>Welcome back, Jeffrey.  Nice to see you again.  </p><p>JEFFREY SONNENFELD, YALE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT:  Thanks, Sue.  Good to see  you.  And hi, Bill.  </p><p>HERERA:  Does it matter whether or not the business executive and we've had  many business executives transfer into government roles, does it matter  whether they come from a private company or a public company?  Does one  give an advantage over the other?  </p><p>SONNENFELD:  That's a great question.  You know, that was the fine point in  Andrew Ross Sorkin's interview with Howard Schultz today, that he wanted to  make that point without coming across like he is starting up a slug fest  with the president.  But he was suggesting that a, you know, a midsize  family business as the Trump Organization is, that has some global reach,  doesn't, you know, maybe a dozen countries, doesn't compare to the  magnitude of what Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has in 75 countries with some, I  don't know, 38,000 stores and things.  </p><p>They're almost as big in terms of the number of stores as McDonald's  (NYSE:MCD).  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>SONNENFELD:  Yes, it makes a big difference, being accountable to bosses,  to a board, to disparate constituencies, difficult bottom line criteria to  meet and things.  As a public CEO, it's a very different experience than  being a private CEO.  I don't want to diminish what Donald Trump has  accomplished.  I think as a CEO of a private business, it's pretty  impressive, but what the scrutiny and everything that a public company has  to go under, there's nothing like it, and none of the predecessors of our  current CEOs have had as difficult a job as the current generation has.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  There have been other successful businessmen in the White House,  though, Jeff.  You had Herbert Hoover, who was a mining magnate.  He made  his fortune in mining.  H.W. Bush made his fortune in oil.  That just names  two of them.  </p><p>How are they different from other people who have been in the White House?   How is their thinking different as business people?  </p><p>SONNENFELD:  It's funny you mention those two, Bill.  It's because Douglas  Brinkley, the presidential historian, used those two in an article today to  say, look, CEOs don't transfer into public office that well.  Look how  troubled those careers were that Herbert Hoover, who by all accounts was a  wonderful human being, was not a wonderful president.  And \"W\" who was also  a wonderful human being won't be ranked as one of our finest presidents,  George W. Bush.</p><p>But, you know, for a historian, that was a strange thing to pick.  You  could also say being a governor was bad because George W. Bush was a  governor.  Andrew Johnson was governor of Tennessee.  You had a lot of --  Jimmy Carter was governor of Georgia.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  By the same token, George Washington was a very successful  farmer, you know, which was a big business back in those days.  So there's  a -- </p><p>SONNENFELD:  Good for you.  He was a farmer, and for that point, you know,  Harry Truman, you know, he was a haberdasher.  That's what my dad did.  I  think that was a pretty important position.</p><p>But there were some who were very successful that were never senators and  never were governors, never really had an elected position like that  exactly.  Abraham Lincoln wasn't a governor, was never a senator.  There  are some very impressive models that way.  </p><p>But business leaders have done well.  Michael Bloomberg, of course, is  mayor, which is the next toughest job after president is mayor of New York  City.  He certainly did very well.</p><p>And there are many business leaders who went into public service who were  successful business leaders but even more renowned for their legacies in  public service, like Averell Harriman who ran his dad's railroad, the Union  Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Brown Brothers Harriman; and Chester Bowles, a great  advertising exec.  These people are people are fantastic diplomats.  </p><p>HERERA:  Lots of examples, indeed.  Jeff, thank you very much.  Jeffrey  Sonnenfeld with Yale School of Management.</p><p>Bill?  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, we've got G-III apparel posting a surprise profit and  that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The owner of Guess and DKNY said that there was demand for many of its  brands and that helps sales and profits topped estimates.  The clothing  company also raised its earnings guidance for the full year.  Shares rose  more than 10 percent today to $47.53.  </p><p>Navistar warned that its profit margins would be pressured this year by a  higher freight costs and an expected rise in sales for its less profitable  trucks.  The company says its auto parts business, its more profitable  division, will likely see flat growth and that news overshadowed an  otherwise upbeat full year outlook and the stock fell a fraction to $38.35.  </p><p>Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is being urged by two of its biggest shareholders to  split the roles of chairman and chief executive into two separate roles.   Hedge funds Appaloosa Management and Senator Investment Group are also  calling on the drug maker to reconsider its acquisition strategy and shake  up management, all in an effort to give new life to Allergan's stock which  today was up to $152.21.  </p><p>HERERA:  The pharmaceutical company Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) said the FDA has  approved its drug that's intended to prevent infections in patients  undergoing chemotherapy.  Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) said it plans to market the  medication the coming weeks.  The shares finished up nearly 4 percent to  $39.98.  </p><p>And shares of Twitter get a three-year high on news that it will join the  S&amp;P 500 index.  The social media company is replacing seed maker Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which is merging with Bayer.  The change will take effect  before the market opens on Thursday.  Twitter's shares jumped 5 percent to  finish the day at $39.80.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, why big tech is pouring big money into the race for  San Francisco mayor.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are being sued by  Washington state's attorney general.  He says the companies failed to  maintain information about political advertising.  That information is  required by law and it includes data about buyers of political ads.  The  cost, how much they paid, and the candidate or ballot measure at issue.  </p><p>Washington candidates and political committees have reportedly spent about  $5 million to advertise on those platforms in the past decade.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Some big tech companies are taking sides in the San Francisco  mayoral race and they have been pouring a lot of money into campaigns.   That's because the stakes are high for a critical American industry.  </p><p>Aditi Roy has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  San Francisco is about  to elect a new mayor in a wide open race and many voters have strong  opinions about the issues important to them.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I understand the tech companies coming in, but the  problem is that they have pushed out a lot of the old-time residents.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two problems.  One is mentally ill homeless people, and  two is drug addicts.  </p><p>ROY:  There are eight candidates running for mayor, but the top three  contenders appear to be London Breed, Jane Kim, and Mark Leno.  </p><p>And the city's housing crisis seems to be front and center in the race.   That's where tech leaders come in.  Companies like Twitter, Airbnb, and  Uber have all moved into San Francisco the last few years, and the infusion  of highly paid engineers has been blamed for the city's housing crisis and  rise of homelessness.  </p><p>Many tech leaders are looking for solutions to these problems.  While all  the candidates addressed those topics, Breed, the front runner, appears to  have the most aggressive plan for building more homes.  She's pledged to  create at least 5,000 units of housing per year and has backed removing  homeless people from the streets.  Medium CEO Evan Williams has donated  $100,500 to a committee supporting here.  And venture capitalist Ron Conway  and his wife Gayle have also contributed.</p><p>Jane Kim is proposing a $1 billion bond to stabilize the housing market and  wants to make shelters more accessible and deploy mobile showers for  homeless people.  Her tech backers include the CEOs of start-up Automatic  and Zendesk.  They donated $100,000 and also $50,000 respectively to a  committee supporting Kim.  </p><p>The tech footprint has expanded in recent years in part because of the  policies of late Mayor Ed Lee, whose sudden death in December sparked  today's election.  Voters we talked to seemed divided on tech's influence  in San Francisco.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Without the tech companies, you don't have all this  fabulous infrastructure.  </p><p>ROY:  Even though many high-profile tech leaders are supporting Breed, it's  unclear whether she'll follow in lee's footsteps in embracing tech  companies.  In 2016, she even introduced legislation that would have  regulated Airbnb.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The first state in the Union, today, became the first state  outside of Nevada to take wagers on sports betting and this comes just a  few weeks after the Supreme Court lifted the federal ban.  Betting is  taking place at three Delaware casinos and will offer wagering on baseball,  football, basketball, soccer, golf, and auto racing.  Other states are  expected to follow.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Finally tonight, the latest list of the world's highest paid  athletes is out.  According to Forbes, Floyd Mayweather is at the top spot  again.  This the fourth time in the last seven years, total earnings last  year, $285 million.  </p><p>Number two, soccer player Lionel Messi.  Payday of $111 million.  Rounding  out the top three , fellow soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo at $108 million.  </p><p>By the way, the 100 highest paid athletes earned a collective $3.8 billion  during the past 12 months.  That is up more than 20 percent from a year  ago.  </p><p>HERERA:  That's it for us tonight.  Have a great night.  </p><p>GRIFFETH:  See you tomorrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

There are more job openings than there are available workers. And that`s never happened before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: What`s brewing? Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) will start its next chapter without the man who turned it into a household name and at a time when the company faces a number of challenges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Death of an icon. Kate Spade turned a small handbag company into a global brand. Today, she was found dead in her Manhattan apartment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, June 5th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you good evening, everybody.</p><p>During an otherwise quiet day on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite closed at a record and we`ll have more on that coming up.</p><p>But we begin tonight with a significant moment in our economic history. We learned today that right now, there are more available jobs than there are people out of work. That is something the American economy has never experienced before.</p><p>The Labor Department`s latest report shows that there are a record 6.7 million job openings in April, while the number of available workers was 6.4 million. That is the first time that has happened since the government began tracking job openings back in 2000.</p><p>Now, to put this in perspective, when the Great Recession ended nine years ago this month, there were about six unemployed people for every job opening at that time. And it`s just the latest sign that the U.S. is facing an historically tight labor market.</p><p>HERERA: And, Bill, those positive numbers on the jobs market come alongside some sobering news on the state of social security. Costs for that program will exceed its income this year for the first time since 1982, forcing the program to dip into its trust fund to cover benefits. It is estimated that those reserves will be depleted by the year 2034 and Social Security will no longer be able to send full benefits.</p><p>The report also said that Medicare`s hospital insurance fund will be depleted in 2026. That is three years earlier than anticipated.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, a new report says leading CEOs are a little less optimistic than they have been. According to the latest survey from the Business Roundtable, many are concerned about the direction of trade policy right now.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has detailed for us from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For the first time since Donald Trump was elected president, a quarterly reading of confidence among CEO has fallen. The survey conducted by the Business Roundtable showed that expectations for the next six months for hiring, capital investment, sales, and U.S. GDP all declined. One major reason: trade. Ninety-five percent of executives citing White House trade policy as a moderate or serious risk.</p><p>Business Roundtable CEO Josh Bolton and chair, JPMorgan`s Jamie Dimon told reporters they`d advise the White House against tariffs and protectionist policies to no avail. One hundred and thirty-two CEOs responded to the survey during the middle two weeks of May, when the White House was negotiating trade deals on NAFTA and with China, two fronts where friction has only increased in the weeks since.</p><p>NEC director Larry Kudlow said the U.S. may pursue separate deals with Canada and Mexico to replace the current trilateral deal, and a White House team in Beijing reportedly rebuffed an offer from China to buy $70 billion in U.S. energy and crops.</p><p>Here`s White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Our focus is on making sure we get good deals. I`m not here to make an announcement on what those look like, but he`s going to continue pushing forward to make sure that he gets the best deal for American workers.</p><p>TAUSCHE: A campaign promise turning into a C-suite headache.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: On Wall Street, as we mentioned, the Nasdaq closed at a fresh record, helped by shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). And while tech stocks powered ahead, the rest of the market struggled for gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13 points. The Nasdaq was up 31 and the S&amp;P $ 500 gained two points, nearly two.</p><p>Now, some say the market is facing some pretty tough hurdles and investors want to know if those hurdles can be cleared. So, Mike Santoli takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stock market bulls have plenty to be proud of after two months of hard-won progress, but they still have a bit more to prove. The S&amp;P 500 index is up more than 6 percent since early April, grinding higher through a thicket of concerns, including trade tensions, rising interest rates, increasing inflation pressures and fears of new regulation on tech giants.</p><p>The slow climb has taken the index right up to a key threshold. The 27.50 level has capped earlier rallies and where a nasty drop occurred in mid- March. This is a pretty natural area for the index to stall for a while as investors assess the underlying strength of the economy and the potential danger of trade policy moves and the Federal Reserve`s rate-boosting campaign.</p><p>The leadership of the market remains sturdy, but selective. The Nasdaq is fully recovered from the correction that started in January, and it`s back at a fresh all-time high. Small company stocks are also at a new record. These are positives for the bull case, but also a reminder that the drivers of the market`s comeback have been narrow.</p><p>Only three major sectors, tech, consumer discretionary, and energy have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 as a whole since the index was last at its current level nearly three months ago. The momentum in corporate profits has been powerful. The only question being how much growth will slow into 2019.</p><p>The latest little push higher for stocks coincided with a pullback in oil prices and an easing back of bond yields, on more soothing talk from the Fed and a flutter of global market turbulence that sent investors to the shelter of treasuries.</p><p>And so, as the market heads for the higher end of its choppy 2018 range, and new economic reports continue to show impressive strength, the next test for the bulls might come as those ten-year treasury yields make another run above 3 percent and the Fed has its say next week.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>We begin with video game maker Take Two Interactive, which was downgraded from outperform at BMO Capital Markets. The analyst there cites high expectations for an upcoming video game release which it says could disappoint. Price target: $116. The stock fell a fraction to $113.26.</p><p>Meanwhile, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) shares were downgraded to neutral from buy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The analyst cites China`s decision to suspend construction of new solar farms and to cut subsidies. Price target now $63 and that stock fell more than 5.5 percent today to $58.24.</p><p>HERERA: And Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is also making a call on Weightwatchers, rating the company a buy in new coverage. The analyst says the stock could rise another 20 percent from current levels. The price target is $95. The stock was up 8 percent today to $85.93.</p><p>Shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were upgraded to buy from neutral at Citi. The analyst cites rising oil prices and a potential increase in production growth this year and next. The price target is $97. The stock closed up a fraction to $85.51.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The woman who created an iconic accessories empire that made her name synonymous with trendy handbags was found dead today in her Manhattan apartment. Designer Kate Spade was 55 years old. The cause of death is being reported as a suicide.</p><p>Our Courtney Reagan now has more on her influence in the fashion world and the legacy she leaves behind.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The retail and fashion industries are mourning the loss of the designer known as Kate Spade. They`ve launched her original eponymous handbag brand Kate Spade in 1993.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, Kate Spade, the brand, begun with six utilitarian hand bags and a variety of colors. The brand was the first premium American handbag maker to use nylon for its base material.</p><p>Kate Spade, her husband, and partners sold their majority stake to Neiman Marcus (NYSE:MCS) in 1999 for around $34 million, and the remaining stake in 2006 for $59 million.</p><p>The Kate Spade brand has only grown. After changing ownership several times, Tapestry, which also owns Coach (NYSE:COH) and Stuart Weitzman, bought the Kate Spade brand for nearly $2.5 billion last year, eleven years after spade sold her are remaining stake in the company she founded.</p><p>The Kate Spade brand is still known today for its bright colors, feminine, whimsical aesthetic, and kitschy marketing. Kate Spade handbags, shoes, accessories and clothing are sold around the world, bringing in more than $1 billion in annual sales.</p><p>Two years ago, she, along with her husband, Andy Spade, and the duo`s original two other business partners, launched a new handbag and shoe brand, Frances Valentine, around the same time she changed her name to Kate Valentine. Frances Valentine also shares colorful shoes and handbags in department stores, boutiques and online, globally, with that still familiar aesthetic that Kate Spade is known for, but with higher prices because of production in Italy and Spain.</p><p>No official word from Frances Valentine on its future after the death of its founder.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, America`s most famous coffee chain embarks on a whole new chapter.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: As we reported last night, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) executive chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down from the company he helped to build. Andrew Ross Sorkin broke the story and spoke to Mr. Schultz today about his next act.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: We`re here in Seattle where we sat down exclusively with Howard Schultz, the outgoing executive chair of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) who announced plans to step down from the company he said among other things that he may pursue in the future, public service, which, of course, has fueled speculation he could run for president in 2020. I asked him directly about that prospect.</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, STARBUCKS: There`s a lot of things I can do as a private citizen other than run for the presidency of the United States, and let`s just see what happens. I`ve got lots of things I`m thinking about. I`m writing a book. It`s only been 24 hours.</p><p>But we`ve talked many times about how concerned I am about the country, our standing in the world, and I think there`s many things I can do as a private citizen to advance the cause of the promise of the country.</p><p>SORKIN: While he said he has not made a decision yet about what he`s going to do in the future, he did have a number of views on public policy.</p><p>SCHULTZ: Ronald Reagan in 1986 passed an immigration bill as a Republican president, so why can`t we come together, move the ideology out, and do what`s in the interest of American people? Seventy percent of the American people want a good immigration policy. Seventy percent of the American people want the kind of policy and legislation that takes the guns of war out of the American people`s neighborhoods. I mean, it just doesn`t make sense to me.</p><p>SORKIN: Intriguingly, he had a fascinating take on how to think about today`s economy and the stock market.</p><p>SCHULTZ: I think it`s very wrong to use the stock market as a proxy for the U.S. economy. Interest rates are going up, and if I had to make a bet, and I`m not an economist, I don`t believe that the stock market is going to continue to grow at the level it has between now and 2020. You`re going to see a sea change.</p><p>So, listen, the economy is strong. I give President Obama credit for that. I give President Trump some credit for that. But you also have systemic problems in the country, the likes of which we have not had in a long time.</p><p>SORKIN: Howard Schultz stepping off the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stage but probably not stepping out of the headlines.</p><p>I`m Andrew Ross Sorkin for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT in Seattle.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) investors aren`t too happy about the departure of Howard Schultz. The news sent shares of the stock lower in trading today. No doubt those same investors want to know what is next for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and how the company plans to overcome a number of challenges.</p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) has that part of the story for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s a new era for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), as founder and executive chairman Howard Schultz steps away from the brand he made into a household name over the past 30- plus years.</p><p>SCHULTZ: Please come in.</p><p>ROGERS: Now, the focus is on Kevin Johnson, the company`s CEO who has been at the helm since last year. The two men worked closely together and analysts say the move presents an opening for Johnson to step out of Schultz` shadow.</p><p>RJ HOTTOVY, MORNINGSTAR SENIOR RESTAURANT ANALYST: I think this will be an opportunity for Kevin to really show himself and that he doesn`t necessarily need to rely strictly on Howard and, you know, frankly, can leverage the experience and talents of the rest of the team.</p><p>ROGERS: Schultz` departure comes at a time when the competition for consumer dollars is fierce as companies from Dunkin Donuts to McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) are offering steeper values on coffee. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is focused on mobile as well as the consumer experience with its reserve bars and roasteries in Seattle and Shanghai, with openings in Milan and New York later this year.</p><p>Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is also in the midst of an ever growing push into China, where it opens a new store once every 15 hours. A big challenge on Johnson`s plate, increasing same store sales in the U.S. which has been stagnant. Experts say Johnson needs to focus on innovation and technology.</p><p>HOTTOVY: I think that they need to iron out the mobile order platform and, you know, make that -- and improve the experience in the stores. I think once they start to do that, I think that the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) brand, you know, will kind of right the ship there.</p><p>ROGERS: Another bright spot in the leadership change, the appointment of Myron Ullman to executive chairperson who turned around struggling retailer JCPenney not once, but twice in the past.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Well, it has been reported by \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" that Howard Schultz may consider a run for the presidency in 2020, and Andrew Ross Sorkin addressed that earlier in our program. Well, today, Home Depot`s co-founder and philanthropist Ken Langone said that if more people with business experience get involved in politics, it`s a good thing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN LANGONE, HOME DEPOT CO-FOUNDER: Howard Schultz, Jamie Dimon, Mike Bloomberg, if we get those kind of people to say, hey, he won and I can win, we`re going to dramatically open the pool of talent for people to become president. And by the way, that`s great.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: And that got us thinking about how business backgrounds could play a role in public office.</p><p>Joining us to talk about that is Jeffery Sonnenfeld, management professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at Yale School of Management.</p><p>Welcome back, Jeffrey. Nice to see you again.</p><p>JEFFREY SONNENFELD, YALE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT: Thanks, Sue. Good to see you. And hi, Bill.</p><p>HERERA: Does it matter whether or not the business executive and we`ve had many business executives transfer into government roles, does it matter whether they come from a private company or a public company? Does one give an advantage over the other?</p><p>SONNENFELD: That`s a great question. You know, that was the fine point in Andrew Ross Sorkin`s interview with Howard Schultz today, that he wanted to make that point without coming across like he is starting up a slug fest with the president. But he was suggesting that a, you know, a midsize family business as the Trump Organization is, that has some global reach, doesn`t, you know, maybe a dozen countries, doesn`t compare to the magnitude of what Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has in 75 countries with some, I don`t know, 38,000 stores and things.</p><p>They`re almost as big in terms of the number of stores as McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD).</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>SONNENFELD: Yes, it makes a big difference, being accountable to bosses, to a board, to disparate constituencies, difficult bottom line criteria to meet and things. As a public CEO, it`s a very different experience than being a private CEO. I don`t want to diminish what Donald Trump has accomplished. I think as a CEO of a private business, it`s pretty impressive, but what the scrutiny and everything that a public company has to go under, there`s nothing like it, and none of the predecessors of our current CEOs have had as difficult a job as the current generation has.</p><p>GRIFFETH: There have been other successful businessmen in the White House, though, Jeff. You had Herbert Hoover, who was a mining magnate. He made his fortune in mining. H.W. Bush made his fortune in oil. That just names two of them.</p><p>How are they different from other people who have been in the White House? How is their thinking different as business people?</p><p>SONNENFELD: It`s funny you mention those two, Bill. It`s because Douglas Brinkley, the presidential historian, used those two in an article today to say, look, CEOs don`t transfer into public office that well. Look how troubled those careers were that Herbert Hoover, who by all accounts was a wonderful human being, was not a wonderful president. And \"W\" who was also a wonderful human being won`t be ranked as one of our finest presidents, George W. Bush.</p><p>But, you know, for a historian, that was a strange thing to pick. You could also say being a governor was bad because George W. Bush was a governor. Andrew Johnson was governor of Tennessee. You had a lot of -- Jimmy Carter was governor of Georgia.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRIFFETH: By the same token, George Washington was a very successful farmer, you know, which was a big business back in those days. So there`s a --</p><p>SONNENFELD: Good for you. He was a farmer, and for that point, you know, Harry Truman, you know, he was a haberdasher. That`s what my dad did. I think that was a pretty important position.</p><p>But there were some who were very successful that were never senators and never were governors, never really had an elected position like that exactly. Abraham Lincoln wasn`t a governor, was never a senator. There are some very impressive models that way.</p><p>But business leaders have done well. Michael Bloomberg, of course, is mayor, which is the next toughest job after president is mayor of New York City. He certainly did very well.</p><p>And there are many business leaders who went into public service who were successful business leaders but even more renowned for their legacies in public service, like Averell Harriman who ran his dad`s railroad, the Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Brown Brothers Harriman; and Chester Bowles, a great advertising exec. These people are people are fantastic diplomats.</p><p>HERERA: Lots of examples, indeed. Jeff, thank you very much. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld with Yale School of Management.</p><p>Bill?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, we`ve got G-III apparel posting a surprise profit and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The owner of Guess and DKNY said that there was demand for many of its brands and that helps sales and profits topped estimates. The clothing company also raised its earnings guidance for the full year. Shares rose more than 10 percent today to $47.53.</p><p>Navistar warned that its profit margins would be pressured this year by a higher freight costs and an expected rise in sales for its less profitable trucks. The company says its auto parts business, its more profitable division, will likely see flat growth and that news overshadowed an otherwise upbeat full year outlook and the stock fell a fraction to $38.35.</p><p>Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is being urged by two of its biggest shareholders to split the roles of chairman and chief executive into two separate roles. Hedge funds Appaloosa Management and Senator Investment Group are also calling on the drug maker to reconsider its acquisition strategy and shake up management, all in an effort to give new life to Allergan`s stock which today was up to $152.21.</p><p>HERERA: The pharmaceutical company Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) said the FDA has approved its drug that`s intended to prevent infections in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) said it plans to market the medication the coming weeks. The shares finished up nearly 4 percent to $39.98.</p><p>And shares of Twitter get a three-year high on news that it will join the S&amp;P 500 index. The social media company is replacing seed maker Monsanto (NYSE:MON), which is merging with Bayer. The change will take effect before the market opens on Thursday. Twitter`s shares jumped 5 percent to finish the day at $39.80.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Coming up, why big tech is pouring big money into the race for San Francisco mayor.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are being sued by Washington state`s attorney general. He says the companies failed to maintain information about political advertising. That information is required by law and it includes data about buyers of political ads. The cost, how much they paid, and the candidate or ballot measure at issue.</p><p>Washington candidates and political committees have reportedly spent about $5 million to advertise on those platforms in the past decade.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Some big tech companies are taking sides in the San Francisco mayoral race and they have been pouring a lot of money into campaigns. That`s because the stakes are high for a critical American industry.</p><p>Aditi Roy has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: San Francisco is about to elect a new mayor in a wide open race and many voters have strong opinions about the issues important to them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I understand the tech companies coming in, but the problem is that they have pushed out a lot of the old-time residents.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two problems. One is mentally ill homeless people, and two is drug addicts.</p><p>ROY: There are eight candidates running for mayor, but the top three contenders appear to be London Breed, Jane Kim, and Mark Leno.</p><p>And the city`s housing crisis seems to be front and center in the race. That`s where tech leaders come in. Companies like Twitter, Airbnb, and Uber have all moved into San Francisco the last few years, and the infusion of highly paid engineers has been blamed for the city`s housing crisis and rise of homelessness.</p><p>Many tech leaders are looking for solutions to these problems. While all the candidates addressed those topics, Breed, the front runner, appears to have the most aggressive plan for building more homes. She`s pledged to create at least 5,000 units of housing per year and has backed removing homeless people from the streets. Medium CEO Evan Williams has donated $100,500 to a committee supporting here. And venture capitalist Ron Conway and his wife Gayle have also contributed.</p><p>Jane Kim is proposing a $1 billion bond to stabilize the housing market and wants to make shelters more accessible and deploy mobile showers for homeless people. Her tech backers include the CEOs of start-up Automatic and Zendesk. They donated $100,000 and also $50,000 respectively to a committee supporting Kim.</p><p>The tech footprint has expanded in recent years in part because of the policies of late Mayor Ed Lee, whose sudden death in December sparked today`s election. Voters we talked to seemed divided on tech`s influence in San Francisco.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Without the tech companies, you don`t have all this fabulous infrastructure.</p><p>ROY: Even though many high-profile tech leaders are supporting Breed, it`s unclear whether she`ll follow in lee`s footsteps in embracing tech companies. In 2016, she even introduced legislation that would have regulated Airbnb.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The first state in the Union, today, became the first state outside of Nevada to take wagers on sports betting and this comes just a few weeks after the Supreme Court lifted the federal ban. Betting is taking place at three Delaware casinos and will offer wagering on baseball, football, basketball, soccer, golf, and auto racing. Other states are expected to follow.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Finally tonight, the latest list of the world`s highest paid athletes is out. According to Forbes, Floyd Mayweather is at the top spot again. This the fourth time in the last seven years, total earnings last year, $285 million.</p><p>Number two, soccer player Lionel Messi. Payday of $111 million. Rounding out the top three , fellow soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo at $108 million.</p><p>By the way, the 100 highest paid athletes earned a collective $3.8 billion during the past 12 months. That is up more than 20 percent from a year ago.</p><p>HERERA: That`s it for us tonight. Have a great night.</p><p>GRIFFETH: See you tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

There  are more job openings than there are available workers.  And that's never  happened before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  What's brewing?  Starbucks  (NASDAQ:SBUX) will start its next chapter without the man who turned it  into a household name and at a time when the company faces a number of  challenges.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  Death of an icon.  Kate Spade turned a small handbag company into  a global brand.  Today, she was found dead in her Manhattan apartment.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, June  5th.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you good evening, everybody.  </p><p> During an otherwise quiet day on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite closed  at a record and we'll have more on that coming up.  </p><p> But we begin tonight with a significant moment in our economic history.  We  learned today that right now, there are more available jobs than there are  people out of work.  That is something the American economy has never  experienced before.  </p><p> The Labor Department's latest report shows that there are a record 6.7  million job openings in April, while the number of available workers was  6.4 million.  That is the first time that has happened since the government  began tracking job openings back in 2000.  </p><p> Now, to put this in perspective, when the Great Recession ended nine years  ago this month, there were about six unemployed people for every job  opening at that time.  And it's just the latest sign that the U.S. is  facing an historically tight labor market.  </p><p> HERERA:  And, Bill, those positive numbers on the jobs market come  alongside some sobering news on the state of social security.  Costs for  that program will exceed its income this year for the first time since  1982, forcing the program to dip into its trust fund to cover benefits.  It  is estimated that those reserves will be depleted by the year 2034 and  Social Security will no longer be able to send full benefits.  </p><p> The report also said that Medicare's hospital insurance fund will be  depleted in 2026.  That is three years earlier than anticipated.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, a new report says leading CEOs are a little less  optimistic than they have been.  According to the latest survey from the  Business Roundtable, many are concerned about the direction of trade policy  right now.  </p><p> Kayla Tausche has detailed for us from Washington.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  For the first time  since Donald Trump was elected president, a quarterly reading of confidence  among CEO has fallen.  The survey conducted by the Business Roundtable  showed that expectations for the next six months for hiring, capital  investment, sales, and U.S. GDP all declined.  One major reason: trade.   Ninety-five percent of executives citing White House trade policy as a  moderate or serious risk.  </p><p> Business Roundtable CEO Josh Bolton and chair, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon told  reporters they'd advise the White House against tariffs and protectionist  policies to no avail.  One hundred and thirty-two CEOs responded to the  survey during the middle two weeks of May, when the White House was  negotiating trade deals on NAFTA and with China, two fronts where friction  has only increased in the weeks since.  </p><p> NEC director Larry Kudlow said the U.S. may pursue separate deals with  Canada and Mexico to replace the current trilateral deal, and a White House  team in Beijing reportedly rebuffed an offer from China to buy $70 billion  in U.S. energy and crops.  </p><p> Here's White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.  </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Our focus is on  making sure we get good deals.  I'm not here to make an announcement on  what those look like, but he's going to continue pushing forward to make  sure that he gets the best deal for American workers.  </p><p> TAUSCHE:  A campaign promise turning into a C-suite headache.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  On Wall Street, as we mentioned, the Nasdaq closed at a fresh  record, helped by shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).   And while tech stocks powered ahead, the rest of the market struggled for  gains.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13 points.  The Nasdaq was up  31 and the S&amp;P $ 500 gained two points, nearly two.  </p><p> Now, some say the market is facing some pretty tough hurdles and investors  want to know if those hurdles can be cleared.  So, Mike Santoli takes a  look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stock market bulls  have plenty to be proud of after two months of hard-won progress, but they  still have a bit more to prove.  The S&amp;P 500 index is up more than 6  percent since early April, grinding higher through a thicket of concerns,  including trade tensions, rising interest rates, increasing inflation  pressures and fears of new regulation on tech giants.  </p><p> The slow climb has taken the index right up to a key threshold.  The 27.50  level has capped earlier rallies and where a nasty drop occurred in mid- March.  This is a pretty natural area for the index to stall for a while as  investors assess the underlying strength of the economy and the potential  danger of trade policy moves and the Federal Reserve's rate-boosting  campaign.  </p><p> The leadership of the market remains sturdy, but selective.  The Nasdaq is  fully recovered from the correction that started in January, and it's back  at a fresh all-time high.  Small company stocks are also at a new record.   These are positives for the bull case, but also a reminder that the drivers  of the market's comeback have been narrow.  </p><p> Only three major sectors, tech, consumer discretionary, and energy have  outperformed the S&amp;P 500 as a whole since the index was last at its current  level nearly three months ago.  The momentum in corporate profits has been  powerful.  The only question being how much growth will slow into 2019.  </p><p> The latest little push higher for stocks coincided with a pullback in oil  prices and an easing back of bond yields, on more soothing talk from the  Fed and a flutter of global market turbulence that sent investors to the  shelter of treasuries.  </p><p> And so, as the market heads for the higher end of its choppy 2018 range,  and new economic reports continue to show impressive strength, the next  test for the bulls might come as those ten-year treasury yields make  another run above 3 percent and the Fed has its say next week.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.  </p><p> We begin with video game maker Take Two Interactive, which was downgraded  from outperform at BMO Capital Markets.  The analyst there cites high  expectations for an upcoming video game release which it says could  disappoint.  Price target: $116.  The stock fell a fraction to $113.26.  </p><p> Meanwhile, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) shares were downgraded to neutral from  buy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).  The analyst cites China's decision to  suspend construction of new solar farms and to cut subsidies.  Price target  now $63 and that stock fell more than 5.5 percent today to $58.24.  </p><p> HERERA:  And Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is also making a call on  Weightwatchers, rating the company a buy in new coverage.  The analyst says  the stock could rise another 20 percent from current levels.  The price  target is $95.  The stock was up 8 percent today to $85.93.  </p><p> Shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were upgraded to buy from neutral  at Citi.  The analyst cites rising oil prices and a potential increase in  production growth this year and next.  The price target is $97.  The stock  closed up a fraction to $85.51.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  The woman who created an iconic accessories empire that made her  name synonymous with trendy handbags was found dead today in her Manhattan  apartment.  Designer Kate Spade was 55 years old.  The cause of death is  being reported as a suicide.  </p><p> Our Courtney Reagan now has more on her influence in the fashion world and  the legacy she leaves behind.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The retail and  fashion industries are mourning the loss of the designer known as Kate  Spade.  They've launched her original eponymous handbag brand Kate Spade in  1993.  </p><p> Twenty-five years ago, Kate Spade, the brand, begun with six utilitarian  hand bags and a variety of colors.  The brand was the first premium  American handbag maker to use nylon for its base material.  </p><p> Kate Spade, her husband, and partners sold their majority stake to Neiman  Marcus (NYSE:MCS) in 1999 for around $34 million, and the remaining stake  in 2006 for $59 million.  </p><p> The Kate Spade brand has only grown.  After changing ownership several  times, Tapestry, which also owns Coach (NYSE:COH) and Stuart Weitzman,  bought the Kate Spade brand for nearly $2.5 billion last year, eleven years  after spade sold her are remaining stake in the company she founded.  </p><p> The Kate Spade brand is still known today for its bright colors, feminine,  whimsical aesthetic, and kitschy marketing.  Kate Spade handbags, shoes,  accessories and clothing are sold around the world, bringing in more than  $1 billion in annual sales.  </p><p> Two years ago, she, along with her husband, Andy Spade, and the duo's  original two other business partners, launched a new handbag and shoe  brand, Frances Valentine, around the same time she changed her name to Kate  Valentine.  Frances Valentine also shares colorful shoes and handbags in  department stores, boutiques and online, globally, with that still familiar  aesthetic that Kate Spade is known for, but with higher prices because of  production in Italy and Spain.  </p><p> No official word from Frances Valentine on its future after the death of  its founder.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, America's most  famous coffee chain embarks on a whole new chapter.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  As we reported last night, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) executive  chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down from the company he helped to  build.  Andrew Ross Sorkin broke the story and spoke to Mr. Schultz today  about his next act.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We're here in  Seattle where we sat down exclusively with Howard Schultz, the outgoing  executive chair of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) who announced plans to step down  from the company he said among other things that he may pursue in the  future, public service, which, of course, has fueled speculation he could  run for president in 2020.  I asked him directly about that prospect.  </p><p> HOWARD SCHULTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, STARBUCKS:  There's a lot of things I  can do as a private citizen other than run for the presidency of the United  States, and let's just see what happens.  I've got lots of things I'm  thinking about.  I'm writing a book.  It's only been 24 hours.  </p><p> But we've talked many times about how concerned I am about the country, our  standing in the world, and I think there's many things I can do as a  private citizen to advance the cause of the promise of the country.  </p><p> SORKIN:  While he said he has not made a decision yet about what he's going  to do in the future, he did have a number of views on public policy.  </p><p> SCHULTZ:  Ronald Reagan in 1986 passed an immigration bill as a Republican  president, so why can't we come together, move the ideology out, and do  what's in the interest of American people?  Seventy percent of the American  people want a good immigration policy.  Seventy percent of the American  people want the kind of policy and legislation that takes the guns of war  out of the American people's neighborhoods.  I mean, it just doesn't make  sense to me.  </p><p> SORKIN:  Intriguingly, he had a fascinating take on how to think about  today's economy and the stock market.  </p><p> SCHULTZ:  I think it's very wrong to use the stock market as a proxy for  the U.S. economy.  Interest rates are going up, and if I had to make a bet,  and I'm not an economist, I don't believe that the stock market is going to  continue to grow at the level it has between now and 2020.  You're going to  see a sea change.  </p><p> So, listen, the economy is strong.  I give President Obama credit for that.   I give President Trump some credit for that.  But you also have systemic  problems in the country, the likes of which we have not had in a long time.  </p><p> SORKIN:  Howard Schultz stepping off the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stage but  probably not stepping out of the headlines.  </p><p> I'm Andrew Ross Sorkin for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT in Seattle.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) investors aren't too happy about  the departure of Howard Schultz.  The news sent shares of the stock lower  in trading today.  No doubt those same investors want to know what is next  for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and how the company plans to overcome a number  of challenges.  </p><p> Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) has that part of the story for us tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's a new era for  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), as founder and executive chairman Howard Schultz  steps away from the brand he made into a household name over the past 30- plus years.  </p><p> SCHULTZ:  Please come in.  </p><p> ROGERS:  Now, the focus is on Kevin Johnson, the company's CEO who has been  at the helm since last year.  The two men worked closely together and  analysts say the move presents an opening for Johnson to step out of  Schultz' shadow.  </p><p> RJ HOTTOVY, MORNINGSTAR SENIOR RESTAURANT ANALYST:  I think this will be an  opportunity for Kevin to really show himself and that he doesn't  necessarily need to rely strictly on Howard and, you know, frankly, can  leverage the experience and talents of the rest of the team.  </p><p> ROGERS:  Schultz' departure comes at a time when the competition for  consumer dollars is fierce as companies from Dunkin Donuts to McDonald's  (NYSE:MCD) are offering steeper values on coffee.  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)  is focused on mobile as well as the consumer experience with its reserve  bars and roasteries in Seattle and Shanghai, with openings in Milan and New  York later this year.  </p><p>Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is also in the midst of an ever growing push into  China, where it opens a new store once every 15 hours.  A big challenge on  Johnson's plate, increasing same store sales in the U.S. which has been  stagnant.  Experts say Johnson needs to focus on innovation and technology.  </p><p> HOTTOVY:  I think that they need to iron out the mobile order platform and,  you know, make that -- and improve the experience in the stores.  I think  once they start to do that, I think that the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) brand,  you know, will kind of right the ship there.  </p><p> ROGERS:  Another bright spot in the leadership change, the appointment of  Myron Ullman to executive chairperson who turned around struggling retailer  JCPenney not once, but twice in the past.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Well, it has been reported by \"The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)\" that  Howard Schultz may consider a run for the presidency in 2020, and Andrew  Ross Sorkin addressed that earlier in our program.  Well, today, Home  Depot's co-founder and philanthropist Ken Langone said that if more people  with business experience get involved in politics, it's a good thing.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KEN LANGONE, HOME DEPOT CO-FOUNDER:  Howard Schultz, Jamie Dimon, Mike  Bloomberg, if we get those kind of people to say, hey, he won and I can  win, we're going to dramatically open the pool of talent for people to  become president.  And by the way, that's great.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  And that got us thinking about how business backgrounds could play  a role in public office.  </p><p> Joining us to talk about that is Jeffery Sonnenfeld, management professor  and senior associate dean for leadership studies at Yale School of  Management.  </p><p> Welcome back, Jeffrey.  Nice to see you again.  </p><p> JEFFREY SONNENFELD, YALE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT:  Thanks, Sue.  Good to see  you.  And hi, Bill.  </p><p> HERERA:  Does it matter whether or not the business executive and we've had  many business executives transfer into government roles, does it matter  whether they come from a private company or a public company?  Does one  give an advantage over the other?  </p><p> SONNENFELD:  That's a great question.  You know, that was the fine point in  Andrew Ross Sorkin's interview with Howard Schultz today, that he wanted to  make that point without coming across like he is starting up a slug fest  with the president.  But he was suggesting that a, you know, a midsize  family business as the Trump Organization is, that has some global reach,  doesn't, you know, maybe a dozen countries, doesn't compare to the  magnitude of what Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has in 75 countries with some, I  don't know, 38,000 stores and things.  </p><p> They're almost as big in terms of the number of stores as McDonald's  (NYSE:MCD).  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p> SONNENFELD:  Yes, it makes a big difference, being accountable to bosses,  to a board, to disparate constituencies, difficult bottom line criteria to  meet and things.  As a public CEO, it's a very different experience than  being a private CEO.  I don't want to diminish what Donald Trump has  accomplished.  I think as a CEO of a private business, it's pretty  impressive, but what the scrutiny and everything that a public company has  to go under, there's nothing like it, and none of the predecessors of our  current CEOs have had as difficult a job as the current generation has.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  There have been other successful businessmen in the White House,  though, Jeff.  You had Herbert Hoover, who was a mining magnate.  He made  his fortune in mining.  H.W. Bush made his fortune in oil.  That just names  two of them.  </p><p> How are they different from other people who have been in the White House?   How is their thinking different as business people?  </p><p> SONNENFELD:  It's funny you mention those two, Bill.  It's because Douglas  Brinkley, the presidential historian, used those two in an article today to  say, look, CEOs don't transfer into public office that well.  Look how  troubled those careers were that Herbert Hoover, who by all accounts was a  wonderful human being, was not a wonderful president.  And \"W\" who was also  a wonderful human being won't be ranked as one of our finest presidents,  George W. Bush.</p><p> But, you know, for a historian, that was a strange thing to pick.  You  could also say being a governor was bad because George W. Bush was a  governor.  Andrew Johnson was governor of Tennessee.  You had a lot of --  Jimmy Carter was governor of Georgia.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  By the same token, George Washington was a very successful  farmer, you know, which was a big business back in those days.  So there's  a -- </p><p> SONNENFELD:  Good for you.  He was a farmer, and for that point, you know,  Harry Truman, you know, he was a haberdasher.  That's what my dad did.  I  think that was a pretty important position.</p><p> But there were some who were very successful that were never senators and  never were governors, never really had an elected position like that  exactly.  Abraham Lincoln wasn't a governor, was never a senator.  There  are some very impressive models that way.  </p><p> But business leaders have done well.  Michael Bloomberg, of course, is  mayor, which is the next toughest job after president is mayor of New York  City.  He certainly did very well.</p><p> And there are many business leaders who went into public service who were  successful business leaders but even more renowned for their legacies in  public service, like Averell Harriman who ran his dad's railroad, the Union  Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Brown Brothers Harriman; and Chester Bowles, a great  advertising exec.  These people are people are fantastic diplomats.  </p><p> HERERA:  Lots of examples, indeed.  Jeff, thank you very much.  Jeffrey  Sonnenfeld with Yale School of Management.</p><p> Bill?  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, we've got G-III apparel posting a surprise profit and  that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The owner of Guess and DKNY said that there was demand for many of its  brands and that helps sales and profits topped estimates.  The clothing  company also raised its earnings guidance for the full year.  Shares rose  more than 10 percent today to $47.53.  </p><p> Navistar warned that its profit margins would be pressured this year by a  higher freight costs and an expected rise in sales for its less profitable  trucks.  The company says its auto parts business, its more profitable  division, will likely see flat growth and that news overshadowed an  otherwise upbeat full year outlook and the stock fell a fraction to $38.35.  </p><p>Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is being urged by two of its biggest shareholders to  split the roles of chairman and chief executive into two separate roles.   Hedge funds Appaloosa Management and Senator Investment Group are also  calling on the drug maker to reconsider its acquisition strategy and shake  up management, all in an effort to give new life to Allergan's stock which  today was up to $152.21.  </p><p> HERERA:  The pharmaceutical company Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) said the FDA has  approved its drug that's intended to prevent infections in patients  undergoing chemotherapy.  Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) said it plans to market the  medication the coming weeks.  The shares finished up nearly 4 percent to  $39.98.  </p><p> And shares of Twitter get a three-year high on news that it will join the  S&amp;P 500 index.  The social media company is replacing seed maker Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which is merging with Bayer.  The change will take effect  before the market opens on Thursday.  Twitter's shares jumped 5 percent to  finish the day at $39.80.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Coming up, why big tech is pouring big money into the race for  San Francisco mayor.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are being sued by  Washington state's attorney general.  He says the companies failed to  maintain information about political advertising.  That information is  required by law and it includes data about buyers of political ads.  The  cost, how much they paid, and the candidate or ballot measure at issue.  </p><p> Washington candidates and political committees have reportedly spent about  $5 million to advertise on those platforms in the past decade.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Some big tech companies are taking sides in the San Francisco  mayoral race and they have been pouring a lot of money into campaigns.   That's because the stakes are high for a critical American industry.  </p><p> Aditi Roy has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  San Francisco is about  to elect a new mayor in a wide open race and many voters have strong  opinions about the issues important to them.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I understand the tech companies coming in, but the  problem is that they have pushed out a lot of the old-time residents.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two problems.  One is mentally ill homeless people, and  two is drug addicts.  </p><p> ROY:  There are eight candidates running for mayor, but the top three  contenders appear to be London Breed, Jane Kim, and Mark Leno.  </p><p> And the city's housing crisis seems to be front and center in the race.   That's where tech leaders come in.  Companies like Twitter, Airbnb, and  Uber have all moved into San Francisco the last few years, and the infusion  of highly paid engineers has been blamed for the city's housing crisis and  rise of homelessness.  </p><p> Many tech leaders are looking for solutions to these problems.  While all  the candidates addressed those topics, Breed, the front runner, appears to  have the most aggressive plan for building more homes.  She's pledged to  create at least 5,000 units of housing per year and has backed removing  homeless people from the streets.  Medium CEO Evan Williams has donated  $100,500 to a committee supporting here.  And venture capitalist Ron Conway  and his wife Gayle have also contributed.</p><p> Jane Kim is proposing a $1 billion bond to stabilize the housing market and  wants to make shelters more accessible and deploy mobile showers for  homeless people.  Her tech backers include the CEOs of start-up Automatic  and Zendesk.  They donated $100,000 and also $50,000 respectively to a  committee supporting Kim.  </p><p> The tech footprint has expanded in recent years in part because of the  policies of late Mayor Ed Lee, whose sudden death in December sparked  today's election.  Voters we talked to seemed divided on tech's influence  in San Francisco.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Without the tech companies, you don't have all this  fabulous infrastructure.  </p><p> ROY:  Even though many high-profile tech leaders are supporting Breed, it's  unclear whether she'll follow in lee's footsteps in embracing tech  companies.  In 2016, she even introduced legislation that would have  regulated Airbnb.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  The first state in the Union, today, became the first state  outside of Nevada to take wagers on sports betting and this comes just a  few weeks after the Supreme Court lifted the federal ban.  Betting is  taking place at three Delaware casinos and will offer wagering on baseball,  football, basketball, soccer, golf, and auto racing.  Other states are  expected to follow.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Finally tonight, the latest list of the world's highest paid  athletes is out.  According to Forbes, Floyd Mayweather is at the top spot  again.  This the fourth time in the last seven years, total earnings last  year, $285 million.  </p><p> Number two, soccer player Lionel Messi.  Payday of $111 million.  Rounding  out the top three , fellow soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo at $108 million.  </p><p> By the way, the 100 highest paid athletes earned a collective $3.8 billion  during the past 12 months.  That is up more than 20 percent from a year  ago.  </p><p> HERERA:  That's it for us tonight.  Have a great night.  </p><p> GRIFFETH:  See you tomorrow.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Stocks climb for a second straight day even as questions about the economic expansion remains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Meeting with Mexico. Top diplomats are in Washington to discuss new tariffs days before new duties on all Mexican imports are scheduled to go into effect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Lifestyles of the rich and powerful. Amazon`s Jeff Bezos is reportedly buying three Fifth Avenue condos and we were able to take our cameras inside.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Wednesday, June 5th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>Well, it was another rally day on Wall Street today. The Dow and the S&amp;P have now recorded their best two-day gains since January. Enthusiasm from yesterday carried over to today as investors appeared even more confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates some time this year. Tech rates rose, so did the interest rate sensitive utility and real estate sectors.</p><p>And with U.S. and Mexican officials talking today, some of the concerns over trade that have rattled investors last week were put in the backburner and we`ll have more on that in just a few minutes.</p><p>In the meantime, the Dow gained another 207 points as you see to 25,539, the Nasdaq was up 48 and the S&amp;P added 22.</p><p>HERERA: And stocks rose despite mixed reports on the economy. Job creation in the private sector hit a nine-year low. According to the payroll processor ADP, businesses added just 27,000 jobs in May. The forecasts were for 175,000.</p><p>A separate report, however, points to a strengthening services sector which makes up the bulk of economic activity. The Institute for Supply Management reports an uptick in activity helped by gains in new orders and that pickup in activity was echoed by the Federal Reserve`s Beige Book which is an anecdotal look at the economy across the country.</p><p>Ylan Mui reports tonight from the Central Bank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Federal Reserve said that economic activity was modest this spring and that`s a little bit better than the preceding period. Almost all 12 Fed districts reported at least some economic growth and some even enjoyed moderate gains. Only one district, St. Louis, said that economic activity was unchanged.</p><p>Nationally, employment was about the same as last time. Most districts reported modest to moderate job growth, but the tight labor market remains a constraint. The Fed did find there was increasing wage pressure and improved benefits across a range of occupations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Fed said prices rose at a modest pace and as for tariffs and trade uncertainty, there were a lot of interesting anecdotes out of Boston and Dallas in particular. In Boston, the report called out Huawei and the impact on semiconductor firms. It also said that trade uncertainty is causing delays of new models in the auto industry.</p><p>Meanwhile, over in Dallas manufacturers, retailers and the service sector, they all pointed to tariffs as concerns for price increases and for demand. And some companies said that long delays at the Mexican border were adding to their transportation costs. Overall, consumer spending was generally positive and real estate and loan demand, they both pointed toward growth.</p><p>The Fed said that the outlook for the coming months was modest and positive, however, I will point out that that forecast is made before the recent flare-up with Mexico.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And while some economists say the risk of recession is growing. Not every state can afford one.</p><p>Robert Frank explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A report from Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) found that while most states are prepared for a recession, two of them would face a budget crisis and be forced to cut costs or raise taxes. Those two states, you guessed it, are Illinois and New Jersey. Report looked at how much revenue would likely drop in each state in the downturn and whether they had enough reserves to fill the gap.</p><p>Now, Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) warned that even a mild downturn could be damaging to some states in the 2008 crisis, since states have become a lot more reliant on the personal income tax and the income tax is more reliant on the top 1 percent, and the incomes to that 1 percent are the most volatile. But the biggest factor is pension liabilities, which for Illinois, would be six times its total tax revenues in the next recession. New Jersey`s would be more than three times revenues, which means that for affluent residents of those states and probably Connecticut, too, taxes will go up.</p><p>Now, politicians and tax experts say these states missed an opportunity to save during the good times.</p><p>EVAN BAYH (D), FORMER INDIANA SENATOR: Put some away in the rainy day fund and fully fund your pension so when tough times come along, you`re prepared for that. Politically, the temptation is on to just let the party roll when times are good.</p><p>FRANK: Instead, the new governor of Illinois is already pushing to eliminate the state`s flat tax with a progressive income tax where the wealthy pay a higher rate, and New Jersey`s Governor Phil Murphy insisting on a millionaire`s tax which the legislature is fighting.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, from recession fears to mixed economic data, to the call for interest rate cuts and just where does the economy stand right now?</p><p>Joining us to talk about that is Craig Dismuke. He is the chief economist at Vining Sparks.</p><p>Welcome back, Craig. Nice to see you again.</p><p>CRAIG DISMUKE, VINING SPARKS CHIEF ECONOMIST: Hey, good evening, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: You know, there are a lot of different opinions floating out there about where we are economically, but you fall in the camp of fundamentally stable, why?</p><p>DISMUKE: Well, I think you look at the consumer, the consumer`s been in a good position. And we see the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent and we`ve seen the wage growth above 3 percent now. The consumer debt load isn`t too onerous in this cycle.</p><p>And I think that`s the basis for this stable economy and business investment is positive, and we see some weakness and we`re starting to see some growing concerns, obviously, with the trade uncertainty that`s creeping in. But I think, today, I was most encouraged by the ISM number and the fact that it didn`t plunge -- did actually bounce a little bit. That was an encouraging number to us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But having said all that, though, you still -- you believe the Fed will cut rates this year. Why?</p><p>DISMUKE: Well, for a couple of reasons. You know, the trade talks with China have deteriorated and they`ve more so than we expected coming into the year. And so, I think that will start to feed into the real data. I think you`ll start to see some weaker growth.</p><p>On top of that, you`ve got these tariffs that have been added to Mexico. That creates a whole new level of uncertainty for business owners in the U.S. You have inflation that`s running below the Fed`s target, down at 1.6 percent right now. The Fed`s talking about a new approach to the targeting and you`ll have to prove that you`re committed to that. So, I think that`s going to put them in a position to be more dovish.</p><p>And then the last thing is the market has priced this in, and the markets are expecting a rate cut and that`s what we see in the bond market and if you don`t, if the Fed were not to cut rates in the second half of the year, it risks creating another scenario like we saw last December where the markets were disappointed in monetary policy.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, it`s kind of a vicious circle, is it not?</p><p>DISMUKE: It is.</p><p>HERERA: I mean, if they cut, it`s because the economy is weak and if they don`t cut, then the market gets upset and the economy may weaken and confidence may suffer.</p><p>DISMUKE: Absolutely. And I think to some degree that`s where we are now and the markets are expecting -- the nice thing for the Fed right now is like we look at previous cycles going back to 1998. We don`t have a lot of inflation right now. And in fact, it`s below their target and it gives them the ability to be patient and to cut rates 25 or 50 basis points and underneath the purview of their mandate and try to boost growth a little bit and stimulate things in the middle of all of this uncertainty.</p><p>HERERA: Craig, thank you so much. Craig Dismuke with Vining Sparks.</p><p>DISMUKE: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meantime, oil prices are now in bear market territory, meaning that they have fallen more than 20 percent since their most recent peak in late April. A government report today showed an unexpected surge in stockpiles of crude. Prices were already under pressure because of fears of slowing global growth, and this is the third bear market for U.S. oil since the start of 2017, and today`s close is its lowest price since January. Domestic crude settled down more than 3 percent to around $51 a barrel.</p><p>HERERA: The International Monetary Fund warns that a trade war could wipe $455 billion off of global growth next year. The IMF report said that the most recent U.S.-China tariffs could further reduce investment and productivity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTINE LAGARDE, IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR: Some of the risks that we had identified back a couple of months ago have actually become materializing. One of the ricks that we have identified is the risks associated with trade tensions and two months ago, we said be very careful what you are doing with this major growth engine that is trade because anything that breaks on trade such as tariffs, such as non-tariff barriers is going to actually be a break on growth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: For some perspective, the estimated decline in GDP would be larger than South Africa`s economy.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And a number of companies today cited the impact of tariffs in their earnings reports. For example, bourbon maker Brown Forman (NYSE:BF.A) says that the trade standoff will drag sales growth down by a percentage point for the entire year. American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) warn that if tariffs are expanded to apparel, its financial results would take a hit.</p><p>And Campbell`s Soup put it this way, it said that if retaliatory tariffs with Canada would be avoided, a significant cost would be eliminated.</p><p>HERERA: A delegation from Mexico were in Washington today, hoping to avert new tariffs that are scheduled to go into effect next week.</p><p>Kayla Tausche is at the White House for us tonight.</p><p>Good evening, Kayla.</p><p>What does the administration want in these negotiations?</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, the White House, Sue, has left the negotiations open and the demands open. They said that they want Mexico to substantially stop the flow of migrants and drugs into the United States, but they haven`t exactly said what the number is that they want. They want Mexico to reinforce its border with Guatemala and they also want Mexico to consider a proposal to become a safe third country.</p><p>That means that Mexico would have to accept all asylum seekers coming through from Central America instead of the United States, but Mexico so far has called that last one a red line.</p><p>GRIFFETH: What are the Mexicans offering? I mean, they came with a list of their own of demands and offers. Did you get a sense of what they are?</p><p>TAUSCHE: Well, we mentioned that they are not willing to accept the U.S. proposal to accept Central American refugees. That being said, they are, according to \"Reuters\" proposing a marshal plan for the rebuilding of Central America. They also are planning to propose a diversion of some funds from the State Department program from 2008 that was to combat drug and human trafficking, and we`ll see exactly what the White House says about where those proposals stand right now.</p><p>HERERA: So do you have a sense of how likely it is that we will get a deal?</p><p>TAUSCHE: Well, I think, Sue, for today, the prospect of a deal is low. We know the president likes to make his own deals and not only is he traveling overseas this week, but many key members of his immigration policy team, Jared Kushner, Stephen Miller, John Bolton, the national security adviser, all of those officials are abroad with the president and he has a high- level delegation on his behalf, but it`s expected that the president will want to do this deal himself.</p><p>HERERA: We will be watching.</p><p>Thank you, Kayla. Kayla Tausche at the White House.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Cannabis company Cronos Group was upgraded to buy from underperform at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch today. The analyst says that Cronos is likely nearing a launch here in the U.S. Price target now $20. Shares rose 10 percent to $15.99.</p><p>Pivotal Software was downgraded to neutral from outperform at Wedbush. The analyst calls the company`s quarterly results a train wreck and described its deferred revenue and billings numbers as disastrous. And the price target is $15, and the stock itself was a disaster, down 41 percent today to $10.89.</p><p>And Roku was upgraded to buy from neutral at Guggenheim. The analyst says the advertising on its streaming platform is becoming more profitable now. So, the price target is $119. The stock rose more than 8.5 percent today to $101.71.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, as big tech power grows, so does its spending in Washington.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: As people spend more time online companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are becoming more powerful.</p><p>And as Julia Boorstin tells us, new reports show just how dominant they`ve become.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With new antitrust scrutiny looming for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and the other tech giants, two new reports show the trends behind their growing power. For the first time ever, American adults will spend more time using their mobile devices daily, three hours and 43 minutes than they do watching TV. That`s according to eMarketer, with mobile time expected to continue to replace TV time in coming years.</p><p>The U.S. internet ad market, the largest, surpassing $100 billion for the first time this year, according to a new PWC study. And Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) dominated. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with 37 percent market share and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with 22 percent.</p><p>TIM LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS: What this is all about is data and advertising, and if advertising keeps going up and the secular tailwinds of people moving to online advertising and advertising on social media continue to grow, they`re just going to see maybe a little bit of, maybe, tamped down earnings over the last few years, but they`re still in the sweet spot.</p><p>BOORSTIN: The question is whether the Federal Trade Commission which will oversee antitrust in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will find that Facebook`s dominant over social, it also owns Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, erodes the competitive environment.</p><p>BRIAN WHITE, MONESS, CRESPI, HARDT &amp; CO.: I do look at this group and I do think there is a reason for increased regulation and I do think there is the possibility for breakup and when I look at the companies most at risk, it`s Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which if they were ever broken up, their stock prices in my view will be much, much higher.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Now, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) doesn`t dominate everything. The smart speaker industry is booming and expected to spawn a massive new ad business with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the leaders there, Facebook`s Portal is just a small player which Mark Zuckerberg might point to is a sign that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) doesn`t deserve antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Plus, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google`s dominance hasn`t hampered Amazon`s ability to make gains, while Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook`s market shares are relatively steady, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has grown to nearly 9 percent in the U.S. digital ad market this year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And as big tech power grows, so does scrutiny from Washington and that has led most of these companies to spend an awful lot of money on lobbying.</p><p>Aditi Roy has that part of the story for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Alphabet spent more than $20 million on lobbying last year. That`s more than any other U.S. company. In fact, for the past two years, the search giant has topped the list of spenders outranking traditional front-runners like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T).</p><p>It wasn`t always that way. Back in 2009, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) spent just $4 million on lobbying, but that number started to climb in 2011 and `12, just as it started facing more regulatory heat. In 2012, Alphabet paid $22 million in fines to settle FTC charges to privacy. In 2013, the company agreed to change its business practices following concerns that those practices were stifling competition.</p><p>Over the last decade, spending on lobbying has gone up 500 percent. It`s not just Alphabet. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ranked among the top as well.</p><p>Those three companies each spent on double digits on issues ranging from competition to privacy. That`s more than the amount Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) spent leading up to its trial with the DOJ two decades ago, but it`s unclear what effect it will have on influencing government regulation.</p><p>KEN AULETTA, NEW YORKER MAGAZINE: More effect than they had before, but the problem is policies and practices are raising questions about whether they should be regulated in some way.</p><p>ROY: Those questions resurfaced when European regulators took antitrust action against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) which resulted in fines of nearly $10 billion. Industry experts say those actions might have stepped up pressure on U.S. regulators who are now looking at their practices of Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also putting resources into the E.U. regulatory challenges, announcing today it has appealed the $1.7 billion E.U. fine for March for stifling competition in the online advertising industry.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: China slaps a fine on Ford and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>In the latest ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, Chinese regulators have fined Ford`s main joint venture in China nearly $24 million for setting minimum retail prices on its cars which the regulator said restricts competition. Ford`s shares fell more than 1 percent to $9.78.</p><p>Boeing (NYSE:BA) is reportedly in talks with China for one of its largest orders of wide-body jets. Bloomberg says the airline maker is discussing orders for as many as 100 twin-aisle jets. The 787 Dreamliners and the 777X planes which is Boeing`s newest long-range aircraft. The report did say no deal is imminent due to the trade war, but Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose more than 1 percent to $348.75.</p><p>And Lab Corp said that more than 7.5 million of its customers may have been impacted by a data breach. The blood testing provider said it was the same breach that rival Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) said may have affected 12 million of its patients. Nonetheless, Lab Corp was up a fraction to $166.84.</p><p>GRIFFETH: GIII Apparel reported better than expected earnings, but it did miss revenue expectations. The company has an array of brands that include Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY, but it already had started raising prices in an effort to offset Chinese tariffs. That stock fell more than 9 percent today to $24.51.</p><p>After the bell, online clothing services Stitch Fix topped expectations and saw an increase in its active clients. The news sent the stock initially higher after-hours, but they did close the regular session down more than 2 percent to $23.57.</p><p>Also after the bell, Cloudera`s revenue and outlook came in below Wall Street`s expectations. The cloud software company also reported that its CEO is stepping down and retiring and it all sent the stock initially lower after-hours on top of a more than 3 percent decline during the regular session today. It closed at $8.80.</p><p>HERERA: As we`ve been reporting, mortgage rates have fallen pretty dramatically over the last few weeks, hitting its lowest levels in more than a year. But curiously enough, demand for mortgages is not heating up.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mortgage rates are down dramatically, but apparently not low enough to impress today`s homebuyers who are still up against very high prices. Total mortgage application volume increased 1.5 percent last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, but the gains were driven by refinancing. The average rate on the 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances fell to 4.23 percent from 4.33 percent by the end of last week. That`s for loans with a 20 percent down payment, and they`re even lower this week.</p><p>With that savings, refinance volume rose 6 percent from the previous week, and was nearly 33 percent higher than the same week a year ago, when interest rates were significantly higher. Refinances are particularly rate-sensitive and the drop in rates added 2 million more borrowers to the pool of those who could benefit from a refi, according to Black Knight.</p><p>But mortgage applications to buy a home fell 2 percent for the week and were barely 0.5 percent higher than the same one year ago. So, really flat.</p><p>MEGAN MCGRATH, BUCKINGHAM RESEARCH GROUP: I think lower rates are helping. Inventory is going up a little, but that`s actually not necessarily a bad thing. We`ve had really low levels of inventory for a long time, and I think that`s kept some buyers out of the market.</p><p>OLICK: While lower rates do help reduce monthly payments, the reasons behind low rates, that is a deepening trade war with China and Mexico and a weakening economy are more concerning, and consumers don`t want to see trouble in the economy when they`re about to make their biggest investment, that is buying a home.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, ever wonder what an $80 million penthouse looks like? Well, we`ll take you inside.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And finally tonight, call it the lifestyles of the very rich and famous, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos is reportedly buying three adjoining New York City apartments for about $80 million. The deal is the priciest ever for a Manhattan neighborhood south of 42nd street.</p><p>Robert Frank is back to take us on a tour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIKKI FIELD, SOTHEBY`S INTERNATIONAL REALTY: When you step off the elevator, what is your first experience? Size does matter.</p><p>FRANK: You`re getting an exclusive look inside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos` brand-new penthouse. Before the richest man in the world paid $80 million for this unit, plus the two apartments below, CNBC got an exclusive tour with broker Nikki Field. The sprawling 10,000 square foot penthouse alone has five bedrooms including a massive, seven-room master suite.</p><p>FIELD: The master bathroom has a priceless view of the Empire State Building from the master tub.</p><p>FRANK: When we toured it, the master was furnished with a $5,000 Bentley dog bed. One level up is the sunlit lounge. Just past the $23,000 glass foosball table is a 5,000 square foot wrap around terrace, a private elevator to the third level reveals another lounge, plus even more outdoor space.</p><p>FIELD: This is what we refer to as view envy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Before we go, let`s take a look at final day`s numbers on Wall Street.

Amazon`s Jeff Bezos is reportedly buying three Fifth Avenue condos and we were able to take our cameras inside.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Wednesday, June 5th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>Well, it was another rally day on Wall Street today.  The Dow and the S&amp;P have now recorded their best two-day gains since January.  Enthusiasm from yesterday carried over to today as investors appeared even more confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates some time this year.  Tech rates rose, so did the interest rate sensitive utility and real estate sectors.</p><p>And with U.S. and Mexican officials talking today, some of the concerns over trade that have rattled investors last week were put in the backburner and we`ll have more on that in just a few minutes.</p><p>In the meantime, the Dow gained another 207 points as you see to 25,539, the Nasdaq was up 48 and the S&amp;P added 22.</p><p>HERERA:  And stocks rose despite mixed reports on the economy.  Job creation in the private sector hit a nine-year low.  According to the payroll processor ADP, businesses added just 27,000 jobs in May.  The forecasts were for 175,000.</p><p>A separate report, however, points to a strengthening services sector which makes up the bulk of economic activity.  The Institute for Supply Management reports an uptick in activity helped by gains in new orders and that pickup in activity was echoed by the Federal Reserve`s Beige Book which is an anecdotal look at the economy across the country.</p><p>Ylan Mui reports tonight from the Central Bank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Reserve said that economic activity was modest this spring and that`s a little bit better than the preceding period.  Almost all 12 Fed districts reported at least some economic growth and some even enjoyed moderate gains.  Only one district, St. Louis, said that economic activity was unchanged.</p><p>Nationally, employment was about the same as last time.  Most districts reported modest to moderate job growth, but the tight labor market remains a constraint.  The Fed did find there was increasing wage pressure and improved benefits across a range of occupations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Fed said prices rose at a modest pace and as for tariffs and trade uncertainty, there were a lot of interesting anecdotes out of Boston and Dallas in particular.  In Boston, the report called out Huawei and the impact on semiconductor firms.  It also said that trade uncertainty is causing delays of new models in the auto industry.</p><p>Meanwhile, over in Dallas manufacturers, retailers and the service sector, they all pointed to tariffs as concerns for price increases and for demand.  And some companies said that long delays at the Mexican border were adding to their transportation costs.  Overall, consumer spending was generally positive and real estate and loan demand, they both pointed toward growth.</p><p>The Fed said that the outlook for the coming months was modest and positive, however, I will point out that that forecast is made before the recent flare-up with Mexico.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And while some economists say the risk of recession is growing.  Not every state can afford one.</p><p>Robert Frank explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A report from Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) found that while most states are prepared for a recession, two of them would face a budget crisis and be forced to cut costs or raise taxes.  Those two states, you guessed it, are Illinois and New Jersey.  Report looked at how much revenue would likely drop in each state in the downturn and whether they had enough reserves to fill the gap.</p><p>Now, Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) warned that even a mild downturn could be damaging to some states in the 2008 crisis, since states have become a lot more reliant on the personal income tax and the income tax is more reliant on the top 1 percent, and the incomes to that 1 percent are the most volatile.  But the biggest factor is pension liabilities, which for Illinois, would be six times its total tax revenues in the next recession.  New Jersey`s would be more than three times revenues, which means that for affluent residents of those states and probably Connecticut, too, taxes will go up.</p><p>Now, politicians and tax experts say these states missed an opportunity to save during the good times.</p><p>EVAN BAYH (D), FORMER INDIANA SENATOR:  Put some away in the rainy day fund and fully fund your pension so when tough times come along, you`re prepared for that.  Politically, the temptation is on to just let the party roll when times are good.</p><p>FRANK:  Instead, the new governor of Illinois is already pushing to eliminate the state`s flat tax with a progressive income tax where the wealthy pay a higher rate, and New Jersey`s Governor Phil Murphy insisting on a millionaire`s tax which the legislature is fighting.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, from recession fears to mixed economic data, to the call for interest rate cuts and just where does the economy stand right now?</p><p>Joining us to talk about that is Craig Dismuke.  He is the chief economist at Vining Sparks.</p><p>Welcome back, Craig.  Nice to see you again.</p><p>CRAIG DISMUKE, VINING SPARKS CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Hey, good evening, Sue.</p><p>HERERA:  You know, there are a lot of different opinions floating out there about where we are economically, but you fall in the camp of fundamentally stable, why?</p><p>DISMUKE:  Well, I think you look at the consumer, the consumer`s been in a good position.  And we see the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent and we`ve seen the wage growth above 3 percent now.  The consumer debt load isn`t too onerous in this cycle.</p><p>And I think that`s the basis for this stable economy and business investment is positive, and we see some weakness and we`re starting to see some growing concerns, obviously, with the trade uncertainty that`s creeping in.  But I think, today, I was most encouraged by the ISM number and the fact that it didn`t plunge -- did actually bounce a little bit.  That was an encouraging number to us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But having said all that, though, you still -- you believe the Fed will cut rates this year.  Why?</p><p>DISMUKE:  Well, for a couple of reasons.  You know, the trade talks with China have deteriorated and they`ve more so than we expected coming into the year.  And so, I think that will start to feed into the real data.  I think you`ll start to see some weaker growth.</p><p>On top of that, you`ve got these tariffs that have been added to Mexico.  That creates a whole new level of uncertainty for business owners in the U.S.  You have inflation that`s running below the Fed`s target, down at 1.6 percent right now.  The Fed`s talking about a new approach to the targeting and you`ll have to prove that you`re committed to that.  So, I think that`s going to put them in a position to be more dovish.</p><p>And then the last thing is the market has priced this in, and the markets are expecting a rate cut and that`s what we see in the bond market and if you don`t, if the Fed were not to cut rates in the second half of the year, it risks creating another scenario like we saw last December where the markets were disappointed in monetary policy.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes, it`s kind of a vicious circle, is it not?</p><p>DISMUKE:  It is.</p><p>HERERA:  I mean, if they cut, it`s because the economy is weak and if they don`t cut, then the market gets upset and the economy may weaken and confidence may suffer.</p><p>DISMUKE:  Absolutely.  And I think to some degree that`s where we are now and the markets are expecting -- the nice thing for the Fed right now is like we look at previous cycles going back to 1998.  We don`t have a lot of inflation right now.  And in fact, it`s below their target and it gives them the ability to be patient and to cut rates 25 or 50 basis points and underneath the purview of their mandate and try to boost growth a little bit and stimulate things in the middle of all of this uncertainty.</p><p>HERERA:  Craig, thank you so much.  Craig Dismuke with Vining Sparks.</p><p>DISMUKE:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meantime, oil prices are now in bear market territory, meaning that they have fallen more than 20 percent since their most recent peak in late April.  A government report today showed an unexpected surge in stockpiles of crude.  Prices were already under pressure because of fears of slowing global growth, and this is the third bear market for U.S. oil since the start of 2017, and today`s close is its lowest price since January.  Domestic crude settled down more than 3 percent to around $51 a barrel.</p><p>HERERA:  The International Monetary Fund warns that a trade war could wipe $455 billion off of global growth next year.  The IMF report said that the most recent U.S.-China tariffs could further reduce investment and productivity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTINE LAGARDE, IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR:  Some of the risks that we had identified back a couple of months ago have actually become materializing.  One of the ricks that we have identified is the risks associated with trade tensions and two months ago, we said be very careful what you are doing with this major growth engine that is trade because anything that breaks on trade such as tariffs, such as non-tariff barriers is going to actually be a break on growth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  For some perspective, the estimated decline in GDP would be larger than South Africa`s economy.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And a number of companies today cited the impact of tariffs in their earnings reports.  For example, bourbon maker Brown Forman (NYSE:BF.A) says that the trade standoff will drag sales growth down by a percentage point for the entire year.  American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE:AEO) warn that if tariffs are expanded to apparel, its financial results would take a hit.</p><p>And Campbell`s Soup put it this way, it said that if retaliatory tariffs with Canada would be avoided, a significant cost would be eliminated.</p><p>HERERA:  A delegation from Mexico were in Washington today, hoping to avert new tariffs that are scheduled to go into effect next week.</p><p>Kayla Tausche is at the White House for us tonight.</p><p>Good evening, Kayla.</p><p>What does the administration want in these negotiations?</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the White House, Sue, has left the negotiations open and the demands open.  They said that they want Mexico to substantially stop the flow of migrants and drugs into the United States, but they haven`t exactly said what the number is that they want.  They want Mexico to reinforce its border with Guatemala and they also want Mexico to consider a proposal to become a safe third country.</p><p>That means that Mexico would have to accept all asylum seekers coming through from Central America instead of the United States, but Mexico so far has called that last one a red line.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  What are the Mexicans offering?  I mean, they came with a list of their own of demands and offers.  Did you get a sense of what they are?</p><p>TAUSCHE:  Well, we mentioned that they are not willing to accept the U.S. proposal to accept Central American refugees.  That being said, they are, according to \"Reuters\" proposing a marshal plan for the rebuilding of Central America.  They also are planning to propose a diversion of some funds from the State Department program from 2008 that was to combat drug and human trafficking, and we`ll see exactly what the White House says about where those proposals stand right now.</p><p>HERERA:  So do you have a sense of how likely it is that we will get a deal?</p><p>TAUSCHE:  Well, I think, Sue, for today, the prospect of a deal is low.  We know the president likes to make his own deals and not only is he traveling overseas this week, but many key members of his immigration policy team, Jared Kushner, Stephen Miller, John Bolton, the national security adviser, all of those officials are abroad with the president and he has a high-level delegation on his behalf, but it`s expected that the president will want to do this deal himself.</p><p>HERERA:  We will be watching.</p><p>Thank you, Kayla.  Kayla Tausche at the White House.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Cannabis company Cronos Group was upgraded to buy from underperform at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch today.  The analyst says that Cronos is likely nearing a launch here in the U.S.  Price target now $20.  Shares rose 10 percent to $15.99.</p><p>Pivotal Software was downgraded to neutral from outperform at Wedbush.  The analyst calls the company`s quarterly results a train wreck and described its deferred revenue and billings numbers as disastrous.  And the price target is $15, and the stock itself was a disaster, down 41 percent today to $10.89.</p><p>And Roku was upgraded to buy from neutral at Guggenheim.  The analyst says the advertising on its streaming platform is becoming more profitable now.  So, the price target is $119.  The stock rose more than 8.5 percent today to $101.71.</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, as big tech power grows, so does its spending in Washington.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  As people spend more time online companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are becoming more powerful.</p><p>And as Julia Boorstin tells us, new reports show just how dominant they`ve become.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  With new antitrust scrutiny looming for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and the other tech giants, two new reports show the trends behind their growing power.  For the first time ever, American adults will spend more time using their mobile devices daily, three hours and 43 minutes than they do watching TV.  That`s according to eMarketer, with mobile time expected to continue to replace TV time in coming years.</p><p>The U.S. internet ad market, the largest, surpassing $100 billion for the first time this year, according to a new PWC study.  And Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) dominated.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with 37 percent market share and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with 22 percent.</p><p>TIM LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS:  What this is all about is data and advertising, and if advertising keeps going up and the secular tailwinds of people moving to online advertising and advertising on social media continue to grow, they`re just going to see maybe a little bit of, maybe, tamped down earnings over the last few years, but they`re still in the sweet spot.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  The question is whether the Federal Trade Commission which will oversee antitrust in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will find that Facebook`s dominant over social, it also owns Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, erodes the competitive environment.</p><p>BRIAN WHITE, MONESS, CRESPI, HARDT &amp; CO.:  I do look at this group and I do think there is a reason for increased regulation and I do think there is the possibility for breakup and when I look at the companies most at risk, it`s Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which if they were ever broken up, their stock prices in my view will be much, much higher.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Now, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) doesn`t dominate everything.  The smart speaker industry is booming and expected to spawn a massive new ad business with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the leaders there, Facebook`s Portal is just a small player which Mark Zuckerberg might point to is a sign that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) doesn`t deserve antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Plus, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google`s dominance hasn`t hampered Amazon`s ability to make gains, while Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook`s market shares are relatively steady, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has grown to nearly 9 percent in the U.S. digital ad market this year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And as big tech power grows, so does scrutiny from Washington and that has led most of these companies to spend an awful lot of money on lobbying.</p><p>Aditi Roy has that part of the story for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Alphabet spent more than $20 million on lobbying last year.  That`s more than any other U.S. company.  In fact, for the past two years, the search giant has topped the list of spenders outranking traditional front-runners like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T).</p><p>It wasn`t always that way.  Back in 2009, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) spent just $4 million on lobbying, but that number started to climb in 2011 and `12, just as it started facing more regulatory heat.  In 2012, Alphabet paid $22 million in fines to settle FTC charges to privacy.  In 2013, the company agreed to change its business practices following concerns that those practices were stifling competition.</p><p>Over the last decade, spending on lobbying has gone up 500 percent.  It`s not just Alphabet.  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ranked among the top as well.</p><p>Those three companies each spent on double digits on issues ranging from competition to privacy.  That`s more than the amount Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) spent leading up to its trial with the DOJ two decades ago, but it`s unclear what effect it will have on influencing government regulation.</p><p>KEN AULETTA, NEW YORKER MAGAZINE:  More effect than they had before, but the problem is policies and practices are raising questions about whether they should be regulated in some way.</p><p>ROY:  Those questions resurfaced when European regulators took antitrust action against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) which resulted in fines of nearly $10 billion.  Industry experts say those actions might have stepped up pressure on U.S. regulators who are now looking at their practices of Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also putting resources into the E.U. regulatory challenges, announcing today it has appealed the $1.7 billion E.U. fine for March for stifling competition in the online advertising industry.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  China slaps a fine on Ford and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>In the latest ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, Chinese regulators have fined Ford`s main joint venture in China nearly $24 million for setting minimum retail prices on its cars which the regulator said restricts competition.  Ford`s shares fell more than 1 percent to $9.78.</p><p>Boeing (NYSE:BA) is reportedly in talks with China for one of its largest orders of wide-body jets.  Bloomberg says the airline maker is discussing orders for as many as 100 twin-aisle jets.  The 787 Dreamliners and the 777X planes which is Boeing`s newest long-range aircraft.  The report did say no deal is imminent due to the trade war, but Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose more than 1 percent to $348.75.</p><p>And Lab Corp said that more than 7.5 million of its customers may have been impacted by a data breach.  The blood testing provider said it was the same breach that rival Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) said may have affected 12 million of its patients.  Nonetheless, Lab Corp was up a fraction to $166.84.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  GIII Apparel reported better than expected earnings, but it did miss revenue expectations.  The company has an array of brands that include Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY, but it already had started raising prices in an effort to offset Chinese tariffs.  That stock fell more than 9 percent today to $24.51.</p><p>After the bell, online clothing services Stitch Fix topped expectations and saw an increase in its active clients.  The news sent the stock initially higher after-hours, but they did close the regular session down more than 2 percent to $23.57.</p><p>Also after the bell, Cloudera`s revenue and outlook came in below Wall Street`s expectations.  The cloud software company also reported that its CEO is stepping down and retiring and it all sent the stock initially lower after-hours on top of a more than 3 percent decline during the regular session today.  It closed at $8.80.</p><p>HERERA:  As we`ve been reporting, mortgage rates have fallen pretty dramatically over the last few weeks, hitting its lowest levels in more than a year.  But curiously enough, demand for mortgages is not heating up.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mortgage rates are down dramatically, but apparently not low enough to impress today`s homebuyers who are still up against very high prices.  Total mortgage application volume increased 1.5 percent last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, but the gains were driven by refinancing.  The average rate on the 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances fell to 4.23 percent from 4.33 percent by the end of last week.  That`s for loans with a 20 percent down payment, and they`re even lower this week.</p><p>With that savings, refinance volume rose 6 percent from the previous week, and was nearly 33 percent higher than the same week a year ago, when interest rates were significantly higher.  Refinances are particularly rate-sensitive and the drop in rates added 2 million more borrowers to the pool of those who could benefit from a refi, according to Black Knight.</p><p>But mortgage applications to buy a home fell 2 percent for the week and were barely 0.5 percent higher than the same one year ago.  So, really flat.</p><p>MEGAN MCGRATH, BUCKINGHAM RESEARCH GROUP:  I think lower rates are helping.  Inventory is going up a little, but that`s actually not necessarily a bad thing.  We`ve had really low levels of inventory for a long time, and I think that`s kept some buyers out of the market.</p><p>OLICK:  While lower rates do help reduce monthly payments, the reasons behind low rates, that is a deepening trade war with China and Mexico and a weakening economy are more concerning, and consumers don`t want to see trouble in the economy when they`re about to make their biggest investment, that is buying a home.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, ever wonder what an $80 million penthouse looks like?  Well, we`ll take you inside.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And finally tonight, call it the lifestyles of the very rich and famous, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos is reportedly buying three adjoining New York City apartments for about $80 million.  The deal is the priciest ever for a Manhattan neighborhood south of 42nd street.</p><p>Robert Frank is back to take us on a tour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIKKI FIELD, SOTHEBY`S INTERNATIONAL REALTY:  When you step off the elevator, what is your first experience?  Size does matter.</p><p>FRANK:  You`re getting an exclusive look inside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos` brand-new penthouse.  Before the richest man in the world paid $80 million for this unit, plus the two apartments below, CNBC got an exclusive tour with broker Nikki Field.  The sprawling 10,000 square foot penthouse alone has five bedrooms including a massive, seven-room master suite.</p><p>FIELD:  The master bathroom has a priceless view of the Empire State Building from the master tub.</p><p>FRANK:  When we toured it, the master was furnished with a $5,000 Bentley dog bed.  One level up is the sunlit lounge.  Just past the $23,000 glass foosball table is a 5,000 square foot wrap around terrace, a private elevator to the third level reveals another lounge, plus even more outdoor space.</p><p>FIELD:  This is what we refer to as view envy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, let`s take a look at final day`s numbers on Wall Street.  The Dow gained 207 points, the Nasdaq was up 48, and the S&amp;P 500 added 22.</p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for watching.</p><p>We`d like to remind you that this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Thank you very much for that support, by the way.</p><p>Have a great evening.

Fewer jobs were created last month than expected, but stocks took off despite the surprisingly low number.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Setting the tone. China`s president changes his language when talking about trade, a reversal from all of the recent, harsh rhetoric.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: House hunters. Flippers are getting help from an unexpected source -- Uber drivers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June 7th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>The stock market soared again today ending a week-long rebound rally that was fueled by hopes that the Federal Reserve is going cut interest rates sooner rather than later. Also lifting the market was hope that tariffs on all those Mexican imports into the U.S. scheduled to go into effect on Monday can be averted.</p><p>Mix it together, stocks had their best week of the year this week. Today, the Dow was up 263 points, up to 25,983. The Nasdaq added 126, the S&amp;P was up 29. And for the week, all of the major averages saw solid gains.</p><p>HERERA: That big lift in the stock market, believe it or not, was driven by a lousy jobs report. Employers tapped the brakes on hiring last month potentially signaling a slowdown in the 10-year economic expansion which could, in turn, prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.</p><p>And as we all know, low interest rates have been a pillar of support for the bull market.</p><p>Steve Liesman has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The May jobs report missing the mark by a long way and raising concerns about the economic outlook and one of the trade wars hurting the jobs market already. Just 75,000 jobs created in May, Wall Street had been forecasting 180,000. The unemployment rate remained low and unchanged at 3.6 percent, but wage growth grows a lukewarm 0.2 percent and downward revisions to the job growth in the prior two months reduced it by 75,000 and that equaled all of the jobs created in May.</p><p>On Wall Street, all of the talk focused on whether the trade war was dragging down the job market.</p><p>Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) wrote: This report will add to evidence gathered ahead of the June Fed meeting showing that economic policy uncertainty may be increasingly weighing on growth prospects.</p><p>JAN HATZIUS, GOLDMAN SACHS CHIEF ECONOMIST: I think it raises the question about whether the trade uncertainty was already having some impact on the economy, you know, prior to the latest escalation as far as Mexico is concerned. This, you know, came after the original tweets about China, and I do think it raises that question.</p><p>LIESMAN: The details of the report show government shed 15,000 jobs and these were mostly state and local education workers. Retail, which has been losing lots of jobs every month, lost another 8,000, and manufacturing which had been strong, grew a tepid 4,000.</p><p>The weak reports raising the prospect that the Federal Reserve will be cutting interest rates and cutting them soon. The chance of a Fed rate cut for July now around 80 percent in the Fed funds futures market, and the market is now banking on multiple Fed rate cuts this year.</p><p>It`s an aggressive call, one that may only hit the mark if the jobs report keeps missing the mark.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And joining us to talk more about the jobs report today and what it may mean for the Fed, Satyam Panday is senior U.S. economist at S&amp;P.</p><p>Good to see you again. Welcome back.</p><p>SATYAM PANDAY, S&amp;P SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST: Thank you for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`ll cut to the chase. Do you think the Fed is going to cut rates maybe as early as July?</p><p>PANDAY: Well, was there a report out today. It didn`t really help establishing any confidence into raising rates. So the odds of cutting rates have moved up, but I wouldn`t go so far as calling it in July, though -- maybe perhaps in September or for a later date in September. But yes, the odds of a rate cut has moved up.</p><p>HERERA: The manufacturing number was especially weak and the Fed has said in the past that they are watching manufacturing and the impact from all of these global trade tensions and weaker global growth.</p><p>How closely are they going to be scrutinizing the details of that?</p><p>PANDAY: I think this is the key point here. How much of a spill over effect from the industrial sector is going to seep into the much bigger service sector of the economy. We have seen manufacturing being -- you know, decelerating over the year and it seems like from the labor report that came out today, we haven`t really added as many jobs as we had last year.</p><p>So, the Fed will be looking through it very carefully, both the activity numbers and the labor markets in manufacturing. And the new tariffs, the escalation, and the potential of it certainly doesn`t help in the outlook of manufacturing.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The Mexican tariffs aside, we still have Chinese tariffs in place, and there`s no sign that they`re going to end any time soon. That can be inflationary. Do you see much in the way of inflation coming our way?</p><p>PANDAY: Well, there are two ways to look at it. You know, you may see a one-time bump up in the inflation numbers if these tariffs were to go through at a 25 percent rate, that, you know, they have been talking about. But at the same time if it really affects the disposable income of a regular consumer, then the demand side effect might actually hold back the inflationary pressure.</p><p>So, net-net, it seems like inflation is really not moving up as fast to the 2 percent growth rate that the Fed had anticipated earlier in the year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very good.</p><p>Satyam Panday, again, with the S&amp;P -- thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>PANDAY: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Chinese President Xi and Russian President Putin presented a unified economic front during a conference in St. Petersburg. As we reported yesterday, the two countries have been coming together to sign deals and today, another twist. And it had to do with President Xi`s tone when it comes to trade with the U.S.</p><p>Geoff Cutmore is there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GEOFF CUTMORE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This was an opportunity to deepen ties and look stronger together, the building of an alliance in the face of tension with the United States.</p><p>President Putin used his keynote address here to criticize the United States` position on Huawei, suggesting that`s the beginning of a tech war. He also felt that the U.S. had overextended its legal authority and it`s important to note that one of the deals done here among the $20 billion worth signed was with Huawei to bring 5G technology to the Russian market.</p><p>President Xi also spoke while on the stage here at St. Petersburg, but I would say his language on trade was very measured, perhaps an indication that he doesn`t want to use a venue like this to upset the delicate, ongoing trade negotiations.</p><p>And the reality is, of course, that of all of the talk in St. Petersburg, the size of trade between Russia and China is significantly smaller than that done between the U.S. and China, perhaps the reason why President Xi`s language was cautious and ultimately he described both President Putin and President Trump as his friend.</p><p>This is Jeff Cutmore in St. Petersburg, for the NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And now to another issue that affects investors, that would be the capital gains tax. Billionaire hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller said today he doesn`t have a problem with the higher capital gains and he explained why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STANLEY DRUCKENMILLER, DUQUESNE FAMILY OFFICE: I don`t really think capital gains promote investment as much as advertised out there and it`s hard for me to believe that Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos would have said, oh, my god, the capital gains is going to be 35 percent, I`m not going to try to fund Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). So, I don`t have a problem with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Druckenmiller also said that ongoing trade tensions could potentially kill the market`s animal spirits.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Exelon (NYSE:EXC) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The analyst cites the company`s free cash flow and calls the stock a top utility idea. The price target is $52. Despite, though, the stock fell a fraction to $49.95.</p><p>Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel Nicolaus. The analyst says Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) will benefit as business activity increases outside of North America. The price target is $50. The stock was up 1.5 percent to $35.60.</p><p>And the arts and crafts retailer Michael`s was downgraded to neutral from outperform at Credit Suisse. The analyst cites a softer outlook and uncertainty regarding the impact of tariffs. The price target is $11. The stock fell slightly to $8.17.</p><p>GRIFFETH: As we have been reporting, big tech`s power and influence is facing scrutiny in Washington these days, with some calling for breakups, others calling for more regulation. Well, tonight, we take a closer look at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and what officials may be eyeing in that company.</p><p>Aditi Roy is in San Francisco for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In the two decades Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been in existence, it`s climbed up the ranks of top U.S. companies, raking in more than $130 billion worth of revenue last year. Now, its dominance could be threatened as the company faces a government antitrust probe.</p><p>RICHARD HAMILTON, FORMER DOJ ANTITRUST ATTORNEY: The United States Department of Justice and particularly the Antitrust Division, they don`t deal with argument. They deal with evidence.</p><p>ROY: In order to prove an antitrust case against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), the company would have to prove that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) owns at least 30 percent or 40 percent of the relevant market. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) owns nearly 90 percent of the search market, according to Satistica, and about three quarters of search ad sales according to eMarketer.</p><p>The DOJ would also have to show that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) preempts the competition by optimizing platforms like search. That`s precisely what some third party competitors of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) assert. For years, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman has been particularly vigilant against the company, saying Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) squeezes out the competition by favoring its own web offerings by placing them at the top of search results.</p><p>Trip Adviser CEO Stephen Kaufer also says in a statement that the company remains concerned about Google`s practices in the U.S., the E.U., and the world. Adding: We welcome any renewed interest by U.S. regulators into Google`s anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>And Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Chair Barry Diller also spoke out about Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) last fall.</p><p>BARRY DILLER, EXPEDIA GROUP CHAIRMAN: Whenever you have that kind of control over the world that can`t go any place else, to get their stuff to a consumer, you also have to -- you -- inevitably, all monopolies behave the same and you`ve got to have regulation of what they do once they get to that stage.</p><p>ROY: Legal experts say the arguments the third parties are making could carry a great deal of weight if they could prove them in testimony or contracts.</p><p>HAMILTON: They`re going to look at what the contracts show. Do the contracts limit? Do they prohibit? Do they foreclose opportunities in the markets for either customers that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is dealing with, or for other market participants? And the devil is in the contracts themselves.</p><p>ROY: Insiders also say the European Union`s investigation into Alphabet could also help U.S. investigators by providing a framework for their arguments.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, our market monitor goes bargain hunting.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Walmart wants to take home delivery a step further. The world`s largest retailer is rolling out a new program where employees deliver fresh groceries right to your refrigerator. Shares got a lift today along with the broader market.</p><p>We should point out, though, that when Walmart announces new initiatives like this, many of them don`t last very long or they don`t go very far.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has our story in Fayetteville, Arkansas, tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Walmart Shareholders Week is an annual tradition in northwest Arkansas. Executives, board members, employers and media from around the world, and this year, even presidential candidate Bernie Sanders come to the retailer`s home turf to vote on shareholder business, give the latest corporate updates, and celebrate the year`s accomplishments.</p><p>In recent years, Walmart has also used the event to announce new e-commerce test programs. This year, it`s Walmart in-home delivery where store employees will deliver online grocery sword orders directly into shoppers` fridges, available for 1 million shoppers in St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Vero Beach, Florida, this fall.</p><p>MARC LORE, WALMART U.S. E-COMMERCE CEO: We`ll come in and install the lock and give you a four-digit unique code only used during certain specified times that you allow. We have our associates, the W-2 employees that have been with Walmart for more than a year. We have a camera that`s on their vest when they walk in and customers can actually watch on their app and come into their home, put the stuff into their fridge, and then leave.</p><p>REAGAN: The in-home delivery announcement is grabbing a lot of attention, just like the other past Walmart Shareholders Weeks` announcement, but they haven`t all ended up making a material difference to the business.</p><p>At the 2016 shareholder event, the retailer announced a partnership with Uber and Lyft, testing grocery delivery in Denver and Phoenix. Two years later, Postmates and DoorDash were added.</p><p>By May 2018, Walmart ended its partnership with Uber and Lyft, though it still uses other crowdsource delivery partners. At shareholders 2017, Walmart said it was testing store employees delivering online orders on their way home from work in New Jersey and Arkansas, through the use of a proprietary app. Around six months later, it quietly ended that program.</p><p>Last year, Walmart launched text message shopping concierge service JetBlack in New York City. It is ongoing and there`s a wait list, but still only in New York City.</p><p>LORE: We`ve been trying a lot of new things lately. Our goal isn`t to have a perfect track record. It`s to make sure we`re moving fast, taking smart risks. We want to continually learn, adapt and push the limit of what`s possible. At the end of the day, everything we`re doing adds up to something really special.</p><p>REAGAN: So while in-home delivery is Walmart`s latest risk, it remains to be seen if it will pay a material reward.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan in Fayetteville, Arkansas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: A new chapter for Barnes &amp; Noble (NYSE:NE) (NYSE:BKS), and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The company has been acquired by hedge fund Elliott Advisers for $683 million. The nation`s largest bookstore chain has been struggling for the past five years, losing more than $1 billion in market value. Elliott recently bought Britain`s largest bookseller Waterstones as well. The shares rose more than 11 percent to $6.62.</p><p>Norwegian Cruise Line said it would be cutting its full-year earnings outlook due to the impact of the Trump administration`s ban on cruises visiting Cuba. Cruise operators are modifying their itineraries and would offer substantial discounts to guests to remain on their booked cruises despite the ban, but the shares were up more than 1 percent today to $52.59.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Online fashion retailer revolve group soared in its trading debut today. This company focuses on millennial customers and attracts many of them through social media. Priced at shares of $18 and they closed at $34. That would be up nearly 89 percent in today`s debut.</p><p>Pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has hired Novartis executive Paul Hudson as its new CEO. Sanofi`s current CEO Olivier Brandicourt is retiring in September. Shares rose more than 5 percent today to $44.21.</p><p>HERERA: It is time now for our weekly market monitor who likes stocks with dividend yields. He has names that he says are severely undervalued in this low interest rate environment.</p><p>Joining us now is Jordan Posner. He`s senior portfolio manager at Matrix Asset Advisers.</p><p>Jordan, welcome back. Nice to have you here.</p><p>JORDAN POSNER, MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS SR. PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Great to be back.</p><p>HERERA: You`re a value investor, bottoms up process and you like value dividends.</p><p>So, let`s start with your first pick which is CVS (NYSE:CVS) Health and, of course, their acquisition of Aetna (NYSE:AET), you say, is kind of a game changer.</p><p>POSNER: Well, it really has reconfigured business to be a much broader player. Just earlier this week, on Wednesday, they had an investor day when they rolled out a lot of the strategy and the financial guidance for that business overall, and I think it was pretty well-received and they`re transforming the healthcare business with a concept called health hubs which is really taking space in many of their stores and converting them to an urgent care type of clinic, but with more services than they can use. We think the stock is modestly valued at less than eight times earnings and has the yield of over 3.5 percent.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Home Depot (NYSE:HD), I was looking at a longer term chart of this company. Now, you`re looking for value, but a few years ago, this was a $75 stock. Today, it`s a $200 stock. There`s still value in there?</p><p>POSNER: There certainly is. The stock is actually down from its high within the last year, and what`s happened there is that the housings market pressure from last year depressed some of their results, drove the stock down and management there is very focused on shareholders at the lower interest rate environment and we expect that demand for housing and home improvement should do much better.</p><p>The stock is certainly more expensive than some. It trades above a market multiple under 18 times, but still pays the 2.8 percent yield. They`re repurchasing stock and we`ll increase that dividend going forward.</p><p>HERERA: Your next pick a really nice dividend, 6.4 percent in terms of its yield, and that is AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). You`re saying basically that they are a key player with 5G coming up, but also the street is not really appreciating that Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) deal that they did.</p><p>POSNER: Right. Now, of course, was a big marquee deal that got a lot of attention and people kind of thought of it as, what could they do with it other than destroy the franchise? And actually, although there`s been some management change there, the business seems to be operating quite well and generating a lot of free cash and contribution to the company.</p><p>Now, with that and the HBO business and the Turner businesses together, they`re going to be launching an over-the-top service. We think that that actually has the potential to be valuable. The stock trades at a very low valuation under nine times and the core wireless business is a terrific franchise and we think they can continue to operate very well.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, Jordan, thank you so much. Jordan Posner with Matrix Asset Advisers.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, they`re called drive-by flippers. They`re part of America`s changing workforce.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: In today`s tight and pricey housing market, home flipping has been fizzling. The business is no longer as lucrative as it once was, but for those who are still in the game, a new strategy is taking shape and it relies on the shared economy. You`re going to love this.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: David Amanzur (ph) is a part-time Uber driver in D.C., and part of the time he`s driving, he`s scouting homes for an investor.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course, you have somewhat of a tree or a limb that may have fallen or something growing up there.</p><p>OLICK: So, this says to you, this could be an opportunity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This could be an opportunity.</p><p>OLICK: An opportunity for Daniel Digiacomo, an investor who hired him to scout properties. Digiacomo has been flipping homes for a decade but has never seen the market this tough.</p><p>DANIEL DIGIACOMO, INVESTOR: As the prices are as high as they are now, the margins on our flips are pretty slim.</p><p>OLICK: Nationwide, flippers saw an average return on their investment of about 39 percent in the first quarter of this year, down from 42.5 percent in the previous quarter and nearly 49 percent a year ago, the lowest return in eight years, according to Atom Data Solutions.</p><p>The number of flips are down 8 percent annually so the stakes are up, precisely why Digiacomo has 150 drivers scouring the streets for opportunities.</p><p>DIGIACOMO: The best deals are always the deal that we put our eyes on and I can`t put miles on every single deal. So, Uber drivers are out there, they`re looking at kinds of neighborhoods. They`re putting their eyes on many houses.</p><p>OLICK: Digiacomo used to go to options, but he says there are too many bidders there, driving prices even higher. As for listings, low mortgage rates have too many regular buyers competing with him, that`s why he`ll pay a driver $500 for a lead that turns into a seal.</p><p>DIGIACOMO: This, that 150 group has put about 2,200 leads and we normally close a deal one per 100, or 150 leads.</p><p>OLICK: Amanzur who dabbles in real estate himself sees it as easy money because he knows what to look for.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Windows are broken. It`s not updated. You may see some exterior outside AC unit sticking out of the window. There`s tons of mail, overgrown grass.</p><p>OLICK: And when he finds one --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The property next door is a corner lot which is a great opportunity for investors.</p><p>OLICK: He just takes a picture on the special app that pin points the property and sends it to Digiacomo.</p><p>If it sells --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s 500 bucks and I just drove around.</p><p>OLICK: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick driving around Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And before we go, let`s take a look at the final day`s numbers on Wall Street. The Dow rose 263 points to 25,983, the Nasdaq added 126, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 29. It was a good week.</p><p>For the week, all of the major averages saw solid gains.</p><p>And that does it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera, thanks for watching.</p><p>We like to remind, this is the time of year your public television seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth and we thank you for your support.

And the sharp  move lower seems to come out of nowhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retirement rule.  A new one takes effect today and it could mean big  changes for your savings.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tipping point.  If you're in the market for a new house, a new report says  you might want to think twice.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June  9th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is  off tonight.  </p><p>The best performing sector of the year had one of its worst days in a  while.  After hitting a record early in the day, the mood shifted suddenly  and without warning.  And those same stocks that accounted for more than 40  percent of the S&amp;P 500's advance this year reversed course.  By the end of  the day, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet, Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) all lost 3 percent or more.  </p><p>In the end, it was a tale of two markets.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed at a record, up 89 points to 21,271.  The NASDAQ lost 113 points.   And the S&amp;P was off two.  </p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look at the hit the tech stocks took.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Finally, we got a  little volatility as some traders came forward to begin to question the  valuation of some of these big tech names.  So, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  and Alphabet, they were down about 3 to 5 percent today.  Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS), in a note this morning, made a very simple but important point.   These big tech names are traditionally cyclical growth stocks.  In other  words, they're volatile.  </p><p>But everyone has been acting like they're boring consumer staple stocks,  which is usually not volatile, and everybody has bought them aggressively  assuming they would go up with no risk at all.  They warned that the stocks  have gone up so much that the trend could quickly reverse.</p><p>And they're right, it's a good point.  And, in fact, that's exactly what  happened today, to all these the big names, as well as some of the big  semiconductor names that have also had big run-ups.  For example, Nvidia  and Advanced Micro.  </p><p>So, what does all this mean?  Well, it means kind of what it always means  on Wall Street.  When you have stocks that keep going up, it attracts a  whole other class of buyers.  </p><p>We call them momentum players.  And essentially these momentum players are  just along for the ride.  Then something fundamental happens, you have the  mildest of earnings or guidance disappointments, or in this case someone  with influence like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) writes something that says, you  know, fellas, this doesn't make too much sense, and you get a selloff that  suddenly accelerates.  </p><p>All right.  So, is this a cause for concern?  For the moment, no.  I think  it's a relief.  There are some signs traders are taking the money and  buying less-loved sectors like banks and energy stocks.  That would be a  healthy rotation using overbought tech stocks as a source of funds to buy  under-owned bank and energy names.  </p><p>So, the verdict so far: at least for the moment this does not appear the  start of an overall correction.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The election results in the United Kingdom could impact the single  biggest economic issue that that country faces -- Brexit.  </p><p>Wilfred Frost gave us the preliminary results last night.  He is back for  us tonight from London.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILFRED FROST, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Uncertainty struck  the United Kingdom overnight as the initial results from the general  election revealed the U.K. was headed for a hung parliament, where no party  wins a clear majority.  </p><p>The pound plunged in response and Theresa May's opponents called for her  resignation.  </p><p>JEREMY CORBYN, LABOUR PARTY LEADER:  The prime minister called for the  election because she wanted a mandate.  Well, the mandate she's got is lost  conservative seats, lost support, and lost confidence.  I would have  thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that  will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.  </p><p>FROST:  But as the final results emerged, Theresa May did win enough seats,  along with the help of the small Northern Irish DUP Party to return to  Downing Street.  </p><p>Prime minister, but her standing much diminished, as she failed to increase  her majority as planned.  </p><p>THERESA MAY, U.K. PRIME MINISTER:  I wanted to achieve a larger majority.   But that was not the result that we secured.  And I'm sorry for all those  candidates and hard working party workers who weren't successful, but also  particularly sorry for those colleagues who were MPs and ministers who  contributed so much to our country and who lost their seats and didn't  deserve to lose their seats.  And as I reflect on the results, I will  reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward.  </p><p>FROST:  The other big takeaway was the Brexit negotiations would begin as  planned in ten days' time, but with the U.K.'s negotiating team much  weakened by this grueling election.  That might explain why European  Council President Donald Tusk was so keen to get started. </p><p>In a letter to Theresa May today, he spoke of their shared responsibility  and named it an urgent task to begin negotiations.  He also reiterated the  March 2019 cutoff date.  He even expressed his congratulations on her  reappointment.  That line no doubt written with a wry smile on his face.  </p><p>The bottom line, May is weaker.  The U.K. is weaker.  The pound weaker as a  result.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Wilfred Frost, London.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Leaders of the House Intelligence Committee say they have asked  the White House counsel to see whether there are any records of the former  FBI director's conversations with the president.  The panel also asked  James Comey for his notes and memos of that same conversation.  </p><p>And in a fiery news conference, the president forcefully accused Mr. Comey  of not being completely truthful.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We were very, very happy and  frankly, James Comey confirmed lot of what I said.  And some of the things  that he said just weren't true.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The president also said he would be glad to state his case to the  special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.  </p><p>A consumer protection aimed at retirement advisers is set to go into effect  today, at least for now.  The Labor Department is still reviewing the  regulation and is expected to make some changes later.  </p><p>Kayla Tausche has more on the effect of the new rule.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The so-called  Fiduciary Rule keeps retirement advisers from favoring their commission- based products over their customers' interests.  </p><p>As of today, they have to abide by the spirit of the rule.  Large  brokerages have already made changes.  For instance, Merrill Lynch gave  customers a choice to move to a different platform or pay a fee.  Wells  Fargo (NYSE:WFC) offering fewer products.  UBS is changing broker  compensation to eliminate the conflict.  </p><p>Smaller broker deals have made big changes.  Ameriprise has dropped  hundreds of funds, and LPL Financial revamped its pricing.  Some  independent firms have frozen assets while the rule is under review.  </p><p>Clients are affected if their retirement account and 401ks are managed by  commission-based adviser or commission-based accounts.  Money managers may  ask (ph) customers to opt back into these accounts to ensure they actually  want to be in them.  </p><p>The Obama administration estimated the rule would save Americans $17  billion in fees.  But it will likely change again before a final January  deadline.  The Labor Department still reviewing it and the department has  38 political appointments vacant that will be important here.  </p><p>Asset managers also are traditionally regulated by the FCC.  That agency  will want a say in how it's written and enforced and the industry has  requested the agency's involvement too.  The wild card, how Congress  tackles large scale financial reform and if they decide to roll back the  rule completely.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche, New York.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Chris Carosa joins us now to discuss what that new fiduciary rule  as it stands now will mean for you.  He is founder and fiduciary expert at  Carosa Asset Management.  </p><p>Good to see you, Chris.  Welcome.  </p><p>CHRIS CAROSA, CAROSA ASSET MANAGEMENT FOUNDER:  Hi, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, bottom line this for me, what are consumers going to see and  investors going to see that will look or appear or be different?  </p><p>CAROSA:  Well, it's likely that they won't see anything dramatic right  away.  Over time, primarily those who are rolling over IRAs from their  existing retirement accounts will begin to see new language in the  agreements, which is called a best interest contract exemption.  And that  discloses to the new rollover that there may be an opportunity for the  provider to offer products that would normally contain what's called  conflict of interest fees.  </p><p>And this is a way for the client to sign off on that and allow them to do  it provided it's still in their best interests.  </p><p>HERERA:  Although it's not necessarily, it doesn't sound like it's written  in an easy way to understand.  </p><p>CAROSA:  Maybe, maybe not.  There's no really formal template for how this  language will appear.  My thinking is it will probably be maybe a paragraph  or two.  But that doesn't mean that's how it will be.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  What questions do investors need to ask, as this rule rolls  into effect?  As you say, we won't see the changes immediately, but as we  get closer to the final version and it does go into effect, what questions  should they be asking their financial fiduciary?  </p><p>CAROSA:  Remember, the actual name of the rule is the conflict of interest  rule.  And I think that's what investors should focus in on.  They should  ask their adviser, what types of fee arrangements do we have?  Are they  traditional conflict of interest fees such as commissions, 12B-1 fees or  revenue sharing?  </p><p>These are the type of fees, sometimes they're disclosed in the mutual fund  but not all times, because the SEC doesn't require a clear disclosure for  revenue sharing.  So, you've got to ask the adviser if that's the type of  fee that you're paying.  And then you might want to consider whether or not  that's the type of fee you want to pay, because you don't have to.  </p><p>HERERA:  And I assume that you need to ask those questions, because when  you look at your statements and when you look at your financial plan,  sometimes, it's a little bit difficult to find out where those fees and  those other exemptions are in the physical document.  </p><p>CAROSA:  That's true.  In 2012, the DOL came out with a rule called the  401(k) mutual fund fee disclosure which was supposed to address this.  But,  unfortunately, again, they didn't provide a template, so we have all  different forms of disclosure, which are often very difficult to read, even  for professionals.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, on that note, that means we'll have to have you back when  they finally finish it up and we get the final product.  </p><p>Chris, thank you very much.  </p><p>CAROSA:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  Chris Carosa with Carosa Asset Management.</p><p>Still ahead tonight, the 51st state?  Investors will be watching a key vote  this weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LESLIE PICKER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We spoke with  residents, investors, and government officials here in Puerto Rico about a  big statehood vote this Sunday.  We'll tell you all about it, coming up on  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  An historic vote in Puerto Rico this weekend.  One hundred years  after being granted U.S. citizenship, Puerto Ricans will vote on whether to  become the 51st state.  And it comes at a time of deep financial  uncertainty for the island.  </p><p>Leslie Picker is in San Juan.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PICKER:  Flags adorning the bright rows of colonial buildings underscore  the sentiment of statehood here in Puerto Rico.  Oftentimes, you'll find  the Puerto Rican flags next to American one, the blue part of the flag  matching.  But then you'll also see Puerto Rican flags by themselves, with  a lighter shade of blue.  That signifies independence.  </p><p>This question of status will be the focus of a vote taking place on Sunday.   Puerto Ricans will go to the polls to determine whether or not they want to  become a U.S. state, sovereign nation, or remain a commonwealth, which is  something in between.  </p><p>Puerto Rico has been in a recession for 10 years and is grappling with $120  billion of debt and unfunded pension liabilities, that caused it to seek  bankruptcy protection last month.  About 40 percent of U.S. municipal bond  funds have exposure to Puerto Rican bonds, with billions of dollars worth  of exposure.  </p><p>Tensions here are high.  Residents we spoke with said becoming a state  could solve their economic problems.  Others blame the U.S. for the mess on  the island and would prefer to keep their commonwealth status or seek  sovereignty.  </p><p>SOCORRO OLIVENCIA, PUERTO RICAN RESIDENT:  There is the feeling, you know,  that you can't trust that anymore.  That is very hard.  </p><p>PICKER:  And not everyone in the U.S. is in full support, wary that they  would have to take on the burden of a bankrupt municipality if Puerto Rico  votes for statehood.  But according to government officials on the island,  Vice President Mike Pence has pledged to support the Puerto Rican statehood  should residents vote that way.  </p><p>Governor Ricardo Rossello who campaigned on the promise of statehood before  winning election in November defended Puerto Rico's rights.  </p><p>RICARDO ANTONIO ROSSELLO, PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR:  We wouldn't want, you  know, a bailout.  I'm no fan of bailouts.  I think we need to assume  responsibility for what's going on here.  Statehood is an equal playing  field for U.S. citizens that reside on the island.  </p><p>PICKER:  Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but they don't have the same  access to benefits as those on the mainland.  While they can serve in the  military, they can't vote for their commander in chief.  The topic is so  important to elected officials here, they've spent $7 million on this  weekend's election, despite being bankrupt.  </p><p>The Justice Department was supposed to provide $2.5 million in exchange for  a say over the wording on the ballots.  But that money has yet to arrive.  </p><p>JENNIFER GONZALEZ-COLON, PUERTO RICO CONGRESSWOMAN:  This is not about the  money.  I mean, this is more than that.  So keep the money.  Let us express  ourselves.  That's what we're going to have on Sunday.  </p><p>PICKER:  Gonzalez is confident that residents will vote for statehood, but  it wouldn't be the first time.  Puerto Rico had a similar vote five years  ago.  But it's up to Congress to write a statute welcoming Puerto Rico to  becoming the 51st state.  </p><p>So far, there hasn't been willingness in Washington to do that.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Leslie Picker, San Juan, Puerto Rico.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And you can read more about what's at stake when Puerto Rico goes  to the polls on our website, NBR.com.  </p><p>The U.S. is mostly clear to provide unfair support to Boeing (NYSE:BA).   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The World Trade Organization rejected claims by the European Union and  Airbus that Boeing (NYSE:BA) had benefitted from billions of dollars of  illegal subsidies.  But it also ruled that the U.S. failed to eliminate a  tax break in a key state.  Both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus claimed victory  over that decision.  Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) were basically unchanged at  $190.03.  </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission staff is advising the agency to prepare a  lawsuit to block Walgreen's nearly $10 billion deal to buy Rite Aid  (NYSE:RAD).  That's according to a report by the trade publication \"Capital  Forum\".  Walgreen's initially bid for its smaller drugstore rival back in  2015.  Shares of Walgreen's dropped 48 cents to $80.99.  Shares of Rite Aid  (NYSE:RAD) plunged 15 percent to $3.  </p><p>Sirius XM will make a $480 million investment in the music streaming  company Pandora.  The satellite radio company cited Pandora's large user  base and personalized music experience as tremendous assets.  Shares of  Sirius XM dropped 20 cents to $5.20.  Pandora rose 10 cents to $8.52.  </p><p>The FDA has requested Endo Pharma pull its opioid painkiller Opana ER off  the market.  This is the first time the agency has asked to remove a  currently marketed opioid drug due to public health consequences of abuse.   Shares of Endo Pharma dropped more than 16 percent to $11.49.  </p><p>Time now for our market monitor, who says he's finding value in some  underappreciated names in the stock market right now.  It's not the first  time on the program for him but it is as market monitor.  </p><p>Let's welcome back Timothy Lesko, portfolio manager with Granite Investment  Advisers.  </p><p>Welcome back, Tim.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PORTFOLIO MGR:  Thanks for  having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, you're saying that the market in certain sectors may look  fairly valued or maybe fully valued or a little overvalued.  But that's not  true of the overall market.  </p><p>LESKO:  Right.  And that's typical of the market.  Usually you have certain  sectors leading the marketplace.  Over the past few years, that's been a  combination of the high flying technology stocks and some of the consumer  staple stocks that pay a higher dividend.  That has really left sectors  like financials and like energy kind of in the dust.  So, we find value in  a lot of different areas in the market.  </p><p>HERERA:  You're also looking at the so-called old tech.  One of your picks  tonight is Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).  Why?  </p><p>LESKO:  Well, I think that the market over the past seven years has really  been searching for secular growth stories, and leaving behind those  cyclical stories that have been undervalued.  So, while Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) kept going up, you saw stocks like IBM, or Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for a period of time, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at different  periods of time, lagging the market.  And Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has been  making a long term transition from selling software to people to selling  software as a service.</p><p>And feel like that finally, that transition is in place and you might start  seeing some top line growth, which the market has been so desperate for  across technology.  </p><p>HERERA:  You're wading into the energy sector, a fascinating sector to  watch but not always an easy one to invest in this year.  Royal Dutch Shell  is your pick in that particular area of the market.  Why do you like it?  </p><p>LESKO:  Well, that's a great analogy, wading into the energy space.  You  like feel at times that you're drowning in oil.  That's been the concern in  the marketplace, is that we have an oversupply issue.  </p><p>And we think that will work itself out.  Oil demand really hasn't wavered  over the past three or four years, despite some predictions by the  governing agencies.  As well as concerns about economic growth across Asia.   So, as demand continues to move forward, we think it will soak up excess in  the marketplace.  </p><p>And Royal Dutch pays you a nice close to 7 percent yield while you wait for  that market equilibrium to hit.  So, it's been a nice place for value  investors like us to at least get some revenue while we wait for, you know,  the oil market to right itself.  </p><p>HERERA:  And you're going a little broader with your last week, Walmart and  that's based on their distribution.  </p><p>LESKO:  Right.  And that to me is one of the favorite stories to talk to  people about, really only because in a world where every retailer fears  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), there are few people that can compete with what  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is really good at, and that is the logistic side of  it, where Walmart already has those products in place in your geography.   And as the world moves toward, whether it be same-day delivery via Uber or  Lyft, or drones are going to land on your doorstep, Walmart has those  products in your neighborhood already.  </p><p>So, they probably have a leg up on a lot of their competition.  And they've  been a logistics juggernaut for years.  And now, they've just had to figure  out the Internet side of it.  And some of the recent acquisitions have  really helped them do that.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Tim, thank you so much.  Have a great weekend.  </p><p>LESKO:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  Timothy Lesko with Granite Investment Advisers.</p><p>And coming up, is it better to buy or rent in this market?  What a new  report says about one of the biggest financial decisions you'll ever make.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  It seems more Americans are not paying off their credit card  bills.  In the past two quarters, banks reported a steep rise in charge- offs, which is debt that they cannot collect from their customers.   According to a report from Moody's (NYSE:MCO), the increase is the largest  since 2009 and is especially unusual since the job market is improving.  </p><p>Well, if you're planning on house hunting this weekend, you might want to  do a little math first.  For several years, it has been cheaper and more  lucrative to buy a home than to rent.  But that equation apparently is  shifting quickly.  </p><p>Diana Olick shows us where that change is happening the most.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After the housing  crash, when home prices plummeted, it fast became not only cheaper to buy a  home than rent, but it was also a better investment to own in terms of  wealth accumulation.  </p><p>Now, with home prices still rising quickly, and rents starting to ease, the  math is shifting.  Nationally, the rent versus buy equation is heading  steadily into the rent territory, according to an index from Florida  Atlantic University, which factors in home prices, rents, mortgage rates,  as well as alternative investments to gain wealth.  </p><p>Of 23 cities that the index measures, 11 are still in \"buy\" territory, some  very clearly, like Chicago, Cincinnati, and Cleveland.  Nine, including  South Diego, Philadelphia, and L.A., hover right around zero, meaning a  toss-up.  Three cities, Dallas, Denver, and Houston, are in historically  high territory for renting being the better option.  </p><p>The main thing is that all of the cities are steadily moving toward rent,  because home prices are so high, mortgage rates are expected to rise, and  other investments are giving better returns.  This may be why another  index, measuring home buyer sentiment, is falling.  The monthly Fannie Mae  survey found those who said now is a good time to buy fell to its lowest  level ever.  In addition, fewer people were confident about holding onto  their jobs.  </p><p>Clearly, affordability in housing is weighing on the market as more  millennials age into their home buying years, demand will surely increase.   But affordability may still stand in the way. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And finally tonight, Powerball fever.  The jackpot has grown to  more than $400 million.  So, we decided to take a moment and daydream about  what all that money could buy.  </p><p>Here's Robert Frank.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, if there is a  winner for Saturday's Powerball jackpot, the lifetime payout would be $435  million.  The lump sum, which is recommended, would be $273 million or only  around $200 million once Uncle Sam takes his cut.  State and local taxes  and the federal bill later in April could bring the total to under $150  million, but that still leaves you with some good walking around money.  </p><p>You could buy this house in Beverly Hills, California, with a gold  champagne room, a gold Rolls-Royce and a gold Lamborghini, and not one but  two pools.  That's 100 million bucks.  </p><p>If you want a little faster car, you can buy the new Bugatti Chiron which  tops 288 miles an hour for only around 3 million bucks.

And the sharp  move lower seems to come out of nowhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retirement rule.  A new one takes effect today and it could mean big  changes for your savings.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tipping point.  If you're in the market for a new house, a new report says  you might want to think twice.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June  9th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is  off tonight.  </p><p>The best performing sector of the year had one of its worst days in a  while.  After hitting a record early in the day, the mood shifted suddenly  and without warning.  And those same stocks that accounted for more than 40  percent of the S&amp;P 500's advance this year reversed course.  By the end of  the day, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet, Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) all lost 3 percent or more.  </p><p>In the end, it was a tale of two markets.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed at a record, up 89 points to 21,271.  The NASDAQ lost 113 points.   And the S&amp;P was off two.  </p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look at the hit the tech stocks took.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Finally, we got a  little volatility as some traders came forward to begin to question the  valuation of some of these big tech names.  So, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  and Alphabet, they were down about 3 to 5 percent today.  Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS), in a note this morning, made a very simple but important point.   These big tech names are traditionally cyclical growth stocks.  In other  words, they're volatile.  </p><p>But everyone has been acting like they're boring consumer staple stocks,  which is usually not volatile, and everybody has bought them aggressively  assuming they would go up with no risk at all.  They warned that the stocks  have gone up so much that the trend could quickly reverse.</p><p>And they're right, it's a good point.  And, in fact, that's exactly what  happened today, to all these the big names, as well as some of the big  semiconductor names that have also had big run-ups.  For example, Nvidia  and Advanced Micro.  </p><p>So, what does all this mean?  Well, it means kind of what it always means  on Wall Street.  When you have stocks that keep going up, it attracts a  whole other class of buyers.  </p><p>We call them momentum players.  And essentially these momentum players are  just along for the ride.  Then something fundamental happens, you have the  mildest of earnings or guidance disappointments, or in this case someone  with influence like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) writes something that says, you  know, fellas, this doesn't make too much sense, and you get a selloff that  suddenly accelerates.  </p><p>All right.  So, is this a cause for concern?  For the moment, no.  I think  it's a relief.  There are some signs traders are taking the money and  buying less-loved sectors like banks and energy stocks.  That would be a  healthy rotation using overbought tech stocks as a source of funds to buy  under-owned bank and energy names.  </p><p>So, the verdict so far: at least for the moment this does not appear the  start of an overall correction.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The election results in the United Kingdom could impact the single  biggest economic issue that that country faces -- Brexit.  </p><p>Wilfred Frost gave us the preliminary results last night.  He is back for  us tonight from London.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILFRED FROST, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Uncertainty struck  the United Kingdom overnight as the initial results from the general  election revealed the U.K. was headed for a hung parliament, where no party  wins a clear majority.  </p><p>The pound plunged in response and Theresa May's opponents called for her  resignation.  </p><p>JEREMY CORBYN, LABOUR PARTY LEADER:  The prime minister called for the  election because she wanted a mandate.  Well, the mandate she's got is lost  conservative seats, lost support, and lost confidence.  I would have  thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that  will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.  </p><p>FROST:  But as the final results emerged, Theresa May did win enough seats,  along with the help of the small Northern Irish DUP Party to return to  Downing Street.  </p><p>Prime minister, but her standing much diminished, as she failed to increase  her majority as planned.  </p><p>THERESA MAY, U.K. PRIME MINISTER:  I wanted to achieve a larger majority.   But that was not the result that we secured.  And I'm sorry for all those  candidates and hard working party workers who weren't successful, but also  particularly sorry for those colleagues who were MPs and ministers who  contributed so much to our country and who lost their seats and didn't  deserve to lose their seats.  And as I reflect on the results, I will  reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward.  </p><p>FROST:  The other big takeaway was the Brexit negotiations would begin as  planned in ten days' time, but with the U.K.'s negotiating team much  weakened by this grueling election.  That might explain why European  Council President Donald Tusk was so keen to get started. </p><p>In a letter to Theresa May today, he spoke of their shared responsibility  and named it an urgent task to begin negotiations.  He also reiterated the  March 2019 cutoff date.  He even expressed his congratulations on her  reappointment.  That line no doubt written with a wry smile on his face.  </p><p>The bottom line, May is weaker.  The U.K. is weaker.  The pound weaker as a  result.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Wilfred Frost, London.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Leaders of the House Intelligence Committee say they have asked  the White House counsel to see whether there are any records of the former  FBI director's conversations with the president.  The panel also asked  James Comey for his notes and memos of that same conversation.  </p><p>And in a fiery news conference, the president forcefully accused Mr. Comey  of not being completely truthful.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We were very, very happy and  frankly, James Comey confirmed lot of what I said.  And some of the things  that he said just weren't true.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The president also said he would be glad to state his case to the  special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.  </p><p>A consumer protection aimed at retirement advisers is set to go into effect  today, at least for now.  The Labor Department is still reviewing the  regulation and is expected to make some changes later.  </p><p>Kayla Tausche has more on the effect of the new rule.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The so-called  Fiduciary Rule keeps retirement advisers from favoring their commission- based products over their customers' interests.  </p><p>As of today, they have to abide by the spirit of the rule.  Large  brokerages have already made changes.  For instance, Merrill Lynch gave  customers a choice to move to a different platform or pay a fee.  Wells  Fargo (NYSE:WFC) offering fewer products.  UBS is changing broker  compensation to eliminate the conflict.  </p><p>Smaller broker deals have made big changes.

Some  independent firms have frozen assets while the rule is under review.  </p><p>Clients are affected if their retirement account and 401ks are managed by  commission-based adviser or commission-based accounts.  Money managers may  ask (ph) customers to opt back into these accounts to ensure they actually  want to be in them.  </p><p>The Obama administration estimated the rule would save Americans $17  billion in fees.  But it will likely change again before a final January  deadline.  The Labor Department still reviewing it and the department has  38 political appointments vacant that will be important here.  </p><p>Asset managers also are traditionally regulated by the FCC.  That agency  will want a say in how it's written and enforced and the industry has  requested the agency's involvement too.  The wild card, how Congress  tackles large scale financial reform and if they decide to roll back the  rule completely.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche, New York.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Chris Carosa joins us now to discuss what that new fiduciary rule  as it stands now will mean for you.  He is founder and fiduciary expert at  Carosa Asset Management.  </p><p>Good to see you, Chris.  Welcome.  </p><p>CHRIS CAROSA, CAROSA ASSET MANAGEMENT FOUNDER:  Hi, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, bottom line this for me, what are consumers going to see and  investors going to see that will look or appear or be different?  </p><p>CAROSA:  Well, it's likely that they won't see anything dramatic right  away.  Over time, primarily those who are rolling over IRAs from their  existing retirement accounts will begin to see new language in the  agreements, which is called a best interest contract exemption.  And that  discloses to the new rollover that there may be an opportunity for the  provider to offer products that would normally contain what's called  conflict of interest fees.  </p><p>And this is a way for the client to sign off on that and allow them to do  it provided it's still in their best interests.  </p><p>HERERA:  Although it's not necessarily, it doesn't sound like it's written  in an easy way to understand.  </p><p>CAROSA:  Maybe, maybe not.  There's no really formal template for how this  language will appear.  My thinking is it will probably be maybe a paragraph  or two.  But that doesn't mean that's how it will be.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  What questions do investors need to ask, as this rule rolls  into effect?  As you say, we won't see the changes immediately, but as we  get closer to the final version and it does go into effect, what questions  should they be asking their financial fiduciary?  </p><p>CAROSA:  Remember, the actual name of the rule is the conflict of interest  rule.  And I think that's what investors should focus in on.  They should  ask their adviser, what types of fee arrangements do we have?  Are they  traditional conflict of interest fees such as commissions, 12B-1 fees or  revenue sharing?  </p><p>These are the type of fees, sometimes they're disclosed in the mutual fund  but not all times, because the SEC doesn't require a clear disclosure for  revenue sharing.  So, you've got to ask the adviser if that's the type of  fee that you're paying.  And then you might want to consider whether or not  that's the type of fee you want to pay, because you don't have to.  </p><p>HERERA:  And I assume that you need to ask those questions, because when  you look at your statements and when you look at your financial plan,  sometimes, it's a little bit difficult to find out where those fees and  those other exemptions are in the physical document.  </p><p>CAROSA:  That's true.  In 2012, the DOL came out with a rule called the  401(k) mutual fund fee disclosure which was supposed to address this.  But,  unfortunately, again, they didn't provide a template, so we have all  different forms of disclosure, which are often very difficult to read, even  for professionals.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, on that note, that means we'll have to have you back when  they finally finish it up and we get the final product.  </p><p>Chris, thank you very much.  </p><p>CAROSA:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  Chris Carosa with Carosa Asset Management.</p><p>Still ahead tonight, the 51st state?  Investors will be watching a key vote  this weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LESLIE PICKER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We spoke with  residents, investors, and government officials here in Puerto Rico about a  big statehood vote this Sunday.  We'll tell you all about it, coming up on  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  An historic vote in Puerto Rico this weekend.  One hundred years  after being granted U.S. citizenship, Puerto Ricans will vote on whether to  become the 51st state.  And it comes at a time of deep financial  uncertainty for the island.  </p><p>Leslie Picker is in San Juan.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PICKER:  Flags adorning the bright rows of colonial buildings underscore  the sentiment of statehood here in Puerto Rico.  Oftentimes, you'll find  the Puerto Rican flags next to American one, the blue part of the flag  matching.  But then you'll also see Puerto Rican flags by themselves, with  a lighter shade of blue.  That signifies independence.  </p><p>This question of status will be the focus of a vote taking place on Sunday.   Puerto Ricans will go to the polls to determine whether or not they want to  become a U.S. state, sovereign nation, or remain a commonwealth, which is  something in between.  </p><p>Puerto Rico has been in a recession for 10 years and is grappling with $120  billion of debt and unfunded pension liabilities, that caused it to seek  bankruptcy protection last month.  About 40 percent of U.S. municipal bond  funds have exposure to Puerto Rican bonds, with billions of dollars worth  of exposure.  </p><p>Tensions here are high.  Residents we spoke with said becoming a state  could solve their economic problems.  Others blame the U.S. for the mess on  the island and would prefer to keep their commonwealth status or seek  sovereignty.  </p><p>SOCORRO OLIVENCIA, PUERTO RICAN RESIDENT:  There is the feeling, you know,  that you can't trust that anymore.  That is very hard.  </p><p>PICKER:  And not everyone in the U.S. is in full support, wary that they  would have to take on the burden of a bankrupt municipality if Puerto Rico  votes for statehood.  But according to government officials on the island,  Vice President Mike Pence has pledged to support the Puerto Rican statehood  should residents vote that way.  </p><p>Governor Ricardo Rossello who campaigned on the promise of statehood before  winning election in November defended Puerto Rico's rights.  </p><p>RICARDO ANTONIO ROSSELLO, PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR:  We wouldn't want, you  know, a bailout.  I'm no fan of bailouts.  I think we need to assume  responsibility for what's going on here.  Statehood is an equal playing  field for U.S. citizens that reside on the island.  </p><p>PICKER:  Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but they don't have the same  access to benefits as those on the mainland.  While they can serve in the  military, they can't vote for their commander in chief.  The topic is so  important to elected officials here, they've spent $7 million on this  weekend's election, despite being bankrupt.  </p><p>The Justice Department was supposed to provide $2.5 million in exchange for  a say over the wording on the ballots.  But that money has yet to arrive.  </p><p>JENNIFER GONZALEZ-COLON, PUERTO RICO CONGRESSWOMAN:  This is not about the  money.  I mean, this is more than that.  So keep the money.  Let us express  ourselves.  That's what we're going to have on Sunday.  </p><p>PICKER:  Gonzalez is confident that residents will vote for statehood, but  it wouldn't be the first time.  Puerto Rico had a similar vote five years  ago.  But it's up to Congress to write a statute welcoming Puerto Rico to  becoming the 51st state.  </p><p>So far, there hasn't been willingness in Washington to do that.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Leslie Picker, San Juan, Puerto Rico.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And you can read more about what's at stake when Puerto Rico goes  to the polls on our website, NBR.com.  </p><p>The U.S. is mostly clear to provide unfair support to Boeing (NYSE:BA).   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The World Trade Organization rejected claims by the European Union and  Airbus that Boeing (NYSE:BA) had benefitted from billions of dollars of  illegal subsidies.  But it also ruled that the U.S. failed to eliminate a  tax break in a key state.  Both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus claimed victory  over that decision.  Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) were basically unchanged at  $190.03.  </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission staff is advising the agency to prepare a  lawsuit to block Walgreen's nearly $10 billion deal to buy Rite Aid  (NYSE:RAD).  That's according to a report by the trade publication \"Capital  Forum\".  Walgreen's initially bid for its smaller drugstore rival back in  2015.  Shares of Walgreen's dropped 48 cents to $80.99.  Shares of Rite Aid  (NYSE:RAD) plunged 15 percent to $3.  </p><p>Sirius XM will make a $480 million investment in the music streaming  company Pandora.  The satellite radio company cited Pandora's large user  base and personalized music experience as tremendous assets.  Shares of  Sirius XM dropped 20 cents to $5.20.  Pandora rose 10 cents to $8.52.  </p><p>The FDA has requested Endo Pharma pull its opioid painkiller Opana ER off  the market.  This is the first time the agency has asked to remove a  currently marketed opioid drug due to public health consequences of abuse.   Shares of Endo Pharma dropped more than 16 percent to $11.49.  </p><p>Time now for our market monitor, who says he's finding value in some  underappreciated names in the stock market right now.  It's not the first  time on the program for him but it is as market monitor.  </p><p>Let's welcome back Timothy Lesko, portfolio manager with Granite Investment  Advisers.  </p><p>Welcome back, Tim.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PORTFOLIO MGR:  Thanks for  having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, you're saying that the market in certain sectors may look  fairly valued or maybe fully valued or a little overvalued.  But that's not  true of the overall market.  </p><p>LESKO:  Right.  And that's typical of the market.  Usually you have certain  sectors leading the marketplace.  Over the past few years, that's been a  combination of the high flying technology stocks and some of the consumer  staple stocks that pay a higher dividend.  That has really left sectors  like financials and like energy kind of in the dust.  So, we find value in  a lot of different areas in the market.  </p><p>HERERA:  You're also looking at the so-called old tech.  One of your picks  tonight is Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).  Why?  </p><p>LESKO:  Well, I think that the market over the past seven years has really  been searching for secular growth stories, and leaving behind those  cyclical stories that have been undervalued.  So, while Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) kept going up, you saw stocks like IBM, or Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for a period of time, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at different  periods of time, lagging the market.  And Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has been  making a long term transition from selling software to people to selling  software as a service.</p><p>And feel like that finally, that transition is in place and you might start  seeing some top line growth, which the market has been so desperate for  across technology.  </p><p>HERERA:  You're wading into the energy sector, a fascinating sector to  watch but not always an easy one to invest in this year.  Royal Dutch Shell  is your pick in that particular area of the market.  Why do you like it?  </p><p>LESKO:  Well, that's a great analogy, wading into the energy space.  You  like feel at times that you're drowning in oil.  That's been the concern in  the marketplace, is that we have an oversupply issue.  </p><p>And we think that will work itself out.  Oil demand really hasn't wavered  over the past three or four years, despite some predictions by the  governing agencies.  As well as concerns about economic growth across Asia.   So, as demand continues to move forward, we think it will soak up excess in  the marketplace.  </p><p>And Royal Dutch pays you a nice close to 7 percent yield while you wait for  that market equilibrium to hit.  So, it's been a nice place for value  investors like us to at least get some revenue while we wait for, you know,  the oil market to right itself.  </p><p>HERERA:  And you're going a little broader with your last week, Walmart and  that's based on their distribution.  </p><p>LESKO:  Right.  And that to me is one of the favorite stories to talk to  people about, really only because in a world where every retailer fears  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), there are few people that can compete with what  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is really good at, and that is the logistic side of  it, where Walmart already has those products in place in your geography.   And as the world moves toward, whether it be same-day delivery via Uber or  Lyft, or drones are going to land on your doorstep, Walmart has those  products in your neighborhood already.  </p><p>So, they probably have a leg up on a lot of their competition.  And they've  been a logistics juggernaut for years.  And now, they've just had to figure  out the Internet side of it.  And some of the recent acquisitions have  really helped them do that.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Tim, thank you so much.  Have a great weekend.  </p><p>LESKO:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  Timothy Lesko with Granite Investment Advisers.</p><p>And coming up, is it better to buy or rent in this market?  What a new  report says about one of the biggest financial decisions you'll ever make.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  It seems more Americans are not paying off their credit card  bills.  In the past two quarters, banks reported a steep rise in charge- offs, which is debt that they cannot collect from their customers.   According to a report from Moody's (NYSE:MCO), the increase is the largest  since 2009 and is especially unusual since the job market is improving.  </p><p>Well, if you're planning on house hunting this weekend, you might want to  do a little math first.  For several years, it has been cheaper and more  lucrative to buy a home than to rent.  But that equation apparently is  shifting quickly.  </p><p>Diana Olick shows us where that change is happening the most.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After the housing  crash, when home prices plummeted, it fast became not only cheaper to buy a  home than rent, but it was also a better investment to own in terms of  wealth accumulation.  </p><p>Now, with home prices still rising quickly, and rents starting to ease, the  math is shifting.  Nationally, the rent versus buy equation is heading  steadily into the rent territory, according to an index from Florida  Atlantic University, which factors in home prices, rents, mortgage rates,  as well as alternative investments to gain wealth.  </p><p>Of 23 cities that the index measures, 11 are still in \"buy\" territory, some  very clearly, like Chicago, Cincinnati, and Cleveland.  Nine, including  South Diego, Philadelphia, and L.A., hover right around zero, meaning a  toss-up.  Three cities, Dallas, Denver, and Houston, are in historically  high territory for renting being the better option.  </p><p>The main thing is that all of the cities are steadily moving toward rent,  because home prices are so high, mortgage rates are expected to rise, and  other investments are giving better returns.  This may be why another  index, measuring home buyer sentiment, is falling.  The monthly Fannie Mae  survey found those who said now is a good time to buy fell to its lowest  level ever.  In addition, fewer people were confident about holding onto  their jobs.  </p><p>Clearly, affordability in housing is weighing on the market as more  millennials age into their home buying years, demand will surely increase.   But affordability may still stand in the way. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And finally tonight, Powerball fever.  The jackpot has grown to  more than $400 million.  So, we decided to take a moment and daydream about  what all that money could buy.  </p><p>Here's Robert Frank.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, if there is a  winner for Saturday's Powerball jackpot, the lifetime payout would be $435  million.  The lump sum, which is recommended, would be $273 million or only  around $200 million once Uncle Sam takes his cut.  State and local taxes  and the federal bill later in April could bring the total to under $150  million, but that still leaves you with some good walking around money.  </p><p>You could buy this house in Beverly Hills, California, with a gold  champagne room, a gold Rolls-Royce and a gold Lamborghini, and not one but  two pools.  That's 100 million bucks.  </p><p>If you want a little faster car, you can buy the new Bugatti Chiron which  tops 288 miles an hour for only around 3 million bucks.  Now, you could  have bought two of the most expensive diamonds ever sold, the pink star,  59.6 karats, pink flawless, for $71 million. </p><p>Now, if you want to quit your job and retire on that yacht, you can hop  aboard the $80 million silver fast.  It's 250 feet.  It's got an outdoor  cinema, eight-person glass Jacuzzi, dining table for 20, and, of course, a  helipad for going to and from the bank.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that's it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p>We want to remind you, this is the time of year your public television  station seeks your support.  </p><p>Thank you.  We'll see you Monday.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

And the sharp  move lower seems to come out of nowhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retirement rule.  A new one takes effect today and it could mean big  changes for your savings.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tipping point.  If you're in the market for a new house, a new report says  you might want to think twice.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June  9th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is  off tonight.  </p><p>The best performing sector of the year had one of its worst days in a  while.  After hitting a record early in the day, the mood shifted suddenly  and without warning.  And those same stocks that accounted for more than 40  percent of the S&amp;P 500's advance this year reversed course.  By the end of  the day, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet, Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) all lost 3 percent or more.  </p><p>In the end, it was a tale of two markets.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed at a record, up 89 points to 21,271.  The NASDAQ lost 113 points.   And the S&amp;P was off two.  </p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look at the hit the tech stocks took.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Finally, we got a  little volatility as some traders came forward to begin to question the  valuation of some of these big tech names.  So, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  and Alphabet, they were down about 3 to 5 percent today.  Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS), in a note this morning, made a very simple but important point.   These big tech names are traditionally cyclical growth stocks.  In other  words, they're volatile.  </p><p>But everyone has been acting like they're boring consumer staple stocks,  which is usually not volatile, and everybody has bought them aggressively  assuming they would go up with no risk at all.  They warned that the stocks  have gone up so much that the trend could quickly reverse.</p><p>And they're right, it's a good point.  And, in fact, that's exactly what  happened today, to all these the big names, as well as some of the big  semiconductor names that have also had big run-ups.  For example, Nvidia  and Advanced Micro.  </p><p>So, what does all this mean?  Well, it means kind of what it always means  on Wall Street.  When you have stocks that keep going up, it attracts a  whole other class of buyers.  </p><p>We call them momentum players.  And essentially these momentum players are  just along for the ride.  Then something fundamental happens, you have the  mildest of earnings or guidance disappointments, or in this case someone  with influence like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) writes something that says, you  know, fellas, this doesn't make too much sense, and you get a selloff that  suddenly accelerates.  </p><p>All right.  So, is this a cause for concern?  For the moment, no.  I think  it's a relief.  There are some signs traders are taking the money and  buying less-loved sectors like banks and energy stocks.  That would be a  healthy rotation using overbought tech stocks as a source of funds to buy  under-owned bank and energy names.  </p><p>So, the verdict so far: at least for the moment this does not appear the  start of an overall correction.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The election results in the United Kingdom could impact the single  biggest economic issue that that country faces -- Brexit.  </p><p>Wilfred Frost gave us the preliminary results last night.  He is back for  us tonight from London.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILFRED FROST, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Uncertainty struck  the United Kingdom overnight as the initial results from the general  election revealed the U.K. was headed for a hung parliament, where no party  wins a clear majority.  </p><p>The pound plunged in response and Theresa May's opponents called for her  resignation.  </p><p>JEREMY CORBYN, LABOUR PARTY LEADER:  The prime minister called for the  election because she wanted a mandate.  Well, the mandate she's got is lost  conservative seats, lost support, and lost confidence.  I would have  thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that  will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.  </p><p>FROST:  But as the final results emerged, Theresa May did win enough seats,  along with the help of the small Northern Irish DUP Party to return to  Downing Street.  </p><p>Prime minister, but her standing much diminished, as she failed to increase  her majority as planned.  </p><p>THERESA MAY, U.K. PRIME MINISTER:  I wanted to achieve a larger majority.   But that was not the result that we secured.  And I'm sorry for all those  candidates and hard working party workers who weren't successful, but also  particularly sorry for those colleagues who were MPs and ministers who  contributed so much to our country and who lost their seats and didn't  deserve to lose their seats.  And as I reflect on the results, I will  reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward.  </p><p>FROST:  The other big takeaway was the Brexit negotiations would begin as  planned in ten days' time, but with the U.K.'s negotiating team much  weakened by this grueling election.  That might explain why European  Council President Donald Tusk was so keen to get started. </p><p>In a letter to Theresa May today, he spoke of their shared responsibility  and named it an urgent task to begin negotiations.  He also reiterated the  March 2019 cutoff date.  He even expressed his congratulations on her  reappointment.  That line no doubt written with a wry smile on his face.  </p><p>The bottom line, May is weaker.  The U.K. is weaker.  The pound weaker as a  result.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Wilfred Frost, London.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Leaders of the House Intelligence Committee say they have asked  the White House counsel to see whether there are any records of the former  FBI director's conversations with the president.  The panel also asked  James Comey for his notes and memos of that same conversation.  </p><p>And in a fiery news conference, the president forcefully accused Mr. Comey  of not being completely truthful.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We were very, very happy and  frankly, James Comey confirmed lot of what I said.  And some of the things  that he said just weren't true.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The president also said he would be glad to state his case to the  special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.  </p><p>A consumer protection aimed at retirement advisers is set to go into effect  today, at least for now.  The Labor Department is still reviewing the  regulation and is expected to make some changes later.  </p><p>Kayla Tausche has more on the effect of the new rule.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The so-called  Fiduciary Rule keeps retirement advisers from favoring their commission- based products over their customers' interests.  </p><p>As of today, they have to abide by the spirit of the rule.  Large  brokerages have already made changes.  For instance, Merrill Lynch gave  customers a choice to move to a different platform or pay a fee.  Wells  Fargo (NYSE:WFC) offering fewer products.  UBS is changing broker  compensation to eliminate the conflict.  </p><p>Smaller broker deals have made big changes.  Ameriprise has dropped  hundreds of funds, and LPL Financial revamped its pricing.  Some  independent firms have frozen assets while the rule is under review.  </p><p>Clients are affected if their retirement account and 401ks are managed by  commission-based adviser or commission-based accounts.  Money managers may  ask (ph) customers to opt back into these accounts to ensure they actually  want to be in them.  </p><p>The Obama administration estimated the rule would save Americans $17  billion in fees.  But it will likely change again before a final January  deadline.  The Labor Department still reviewing it and the department has  38 political appointments vacant that will be important here.  </p><p>Asset managers also are traditionally regulated by the FCC.  That agency  will want a say in how it's written and enforced and the industry has  requested the agency's involvement too.  The wild card, how Congress  tackles large scale financial reform and if they decide to roll back the  rule completely.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche, New York.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Chris Carosa joins us now to discuss what that new fiduciary rule  as it stands now will mean for you.  He is founder and fiduciary expert at  Carosa Asset Management.  </p><p>Good to see you, Chris.  Welcome.  </p><p>CHRIS CAROSA, CAROSA ASSET MANAGEMENT FOUNDER:  Hi, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, bottom line this for me, what are consumers going to see and  investors going to see that will look or appear or be different?  </p><p>CAROSA:  Well, it's likely that they won't see anything dramatic right  away.  Over time, primarily those who are rolling over IRAs from their  existing retirement accounts will begin to see new language in the  agreements, which is called a best interest contract exemption.  And that  discloses to the new rollover that there may be an opportunity for the  provider to offer products that would normally contain what's called  conflict of interest fees.  </p><p>And this is a way for the client to sign off on that and allow them to do  it provided it's still in their best interests.  </p><p>HERERA:  Although it's not necessarily, it doesn't sound like it's written  in an easy way to understand.  </p><p>CAROSA:  Maybe, maybe not.  There's no really formal template for how this  language will appear.  My thinking is it will probably be maybe a paragraph  or two.  But that doesn't mean that's how it will be.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  What questions do investors need to ask, as this rule rolls  into effect?  As you say, we won't see the changes immediately, but as we  get closer to the final version and it does go into effect, what questions  should they be asking their financial fiduciary?  </p><p>CAROSA:  Remember, the actual name of the rule is the conflict of interest  rule.  And I think that's what investors should focus in on.  They should  ask their adviser, what types of fee arrangements do we have?  Are they  traditional conflict of interest fees such as commissions, 12B-1 fees or  revenue sharing?  </p><p>These are the type of fees, sometimes they're disclosed in the mutual fund  but not all times, because the SEC doesn't require a clear disclosure for  revenue sharing.  So, you've got to ask the adviser if that's the type of  fee that you're paying.  And then you might want to consider whether or not  that's the type of fee you want to pay, because you don't have to.  </p><p>HERERA:  And I assume that you need to ask those questions, because when  you look at your statements and when you look at your financial plan,  sometimes, it's a little bit difficult to find out where those fees and  those other exemptions are in the physical document.  </p><p>CAROSA:  That's true.  In 2012, the DOL came out with a rule called the  401(k) mutual fund fee disclosure which was supposed to address this.  But,  unfortunately, again, they didn't provide a template, so we have all  different forms of disclosure, which are often very difficult to read, even  for professionals.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, on that note, that means we'll have to have you back when  they finally finish it up and we get the final product.  </p><p>Chris, thank you very much.  </p><p>CAROSA:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  Chris Carosa with Carosa Asset Management.</p><p>Still ahead tonight, the 51st state?  Investors will be watching a key vote  this weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LESLIE PICKER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We spoke with  residents, investors, and government officials here in Puerto Rico about a  big statehood vote this Sunday.  We'll tell you all about it, coming up on  NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  An historic vote in Puerto Rico this weekend.  One hundred years  after being granted U.S. citizenship, Puerto Ricans will vote on whether to  become the 51st state.  And it comes at a time of deep financial  uncertainty for the island.  </p><p>Leslie Picker is in San Juan.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PICKER:  Flags adorning the bright rows of colonial buildings underscore  the sentiment of statehood here in Puerto Rico.  Oftentimes, you'll find  the Puerto Rican flags next to American one, the blue part of the flag  matching.  But then you'll also see Puerto Rican flags by themselves, with  a lighter shade of blue.  That signifies independence.  </p><p>This question of status will be the focus of a vote taking place on Sunday.   Puerto Ricans will go to the polls to determine whether or not they want to  become a U.S. state, sovereign nation, or remain a commonwealth, which is  something in between.  </p><p>Puerto Rico has been in a recession for 10 years and is grappling with $120  billion of debt and unfunded pension liabilities, that caused it to seek  bankruptcy protection last month.  About 40 percent of U.S. municipal bond  funds have exposure to Puerto Rican bonds, with billions of dollars worth  of exposure.  </p><p>Tensions here are high.  Residents we spoke with said becoming a state  could solve their economic problems.  Others blame the U.S. for the mess on  the island and would prefer to keep their commonwealth status or seek  sovereignty.  </p><p>SOCORRO OLIVENCIA, PUERTO RICAN RESIDENT:  There is the feeling, you know,  that you can't trust that anymore.  That is very hard.  </p><p>PICKER:  And not everyone in the U.S. is in full support, wary that they  would have to take on the burden of a bankrupt municipality if Puerto Rico  votes for statehood.  But according to government officials on the island,  Vice President Mike Pence has pledged to support the Puerto Rican statehood  should residents vote that way.  </p><p>Governor Ricardo Rossello who campaigned on the promise of statehood before  winning election in November defended Puerto Rico's rights.  </p><p>RICARDO ANTONIO ROSSELLO, PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR:  We wouldn't want, you  know, a bailout.  I'm no fan of bailouts.  I think we need to assume  responsibility for what's going on here.  Statehood is an equal playing  field for U.S. citizens that reside on the island.  </p><p>PICKER:  Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but they don't have the same  access to benefits as those on the mainland.  While they can serve in the  military, they can't vote for their commander in chief.  The topic is so  important to elected officials here, they've spent $7 million on this  weekend's election, despite being bankrupt.  </p><p>The Justice Department was supposed to provide $2.5 million in exchange for  a say over the wording on the ballots.  But that money has yet to arrive.  </p><p>JENNIFER GONZALEZ-COLON, PUERTO RICO CONGRESSWOMAN:  This is not about the  money.  I mean, this is more than that.  So keep the money.  Let us express  ourselves.  That's what we're going to have on Sunday.  </p><p>PICKER:  Gonzalez is confident that residents will vote for statehood, but  it wouldn't be the first time.  Puerto Rico had a similar vote five years  ago.  But it's up to Congress to write a statute welcoming Puerto Rico to  becoming the 51st state.  </p><p>So far, there hasn't been willingness in Washington to do that.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Leslie Picker, San Juan, Puerto Rico.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And you can read more about what's at stake when Puerto Rico goes  to the polls on our website, NBR.com.  </p><p>The U.S. is mostly clear to provide unfair support to Boeing (NYSE:BA).   That's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The World Trade Organization rejected claims by the European Union and  Airbus that Boeing (NYSE:BA) had benefitted from billions of dollars of  illegal subsidies.  But it also ruled that the U.S. failed to eliminate a  tax break in a key state.  Both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus claimed victory  over that decision.  Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) were basically unchanged at  $190.03.  </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission staff is advising the agency to prepare a  lawsuit to block Walgreen's nearly $10 billion deal to buy Rite Aid  (NYSE:RAD).  That's according to a report by the trade publication \"Capital  Forum\".  Walgreen's initially bid for its smaller drugstore rival back in  2015.  Shares of Walgreen's dropped 48 cents to $80.99.  Shares of Rite Aid  (NYSE:RAD) plunged 15 percent to $3.  </p><p>Sirius XM will make a $480 million investment in the music streaming  company Pandora.  The satellite radio company cited Pandora's large user  base and personalized music experience as tremendous assets.  Shares of  Sirius XM dropped 20 cents to $5.20.  Pandora rose 10 cents to $8.52.  </p><p>The FDA has requested Endo Pharma pull its opioid painkiller Opana ER off  the market.  This is the first time the agency has asked to remove a  currently marketed opioid drug due to public health consequences of abuse.   Shares of Endo Pharma dropped more than 16 percent to $11.49.  </p><p>Time now for our market monitor, who says he's finding value in some  underappreciated names in the stock market right now.  It's not the first  time on the program for him but it is as market monitor.  </p><p>Let's welcome back Timothy Lesko, portfolio manager with Granite Investment  Advisers.  </p><p>Welcome back, Tim.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PORTFOLIO MGR:  Thanks for  having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, you're saying that the market in certain sectors may look  fairly valued or maybe fully valued or a little overvalued.  But that's not  true of the overall market.  </p><p>LESKO:  Right.  And that's typical of the market.  Usually you have certain  sectors leading the marketplace.  Over the past few years, that's been a  combination of the high flying technology stocks and some of the consumer  staple stocks that pay a higher dividend.  That has really left sectors  like financials and like energy kind of in the dust.  So, we find value in  a lot of different areas in the market.  </p><p>HERERA:  You're also looking at the so-called old tech.  One of your picks  tonight is Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL).  Why?  </p><p>LESKO:  Well, I think that the market over the past seven years has really  been searching for secular growth stories, and leaving behind those  cyclical stories that have been undervalued.  So, while Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) kept going up, you saw stocks like IBM, or Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for a period of time, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at different  periods of time, lagging the market.  And Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has been  making a long term transition from selling software to people to selling  software as a service.</p><p>And feel like that finally, that transition is in place and you might start  seeing some top line growth, which the market has been so desperate for  across technology.  </p><p>HERERA:  You're wading into the energy sector, a fascinating sector to  watch but not always an easy one to invest in this year.  Royal Dutch Shell  is your pick in that particular area of the market.  Why do you like it?  </p><p>LESKO:  Well, that's a great analogy, wading into the energy space.  You  like feel at times that you're drowning in oil.  That's been the concern in  the marketplace, is that we have an oversupply issue.  </p><p>And we think that will work itself out.  Oil demand really hasn't wavered  over the past three or four years, despite some predictions by the  governing agencies.  As well as concerns about economic growth across Asia.   So, as demand continues to move forward, we think it will soak up excess in  the marketplace.  </p><p>And Royal Dutch pays you a nice close to 7 percent yield while you wait for  that market equilibrium to hit.  So, it's been a nice place for value  investors like us to at least get some revenue while we wait for, you know,  the oil market to right itself.  </p><p>HERERA:  And you're going a little broader with your last week, Walmart and  that's based on their distribution.  </p><p>LESKO:  Right.  And that to me is one of the favorite stories to talk to  people about, really only because in a world where every retailer fears  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), there are few people that can compete with what  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is really good at, and that is the logistic side of  it, where Walmart already has those products in place in your geography.   And as the world moves toward, whether it be same-day delivery via Uber or  Lyft, or drones are going to land on your doorstep, Walmart has those  products in your neighborhood already.  </p><p>So, they probably have a leg up on a lot of their competition.  And they've  been a logistics juggernaut for years.  And now, they've just had to figure  out the Internet side of it.  And some of the recent acquisitions have  really helped them do that.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Tim, thank you so much.  Have a great weekend.  </p><p>LESKO:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  Timothy Lesko with Granite Investment Advisers.</p><p>And coming up, is it better to buy or rent in this market?  What a new  report says about one of the biggest financial decisions you'll ever make.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  It seems more Americans are not paying off their credit card  bills.  In the past two quarters, banks reported a steep rise in charge- offs, which is debt that they cannot collect from their customers.   According to a report from Moody's (NYSE:MCO), the increase is the largest  since 2009 and is especially unusual since the job market is improving.  </p><p>Well, if you're planning on house hunting this weekend, you might want to  do a little math first.  For several years, it has been cheaper and more  lucrative to buy a home than to rent.  But that equation apparently is  shifting quickly.  </p><p>Diana Olick shows us where that change is happening the most.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After the housing  crash, when home prices plummeted, it fast became not only cheaper to buy a  home than rent, but it was also a better investment to own in terms of  wealth accumulation.  </p><p>Now, with home prices still rising quickly, and rents starting to ease, the  math is shifting.  Nationally, the rent versus buy equation is heading  steadily into the rent territory, according to an index from Florida  Atlantic University, which factors in home prices, rents, mortgage rates,  as well as alternative investments to gain wealth.  </p><p>Of 23 cities that the index measures, 11 are still in \"buy\" territory, some  very clearly, like Chicago, Cincinnati, and Cleveland.  Nine, including  South Diego, Philadelphia, and L.A., hover right around zero, meaning a  toss-up.  Three cities, Dallas, Denver, and Houston, are in historically  high territory for renting being the better option.  </p><p>The main thing is that all of the cities are steadily moving toward rent,  because home prices are so high, mortgage rates are expected to rise, and  other investments are giving better returns.  This may be why another  index, measuring home buyer sentiment, is falling.  The monthly Fannie Mae  survey found those who said now is a good time to buy fell to its lowest  level ever.  In addition, fewer people were confident about holding onto  their jobs.  </p><p>Clearly, affordability in housing is weighing on the market as more  millennials age into their home buying years, demand will surely increase.   But affordability may still stand in the way. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And finally tonight, Powerball fever.  The jackpot has grown to  more than $400 million.  So, we decided to take a moment and daydream about  what all that money could buy.  </p><p>Here's Robert Frank.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, if there is a  winner for Saturday's Powerball jackpot, the lifetime payout would be $435  million.  The lump sum, which is recommended, would be $273 million or only  around $200 million once Uncle Sam takes his cut.  State and local taxes  and the federal bill later in April could bring the total to under $150  million, but that still leaves you with some good walking around money.  </p><p>You could buy this house in Beverly Hills, California, with a gold  champagne room, a gold Rolls-Royce and a gold Lamborghini, and not one but  two pools.  That's 100 million bucks.  </p><p>If you want a little faster car, you can buy the new Bugatti Chiron which  tops 288 miles an hour for only around 3 million bucks.  Now, you could  have bought two of the most expensive diamonds ever sold, the pink star,  59.6 karats, pink flawless, for $71 million. </p><p>Now, if you want to quit your job and retire on that yacht, you can hop  aboard the $80 million silver fast.  It's 250 feet.  It's got an outdoor  cinema, eight-person glass Jacuzzi, dining table for 20, and, of course, a  helipad for going to and from the bank.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that's it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p>We want to remind you, this is the time of year your public television  station seeks your support.  </p><p>Thank you.  We'll see you Monday.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

And the sharp move lower seems to come out of nowhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Retirement rule. A new one takes effect today and it could mean big changes for your savings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tipping point. If you`re in the market for a new house, a new report says you might want to think twice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June 9th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome. I`m Sue Herera. Tyler Mathisen is off tonight.</p><p>The best performing sector of the year had one of its worst days in a while. After hitting a record early in the day, the mood shifted suddenly and without warning. And those same stocks that accounted for more than 40 percent of the S&amp;P 500`s advance this year reversed course. By the end of the day, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) all lost 3 percent or more.</p><p>In the end, it was a tale of two markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record, up 89 points to 21,271. The NASDAQ lost 113 points. And the S&amp;P was off two.</p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look at the hit the tech stocks took.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Finally, we got a little volatility as some traders came forward to begin to question the valuation of some of these big tech names. So, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet, they were down about 3 to 5 percent today. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), in a note this morning, made a very simple but important point. These big tech names are traditionally cyclical growth stocks. In other words, they`re volatile.</p><p>But everyone has been acting like they`re boring consumer staple stocks, which is usually not volatile, and everybody has bought them aggressively assuming they would go up with no risk at all. They warned that the stocks have gone up so much that the trend could quickly reverse.</p><p>And they`re right, it`s a good point. And, in fact, that`s exactly what happened today, to all these the big names, as well as some of the big semiconductor names that have also had big run-ups. For example, Nvidia and Advanced Micro.</p><p>So, what does all this mean? Well, it means kind of what it always means on Wall Street. When you have stocks that keep going up, it attracts a whole other class of buyers.</p><p>We call them momentum players. And essentially these momentum players are just along for the ride. Then something fundamental happens, you have the mildest of earnings or guidance disappointments, or in this case someone with influence like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) writes something that says, you know, fellas, this doesn`t make too much sense, and you get a selloff that suddenly accelerates.</p><p>All right. So, is this a cause for concern? For the moment, no. I think it`s a relief. There are some signs traders are taking the money and buying less-loved sectors like banks and energy stocks. That would be a healthy rotation using overbought tech stocks as a source of funds to buy under-owned bank and energy names.</p><p>So, the verdict so far: at least for the moment this does not appear the start of an overall correction.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The election results in the United Kingdom could impact the single biggest economic issue that that country faces -- Brexit.</p><p>Wilfred Frost gave us the preliminary results last night. He is back for us tonight from London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILFRED FROST, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Uncertainty struck the United Kingdom overnight as the initial results from the general election revealed the U.K. was headed for a hung parliament, where no party wins a clear majority.</p><p>The pound plunged in response and Theresa May`s opponents called for her resignation.</p><p>JEREMY CORBYN, LABOUR PARTY LEADER: The prime minister called for the election because she wanted a mandate. Well, the mandate she`s got is lost conservative seats, lost support, and lost confidence. I would have thought that`s enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.</p><p>FROST: But as the final results emerged, Theresa May did win enough seats, along with the help of the small Northern Irish DUP Party to return to Downing Street.</p><p>Prime minister, but her standing much diminished, as she failed to increase her majority as planned.</p><p>THERESA MAY, U.K. PRIME MINISTER: I wanted to achieve a larger majority. But that was not the result that we secured. And I`m sorry for all those candidates and hard working party workers who weren`t successful, but also particularly sorry for those colleagues who were MPs and ministers who contributed so much to our country and who lost their seats and didn`t deserve to lose their seats. And as I reflect on the results, I will reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward.</p><p>FROST: The other big takeaway was the Brexit negotiations would begin as planned in ten days` time, but with the U.K.`s negotiating team much weakened by this grueling election. That might explain why European Council President Donald Tusk was so keen to get started.</p><p>In a letter to Theresa May today, he spoke of their shared responsibility and named it an urgent task to begin negotiations. He also reiterated the March 2019 cutoff date. He even expressed his congratulations on her reappointment. That line no doubt written with a wry smile on his face.</p><p>The bottom line, May is weaker. The U.K. is weaker. The pound weaker as a result.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Wilfred Frost, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Leaders of the House Intelligence Committee say they have asked the White House counsel to see whether there are any records of the former FBI director`s conversations with the president. The panel also asked James Comey for his notes and memos of that same conversation.</p><p>And in a fiery news conference, the president forcefully accused Mr. Comey of not being completely truthful.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We were very, very happy and frankly, James Comey confirmed lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just weren`t true.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The president also said he would be glad to state his case to the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.</p><p>A consumer protection aimed at retirement advisers is set to go into effect today, at least for now. The Labor Department is still reviewing the regulation and is expected to make some changes later.</p><p>Kayla Tausche has more on the effect of the new rule.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The so-called Fiduciary Rule keeps retirement advisers from favoring their commission- based products over their customers` interests.</p><p>As of today, they have to abide by the spirit of the rule. Large brokerages have already made changes. For instance, Merrill Lynch gave customers a choice to move to a different platform or pay a fee. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) offering fewer products. UBS is changing broker compensation to eliminate the conflict.</p><p>Smaller broker deals have made big changes. Ameriprise has dropped hundreds of funds, and LPL Financial revamped its pricing. Some independent firms have frozen assets while the rule is under review.</p><p>Clients are affected if their retirement account and 401ks are managed by commission-based adviser or commission-based accounts. Money managers may ask (ph) customers to opt back into these accounts to ensure they actually want to be in them.</p><p>The Obama administration estimated the rule would save Americans $17 billion in fees. But it will likely change again before a final January deadline. The Labor Department still reviewing it and the department has 38 political appointments vacant that will be important here.</p><p>Asset managers also are traditionally regulated by the FCC. That agency will want a say in how it`s written and enforced and the industry has requested the agency`s involvement too. The wild card, how Congress tackles large scale financial reform and if they decide to roll back the rule completely.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Chris Carosa joins us now to discuss what that new fiduciary rule as it stands now will mean for you. He is founder and fiduciary expert at Carosa Asset Management.</p><p>Good to see you, Chris. Welcome.</p><p>CHRIS CAROSA, CAROSA ASSET MANAGEMENT FOUNDER: Hi, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: So, bottom line this for me, what are consumers going to see and investors going to see that will look or appear or be different?</p><p>CAROSA: Well, it`s likely that they won`t see anything dramatic right away. Over time, primarily those who are rolling over IRAs from their existing retirement accounts will begin to see new language in the agreements, which is called a best interest contract exemption. And that discloses to the new rollover that there may be an opportunity for the provider to offer products that would normally contain what`s called conflict of interest fees.</p><p>And this is a way for the client to sign off on that and allow them to do it provided it`s still in their best interests.</p><p>HERERA: Although it`s not necessarily, it doesn`t sound like it`s written in an easy way to understand.</p><p>CAROSA: Maybe, maybe not. There`s no really formal template for how this language will appear. My thinking is it will probably be maybe a paragraph or two. But that doesn`t mean that`s how it will be.</p><p>HERERA: OK. What questions do investors need to ask, as this rule rolls into effect? As you say, we won`t see the changes immediately, but as we get closer to the final version and it does go into effect, what questions should they be asking their financial fiduciary?</p><p>CAROSA: Remember, the actual name of the rule is the conflict of interest rule. And I think that`s what investors should focus in on. They should ask their adviser, what types of fee arrangements do we have? Are they traditional conflict of interest fees such as commissions, 12B-1 fees or revenue sharing?</p><p>These are the type of fees, sometimes they`re disclosed in the mutual fund but not all times, because the SEC doesn`t require a clear disclosure for revenue sharing. So, you`ve got to ask the adviser if that`s the type of fee that you`re paying. And then you might want to consider whether or not that`s the type of fee you want to pay, because you don`t have to.</p><p>HERERA: And I assume that you need to ask those questions, because when you look at your statements and when you look at your financial plan, sometimes, it`s a little bit difficult to find out where those fees and those other exemptions are in the physical document.</p><p>CAROSA: That`s true. In 2012, the DOL came out with a rule called the 401(k) mutual fund fee disclosure which was supposed to address this. But, unfortunately, again, they didn`t provide a template, so we have all different forms of disclosure, which are often very difficult to read, even for professionals.</p><p>HERERA: Well, on that note, that means we`ll have to have you back when they finally finish it up and we get the final product.</p><p>Chris, thank you very much.</p><p>CAROSA: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Chris Carosa with Carosa Asset Management.</p><p>Still ahead tonight, the 51st state? Investors will be watching a key vote this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LESLIE PICKER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: We spoke with residents, investors, and government officials here in Puerto Rico about a big statehood vote this Sunday. We`ll tell you all about it, coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: An historic vote in Puerto Rico this weekend. One hundred years after being granted U.S. citizenship, Puerto Ricans will vote on whether to become the 51st state. And it comes at a time of deep financial uncertainty for the island.</p><p>Leslie Picker is in San Juan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PICKER: Flags adorning the bright rows of colonial buildings underscore the sentiment of statehood here in Puerto Rico. Oftentimes, you`ll find the Puerto Rican flags next to American one, the blue part of the flag matching. But then you`ll also see Puerto Rican flags by themselves, with a lighter shade of blue. That signifies independence.</p><p>This question of status will be the focus of a vote taking place on Sunday. Puerto Ricans will go to the polls to determine whether or not they want to become a U.S. state, sovereign nation, or remain a commonwealth, which is something in between.</p><p>Puerto Rico has been in a recession for 10 years and is grappling with $120 billion of debt and unfunded pension liabilities, that caused it to seek bankruptcy protection last month. About 40 percent of U.S. municipal bond funds have exposure to Puerto Rican bonds, with billions of dollars worth of exposure.</p><p>Tensions here are high. Residents we spoke with said becoming a state could solve their economic problems. Others blame the U.S. for the mess on the island and would prefer to keep their commonwealth status or seek sovereignty.</p><p>SOCORRO OLIVENCIA, PUERTO RICAN RESIDENT: There is the feeling, you know, that you can`t trust that anymore. That is very hard.</p><p>PICKER: And not everyone in the U.S. is in full support, wary that they would have to take on the burden of a bankrupt municipality if Puerto Rico votes for statehood. But according to government officials on the island, Vice President Mike Pence has pledged to support the Puerto Rican statehood should residents vote that way.</p><p>Governor Ricardo Rossello who campaigned on the promise of statehood before winning election in November defended Puerto Rico`s rights.</p><p>RICARDO ANTONIO ROSSELLO, PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR: We wouldn`t want, you know, a bailout. I`m no fan of bailouts. I think we need to assume responsibility for what`s going on here. Statehood is an equal playing field for U.S. citizens that reside on the island.</p><p>PICKER: Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but they don`t have the same access to benefits as those on the mainland. While they can serve in the military, they can`t vote for their commander in chief. The topic is so important to elected officials here, they`ve spent $7 million on this weekend`s election, despite being bankrupt.</p><p>The Justice Department was supposed to provide $2.5 million in exchange for a say over the wording on the ballots. But that money has yet to arrive.</p><p>JENNIFER GONZALEZ-COLON, PUERTO RICO CONGRESSWOMAN: This is not about the money. I mean, this is more than that. So keep the money. Let us express ourselves. That`s what we`re going to have on Sunday.</p><p>PICKER: Gonzalez is confident that residents will vote for statehood, but it wouldn`t be the first time. Puerto Rico had a similar vote five years ago. But it`s up to Congress to write a statute welcoming Puerto Rico to becoming the 51st state.</p><p>So far, there hasn`t been willingness in Washington to do that.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Leslie Picker, San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And you can read more about what`s at stake when Puerto Rico goes to the polls on our website, NBR.com.</p><p>The U.S. is mostly clear to provide unfair support to Boeing (NYSE:BA). That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The World Trade Organization rejected claims by the European Union and Airbus that Boeing (NYSE:BA) had benefitted from billions of dollars of illegal subsidies. But it also ruled that the U.S. failed to eliminate a tax break in a key state. Both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus claimed victory over that decision. Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) were basically unchanged at $190.03.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission staff is advising the agency to prepare a lawsuit to block Walgreen`s nearly $10 billion deal to buy Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD). That`s according to a report by the trade publication \"Capital Forum\". Walgreen`s initially bid for its smaller drugstore rival back in 2015. Shares of Walgreen`s dropped 48 cents to $80.99. Shares of Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) plunged 15 percent to $3.</p><p>Sirius XM will make a $480 million investment in the music streaming company Pandora. The satellite radio company cited Pandora`s large user base and personalized music experience as tremendous assets. Shares of Sirius XM dropped 20 cents to $5.20. Pandora rose 10 cents to $8.52.</p><p>The FDA has requested Endo Pharma pull its opioid painkiller Opana ER off the market. This is the first time the agency has asked to remove a currently marketed opioid drug due to public health consequences of abuse. Shares of Endo Pharma dropped more than 16 percent to $11.49.</p><p>Time now for our market monitor, who says he`s finding value in some underappreciated names in the stock market right now. It`s not the first time on the program for him but it is as market monitor.</p><p>Let`s welcome back Timothy Lesko, portfolio manager with Granite Investment Advisers.</p><p>Welcome back, Tim. Nice to have you here.</p><p>TIMOTHY LESKO, GRANITE INVESTMENT ADVISORS PORTFOLIO MGR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: So, you`re saying that the market in certain sectors may look fairly valued or maybe fully valued or a little overvalued. But that`s not true of the overall market.</p><p>LESKO: Right. And that`s typical of the market. Usually you have certain sectors leading the marketplace. Over the past few years, that`s been a combination of the high flying technology stocks and some of the consumer staple stocks that pay a higher dividend. That has really left sectors like financials and like energy kind of in the dust. So, we find value in a lot of different areas in the market.</p><p>HERERA: You`re also looking at the so-called old tech. One of your picks tonight is Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). Why?</p><p>LESKO: Well, I think that the market over the past seven years has really been searching for secular growth stories, and leaving behind those cyclical stories that have been undervalued. So, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) kept going up, you saw stocks like IBM, or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for a period of time, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at different periods of time, lagging the market. And Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has been making a long term transition from selling software to people to selling software as a service.</p><p>And feel like that finally, that transition is in place and you might start seeing some top line growth, which the market has been so desperate for across technology.</p><p>HERERA: You`re wading into the energy sector, a fascinating sector to watch but not always an easy one to invest in this year. Royal Dutch Shell is your pick in that particular area of the market. Why do you like it?</p><p>LESKO: Well, that`s a great analogy, wading into the energy space. You like feel at times that you`re drowning in oil. That`s been the concern in the marketplace, is that we have an oversupply issue.</p><p>And we think that will work itself out. Oil demand really hasn`t wavered over the past three or four years, despite some predictions by the governing agencies. As well as concerns about economic growth across Asia. So, as demand continues to move forward, we think it will soak up excess in the marketplace.</p><p>And Royal Dutch pays you a nice close to 7 percent yield while you wait for that market equilibrium to hit. So, it`s been a nice place for value investors like us to at least get some revenue while we wait for, you know, the oil market to right itself.</p><p>HERERA: And you`re going a little broader with your last week, Walmart and that`s based on their distribution.</p><p>LESKO: Right. And that to me is one of the favorite stories to talk to people about, really only because in a world where every retailer fears Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), there are few people that can compete with what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is really good at, and that is the logistic side of it, where Walmart already has those products in place in your geography. And as the world moves toward, whether it be same-day delivery via Uber or Lyft, or drones are going to land on your doorstep, Walmart has those products in your neighborhood already.</p><p>So, they probably have a leg up on a lot of their competition. And they`ve been a logistics juggernaut for years. And now, they`ve just had to figure out the Internet side of it. And some of the recent acquisitions have really helped them do that.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, Tim, thank you so much. Have a great weekend.</p><p>LESKO: Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA: Timothy Lesko with Granite Investment Advisers.</p><p>And coming up, is it better to buy or rent in this market? What a new report says about one of the biggest financial decisions you`ll ever make.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: It seems more Americans are not paying off their credit card bills. In the past two quarters, banks reported a steep rise in charge- offs, which is debt that they cannot collect from their customers. According to a report from Moody`s (NYSE:MCO), the increase is the largest since 2009 and is especially unusual since the job market is improving.</p><p>Well, if you`re planning on house hunting this weekend, you might want to do a little math first. For several years, it has been cheaper and more lucrative to buy a home than to rent. But that equation apparently is shifting quickly.</p><p>Diana Olick shows us where that change is happening the most.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After the housing crash, when home prices plummeted, it fast became not only cheaper to buy a home than rent, but it was also a better investment to own in terms of wealth accumulation.</p><p>Now, with home prices still rising quickly, and rents starting to ease, the math is shifting. Nationally, the rent versus buy equation is heading steadily into the rent territory, according to an index from Florida Atlantic University, which factors in home prices, rents, mortgage rates, as well as alternative investments to gain wealth.</p><p>Of 23 cities that the index measures, 11 are still in \"buy\" territory, some very clearly, like Chicago, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. Nine, including South Diego, Philadelphia, and L.A., hover right around zero, meaning a toss-up. Three cities, Dallas, Denver, and Houston, are in historically high territory for renting being the better option.</p><p>The main thing is that all of the cities are steadily moving toward rent, because home prices are so high, mortgage rates are expected to rise, and other investments are giving better returns. This may be why another index, measuring home buyer sentiment, is falling. The monthly Fannie Mae survey found those who said now is a good time to buy fell to its lowest level ever. In addition, fewer people were confident about holding onto their jobs.</p><p>Clearly, affordability in housing is weighing on the market as more millennials age into their home buying years, demand will surely increase. But affordability may still stand in the way.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And finally tonight, Powerball fever. The jackpot has grown to more than $400 million. So, we decided to take a moment and daydream about what all that money could buy.</p><p>Here`s Robert Frank.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, if there is a winner for Saturday`s Powerball jackpot, the lifetime payout would be $435 million. The lump sum, which is recommended, would be $273 million or only around $200 million once Uncle Sam takes his cut. State and local taxes and the federal bill later in April could bring the total to under $150 million, but that still leaves you with some good walking around money.</p><p>You could buy this house in Beverly Hills, California, with a gold champagne room, a gold Rolls-Royce and a gold Lamborghini, and not one but two pools. That`s 100 million bucks.</p><p>If you want a little faster car, you can buy the new Bugatti Chiron which tops 288 miles an hour for only around 3 million bucks. Now, you could have bought two of the most expensive diamonds ever sold, the pink star, 59.6 karats, pink flawless, for $71 million.</p><p>Now, if you want to quit your job and retire on that yacht, you can hop aboard the $80 million silver fast. It`s 250 feet. It`s got an outdoor cinema, eight-person glass Jacuzzi, dining table for 20, and, of course, a helipad for going to and from the bank.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that`s it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera.</p><p>We want to remind you, this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>Thank you. We`ll see you Monday.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Billionaire investors say it`s OK to raise the capital gains tax rate, but that may not be what`s best for individual investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, June 10th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Investors started the week with some welcome news. Two major mergers were announced and a deal was reached over the weekend that averted tariffs on all imports from Mexico. That lifted sentiment on Wall Street, which in turn lifted stocks.</p><p>The major indexes built on last week`s big gains turning in their longest win streak in more than a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 78 points to 26,062, the Nasdaq added 81 and the S&amp;P 500 was up 13.</p><p>Bob Pisani starts us off tonight from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks were in rally mode on this Monday with the Dow rising for its sixth straight day seeing its longest winning streak since May of last year, although the market ended well off the highs. Trade talk optimism once again sparks the move higher after President Donald Trump said the U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement to suspend tariffs indefinitely.</p><p>Well, it`s no surprise the trade sectors led the market higher. Trade sensitive groups, semiconductors, retailers, industrials, they all outperformed but what a roller coast coaster this has been. We had historic highs in early May.</p><p>The S&amp;P dropped 7 percent in the next 5 weeks or so on China trade wars and then Mexican tariff worries. But it`s rallied back in the next week. We`re up 6 percent in a week, knocking right on the door of the old historic high for the S&amp;P 500. That`s 2, 945. We did get through 2,900 today, though closed below that. That`s the good news.</p><p>The bad news is stocks aren`t cheap anymore. They`re pricing in a lot of good news. Remember we did not have a China deal even though the market is acting like we do have one and we have not had great economic numbers out of the U.S. or, in fact, out of Europe recently, so weaker global growth is an issue with or without trade.</p><p>Another Dow component hit new highs today, Visa (NYSE:V), Walmart, American Express (NYSE:EXPR) (NYSE:AXP) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). In fact, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) broke the $1 trillion mark today and aerospace and defense names also rode the rally, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), got a boost from this announced mega merger between Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And yes, as Bob just mentioned, United Tech and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) are joining forces. It`s one of the biggest corporate deals of the year so far and during today`s trading session, both stocks moved in opposite directions.</p><p>As Morgan Brennan reports right now, this merger puts a lot of products and systems under one roof.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s a move that`s stunned experts -- a merger of equals between Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).</p><p>THOMAS KENNEDY, RAYTHEON CEO: We wind up with a great company that is about 50 percent domestic, 50 percent international, 50 percent defense, 50 percent commercial. It`s a very stable, resilient company moving forward and it`s all built on this great technology base.</p><p>BRENNAN: The all stock deal is expected to close next year as United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) spins off its Otis elevator and carrier building system segments. It would combine one of the world`s largest defense contractors with one of the top aerospace suppliers, to create Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Technologies, valued at more than $100 billion and second only to Boeing (NYSE:BA) in sales.</p><p>This would bring missiles like the Tomahawk and missile defense programs like the Patriot system together with airplane avionics and jet engines made not only for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus but for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets as well.</p><p>Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Technologies could be positioned to benefit from more defense spending and more commercial orders. While greater scale could also mean the ability to weather any future slowdowns more smoothly.</p><p>GREG HAYES, UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CEO: The commercial aero side, we expect growth around 6 percent, 7 percent annually for the next 5 years. Tom, with everything that he`s won and the modernization focus of the DOD, he`s probably looking at about 5 percent or 6 percent growth. So this is not about one company growing and the other not.</p><p>BRENNAN: They expect a billion dollars in cost synergies by year four but really, it`s all about the technology -- 38,000 patents, $8 billion in research and development, and more than 60,000 engineers. Even though their products don`t overlap, the underlying technologies, be it A.I. and analytics or engineering techniques could be applied to different production lines across commercial and defense.</p><p>Still, the news was greeted by President Trump with at least initially some skepticism.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When I hear United and I hear Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), which is another incredible company, the missile systems they make are incredible, when I hear they`re merging, does that take away more competition? It becomes one big fat beautiful company.</p><p>BRENNAN: Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and United Tech say they`re complementary, not competitive. They say they`ll create more U.S. jobs and they promise to reduce costs to the government since they`ll be able to bid aggressively on future defense contracts.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: But that wasn`t the only deal today. Salesforce is buying Tableau Software for about $16 billion, making this one of the largest software acquisitions ever. As typically happens, the company being acquired rose sharply while the acquirer fell.</p><p>Josh Lipton dives into the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Groundbreaking. That`s how analysts are describing Salesforce`s decision to buy Tableau Software. It`s one of the largest software acquisitions ever.</p><p>Analysts say the deal is transformative, because it means Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff can offer his business customers something they desperately want, more ways to gather, order, and analyze the data they collect. That`s what Tableau does. It has more than 86,000 customers, including Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, ELEVATION PARTNERS CO-FOUNDER: What an amazing transaction for the tableau shareholder. I mean, they are about to be in a business where their biggest competitors were going to be Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and all of a sudden, they get bought out at a 50 percent premium. I mean, that is -- I mean, we`re breaking out the champagne on behalf of the Tableau shareholder because that was a great outcome.</p><p>LIPTON: Cloud companies from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) all understand that this is a hot market to capitalize on and they`re working to innovate or acquire their way into advanced analytics. It`s why Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) just last week bought a data analytics company called Looker for nearly $3 billion.</p><p>Analysts say this deal is a shot across the bow at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), extending the rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from sales tracking software to the analytics market. But for some, this deal also sparked concern that Benioff knows he can no longer grow his company as fast independently and that he will now have to go out and pay for that growth.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now that tariffs on Mexican imports have been averted at least for now, attention turns back to China and a new report out today from that country showed a decline in Chinese imports, perhaps an indication that the trade war is reducing demand there. And the icy relationship between the U.S. and China was punctuated over the weekend when Treasury Secretary Mnuchin defended the use of tariffs and said that there could be more coming.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Chinese expert data for May beat expectations. It appears that manufacturers front-loaded shipments or rushed orders after President Trump threatened to slap more tariffs on $300 billion worth of goods.</p><p>Experts jumped 1 percent, blowing past consensus of a fall of 3.8 percent. Imports suggested lackluster domestic demand. The trade surplus with the demand widened to a four-month high to $27 billion. Most analysts believe weak global growth and the trade war will hurt the chances of a recovery in the second half and lead to more stimulus.</p><p>Separately, China responded to Mnuchin`s assertion that Presidents Trump and Xi would meet at the G20 in June. The foreign ministry refused to confirm the meeting, saying: We have noticed the United States has repeatedly expressed this expectation. If there is concrete news on this, China will release it in a timely manner.</p><p>China is likely assessing the risks of having President Xi Jinping meet with President Trump. The Chinese won`t want President Xi to be publicly humiliated at the same time they`ll want to appear like the consistent partner and the U.S.-China relationship, which suggests that they would want to have the meeting.</p><p>The bottom line, though, is that from the Chinese perspective, a Trump-Xi meeting at the G20 is not a done deal.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, what does all of this mean for the Fed and the odds of a rate cut?</p><p>Steve Liesman has that part of the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Despite a weekend deal with Mexico to avoid tariffs, markets are still betting on a series of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. The chance of a rate cut is priced in futures markets running around 80 percent, so what would it take for the Fed to lower rates? The Fed meets next week and they`re expected to stay on hold but perhaps signal possible cuts coming in July.</p><p>A cut might come if Presidents Trump and Xi either don`t meet in Japan later this month at the G20 gathering or if they meet and can`t strike a deal. In that case, the president said in a CNBC interview today that additional tariffs could be levied on Chinese goods.</p><p>A weak second quarter growth could all seal the deal for a fed rate cut. Some Fed watchers expect a mini-easing cycle by the Fed, consisting of two or three rate cuts.</p><p>KRISHNA GUHA, EVERCORE ISI: What does it do? Well, obviously, it supports asset prices and credit conditions. It softens the dollar a little bit. It would help sectors like housing that are beginning to benefit from lower ten-year yields.</p><p>Is it totally transformative? No. Does it help lean against this extreme uncertainty from trade? Yes, it does.</p><p>LIESMAN: And there are those who say the Fed may decide to hold the line. New York Fed President John Williams last week said he knows what markets are pricing in for the Fed but he declined to endorse it.</p><p>TORSTEN SLOK, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: The bottom line is that the constantly we`re hit by shocks and the question is, assessing the magnitude of these shocks is critical and we just don`t really know at this point if it`s required to have deep cuts and rates that the market is pricing at the moment.</p><p>LIESMAN: So, there`s some risk the Fed doesn`t deliver but most economies say another round of tariffs or even tariff threats from the Trump administration would likely force the Fed to cut rates in response.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And from interest rate cuts to raising the capital gains tax. Just last week, billionaire hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller said that he would not have a problem with a hirer capital gains rate, but what about individual investors? How would this affect them if it were to happen?</p><p>Joining us right now with his assessment, Ben Phillips. He`s founder and chief investment officer of EventShares.</p><p>Ben, good to see you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, EVENTSHARES FOUNDER &amp; CIO: Thanks, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You know, among proponents, one of the arguments in favor of raising the cap gains tax is that many wage earners already pay a higher tax than capital gains tax rates. So, raising the cap gains rate would just level the playing field.</p><p>What do you say?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, you know, we looked at past examples in `81, `97 and 2003 when you saw the tax gains rate actually cut and you saw an increase in tax revenue. So, for the individual, we actually think that higher cap gains taxes means that they`re going to be less willing to invest in stocks and it reduces potential future growth as entrepreneurs are less willing to invest. And so, we think that just means lower stock market returns and lower income for retirees who are trying to monetize their stock portfolio.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, I was going to say, you make the point that basically for retirees who may still have significant exposure to the stock market, this actually cuts back on their ability to spend quite considerably.</p><p>PHILLIPS: That`s right. It`s kind of a double whammy, right? So, you have first the lower equity returns, lower stock market returns so you have that, plus you have the hit from the taxes so if we`re talking from going 20 percent to, let`s say, 35 percent, that`s almost doubling the tax burden on a sale.</p><p>So, you sell $100,000 stock position instead of, you know, just paying $20,000 to Uncle Sam, you`re paying $35,000 to Uncle Sam.</p><p>GRIFETH: And we often think of just the stock market when we`re talking about the capital gains rate, but this applies also to small business owners in many cases, doesn`t it?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Absolutely. I think it`s about a 50/50 between stock sales and other capital gains which include business sales. So, you think of an entrepreneur who, let`s say that, you know, they put in ten years of sweat equity, no cash equity. They sell their business for a million dollars and you`re talking about another $150,000 that they can`t invest -- reinvest in the business if we go from a 20 percent to a 35 percent tax rate.</p><p>So, that`s substantial. We think that`s a drag on growth. Small businesses are the engine for job creation. They`re the engine for innovation and U.S. economy. So, if we throw a wrench in that, we think that`s bad overall for U.S. growth.</p><p>HERERA: You also say it`s an easy tax to avoid, just don`t sell your shares.</p><p>PHILLIPS: That`s right. It is one of the easiest taxes to avoid, so there is some of that encouragement for might encourage a buy and hold investor. So, there might be some of that.</p><p>But again, you know, you have to ask the government, what is the intention of hiking the tax there? What would that mean? And they want to raise revenue but actually it`s counter to that. You hike cap gains tax, you see lower tax revenue typically the past three times it`s happened.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Ben Phillips with EventShares. Again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: Time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Tesla was upgraded to buy from neutral at Roth Capital. The analyst cites the potential for stronger demand from China. The price target is $238, the stock rose 4 percent to $212.88. Analog Devices (NYSE:ADI) was upgraded to buy from sell at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The analyst cites an improved growth outlook and exposure to multiple revenue drivers. The price target is $114 and the stock rose more than 5.5 percent to $106.55.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) issues a new credit card to help consumers build their credit, but is there a catch?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Insys Therapeutics has filed for bankruptcy. The filing comes days after the pharmaceutical company agreed to pay $225 million to settle federal charges over the sales of its opioid drug. Insys is the first drug manufacturer to turn to bankruptcy due to opioid-related legal expenses.</p><p>As you know, it is the story that we have been following for years from the first state investigations to doctors who were targeted by the company. And back in 2015, we did a series focused on the issue called \"pushing pain\".</p><p>GRIFFETH: Also as you know, big tech is facing antitrust scrutiny in Washington these days, and that includes Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which has ambitions far beyond its core social media platform.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The FTC will be taking a hard look at not just whether the tech giants are too big, but also whether the tech giants are unfairly using their dominance in their core areas to disadvantaged competitors.</p><p>DINA SRINIVASAN, ANTITRUST SCHOLAR: I think the focus is going to be on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). They both have very dominant positions in niche markets. For Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), it`s social networking. With Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), importantly, it`s advertising technology or ad tech, which is the piece of technology that publishers use to sell ads online. It`s also online search and those markets, they have a very dominant position.</p><p>BOORSTIN: With Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) now competing in a wide range of businesses from video games and e-sports to job postings and movie ticket sales, one question is whether Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is using its dominance in social media to promote, say, its own dating service.</p><p>The FTC will scrutinize Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) under the Federal Trade Commission Act. According to one law professor, who says it`s more flexible law and could recognize new forms of power and abuse, saying the FTC could decide that a dominant platform is a gatekeeper and abusing competitors on the platform would be unfair competition.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) was fined a record $2.7 billion by the E.U. in 2017 for giving an illegal advantage to its own online shopping service in search results. The FTC investigated Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for this but didn`t fine the company.</p><p>President Trump in an interview with CNBC Monday criticized large E.U. fines against U.S. big tech but said the antitrust issue is worth exploring.</p><p>TRUMP: I think it`s a bad situation but obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Experts saying that regulatory scrutiny is likely to be much more about policing these companies` behaviors rather than trying to break them up.</p><p>MICHAEL KATZ, HAAS SCHOOL OF BUSINESS PROFESSOR: I do believe the agencies are going to look closely at big tech, but I think it`s going to be much more drawn out and sort of in the trenches and details than people think. I just don`t think we`re going to see these sort of sweeping wholesale changes or break-ups that some people are talking about.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Now that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) enables its users to make phone calls and sell products, they`ll have to be careful to show it`s not disadvantaging new rivals, including the likes of mobile carriers and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: American Airlines extends flight cancellations of 737 MAX planes past Labor Day and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The airline carrier says it`s canceling more than 100 daily flights because of the grounding of the 737 MAX planes through September 3rd. Later than the previously planned August 19th date. Boeing (NYSE:BA) says it has finished a software patch for the 737 MAX planes but aviation officials have not signed off yet on those fixes. The plane was grounded in March following an Ethiopian Airlines crash, the second fatal crash in five months involving a MAX. Shares of American Airlines dropped a fraction to $30.76.</p><p>Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz says it`s completed an internal accounting investigation and changed its financial practices that triggered a regulator probe and steep decline in the food maker`s stock price. The company says it is taking actions to strengthen internal controls over financial reporting. Shares rose more than 5 percent to $30.31.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Private equity firm Apollo Global is buying online digital photo services company Shutterfly (NASDAQ:SFLY). Apollo is going to pay $51 in a share that values Shutterfly (NASDAQ:SFLY) around $2.7 billion. Shutterfly (NASDAQ:SFLY) was up more than 2 percent in the regular session today to $50.25.</p><p>And Merck (NYSE:MRK) is buying pharmaceutical company Tilos Therapeutics. That`s a deal valued at around $773 million. The acquisition gives Merck (NYSE:MRK) control of a pipeline of cancer, fibrosis and autoimmune disease treatments. Merck (NYSE:MRK) was up a fraction today to $82.48.</p><p>HERERA: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is launching a new credit card for prime members with no credit history or bad credit. The card will be called Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Credit Builder and it will allow users to build up their credit through a secured card, while getting perks like 5 percent cash back on purchases.</p><p>What are the pros and the cons?</p><p>Well, Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate joins us now to talk about that.</p><p>Greg, nice to have you here.</p><p>GREG MCBRIDGE, CHIEF FINANCIAL ANALYST, BANKRATE: Thank you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: You know, it seems as though it`s a good idea for those who are, quote, unquote, unbanked, don`t have access to credit, but it seems the devil is in the details. One instance is an extremely high interest rate.</p><p>MCBRIDGE: Very high, even by retail card standards. The interest rate is over 28 percent. Retail cards by nature tend to have higher rates to begin with but even 28 percent is really at the top end.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And that`s on a secured card, so you deposit money and that becomes your credit line and yet you`re still paying the 28 percent. The other thing that strikes me is you can only use the card to buy items on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). That`s a new wrinkle.</p><p>MCBRIDE: Yes, and this is a -- what`s called a closed loop card, so like a lot of retail cards you can only use it at that particular retailer. So this retail-type card but having a secured card , that`s kind of a new wrinkle. And you`re right, you make a deposit that`s equal to your credit line, anywhere between $100 to $1,000 that really takes away a lot of the risk for the issuer and also for the card holder. But again, paying 28 percent, you don`t have to keep a balance for too long and you have more than wiped out any cash back they`re giving you on those purchases.</p><p>HERERA: So, it comes down to discipline, does it not, in terms of if you get one of these cards, you need to pay off the balance completely.</p><p>MCBRIDE: Absolutely. I mean, it is a lot like a sharp kitchen knife in the right hands, it`s a very useful tool. In the wrong hands, it can be dangerous. With an interest rate of over 28 percent, if you`re carrying a balance, that`s dangerous.</p><p>If you`re trying to establish credit, don`t fall for this notion that you have to carry a balance in order to build credit. You don`t. You can make small token purchases, pay it off in full every month, build credit very effectively that way, not incur finance charges. And if you`re a prime member, you can get 5 percent back on those purchases.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But it does highlight the number of people who are either underbanked or unbanked completely. They`re taking advantage -- they`re looking into this opportunity to reach those people who wouldn`t otherwise have an opportunity to have a card, right?</p><p>MCBRIDE: Yes, Bill, I mean, this has been, really, I think, the area where a lot of financial institutions and even some nonfinancial institutions have been trying to tap into this market -- the unbanked and the underbanked consumer, viewing that as a potential growth area. But on the other side of that, if you`re the consumer, you`ve got a real incentive to do what you can to pay that bill on time, not run up balances that you can`t pay back and then eventually translate to an unsecured card.</p><p>HERERA: Greg, as always, thank you. Greg McBride with Bankrate.</p><p>Coming up, help wanted, the power of wind and the job skills that are in demand.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The number of job openings remain near a record in April and it exceeded the number of unemployed Americans by the largest margin on record. According to the Labor Department, there were about 7.5 million unfilled jobs, meaning that employers are still having a hard time finding the right workers.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And that is especially true in the wind power industry which is experiencing record growth right now. Many businesses there are hanging out the help wanted sign and Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) went to one of those companies in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In 2018, Jason Urichich was at a crossroads, after losing his home and landscaping business in Youngstown, Ohio. He decided to pursue a six month program for wind turbine technicians.</p><p>JASON URICHICH, AVANGRID RENEWABLES SENIOR LEAD TECHNICIAN: I was really interested just in the small turbines at home, trying to build one myself. I decided that maybe I didn`t know enough about it. Maybe I should go to school for it.</p><p>ROGERS: That maybe turned into a career for him, who`s now a senior lead technician for Avangrid Renewables in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania.</p><p>With 114,000 fulltime jobs supported by wind energy in 2018, from construction to manufacturing, the American Wind Energy Association says workers like Urichich will be in demand for years to come with projects under way nationwide. Turbine technicians make a median of $50,000 annually. But in the face of a tight labor market, companies are aggressively recruiting across state lines, offering signing bonuses and competitive benefits.</p><p>With 60 wind facilities and another five in development, Avangrid Renewables says talent retention is a top concern.</p><p>LAURA BEANE, AVANGRID RENEWABLES CEO: We`ve been doing a lot at the local colleges and schools and even starting in the high school area because it doesn`t require a four year degree. It`s really a commitment to safety, first and foremost, mechanical aptitude and problem solvers. And so when you look across our workforce of technicians, they come from all different backgrounds.</p><p>ROGERS: Manufacturers do make parts for turbines like these ones domestically, but the supply chain is also global. So, tariffs on imported Chinese goods could hinder job growth moving forward.</p><p>TOM KIERNAN, AWEA CEO: We would have been hiring more people if it weren`t for the current tariffs, and if the tariffs increase as the president is proposing, that will either further reduce our growth or could at some point lead to a decline in the number of jobs in the wind industry.</p><p>ROGERS: Political uncertainties aside, technicians like Clayton Karenek say the job is rewarding.</p><p>CLAYTON KARENEK, AVANGRID RENEWABLES WIND TECHNICIAN: It`s like working on a big car. It`s satisfying. It pays good. The benefits are good. You know, kind of makes you feel like you`re doing a little bit good for the environment, even if it`s just small.</p><p>ROGERS: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street today. The Dow rose 78 points, the Nasdaq added 81 and the S&amp;P 500 was up 13.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth.

We need to re-think our approach to antitrust and to merger approval.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Mergers in trouble? Attorneys general sue to block T-Mobile from merging with Sprint, and that`s not the only deal being questioned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Taking charge. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) has a new CEO and she`s determined to pick up where the last chief executive left off.</p><p>HERERA: Anytime, anywhere. The future of gaming and the technology powering it.</p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, June 11th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>We begin tonight with big corporate mergers and a push to stop some of them. Today, 10 state attorneys general sued to block the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint which would be reducing the number of major U.S. wireless telecom providers from four to three. The mergers have been in the works for years, but the New York A.G. said today that bigger is not always better and that such a deal would be bad for consumers, innovation and workers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES: The T-Mobile and Sprint merger would not only cause irreparable harm to mobile subscribers nationwide by cutting access it affordable, reliable wireless service for millions of Americans, but would particularly affect lower income and minority communities here in New York and urban areas across the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The FCC has yet to formally rule on the deal and the Justice Department is still reviewing it, as well. Today`s news sent shares of both Sprint and T-Mobile lower.</p><p>HERERA: And CVS` $69 billion acquisition of Aetna (NYSE:AET) is facing a potential legal challenge. In an unusual case, the federal judge could reportedly block the deal even though it already closed late last year. Shares of CVS (NYSE:CVS) fell about 2 percent in today`s session.</p><p>Bertha Coombs has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Aetna`s merger closed last November, but U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon still has not signed off on the Justice Department`s approval of the deal, holding hearings on concerns from consumer groups who said the DOJ did not go far enough to protect seniors. The DOJ required the company for the Aetna (NYSE:AET) 2 million member Medicare Part D drug plan business, selling it to rival insurer WellCare. \"The New York Post\" claims the judge appears poised to block the merger citing an anonymous source close to CVS (NYSE:CVS).</p><p>CVS (NYSE:CVS) shot back, telling NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT that we, quote, will not be distracted by rumors.</p><p>David Balto, an attorney for consumer groups opposing the deal, says that judge could ask further conditions on the divestitures. He notes last year, Judge Leon ruled against the Trump administration to block the AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)-Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) merger and that decision prevailed on appeal.</p><p>But in this case, some antitrust analyst say the judge cannot reverse the CVS (NYSE:CVS) merger under legal statute known as the Tunney Act because it goes beyond the scope of the settlement approval itself and such a ruling would likely be reversed on appeal. Final arguments in the case are scheduled for mid-July.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who is a large United Technology shareholder, today urged that company to call off its planned merger with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN). He says it makes no strategic sense and as we reported yesterday, President Trump expressed concern that that deal could kill competition.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When I hear United and I hear Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), which is another incredible company, the missile systems they make are incredible. When I hear they`re merging, does that take away more competition? It becomes one big, fat, beautiful company, but I have to negotiate, meaning the United States has to buy things, and does that make it less competitive? Because it`s already non-competitive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Shares of both Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and United Tech came under pressure in today`s session.</p><p>HERERA: In Washington, Congress opened its antitrust investigation into big tech. The House Judiciary Committee planned several hearings and interviews as part of its probe into whether the dominance of companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) have decreased competition.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): I strongly believe that this investigation is long overdue. This subcommittee has a constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of our antitrust laws and competition system to ensure that they`re probably working.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The committee plans to explore a number of issues related to the industry. Today, the focus was on the big impact big tech has had on publishers and also the news industry.</p><p>GRIFFETH: To the markets now. On Wall Street, the Dow snapped its six-day win streak. The stocks had opened strong on reports of stimulus measures taken by the Chinese government to juice its economy, but that rally fizzled and the industrial average by the close was down 14 points to 26,048, the Nasdaq fell a fraction and the S&amp;P was down one point.</p><p>Today`s pullback has some investors wondering whether the recent rally can be trusted.</p><p>Mike Santoli is at the New York Stock Exchange tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks have recovered most of the ground they lost with the S&amp;P 500 now less than 3 percent from the record high, and investors seemed not ready to embrace this rebound rally just yet. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch said its clients sent a trickle of new cash each if the market is 4 percent. An indicator of investor sentiment calls the free gear index remains in the fearful zone at 35 on a zero to 100 scale, and the so-called volatility index has not declined in recent days as it usually does in a rising market, a sign that traders continue to pay up for options that give protection against the market drop over the next month.</p><p>This persistent caution among investors likely has a lot to do with the confusing economic crosscurrent and the series of crucial events that could swing markets around in coming weeks. Friday`s employment report solidified expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in coming months and with the Fed set to meet next week, plenty of suspense remains over its intentions and whether a rate cut can support the economy and lift inflation should be welcome.</p><p>The G-20 meeting of world leaders in the end of June could be the site of a meeting between President Trump and China`s President Xi to hammer out a trade deal, but no firm plans are set, and the U.S. stands to ready to extend tariffs to another $300 billion in Chinese imports around that time.</p><p>Meantime, the S&amp;P itself is near levels where it peaked three times since January 2018, explaining some hesitation among investors to buy aggressively right now today`s prices, sometimes a backdrop of caution and skepticism is a positive for market performance looking forward, but only if investors` worse fears are not realized.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And a new report shows inflation ticked higher last month. The producer price index, which measures the wholesale prices businesses received for their goods and services raised 5 percent compared to the previous month. That was in line with expectations. Prices for consumer services rose, led by an unusually large increase in hotel room rentals and costs for medical care were also higher.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Jason Ware joins us now to talk about the inflation data, what it means for the Fed and the economy. He`s chief investment officer with Albion Financial Group.</p><p>Good to see you again. Welcome back.</p><p>JASON WARE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ALBION FINANCIAL GROUP: Thanks for having me. Good to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH: As you well know, there is a wide spectrum of forecasts on Wall Street about what the Fed`s going to do with interest rates this year. Barclays, for example, says three cuts before the end of the year, totaling 75 bases points. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said no cuts at all this year.</p><p>Where do you fall on this, bearing in mind what we`re seeing about inflation right now?</p><p>WARE: Right. So, I think a lot of those targets and predictions are reactionary to what the federal funds future market is saying that there`s an expectation among market participants that the Fed is going to cut twice this year.</p><p>Our view is that while it`s certainly possible that they could cut once or twice this year, that the likelihood of that happening is fairly low. I think odds on is that they continue to being patient with the economic data. I don`t think there`s any push for them to cut rates given the fact that inflation while certainly slowing to some degree still continues to bounce around within a range that we`ve seen for the better part of this economic expansion, the 1.5 to 2 percent core.</p><p>So, it`s certainly possible and I think if they were to make any move, it`s probably a cut, more than a hike, but we`ll see what happens over the next six, seven months.</p><p>HERERA: Do you see -- as you mentioned, inflation is kind of all over the board depending on which commodity or which measure you choose to look at, but do you see inflation ticking up in your work?</p><p>WARE: So, the Fed prefers to look at core PCE. We think that`s the right measure to try to evaluate where inflation is. There`s not much that we`re seeing out there that suggests that we have any kind of hot inflation. Certainly, having 2 percent is a reasonable inflation level, if economy is well-balanced which it seems to be.</p><p>The Fed seems to have -- at least under Yellen -- seemed to have a bit of a tolerance to let it run hotter than that, but it`s consistently been under- target for the better part of the last ten years and I think it`s likely to remain there given the body of evidence that we`ve seen.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And then you have the trade tensions with China. The president has certainly called for the Fed to cut rates to help in the trade war with China. It makes our goods cheaper, maybe the demand remains strong even as the tariffs go up.</p><p>Do you think that becomes a factor for the Fed at all?</p><p>WARE: I certainly think if the trade war were to be protracted and indeed take up -- pick up to another level, we might start to see a little bit of inflation coming from the trade war and goods. But I think it`s also worth noting that if there`s any economic slowdown as a result of the trade war, then that certainly runs counter to that and may provide inflation inertia. What we`re seeing is rising wages when we look at the jobs reports, we are still north of 3 percent, have been for 10 straight months. I think that`s probably more of an indicator to watch, where inflation could go from here.</p><p>But there are so many secular disinflationary forces out there that it`s keeping a lid on inflation, but it`s hard for us to make a strong case to make anything run, you know, 2-1/2, 3 percent anytime soon. So, as long as we stay sub 2 percent on core, I think the Fed is going to be fairly patient and see where things go.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Jason Ware with Albion Financial Group, again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>WARE: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Well, you would think with all of the information online that today`s potential homebuyers would be more informed about the mortgage process than ever before, but that apparently is not the case.</p><p>Diana Olick has the results of a new report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After the foreclosure crisis a decade ago, mortgage lending tightened up and new regulations were put in place. But consumers today apparently think it`s a lot harder to get a home loan than it really is, a growing number of consumers said they had seen their credit score recently, thanks to a myriad of credit monitoring sites, but nearly half couldn`t remember what this core was according to a recent Fannie Mae survey.</p><p>The survey also found that consumers either didn`t know or overestimated the minimum credit score needed to qualify for a loan. Half of those asked were unsure and the third thought it needed to be higher than 620, but the minimum is actually 550. Both current home owners and renters were equally uninformed.</p><p>Consumers also overestimated the required down payment. Most either didn`t know or thought it had to be 10 percent or higher.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe about 30 percent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: About 20 percent. I`m assuming, but no, I don`t know the details. It`s very overwhelming.</p><p>OLICK: In reality, the FHA-backed loans with a minimum down payment of 3- 1/2 percent and there are other programs through the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Veterans Affairs that offer zero down payment option. Consumers can qualify for a mortgage with as much as half their income going toward debt payments, but the majority of consumers said they didn`t know what the level was and most others said the limit was 40 percent.</p><p>Fannie Mae`s chief economist said it`s impossible to know how many renters don`t even consider buying because of these misperceptions, but he said it had to be some.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time that take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>We begin with shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which was downgraded to buy from neutral at MoffettNathanson. The analyst there cited the health of Facebook`s core business and potential for growth. The price target now $210, that stock rose more than 1.5 percent today to $178.10.</p><p>JetBlue was upgraded to buy from neutral at Citi. The analyst cited positive pricing trends right now and the price target $26. That stock was up 4 percent today to $19.09.</p><p>HERERA: Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) was upgraded to overweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan. The analyst cites the potential for net income growth and the generation for free cash flow. The price target is $122. The stock gained more than 2 percent to $106.63.</p><p>Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was downgraded to underweight from neutral at Atlantic Equities. The analyst cites the deteriorating outlook for interest rates. The price target is $42. The stock fell a fraction to $46.26.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, stocks that soared in a short period of time may look like something you want to own, but should you?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: There was a changing of guard at Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) today. Corie Barry officially took over as CEO and she has some big shoes to fill. The retailer has come back from the brink and has caused the stock to outperform the broader market over the past five years, rising by 125 percent. So, who is Corie Barry and what`s her plan to keep the streak alive.</p><p>Rahel Solomon takes a look for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAHEL SOLOMON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: At 44, Corie Barry is among the youngest CEOs to run a major public company. She`s also one of 33 women.</p><p>CORIE BARRY, BEST BUY CEO: I am deeply grateful to Hubert and the rest of the board of directors for their confidence in me and their clear belief that this leadership evolution is in the best interest of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and all its stakeholders.</p><p>SOLOMON: She said almost her entire career as Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) starting in 1999 as financial analyst and most recently chief financial officer. It`s an investment that`s paid off with the Minnesota native. She`s been with the retailer in darker days. Seven years ago amid slumping sales and management scandals, there were questions about its survival. The company brought an outsider Hubert Jolly.</p><p>MICHAEL LASSER, UBS: They`ve cut $2 billion of costs both on the operating side and on the product side by being more efficient and doing more with less. Two, they partnered with their vendors to do more shop-in-shop, so making the stores more inviting, more focused on products, more focused on the reason for why consumers come in your consumer electronic store.</p><p>SOLOMON: They also invested heavily in tech services like geek squad, total tech support and in-home advisers.</p><p>And for those who are long time investors and have stuck with the company, that`s an investment that`s paid off. The stock has quadrupled since Jolly took over in August 2012.</p><p>LASSER: Corie`s going to continue everything that they`ve been doing thus far, because she was instrumental in helping to formulate the strategy and execute the strategy. So, I expect to see more focused on services, more focused on smartphone, more focused on new populations like the baby boomers and those are all going to be key tenants of Corie`s strategy moving forward.</p><p>SOLOMON: That`s why headquarters are in Minnesota, so Barry will remain close where she grew up and attended college, St. Benedict.</p><p>She has said that she wants her market CEO to be increased employee engagement, customer service that can`t be matched elsewhere, think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and solution-oriented products.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Rahel Solomon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) posts an earnings beat and buys a Canadian financial services firm and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The tax preparation company topped analyst expectations and raised its dividend, as well. H&amp;R block is also buying financial solutions platform company Wave Financial for $405 million. Shares of H&amp;R block were up more than 3 percent to $27.78.</p><p>Chico`s FAS (NYSE:CHS (NASDAQ:CHSCP)) reported better than expected earnings and revenue. But the woman`s apparel retailer did see a drop in comp store sales and it lowered its full-year guidance. But the company said it sees stronger sales trends in the second half of the year. That helped send the stock up more than 8 percent to $3.69.</p><p>HD Supply beat expectations while revenue was in line. The industrial distributor had an increase in organic sales, but it did give some weak guidance. That sent the shares down more than 5 percent to $40.06.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) CEO said today that the bank`s second quarter trading revenue is unlikely to beat its previous quarter. Citi, J.P. Morgan and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) have already warned of a possible trading slowdown for that second quarter, as well, but Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) did rise a fraction in today`s trade at $43.67.</p><p>After the bell, Dave &amp; Buster`s (NASDAQ:PLAY) missed both earnings and revenue expectations. The entertainment company also fell short with comp store sales and it lowered its full-year revenue guidance in the process. Shares initially plummeted in the after-hours trading tonight, but did close in the regular session up nearly 2 percent to $51.53.</p><p>J.P. Morgan downgraded Beyond Meat`s stock to neutral from overweight, saying that its price had exceeded Wall Street`s estimates. The stock has surged more than 600 percent from its $25 per share IPO price. As a result, a research firm report said that short sellers have lost more than $400 million betting against that stock. After today`s downgrade, though, shares tumbled by 25 percent to $126.04.</p><p>HERERA: And Beyond Meat is not the first stock to skyrocket to levels that make analysts and investors uncomfortable and it won`t be the last, either. More recent high-profile examples include Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla, but what is an investor to do if you are tempted to buy a stock that has risen 600 percent or what do you do if you already own it?</p><p>Joining us now is David Sowerby, portfolio manager at Ancora Advisers.</p><p>Welcome, Dave. Nice to have you here.</p><p>DAVID SOWERBY, ANCORA ADVISERS PORTFOLIO MANAGER: My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA: I mean, Beyond Meat is the story really of the last couple of months. Do you view it as what they call a bubble stock? And how would you assess stocks that have gone too far, too fast?</p><p>SOWERBY: Well, first, I don`t own it because I can own stocks that have a price to sales of almost 90 times sales negative cash flow, negative profit margins, and I don`t think that there`s enough barriers to entry that make that kind of valuation that`s priced for sainthood, frankly, something you want to be long in your portfolio. And it all comes back to when stocks have excessive valuations, fundamentals don`t allow you to analyze and put a true value on the stock when there`s what we`ll call FOMO, which is fear of missing out, becomes -- supersedes the desire to own a stock.</p><p>All those lead me to the conclusion, whether it`s Beyond Meat or a Tesla or a bit coin in January of 2018, those are all bubbles.</p><p>GRIFFETH: What do you do, though, David? I mean, there is a definite interest in plant-based foods right now. You know, fake meat, if you will.</p><p>SOWERBY: Sure.</p><p>GRIFFETH: A lot of fast food chains are starting to offer it. The health issues that people face. Right now, Beyond Meat is the pure play in that category, but it`s too expensive for a lot of analysts out there.</p><p>What do you do if want to invest in what you see as a growing trend right now?</p><p>SOWERBY: Bill, I think it`s -- I think in investing in general, investing 101 is always about discipline and patience and in this case, it`s even more so which is simply wait a little while for the market to allow more competition to enter and then find a company that has a better valuation and fundamentals that I think are better to analyze and patience becomes the virtue. If you can`t be patient, then have the right size of this which is small in your portfolio, and don`t be that person that leveraged their own portfolio to own bit coin in January 2018, or Beyond Meat, even after a great big run-up of the IPO, of June 2019.</p><p>HERERA: Are there areas of the market or sectors, if you will, where you see too much enthusiasm and valuations that are out of line?</p><p>SOWERBY: Well, Sue, I think the FANG stocks still trade for the four FANG stocks, A being Alphabet, the average P/E collectively is 65 times trailing earnings, that`s still pretty expensive to me when the average stock in the S&amp;P is trading at 17, 18 times earnings and even less expensive than that.</p><p>I think too many of those names are still expensive today, they`re priced for perfection and priced for sainthood.</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>SOWERBY: And those are names like it.</p><p>Even on the debt side, quickly, the WeWorks, the Teslas, to own the company debt, I think there are bubbles there, too.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>SOWERBY: Overall, there aren`t many bubbles in the market, but there are sure some in these pockets of the market.</p><p>HERERA: David Sowerby with Ancora Advisors, thank you so much for joining us tonight.</p><p>SOWERBY: My pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We do have some sad news tonight in the world of economics and finance. Economist martin Feldstein has passed away. His accomplishments were numerous. He first came to prominence as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Ronald Reagan. He was also on President Obama`s Economic Recovery Advisory Board. He was president emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a longtime professor of economics at Harvard University. Martin Feldstein was 79 years old.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The premiere event for the fast-growing videogame industry is under way, and that`s where cutting-edge new technology is on display and innovative new games are show cased and this year, a few new trends are e merging.</p><p>Josh Lipton is in Los Angeles tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This year at E3, the $166 billion video game industry is imagining a world where fans can play games anytime anywhere. No need for a PC or game console.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) talked about new technology called Project X Cloud which will allow fans to stream complex and graphics-rich games over the Internet and right to their mobile devices. Other tech giants are pursuing this same opportunity like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and reportedly Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>Industry executives says the streaming technology sounds exciting, but there are still a lot of questions.</p><p>STRAUSS ZELNICK, TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE CEO: What is the experience like? What is the business model like? But anything that broadens the market, and anything that brings more opportunities to consumers will be a good thing for the industry.</p><p>LIPTON: There are also changes coming to the business model of video games. Fortnite proved that free to play games can be moneymakers. Epic Games, the private company that owns Fortnite, raked in $2.5 billion last year, and Fortnite rival Apex Legend attracted more than 50 million unique players in its first month.</p><p>For all its success, though, the industry also faces real potential challenges.</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation that would prohibit video games played by minors from offering certain in-game purchases that he says encouraged addictive behavior.</p><p>If this bill were to pass, analysts say it could be financially devastating for the industry because companies generate billions of dollars for these features. Hawley`s bill is moving forward with support from co-sponsors, Senators Blumenthal and Markey.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, Los Angeles, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And finally tonight, the world`s most valuable brands, advertising giant WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY) and research agency Kantar released their list today, and there`s a new company at the number one spot. It`s Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which topped the list to do a variety of services it offers right now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) came in second. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) rounded out the top three.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) had spent a combined 12 years at the top of that list. In fact, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) was in the top spot last year.</p><p>HERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening. See you tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

We need to re-think our approach to antitrust and to merger approval.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Mergers in trouble?  Attorneys general sue to block T-Mobile from merging with Sprint, and that`s not the only deal being questioned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Taking charge.  Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) has a new CEO and she`s determined to pick up where the last chief executive left off.</p><p>HERERA:  Anytime, anywhere.  The future of gaming and the technology powering it.</p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, June 11th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.</p><p>We begin tonight with big corporate mergers and a push to stop some of them.  Today, 10 state attorneys general sued to block the combination of T-Mobile and Sprint which would be reducing the number of major U.S. wireless telecom providers from four to three.  The mergers have been in the works for years, but the New York A.G. said today that bigger is not always better and that such a deal would be bad for consumers, innovation and workers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES:  The T-Mobile and Sprint merger would not only cause irreparable harm to mobile subscribers nationwide by cutting access it affordable, reliable wireless service for millions of Americans, but would particularly affect lower income and minority communities here in New York and urban areas across the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The FCC has yet to formally rule on the deal and the Justice Department is still reviewing it, as well.  Today`s news sent shares of both Sprint and T-Mobile lower.</p><p>HERERA:  And CVS` $69 billion acquisition of Aetna (NYSE:AET) is facing a potential legal challenge.  In an unusual case, the federal judge could reportedly block the deal even though it already closed late last year.  Shares of CVS (NYSE:CVS) fell about 2 percent in today`s session.</p><p>Bertha Coombs has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Aetna`s merger closed last November, but U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon still has not signed off on the Justice Department`s approval of the deal, holding hearings on concerns from consumer groups who said the DOJ did not go far enough to protect seniors.  The DOJ required the company for the Aetna (NYSE:AET) 2 million member Medicare Part D drug plan business, selling it to rival insurer WellCare.  \"The New York Post\" claims the judge appears poised to block the merger citing an anonymous source close to CVS (NYSE:CVS).</p><p>CVS (NYSE:CVS) shot back, telling NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT that we, quote, will not be distracted by rumors.</p><p>David Balto, an attorney for consumer groups opposing the deal, says that judge could ask further conditions on the divestitures.  He notes last year, Judge Leon ruled against the Trump administration to block the AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)-Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) merger and that decision prevailed on appeal.</p><p>But in this case, some antitrust analyst say the judge cannot reverse the CVS (NYSE:CVS) merger under legal statute known as the Tunney Act because it goes beyond the scope of the settlement approval itself and such a ruling would likely be reversed on appeal.  Final arguments in the case are scheduled for mid-July.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who is a large United Technology shareholder, today urged that company to call off its planned merger with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).  He says it makes no strategic sense and as we reported yesterday, President Trump expressed concern that that deal could kill competition.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  When I hear United and I hear Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), which is another incredible company, the missile systems they make are incredible.  When I hear they`re merging, does that take away more competition?  It becomes one big, fat, beautiful company, but I have to negotiate, meaning the United States has to buy things, and does that make it less competitive?  Because it`s already non-competitive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Shares of both Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and United Tech came under pressure in today`s session.</p><p>HERERA:  In Washington, Congress opened its antitrust investigation into big tech.  The House Judiciary Committee planned several hearings and interviews as part of its probe into whether the dominance of companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) have decreased competition.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI):  I strongly believe that this investigation is long overdue.  This subcommittee has a constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of our antitrust laws and competition system to ensure that they`re probably working.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The committee plans to explore a number of issues related to the industry.  Today, the focus was on the big impact big tech has had on publishers and also the news industry.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  To the markets now.  On Wall Street, the Dow snapped its six-day win streak.  The stocks had opened strong on reports of stimulus measures taken by the Chinese government to juice its economy, but that rally fizzled and the industrial average by the close was down 14 points to 26,048, the Nasdaq fell a fraction and the S&amp;P was down one point.</p><p>Today`s pullback has some investors wondering whether the recent rally can be trusted.</p><p>Mike Santoli is at the New York Stock Exchange tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks have recovered most of the ground they lost with the S&amp;P 500 now less than 3 percent from the record high, and investors seemed not ready to embrace this rebound rally just yet.  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch said its clients sent a trickle of new cash each if the market is 4 percent.  An indicator of investor sentiment calls the free gear index remains in the fearful zone at 35 on a zero to 100 scale, and the so-called volatility index has not declined in recent days as it usually does in a rising market, a sign that traders continue to pay up for options that give protection against the market drop over the next month.</p><p>This persistent caution among investors likely has a lot to do with the confusing economic crosscurrent and the series of crucial events that could swing markets around in coming weeks.  Friday`s employment report solidified expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in coming months and with the Fed set to meet next week, plenty of suspense remains over its intentions and whether a rate cut can support the economy and lift inflation should be welcome.</p><p>The G-20 meeting of world leaders in the end of June could be the site of a meeting between President Trump and China`s President Xi to hammer out a trade deal, but no firm plans are set, and the U.S. stands to ready to extend tariffs to another $300 billion in Chinese imports around that time.</p><p>Meantime, the S&amp;P itself is near levels where it peaked three times since January 2018, explaining some hesitation among investors to buy aggressively right now today`s prices, sometimes a backdrop of caution and skepticism is a positive for market performance looking forward, but only if investors` worse fears are not realized.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And a new report shows inflation ticked higher last month.  The producer price index, which measures the wholesale prices businesses received for their goods and services raised 5 percent compared to the previous month.  That was in line with expectations.  Prices for consumer services rose, led by an unusually large increase in hotel room rentals and costs for medical care were also higher.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Jason Ware joins us now to talk about the inflation data, what it means for the Fed and the economy.  He`s chief investment officer with Albion Financial Group.</p><p>Good to see you again.  Welcome back.</p><p>JASON WARE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ALBION FINANCIAL GROUP:  Thanks for having me.  Good to be here.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As you well know, there is a wide spectrum of forecasts on Wall Street about what the Fed`s going to do with interest rates this year.  Barclays, for example, says three cuts before the end of the year, totaling 75 bases points.  Yesterday, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said no cuts at all this year.</p><p>Where do you fall on this, bearing in mind what we`re seeing about inflation right now?</p><p>WARE:  Right.  So, I think a lot of those targets and predictions are reactionary to what the federal funds future market is saying that there`s an expectation among market participants that the Fed is going to cut twice this year.</p><p>Our view is that while it`s certainly possible that they could cut once or twice this year, that the likelihood of that happening is fairly low.  I think odds on is that they continue to being patient with the economic data.  I don`t think there`s any push for them to cut rates given the fact that inflation while certainly slowing to some degree still continues to bounce around within a range that we`ve seen for the better part of this economic expansion, the 1.5 to 2 percent core.</p><p>So, it`s certainly possible and I think if they were to make any move, it`s probably a cut, more than a hike, but we`ll see what happens over the next six, seven months.</p><p>HERERA:  Do you see -- as you mentioned, inflation is kind of all over the board depending on which commodity or which measure you choose to look at, but do you see inflation ticking up in your work?</p><p>WARE:  So, the Fed prefers to look at core PCE.  We think that`s the right measure to try to evaluate where inflation is.  There`s not much that we`re seeing out there that suggests that we have any kind of hot inflation.  Certainly, having 2 percent is a reasonable inflation level, if economy is well-balanced which it seems to be.</p><p>The Fed seems to have -- at least under Yellen -- seemed to have a bit of a tolerance to let it run hotter than that, but it`s consistently been under-target for the better part of the last ten years and I think it`s likely to remain there given the body of evidence that we`ve seen.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And then you have the trade tensions with China.  The president has certainly called for the Fed to cut rates to help in the trade war with China.  It makes our goods cheaper, maybe the demand remains strong even as the tariffs go up.</p><p>Do you think that becomes a factor for the Fed at all?</p><p>WARE:  I certainly think if the trade war were to be protracted and indeed take up -- pick up to another level, we might start to see a little bit of inflation coming from the trade war and goods.  But I think it`s also worth noting that if there`s any economic slowdown as a result of the trade war, then that certainly runs counter to that and may provide inflation inertia.  What we`re seeing is rising wages when we look at the jobs reports, we are still north of 3 percent, have been for 10 straight months.  I think that`s probably more of an indicator to watch, where inflation could go from here.</p><p>But there are so many secular disinflationary forces out there that it`s keeping a lid on inflation, but it`s hard for us to make a strong case to make anything run, you know, 2-1/2, 3 percent anytime soon.  So, as long as we stay sub 2 percent on core, I think the Fed is going to be fairly patient and see where things go.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Jason Ware with Albion Financial Group, again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>WARE:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, you would think with all of the information online that today`s potential homebuyers would be more informed about the mortgage process than ever before, but that apparently is not the case.</p><p>Diana Olick has the results of a new report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After the foreclosure crisis a decade ago, mortgage lending tightened up and new regulations were put in place.  But consumers today apparently think it`s a lot harder to get a home loan than it really is, a growing number of consumers said they had seen their credit score recently, thanks to a myriad of credit monitoring sites, but nearly half couldn`t remember what this core was according to a recent Fannie Mae survey.</p><p>The survey also found that consumers either didn`t know or overestimated the minimum credit score needed to qualify for a loan.  Half of those asked were unsure and the third thought it needed to be higher than 620, but the minimum is actually 550.  Both current home owners and renters were equally uninformed.</p><p>Consumers also overestimated the required down payment.  Most either didn`t know or thought it had to be 10 percent or higher.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Maybe about 30 percent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  About 20 percent.  I`m assuming, but no, I don`t know the details.  It`s very overwhelming.</p><p>OLICK:  In reality, the FHA-backed loans with a minimum down payment of 3-1/2 percent and there are other programs through the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Veterans Affairs that offer zero down payment option.  Consumers can qualify for a mortgage with as much as half their income going toward debt payments, but the majority of consumers said they didn`t know what the level was and most others said the limit was 40 percent.</p><p>Fannie Mae`s chief economist said it`s impossible to know how many renters don`t even consider buying because of these misperceptions, but he said it had to be some.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time that take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>We begin with shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which was downgraded to buy from neutral at MoffettNathanson.  The analyst there cited the health of Facebook`s core business and potential for growth.  The price target now $210, that stock rose more than 1.5 percent today to $178.10.</p><p>JetBlue was upgraded to buy from neutral at Citi.  The analyst cited positive pricing trends right now and the price target $26.  That stock was up 4 percent today to $19.09.</p><p>HERERA:  Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) was upgraded to overweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan.  The analyst cites the potential for net income growth and the generation for free cash flow.  The price target is $122.  The stock gained more than 2 percent to $106.63.</p><p>Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was downgraded to underweight from neutral at Atlantic Equities.  The analyst cites the deteriorating outlook for interest rates.  The price target is $42.  The stock fell a fraction to $46.26.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, stocks that soared in a short period of time may look like something you want to own, but should you?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  There was a changing of guard at Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) today.  Corie Barry officially took over as CEO and she has some big shoes to fill.  The retailer has come back from the brink and has caused the stock to outperform the broader market over the past five years, rising by 125 percent.  So, who is Corie Barry and what`s her plan to keep the streak alive.</p><p>Rahel Solomon takes a look for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAHEL SOLOMON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  At 44, Corie Barry is among the youngest CEOs to run a major public company.  She`s also one of 33 women.</p><p>CORIE BARRY, BEST BUY CEO:  I am deeply grateful to Hubert and the rest of the board of directors for their confidence in me and their clear belief that this leadership evolution is in the best interest of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) and all its stakeholders.</p><p>SOLOMON:  She said almost her entire career as Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) starting in 1999 as financial analyst and most recently chief financial officer.  It`s an investment that`s paid off with the Minnesota native.  She`s been with the retailer in darker days.  Seven years ago amid slumping sales and management scandals, there were questions about its survival.  The company brought an outsider Hubert Jolly.</p><p>MICHAEL LASSER, UBS:  They`ve cut $2 billion of costs both on the operating side and on the product side by being more efficient and doing more with less.  Two, they partnered with their vendors to do more shop-in-shop, so making the stores more inviting, more focused on products, more focused on the reason for why consumers come in your consumer electronic store.</p><p>SOLOMON:  They also invested heavily in tech services like geek squad, total tech support and in-home advisers.</p><p>And for those who are long time investors and have stuck with the company, that`s an investment that`s paid off.  The stock has quadrupled since Jolly took over in August 2012.</p><p>LASSER:  Corie`s going to continue everything that they`ve been doing thus far, because she was instrumental in helping to formulate the strategy and execute the strategy.  So, I expect to see more focused on services, more focused on smartphone, more focused on new populations like the baby boomers and those are all going to be key tenants of Corie`s strategy moving forward.</p><p>SOLOMON:  That`s why headquarters are in Minnesota, so Barry will remain close where she grew up and attended college, St. Benedict.</p><p>She has said that she wants her market CEO to be increased employee engagement, customer service that can`t be matched elsewhere, think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and solution-oriented products.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Rahel Solomon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) posts an earnings beat and buys a Canadian financial services firm and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The tax preparation company topped analyst expectations and raised its dividend, as well.  H&amp;R block is also buying financial solutions platform company Wave Financial for $405 million.  Shares of H&amp;R block were up more than 3 percent to $27.78.</p><p>Chico`s FAS (NYSE:CHS (NASDAQ:CHSCP)) reported better than expected earnings and revenue.  But the woman`s apparel retailer did see a drop in comp store sales and it lowered its full-year guidance.  But the company said it sees stronger sales trends in the second half of the year.  That helped send the stock up more than 8 percent to $3.69.</p><p>HD Supply beat expectations while revenue was in line.  The industrial distributor had an increase in organic sales, but it did give some weak guidance.  That sent the shares down more than 5 percent to $40.06.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) CEO said today that the bank`s second quarter trading revenue is unlikely to beat its previous quarter.  Citi, J.P. Morgan and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) have already warned of a possible trading slowdown for that second quarter, as well, but Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) did rise a fraction in today`s trade at $43.67.</p><p>After the bell, Dave &amp; Buster`s (NASDAQ:PLAY) missed both earnings and revenue expectations.  The entertainment company also fell short with comp store sales and it lowered its full-year revenue guidance in the process.  Shares initially plummeted in the after-hours trading tonight, but did close in the regular session up nearly 2 percent to $51.53.</p><p>J.P. Morgan downgraded Beyond Meat`s stock to neutral from overweight, saying that its price had exceeded Wall Street`s estimates.  The stock has surged more than 600 percent from its $25 per share IPO price.  As a result, a research firm report said that short sellers have lost more than $400 million betting against that stock.  After today`s downgrade, though, shares tumbled by 25 percent to $126.04.</p><p>HERERA:  And Beyond Meat is not the first stock to skyrocket to levels that make analysts and investors uncomfortable and it won`t be the last, either.  More recent high-profile examples include Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla, but what is an investor to do if you are tempted to buy a stock that has risen 600 percent or what do you do if you already own it?</p><p>Joining us now is David Sowerby, portfolio manager at Ancora Advisers.</p><p>Welcome, Dave.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>DAVID SOWERBY, ANCORA ADVISERS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  My pleasure.</p><p>HERERA:  I mean, Beyond Meat is the story really of the last couple of months.  Do you view it as what they call a bubble stock?  And how would you assess stocks that have gone too far, too fast?</p><p>SOWERBY:  Well, first, I don`t own it because I can own stocks that have a price to sales of almost 90 times sales negative cash flow, negative profit margins, and I don`t think that there`s enough barriers to entry that make that kind of valuation that`s priced for sainthood, frankly, something you want to be long in your portfolio.  And it all comes back to when stocks have excessive valuations, fundamentals don`t allow you to analyze and put a true value on the stock when there`s what we`ll call FOMO, which is fear of missing out, becomes -- supersedes the desire to own a stock.</p><p>All those lead me to the conclusion, whether it`s Beyond Meat or a Tesla or a bit coin in January of 2018, those are all bubbles.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  What do you do, though, David?  I mean, there is a definite interest in plant-based foods right now.  You know, fake meat, if you will.</p><p>SOWERBY:  Sure.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A lot of fast food chains are starting to offer it.  The health issues that people face.  Right now, Beyond Meat is the pure play in that category, but it`s too expensive for a lot of analysts out there.</p><p>What do you do if want to invest in what you see as a growing trend right now?</p><p>SOWERBY:  Bill, I think it`s -- I think in investing in general, investing 101 is always about discipline and patience and in this case, it`s even more so which is simply wait a little while for the market to allow more competition to enter and then find a company that has a better valuation and fundamentals that I think are better to analyze and patience becomes the virtue.  If you can`t be patient, then have the right size of this which is small in your portfolio, and don`t be that person that leveraged their own portfolio to own bit coin in January 2018, or Beyond Meat, even after a great big run-up of the IPO, of June 2019.</p><p>HERERA:  Are there areas of the market or sectors, if you will, where you see too much enthusiasm and valuations that are out of line?</p><p>SOWERBY:  Well, Sue, I think the FANG stocks still trade for the four FANG stocks, A being Alphabet, the average P/E collectively is 65 times trailing earnings, that`s still pretty expensive to me when the average stock in the S&amp;P is trading at 17, 18 times earnings and even less expensive than that.</p><p>I think too many of those names are still expensive today, they`re priced for perfection and priced for sainthood.</p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>SOWERBY:  And those are names like it.</p><p>Even on the debt side, quickly, the WeWorks, the Teslas, to own the company debt, I think there are bubbles there, too.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>SOWERBY:  Overall, there aren`t many bubbles in the market, but there are sure some in these pockets of the market.</p><p>HERERA:  David Sowerby with Ancora Advisors, thank you so much for joining us tonight.</p><p>SOWERBY:  My pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We do have some sad news tonight in the world of economics and finance.  Economist martin Feldstein has passed away.  His accomplishments were numerous.  He first came to prominence as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Ronald Reagan.  He was also on President Obama`s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.  He was president emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a longtime professor of economics at Harvard University.  Martin Feldstein was 79 years old.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The premiere event for the fast-growing videogame industry is under way, and that`s where cutting-edge new technology is on display and innovative new games are show cased and this year, a few new trends are e merging.</p><p>Josh Lipton is in Los Angeles tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This year at E3, the $166 billion video game industry is imagining a world where fans can play games anytime anywhere.  No need for a PC or game console.</p><p>Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) talked about new technology called Project X Cloud which will allow fans to stream complex and graphics-rich games over the Internet and right to their mobile devices.  Other tech giants are pursuing this same opportunity like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and reportedly Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>Industry executives says the streaming technology sounds exciting, but there are still a lot of questions.</p><p>STRAUSS ZELNICK, TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE CEO:  What is the experience like?  What is the business model like?  But anything that broadens the market, and anything that brings more opportunities to consumers will be a good thing for the industry.</p><p>LIPTON:  There are also changes coming to the business model of video games.  Fortnite proved that free to play games can be moneymakers.  Epic Games, the private company that owns Fortnite, raked in $2.5 billion last year, and Fortnite rival Apex Legend attracted more than 50 million unique players in its first month.</p><p>For all its success, though, the industry also faces real potential challenges.</p><p>Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation that would prohibit video games played by minors from offering certain in-game purchases that he says encouraged addictive behavior.</p><p>If this bill were to pass, analysts say it could be financially devastating for the industry because companies generate billions of dollars for these features.  Hawley`s bill is moving forward with support from co-sponsors, Senators Blumenthal and Markey.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, Los Angeles, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And finally tonight, the world`s most valuable brands, advertising giant WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY) and research agency Kantar released their list today, and there`s a new company at the number one spot.  It`s Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which topped the list to do a variety of services it offers right now.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) came in second.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) rounded out the top three.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) had spent a combined 12 years at the top of that list.  In fact, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) was in the top spot last year.</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.

The long- time CEO of General Electric (NYSE:GE) is stepping down.  A GE veteran is  stepping up.  And investors are cheering.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Techs tumble.  The best performing sector this year extends its losses.   But what happens next is up for debate.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Supreme decision.  A ruling by the highest court in the land could make  copies of biotech drugs available to consumers quicker.  </p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, June  12th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is  off tonight.  </p><p>The sell-off in technology shares intensified.  We'll have more on that in  a moment.  </p><p>But we begin tonight with a changing of the guard at General Electric  (NYSE:GE).  Chief executive Jeff Immelt will end his tenure this summer  after nearly 17 years.  Immelt engineered a shift in the industrial  company's focus but was under pressure to increase the price of the stock  which is widely owned by longtime investors and mutual funds.  Taking over  the top job is GE veteran John Flannery who heads up GE's health care  division.  Investors like the news, sending shares up 3.5 percent.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on the future of GE, a company that was an original  member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The change at the  top of General Electric (NYSE:GE) comes after 16 years.  Over that time,  there have been many grumblings about the stock price, a fact that hasn't  eluded the man soon to be in charge.  </p><p>JOHN FLANNERY, INCOMING GE CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  No one's happy with the stock  price right now, or some of the cash, you know, pictures that we've had.   We know we can be better at those things.  I want to focus on those things.  </p><p>So, I'm going to do basically what I've done in the health care business,  spend a lot of time with investors, with customers, with employees,  listening, hearing what, you know, people think about the company.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  John Flannery is a 30-year GE veteran.  He's held a number of top  posts, including health care where he turned around the flagging business. </p><p>Analysts say on the heels of some disappointing financial metrics, the key  will be how he plans to grow the company.  </p><p>JEFF WINDAU, EDWARD JONES ANALYST:  We're really looking for Mr. Flannery  to take a deep dive in the business, and really lay out the strategies and  where the growth's going to come from, help reassure us on the cash flow,  cash generation.  And we'd also like to see the -- some more information on  just where the capital's going to be spent, capital allocation.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  It also caps a dramatic 16-year tenure for Jeff Immelt, one  that's included the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the financial crisis, and a  flurry of deal activity that's fundamentally transformed the Dow component.   In 2001, GE derives nearly half its profit from its financial arm.  Today,  thanks to Immelt, roughly 90 percent comes from industrial businesses  instead.  </p><p>BILL GEORGE, HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL:  He's engineered a tremendous  strategic change in this company to move away from being a bank, which it  was moving towards when he turned over the rains in 2001 and emphasizing  high-tech and innovation and much more innovation.  Now, that takes time.  </p><p>Now, 16 years is a long time.  So, if I would be critical, I'd say move too  slowly, and to navigate two major crises, and it can be up to John Flannery  to prove that all these strategies are going to work.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  But the stock has performed poorly.  Down nearly 30 percent since  Immelt took the helm in 2001 and lagging this year on concerns about cash  flow and whether GE can reach its 2018 earnings target.  </p><p>But shares did jump today, even as management added some levity to a high- stakes scenario.  </p><p>Which talent would you most like to have?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Blues guitar and dunk a basketball.  Far up on both of  those.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Or maybe, maybe --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've gotten over that.  I've gotten over that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was hoping for great CEO of GE.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I thought you already felt that way.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can I do this over again? </p><p>BRENNAN:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And a new CEO isn't the only thing that happened at General  Electric (NYSE:GE) today.  The company also received regulatory approval  for its merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).  That deal was approved on the  condition that GE sell its water and process technologies business.  </p><p>On Wall Street overall, there was renewed pressure on the technology  sector.  The NASDAQ posted its biggest two-day slide since December, and  that took the rest of the market down with it.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the  worst performing stock on the Dow index, following an analyst's downgrade  today and a price target cut.  Dow Jones industrial average lost 36 points  to 21,235.  The NASDAQ was off 32, and the S&amp;P 500 fell two.  </p><p>But after outperforming the market this year, some say the pullback in the  tech sector is healthy.  Others say it is not.  </p><p>So, we asked Bob Pisani to lay out both sides of that debate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This sudden movement is  generating a lot of healthy debate about whether the great technology run  of 2017 is over.  Tech, of course, has been the big mover this year, up 17  percent and far outperforming the 8 percent gain for the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>There are arguments on both the bull and bear side on this.  Now, the bears  argue tech is overall oversaturated or it's crowded trade.  It's all true,  particularly the so-called FAANG names, the Facebooks, Amazons, Apples,  Googles, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  </p><p>But the big tech names are better capitalized and have more stable profits  than their old counterparts during the dotcom boon.  That doesn't mean they  won't go down.  They're just more stable.  </p><p>Bears do have one big point.  These are traditionally cyclical stocks,  which means they can be volatile.  Investors are treating them more like  old-fashioned safety stocks like consumer staples with no volatility.   That's a mistake.  We saw that on Friday.  </p><p>The bulls' main argument is this, with the few exceptions, valuations of  even big tech names is not excessive.  True, some of the big names, the  Facebooks, and especially Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), they have priced earnings  ratios way above the S&amp;P norm of about 18.  That's because the market is  assuming very strong revenue growth for these companies, which is not  proven to be wrong, at least not yet.  </p><p>Take the biggest name of all, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which currently trades  at about 16 times 2017 earnings.  That's hardly inflated.  Apple's had very  high valuations in the past, but not today.  Tech is strong because tech  companies have plenty of new business opportunities.  Think about it,  there's the growth of artificial intelligence, there's robotics, there's  genomics, there's cloud computing, there's self-driving cars, and the  Internet of things.  No lack of opportunities for tech names.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, let's turn now to our bull and our bear guests for more on  technology.  We have Daniel Flax, senior technology at Neuberger Berman,  who is our bull, who sees more room for tech to run.  While our bear,  Charlie Bobrinskoy is the vice chairman at Arial Investments, and he says  some of the tech names do not deserve the run-up that we've seen.  </p><p>Gentlemen, welcome.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>CHARLES BOBRINSKOY, ARIEL INVESTMENT VICE CHAIRMAN:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>DANIEL FLAX, NEUBERGER BERMAN SR. TECH ANALYST:  Great to see you, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  Charlie, I'm going to start with you.  Bob laid out, you know,  kind of the -- both scenarios for us.  You do not own the FAANG stocks, the  Facebooks, the Apples, the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Why?  </p><p>BOBRINSKOY:  Because if there's anything history has shown us, it's that  people are too optimistic and overconfident about their ability to see the  future.  And by definitions, these stocks are trading at 144 times  earnings, because people think they're very confident that these companies  are going to grow massively in the future.  </p><p>And again, history just teaches us that in technology, yesterday's and even  today's leader are not necessarily tomorrow's winner.  Just look at IBM and  all the big computer companies, MySpace, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), even  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which was the leader so far ago.  </p><p>So, it's just a tough industry to predict.  And therefore, it shouldn't pay  144 times earnings for it.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Daniel, what about that?  I mean, you mentioned in my  notes at least that if you focus on companies that can disrupt and can look  through some of the noise that we're seeing today, a pullback in tech might  be a good buying opportunity.  </p><p>FLAX:  Thanks, Sue.  Look, at Neuberger Berman, we try to take a longer  term view on this.  While we expect a lot of these shares, including Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), to remain volatile, we think there's certain elements that  are underappreciated. </p><p>So, for example, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), you have a very strong ecosystem  which is underappreciated by the market.  And as we look out over the next  one to two years, we think growth could improve driven by the new iPhone 8  which is likely to come in the fall.  We would also add that Apple's  revenue and profit pull is more stable I think than people appreciate,  helped partly by their services growth.  </p><p>HERERA:  What about that, Charlie?  Some of these companies do have -- to  use Daniel's words -- an echo system that is well-developed.  </p><p>BOBRINSKOY:  Well, sure, that's what they always say.  But if we were  having this conversation 15 years ago, it would have been about how the  BlackBerry has this wonderful ecosystem.  Everyone had a BlackBerry in the  business world 15 years ago.  Now nobody does.  The stock is virtually  gone.  </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is earning more than half of its profits from phones,  from hardware, and there is just no predictability that they're going to be  the leader in ten years from now, in phones.  I'm predicting that they  actually won't be.  </p><p>HERERA:  Interesting.  </p><p>Daniel, what about that point?  I mean, mentioning the BlackBerry certainly  does bring back those days when everybody did have them.  That was the tech  stock that everybody had to own.  How do you make sure that when you do add  a tech stock, or when Neuberger adds a tech stock to the recommended list,  that you are going to have something that has longevity?  </p><p>FLAX:  I think which distinguishes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) from BlackBerry is  apple has been able to build a platform upon which others are able to build  and create.  And so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) builds integrated systems, which  include the hardware, the software and the services, but the key is that  the developer community has really been able to build on top of that.  </p><p>And so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has paid out over $70 billion to developers  over the last several years.  And so, by bringing others along with it, and  helping to create a differentiated user experience, this in our view is  what's going to help Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) attract new customers, and of  course, get their installed base to continue upgrading.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, Charlie, I know we had a pullback in the NASDAQ for the  last few days or so.  And in same case, on some stocks, it's been a little  worse than others.  But a number of these stocks have been big winners for  the year.  </p><p>Do you worry about missing out on that kind of growth?  </p><p>BOBRINSKOY:  No.  You want to be selling what others have been buying.  And  buy what others have been selling.  And, clearly, you're absolutely right,  apple has benefited from this big move in the index fund and the S&amp;P.   Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest name in the S&amp;P.  So, when people move  money into an S&amp;P index fund, that fund is forced to buy more Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- more Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) than anything else.  </p><p>So, as money's flown into indexes, it's flowing into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).   And that's what pushed all of these big tech names up.  When that slows  down, and it will, you're going to lose the big tailwind that you've had  behind these names.  </p><p>HERERA:  Daniel, have you been adding to your tech positions with the  downdraft that we've seen Thursday, Friday and today?  Or no?  </p><p>FLAX:  Sue, we can't speak to what specific funds are doing.  But what I  would say is, if you look back over time, many of these technology  companies' shares have been volatile.  At Neuberger Berman, our focus is  really on the fundamentals.  So, for example, we are looking for  significant earnings growth out of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next one to  two years.  Alphabet is another name that we think has attractive earnings  prospect.  </p><p>Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is a name where the shares are inexpensive, has  been a contrarian name.  That's a company that we continue to like, driven  by changes to its underlying mix.  And so, while the indices are at record  highs, we are really looking for names that we think can outperform  virtually regardless of the market environment, which, again, we expect is  going to remain pretty volatile.  </p><p>HERERA:  All righty.  On that note, gentlemen, thank you.  Good discussion.  </p><p>FLAX:  Thank you.  </p><p>BOBRINSKOY:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>HERERA:  Daniel Flax of Neuberger Berman and Charlie Bobrinskoy with Ariel  Investments.</p><p>A second federal appeals court ruled against President Trump's revised  travel ban.  The new ruling from a three-judge panel affirms a March  decision to block major parts of the order, which limited travel from six  predominantly Muslim countries.  The judges wrote that the order exceeded  the scope of the authority designated to the president by Congress.  The  ruling will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court, which is already  considering a similar case.  </p><p>There are a few other stories as well out of Washington that investors need  to be keeping an eye on.  </p><p>Not surprisingly.  John Harwood is here to talk about them with us.  </p><p>John, it's good to see you, as always.  </p><p>So, let's start with Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, testifying  tomorrow on Russia.  Why should investors specifically be watching closely?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is key  testimony in the investigation for the Senate Intelligence Committee, and  it may factor into the special counsel's investigation as well, because  Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, has been involved at both ends here.  </p><p>First of all, he had undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador that  he had not initially told Congress about, when he was up for confirmation.   And then in addition to that, having recused himself from the Russia  investigation, he was involved in the firing of James Comey, who is leading  that investigation.  </p><p>This is a scandal that has the potential to destabilize the administration,  and Jeff Sessions by testifying in public is raising the stakes.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, it certainly seems that way.  What about the impact that this  might have, the investigation, the testimony, et cetera, on the president's  agenda, most immediately health care, tax reform, last week was  infrastructure leak.  How will that be affected, if at all?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  The danger, Sue, is that the administration gets in a negative  downward spiral.  Gallup today had the president's approval rating at just  36 percent.  There's a special election coming up in Georgia in two weeks  to -- or in one week, rather, to fill the seat that Tom Price vacated, the  HHS secretary.  </p><p>If you see the president continue to go down, it makes it more difficult  for Republican members of Congress to stand with him on his priorities,  like health care, like tax reform, like infrastructure.  And you could get  into a situation if he continues to erode in his popularity, where it's  every person for him or herself in Washington, and that is not the kind of  unified front that Republicans need to push these agenda items through  Congress and get them on the president's desk.  </p><p>HERERA:  We will be watching closely, John.  Thank you, as always.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  You bet.  </p><p>HERERA:  John Harward in Washington.  </p><p>Still ahead tonight, did the Supreme Court just help get some drugs to  patients sooner?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Across the globe, in Qatar, financial markets there stabilized  after a week of losses.  This is as the government shows it can keep things  up and running despite being sanctioned by its neighbors.  </p><p>In an exclusive interview with CNBC, the Qatari finance minister dismissed  fears of an economic crisis and stressed his country's resilience.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALI SHERIFF AL EMADI, QATAR FINANCE MINISTER:  If you look at what's  happened, sometimes a lot of people think that we're the only one to lose  in this.  I don't think so.  </p><p>Qatar is a very strong economy, and it's a big economy.  And I think if  we're going to lose a dollar, they will lose a dollar also.  I think there  is a lot of business among everybody around us.  So, I think it's -- I  always like to have a win-win situation, but this incident, it's very  unfortunate.  It's put a lot of lives, especially human peoples in  difficulties.  Families are being disrupted around these countries.  </p><p>This is not a measure that we wanted to be.  It was forced on us, it was  taken by other countries.  But I will say that Qatar is always open for  business.  We'd like the people that live here, they have all the respects  and they have full accessibilities and actually getting in and out of the  country at their previous life.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  As we've reported, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt are  among the leading Arab governments who have cut ties with Doha last week.  </p><p>Puerto Rico votes to be the 51st state, but the legitimacy of that result  is being questioned because the turnout was so low.  The governor, however,  said that he will create a commission to appoint a panel to lobby Congress  for statehood.  Congress now has to approve any changes to the island's  political status.  Puerto Rico is in the midst of a financial crisis.  It  has a debt load of $70 billion, and last month filed for the largest  municipal bankruptcy in the U.S.</p><p>A clothing retailer has joined the ranks of many other of its peers.   Gymboree has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  This comes just  weeks after it partnered with a turnaround firm after missing a June 1st  debt payment.  The company says it expects the move to move through the  process quickly and emerge as a stronger organization.  </p><p>IMAX is cutting 14 percent of its workforce.  That's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The movie theater company announced a $20 million cost savings plan which  includes eliminating approximately 100 positions worldwide.  IMAX also  announced a new $200 million share buyback program.  Shares of IMAX fell a  dime to $24 even.  </p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) raised its quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share, up  from its 40 cents per share.  Investors liked the news, sending shares of  FedEx (NYSE:FDX) up more than 1 percent to $209.12.  </p><p>Merck (NYSE:MRK) said it would pause new enrollment in two late stage  studies of its immunotherapy drug Keytruda used in combination with other  treatments for multiple myeloma, which is a form of blood cancer.  The  stoppage was at the recommendation of an external data monitoring committee  to allow more information to be collected, to help understand why some  patients died given the therapy.  Keytruda is approved for lung and skin  cancer.  Shares of Merck (NYSE:MRK) initially dropped in afterhours  trading.  They were unchanged in the regular session at $64.39.  </p><p>And shares of Coherus Biosciences plunged after the FDA failed to approve a  bio similar drug that helps prevent infections for cancer patients who are  on chemotherapy.  Coherus Biosciences finished down nearly 24 percent at  $15.73.  </p><p>A ruling by the Supreme Court today could have wide-ranging implications  for the pharmaceutical industry.  The court's decision speeds up the time  that copycat versions of biologic drugs can get to market.  Biologics are  an expensive class of medicines that can boost sales for the drug  companies.  Biosimilars are copycat versions of those drugs.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell is following the story for us and she joins us here on the set.  </p><p>Always good to see you, Meg.  </p><p>So, what -- what was the case that the Supreme Court specifically ruled on?  </p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.  So,  this case is called Sandoz versus Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).  Sandoz is a unit of  Novartis.  And essentially it was over Amgen's drug Neupogen that is a  biologic drug.  Often, biologic drugs are administered through shots or  intravenously.  They're administered -- they're manufactured using living  cells.</p><p>And so, biosimilars are the copycat versions of biologics.  And the  industry calls them biosimilars because they argue because of the way  they're manufactured, they're not identical.  But we basically think of  generic drugs as sort of identical versions of the chemical versions of  drugs.  So --  </p><p>HERERA:  It's sort of a kind an equivalent.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  That's the idea.</p><p>And so, what this ruling did today was essentially overturn a lower court's  ruling that gave a six-month delay before when a biosimilar could be  introduced to market after it got approved.  It said no delay needed there  as long as you give the notice to the manufacturer early, you can launch.   Though it basically wiped out that six-month delay that would still  continue to allow accrual of sales for the original manufacturer.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, what are the broader implications for the drug industry?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  So, this essentially will have implications down the line as a  lot of these new drugs are introduced to market.  Right now, we only have  about five biosimilars currently approved in the United States.  And some  of them are still working their way through legal battles.  </p><p>But as we see more and more of these biosimilars being produced, it will  mean that they'll come to market a little bit sooner, and cut into the  original manufacturer sales more.  </p><p>HERERA:  Have you gotten any reaction yet from either the drug companies,  or, you know, the broader medical community that is using these products?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Yes, it's kind of interesting.  The reaction was a little bit  muted.  This has been a very long process to figuring out how to get  biosimilars to market.  It's actually taken years to continue figuring it  out.  Probably the strongest reaction we saw today was from the payer  community, from -- you know, the pharmacy benefits managers who are  encouraging use of these lower priced medicines.  </p><p>However, what we've seen is when these are introduced, maybe they're only  introduced at a 10 percent to 15 percent discount to the original drug.   So, it's not that gigantic cost savings you're looking to see.  </p><p>HERERA:  Right.  I was wondering about that because the drug companies have  been under such scrutiny about cost increases, and the pharmacy benefit  managers are right in the middle of that.  So, maybe a little bit of a  benefit, but not an extreme benefit for the consumer.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  That's right.  At the beginning, we're seeing them introduced at  these kind of smaller discounts than you might expect to see, but people  say as we see more and more of these entering the market, that competitions  should bring prices down overall.  That's going to be a little ways off,  but we're headed in that direction.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, you'll be following it, I know.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Definitely.  </p><p>HERERA:  Thank you so much, Meg.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas.  While Uber struggles, rival Lyft is quietly  making some big moves.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  And here's a look at what to watch for tomorrow.  It is day one of  the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.  As we reported, Attorney  General Jeff Sessions will testify in front of a Senate panel on Russia.   OPEC will release an update on supply and demand trends in the oil market.   And that is what to watch for on Tuesday.  </p><p>McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) wants to hire 250,000 workers in the U.S. this  summer.  And it's doing it in a very modern way.  It's using Snapchat.  The  chain plans to run ten-second videos on the social media service of current  employees talking about working at the company, at which point viewers can  then swipe to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) website and apply.  </p><p>There may be a new player in the U.S. grocery market.  A German low-cost  grocer called Aldi plans to invest roughly $3.5 billion to expand its store  base.  It's an aggressive plan that would make Aldi the third biggest  supermarket chain behind Walmart and Kruger by the year 2022.  The  investment comes at a time of intense competition in that industry.   Walmart, which is the largest U.S. grocer, is testing lower prices in 11  states and is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the  low-price leader.  </p><p>Uber's chief executive will likely take a leave of absence.  According to  reports, no final decision has been made, following a board meeting  yesterday.  The board met over the weekend to consider recommendations from  an investigation into sexual harassment and related issues.  A close ally  of the CEO, Travis Kalanick, has left the ride-hailing company, making him  the latest high-level executive to depart.  Uber is a privately held  company but it is valued at roughly $70 billion.  </p><p>While Uber continues to wrestle with high profile legal and public  relations problems, its rival Lyft is quietly making some strategic moves.   The latest has Jaguar Land Rover taking a stake in Lyft and Phil LeBeau has  those details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Uber may rule the road  when it comes to ride-sharing.  But its rival Lyft is putting together an  impressive group of partnerships that could pay off in the long run.  </p><p>That includes a new deal with Jaguar Land Rover.  The luxury auto brands  are investing $25 million in Lyft, and will work with the ride share  company developing mobility services.  The deal also calls for Jaguar Land  Rover to supply some vehicles to Lyft drivers.  </p><p>This is the second automaker to take a stake in Lyft, following GM's  investment of a half billion dollars last year.  At the time, many thought  it would lead to Lyft working almost exclusively with GM.  But since then,  both companies have branched out to also work with other tech and  transportation firms.  For example, Lyft has also struck a deal with Waymo,  the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary that is leading the development of  driverless vehicles.  </p><p>And just last week, Lyft announced it's working with the tech firm nuTonomy  to test self-driving vehicles with paying customers in Boston later this  year.  </p><p>Uber is also developing autonomous drive vehicles, testing them in  Pittsburgh.  But with the company embroiled in a number of controversies,  ranging from the culture of the firm to whether or not it's overcharging  customers, the time could be ripe for Lyft to gain ground on Uber,  especially in one or more of its partnerships takes off, and leaves the  company to greater growth.  </p><p>It's estimated the majority of the ride share business in the U.S. goes to  Uber.  Lyft says it has nearly 30 percent of the market.  But as Lyft  continues to expand and add new partnerships, it is slowly gaining ground  on Uber here in the U.S. </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

The long- time CEO of General Electric (NYSE:GE) is stepping down.  A GE veteran is  stepping up.  And investors are cheering.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Techs tumble.  The best performing sector this year extends its losses.   But what happens next is up for debate.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Supreme decision.  A ruling by the highest court in the land could make  copies of biotech drugs available to consumers quicker.  </p><p> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, June  12th.  </p><p> Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is  off tonight.  </p><p> The sell-off in technology shares intensified.  We'll have more on that in  a moment.  </p><p> But we begin tonight with a changing of the guard at General Electric  (NYSE:GE).  Chief executive Jeff Immelt will end his tenure this summer  after nearly 17 years.  Immelt engineered a shift in the industrial  company's focus but was under pressure to increase the price of the stock  which is widely owned by longtime investors and mutual funds.  Taking over  the top job is GE veteran John Flannery who heads up GE's health care  division.  Investors like the news, sending shares up 3.5 percent.  </p><p> Morgan Brennan has more on the future of GE, a company that was an original  member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The change at the  top of General Electric (NYSE:GE) comes after 16 years.  Over that time,  there have been many grumblings about the stock price, a fact that hasn't  eluded the man soon to be in charge.  </p><p> JOHN FLANNERY, INCOMING GE CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  No one's happy with the stock  price right now, or some of the cash, you know, pictures that we've had.   We know we can be better at those things.  I want to focus on those things.  </p><p> So, I'm going to do basically what I've done in the health care business,  spend a lot of time with investors, with customers, with employees,  listening, hearing what, you know, people think about the company.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  John Flannery is a 30-year GE veteran.  He's held a number of top  posts, including health care where he turned around the flagging business. </p><p> Analysts say on the heels of some disappointing financial metrics, the key  will be how he plans to grow the company.  </p><p> JEFF WINDAU, EDWARD JONES ANALYST:  We're really looking for Mr. Flannery  to take a deep dive in the business, and really lay out the strategies and  where the growth's going to come from, help reassure us on the cash flow,  cash generation.  And we'd also like to see the -- some more information on  just where the capital's going to be spent, capital allocation.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  It also caps a dramatic 16-year tenure for Jeff Immelt, one  that's included the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the financial crisis, and a  flurry of deal activity that's fundamentally transformed the Dow component.   In 2001, GE derives nearly half its profit from its financial arm.  Today,  thanks to Immelt, roughly 90 percent comes from industrial businesses  instead.  </p><p> BILL GEORGE, HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL:  He's engineered a tremendous  strategic change in this company to move away from being a bank, which it  was moving towards when he turned over the rains in 2001 and emphasizing  high-tech and innovation and much more innovation.  Now, that takes time.  </p><p> Now, 16 years is a long time.  So, if I would be critical, I'd say move too  slowly, and to navigate two major crises, and it can be up to John Flannery  to prove that all these strategies are going to work.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  But the stock has performed poorly.  Down nearly 30 percent since  Immelt took the helm in 2001 and lagging this year on concerns about cash  flow and whether GE can reach its 2018 earnings target.  </p><p> But shares did jump today, even as management added some levity to a high- stakes scenario.  </p><p> Which talent would you most like to have?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Blues guitar and dunk a basketball.  Far up on both of  those.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Or maybe, maybe --  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've gotten over that.  I've gotten over that.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was hoping for great CEO of GE.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I thought you already felt that way.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can I do this over again? </p><p> BRENNAN:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And a new CEO isn't the only thing that happened at General  Electric (NYSE:GE) today.  The company also received regulatory approval  for its merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).  That deal was approved on the  condition that GE sell its water and process technologies business.  </p><p> On Wall Street overall, there was renewed pressure on the technology  sector.  The NASDAQ posted its biggest two-day slide since December, and  that took the rest of the market down with it.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the  worst performing stock on the Dow index, following an analyst's downgrade  today and a price target cut.  Dow Jones industrial average lost 36 points  to 21,235.  The NASDAQ was off 32, and the S&amp;P 500 fell two.  </p><p> But after outperforming the market this year, some say the pullback in the  tech sector is healthy.  Others say it is not.  </p><p> So, we asked Bob Pisani to lay out both sides of that debate.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This sudden movement is  generating a lot of healthy debate about whether the great technology run  of 2017 is over.  Tech, of course, has been the big mover this year, up 17  percent and far outperforming the 8 percent gain for the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p> There are arguments on both the bull and bear side on this.  Now, the bears  argue tech is overall oversaturated or it's crowded trade.  It's all true,  particularly the so-called FAANG names, the Facebooks, Amazons, Apples,  Googles, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  </p><p> But the big tech names are better capitalized and have more stable profits  than their old counterparts during the dotcom boon.  That doesn't mean they  won't go down.  They're just more stable.  </p><p> Bears do have one big point.  These are traditionally cyclical stocks,  which means they can be volatile.  Investors are treating them more like  old-fashioned safety stocks like consumer staples with no volatility.   That's a mistake.  We saw that on Friday.  </p><p> The bulls' main argument is this, with the few exceptions, valuations of  even big tech names is not excessive.  True, some of the big names, the  Facebooks, and especially Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), they have priced earnings  ratios way above the S&amp;P norm of about 18.  That's because the market is  assuming very strong revenue growth for these companies, which is not  proven to be wrong, at least not yet.  </p><p> Take the biggest name of all, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which currently trades  at about 16 times 2017 earnings.  That's hardly inflated.  Apple's had very  high valuations in the past, but not today.  Tech is strong because tech  companies have plenty of new business opportunities.  Think about it,  there's the growth of artificial intelligence, there's robotics, there's  genomics, there's cloud computing, there's self-driving cars, and the  Internet of things.  No lack of opportunities for tech names.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  So, let's turn now to our bull and our bear guests for more on  technology.  We have Daniel Flax, senior technology at Neuberger Berman,  who is our bull, who sees more room for tech to run.  While our bear,  Charlie Bobrinskoy is the vice chairman at Arial Investments, and he says  some of the tech names do not deserve the run-up that we've seen.  </p><p> Gentlemen, welcome.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p> CHARLES BOBRINSKOY, ARIEL INVESTMENT VICE CHAIRMAN:  Thanks for having us.</p><p> DANIEL FLAX, NEUBERGER BERMAN SR. TECH ANALYST:  Great to see you, Sue.  </p><p> HERERA:  Charlie, I'm going to start with you.  Bob laid out, you know,  kind of the -- both scenarios for us.  You do not own the FAANG stocks, the  Facebooks, the Apples, the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Why?  </p><p> BOBRINSKOY:  Because if there's anything history has shown us, it's that  people are too optimistic and overconfident about their ability to see the  future.  And by definitions, these stocks are trading at 144 times  earnings, because people think they're very confident that these companies  are going to grow massively in the future.  </p><p> And again, history just teaches us that in technology, yesterday's and even  today's leader are not necessarily tomorrow's winner.  Just look at IBM and  all the big computer companies, MySpace, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), even  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which was the leader so far ago.  </p><p> So, it's just a tough industry to predict.  And therefore, it shouldn't pay  144 times earnings for it.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  Daniel, what about that?  I mean, you mentioned in my  notes at least that if you focus on companies that can disrupt and can look  through some of the noise that we're seeing today, a pullback in tech might  be a good buying opportunity.  </p><p> FLAX:  Thanks, Sue.  Look, at Neuberger Berman, we try to take a longer  term view on this.  While we expect a lot of these shares, including Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), to remain volatile, we think there's certain elements that  are underappreciated. </p><p> So, for example, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), you have a very strong ecosystem  which is underappreciated by the market.  And as we look out over the next  one to two years, we think growth could improve driven by the new iPhone 8  which is likely to come in the fall.  We would also add that Apple's  revenue and profit pull is more stable I think than people appreciate,  helped partly by their services growth.  </p><p> HERERA:  What about that, Charlie?  Some of these companies do have -- to  use Daniel's words -- an echo system that is well-developed.  </p><p> BOBRINSKOY:  Well, sure, that's what they always say.  But if we were  having this conversation 15 years ago, it would have been about how the  BlackBerry has this wonderful ecosystem.  Everyone had a BlackBerry in the  business world 15 years ago.  Now nobody does.  The stock is virtually  gone.  </p><p> Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is earning more than half of its profits from phones,  from hardware, and there is just no predictability that they're going to be  the leader in ten years from now, in phones.  I'm predicting that they  actually won't be.  </p><p> HERERA:  Interesting.  </p><p> Daniel, what about that point?  I mean, mentioning the BlackBerry certainly  does bring back those days when everybody did have them.  That was the tech  stock that everybody had to own.  How do you make sure that when you do add  a tech stock, or when Neuberger adds a tech stock to the recommended list,  that you are going to have something that has longevity?  </p><p> FLAX:  I think which distinguishes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) from BlackBerry is  apple has been able to build a platform upon which others are able to build  and create.  And so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) builds integrated systems, which  include the hardware, the software and the services, but the key is that  the developer community has really been able to build on top of that.  </p><p> And so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has paid out over $70 billion to developers  over the last several years.  And so, by bringing others along with it, and  helping to create a differentiated user experience, this in our view is  what's going to help Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) attract new customers, and of  course, get their installed base to continue upgrading.  </p><p> HERERA:  You know, Charlie, I know we had a pullback in the NASDAQ for the  last few days or so.  And in same case, on some stocks, it's been a little  worse than others.  But a number of these stocks have been big winners for  the year.  </p><p> Do you worry about missing out on that kind of growth?  </p><p> BOBRINSKOY:  No.  You want to be selling what others have been buying.  And  buy what others have been selling.  And, clearly, you're absolutely right,  apple has benefited from this big move in the index fund and the S&amp;P.   Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest name in the S&amp;P.  So, when people move  money into an S&amp;P index fund, that fund is forced to buy more Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- more Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) than anything else.  </p><p> So, as money's flown into indexes, it's flowing into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).   And that's what pushed all of these big tech names up.  When that slows  down, and it will, you're going to lose the big tailwind that you've had  behind these names.  </p><p> HERERA:  Daniel, have you been adding to your tech positions with the  downdraft that we've seen Thursday, Friday and today?  Or no?  </p><p> FLAX:  Sue, we can't speak to what specific funds are doing.  But what I  would say is, if you look back over time, many of these technology  companies' shares have been volatile.  At Neuberger Berman, our focus is  really on the fundamentals.  So, for example, we are looking for  significant earnings growth out of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next one to  two years.  Alphabet is another name that we think has attractive earnings  prospect.  </p><p> Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is a name where the shares are inexpensive, has  been a contrarian name.  That's a company that we continue to like, driven  by changes to its underlying mix.  And so, while the indices are at record  highs, we are really looking for names that we think can outperform  virtually regardless of the market environment, which, again, we expect is  going to remain pretty volatile.  </p><p> HERERA:  All righty.  On that note, gentlemen, thank you.  Good discussion.  </p><p> FLAX:  Thank you.  </p><p> BOBRINSKOY:  Thank you very much.  </p><p> HERERA:  Daniel Flax of Neuberger Berman and Charlie Bobrinskoy with Ariel  Investments.</p><p> A second federal appeals court ruled against President Trump's revised  travel ban.  The new ruling from a three-judge panel affirms a March  decision to block major parts of the order, which limited travel from six  predominantly Muslim countries.  The judges wrote that the order exceeded  the scope of the authority designated to the president by Congress.  The  ruling will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court, which is already  considering a similar case.  </p><p> There are a few other stories as well out of Washington that investors need  to be keeping an eye on.  </p><p> Not surprisingly.  John Harwood is here to talk about them with us.  </p><p> John, it's good to see you, as always.  </p><p> So, let's start with Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, testifying  tomorrow on Russia.  Why should investors specifically be watching closely?  </p><p> JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is key  testimony in the investigation for the Senate Intelligence Committee, and  it may factor into the special counsel's investigation as well, because  Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, has been involved at both ends here.  </p><p> First of all, he had undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador that  he had not initially told Congress about, when he was up for confirmation.   And then in addition to that, having recused himself from the Russia  investigation, he was involved in the firing of James Comey, who is leading  that investigation.  </p><p> This is a scandal that has the potential to destabilize the administration,  and Jeff Sessions by testifying in public is raising the stakes.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes, it certainly seems that way.  What about the impact that this  might have, the investigation, the testimony, et cetera, on the president's  agenda, most immediately health care, tax reform, last week was  infrastructure leak.  How will that be affected, if at all?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  The danger, Sue, is that the administration gets in a negative  downward spiral.  Gallup today had the president's approval rating at just  36 percent.  There's a special election coming up in Georgia in two weeks  to -- or in one week, rather, to fill the seat that Tom Price vacated, the  HHS secretary.  </p><p> If you see the president continue to go down, it makes it more difficult  for Republican members of Congress to stand with him on his priorities,  like health care, like tax reform, like infrastructure.  And you could get  into a situation if he continues to erode in his popularity, where it's  every person for him or herself in Washington, and that is not the kind of  unified front that Republicans need to push these agenda items through  Congress and get them on the president's desk.  </p><p> HERERA:  We will be watching closely, John.  Thank you, as always.  </p><p> HARWOOD:  You bet.  </p><p> HERERA:  John Harward in Washington.  </p><p> Still ahead tonight, did the Supreme Court just help get some drugs to  patients sooner?  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  Across the globe, in Qatar, financial markets there stabilized  after a week of losses.  This is as the government shows it can keep things  up and running despite being sanctioned by its neighbors.  </p><p> In an exclusive interview with CNBC, the Qatari finance minister dismissed  fears of an economic crisis and stressed his country's resilience.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ALI SHERIFF AL EMADI, QATAR FINANCE MINISTER:  If you look at what's  happened, sometimes a lot of people think that we're the only one to lose  in this.  I don't think so.  </p><p>Qatar is a very strong economy, and it's a big economy.  And I think if  we're going to lose a dollar, they will lose a dollar also.  I think there  is a lot of business among everybody around us.  So, I think it's -- I  always like to have a win-win situation, but this incident, it's very  unfortunate.  It's put a lot of lives, especially human peoples in  difficulties.  Families are being disrupted around these countries.  </p><p> This is not a measure that we wanted to be.  It was forced on us, it was  taken by other countries.  But I will say that Qatar is always open for  business.  We'd like the people that live here, they have all the respects  and they have full accessibilities and actually getting in and out of the  country at their previous life.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  As we've reported, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt are  among the leading Arab governments who have cut ties with Doha last week.  </p><p>Puerto Rico votes to be the 51st state, but the legitimacy of that result  is being questioned because the turnout was so low.  The governor, however,  said that he will create a commission to appoint a panel to lobby Congress  for statehood.  Congress now has to approve any changes to the island's  political status.  Puerto Rico is in the midst of a financial crisis.  It  has a debt load of $70 billion, and last month filed for the largest  municipal bankruptcy in the U.S.</p><p> A clothing retailer has joined the ranks of many other of its peers.   Gymboree has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  This comes just  weeks after it partnered with a turnaround firm after missing a June 1st  debt payment.  The company says it expects the move to move through the  process quickly and emerge as a stronger organization.  </p><p> IMAX is cutting 14 percent of its workforce.  That's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The movie theater company announced a $20 million cost savings plan which  includes eliminating approximately 100 positions worldwide.  IMAX also  announced a new $200 million share buyback program.  Shares of IMAX fell a  dime to $24 even.  </p><p> FedEx (NYSE:FDX) raised its quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share, up  from its 40 cents per share.  Investors liked the news, sending shares of  FedEx (NYSE:FDX) up more than 1 percent to $209.12.  </p><p> Merck (NYSE:MRK) said it would pause new enrollment in two late stage  studies of its immunotherapy drug Keytruda used in combination with other  treatments for multiple myeloma, which is a form of blood cancer.  The  stoppage was at the recommendation of an external data monitoring committee  to allow more information to be collected, to help understand why some  patients died given the therapy.  Keytruda is approved for lung and skin  cancer.  Shares of Merck (NYSE:MRK) initially dropped in afterhours  trading.  They were unchanged in the regular session at $64.39.  </p><p> And shares of Coherus Biosciences plunged after the FDA failed to approve a  bio similar drug that helps prevent infections for cancer patients who are  on chemotherapy.  Coherus Biosciences finished down nearly 24 percent at  $15.73.  </p><p> A ruling by the Supreme Court today could have wide-ranging implications  for the pharmaceutical industry.  The court's decision speeds up the time  that copycat versions of biologic drugs can get to market.  Biologics are  an expensive class of medicines that can boost sales for the drug  companies.  Biosimilars are copycat versions of those drugs.  </p><p> Meg Tirrell is following the story for us and she joins us here on the set.  </p><p> Always good to see you, Meg.  </p><p> So, what -- what was the case that the Supreme Court specifically ruled on?  </p><p> MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.  So,  this case is called Sandoz versus Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).  Sandoz is a unit of  Novartis.  And essentially it was over Amgen's drug Neupogen that is a  biologic drug.  Often, biologic drugs are administered through shots or  intravenously.  They're administered -- they're manufactured using living  cells.</p><p> And so, biosimilars are the copycat versions of biologics.  And the  industry calls them biosimilars because they argue because of the way  they're manufactured, they're not identical.  But we basically think of  generic drugs as sort of identical versions of the chemical versions of  drugs.  So --  </p><p> HERERA:  It's sort of a kind an equivalent.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  That's the idea.</p><p> And so, what this ruling did today was essentially overturn a lower court's  ruling that gave a six-month delay before when a biosimilar could be  introduced to market after it got approved.  It said no delay needed there  as long as you give the notice to the manufacturer early, you can launch.   Though it basically wiped out that six-month delay that would still  continue to allow accrual of sales for the original manufacturer.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, what are the broader implications for the drug industry?  </p><p> TIRRELL:  So, this essentially will have implications down the line as a  lot of these new drugs are introduced to market.  Right now, we only have  about five biosimilars currently approved in the United States.  And some  of them are still working their way through legal battles.  </p><p> But as we see more and more of these biosimilars being produced, it will  mean that they'll come to market a little bit sooner, and cut into the  original manufacturer sales more.  </p><p> HERERA:  Have you gotten any reaction yet from either the drug companies,  or, you know, the broader medical community that is using these products?  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Yes, it's kind of interesting.  The reaction was a little bit  muted.  This has been a very long process to figuring out how to get  biosimilars to market.  It's actually taken years to continue figuring it  out.  Probably the strongest reaction we saw today was from the payer  community, from -- you know, the pharmacy benefits managers who are  encouraging use of these lower priced medicines.  </p><p> However, what we've seen is when these are introduced, maybe they're only  introduced at a 10 percent to 15 percent discount to the original drug.   So, it's not that gigantic cost savings you're looking to see.  </p><p> HERERA:  Right.  I was wondering about that because the drug companies have  been under such scrutiny about cost increases, and the pharmacy benefit  managers are right in the middle of that.  So, maybe a little bit of a  benefit, but not an extreme benefit for the consumer.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  That's right.  At the beginning, we're seeing them introduced at  these kind of smaller discounts than you might expect to see, but people  say as we see more and more of these entering the market, that competitions  should bring prices down overall.  That's going to be a little ways off,  but we're headed in that direction.</p><p> HERERA:  Well, you'll be following it, I know.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Definitely.  </p><p> HERERA:  Thank you so much, Meg.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Thank you.  </p><p> HERERA:  Meg Tirrell.  </p><p> Coming up, hitting the gas.  While Uber struggles, rival Lyft is quietly  making some big moves.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  And here's a look at what to watch for tomorrow.  It is day one of  the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.  As we reported, Attorney  General Jeff Sessions will testify in front of a Senate panel on Russia.   OPEC will release an update on supply and demand trends in the oil market.   And that is what to watch for on Tuesday.  </p><p>McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) wants to hire 250,000 workers in the U.S. this  summer.  And it's doing it in a very modern way.  It's using Snapchat.  The  chain plans to run ten-second videos on the social media service of current  employees talking about working at the company, at which point viewers can  then swipe to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) website and apply.  </p><p> There may be a new player in the U.S. grocery market.  A German low-cost  grocer called Aldi plans to invest roughly $3.5 billion to expand its store  base.  It's an aggressive plan that would make Aldi the third biggest  supermarket chain behind Walmart and Kruger by the year 2022.  The  investment comes at a time of intense competition in that industry.   Walmart, which is the largest U.S. grocer, is testing lower prices in 11  states and is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the  low-price leader.  </p><p> Uber's chief executive will likely take a leave of absence.  According to  reports, no final decision has been made, following a board meeting  yesterday.  The board met over the weekend to consider recommendations from  an investigation into sexual harassment and related issues.  A close ally  of the CEO, Travis Kalanick, has left the ride-hailing company, making him  the latest high-level executive to depart.  Uber is a privately held  company but it is valued at roughly $70 billion.  </p><p> While Uber continues to wrestle with high profile legal and public  relations problems, its rival Lyft is quietly making some strategic moves.   The latest has Jaguar Land Rover taking a stake in Lyft and Phil LeBeau has  those details.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Uber may rule the road  when it comes to ride-sharing.  But its rival Lyft is putting together an  impressive group of partnerships that could pay off in the long run.  </p><p> That includes a new deal with Jaguar Land Rover.  The luxury auto brands  are investing $25 million in Lyft, and will work with the ride share  company developing mobility services.  The deal also calls for Jaguar Land  Rover to supply some vehicles to Lyft drivers.  </p><p> This is the second automaker to take a stake in Lyft, following GM's  investment of a half billion dollars last year.  At the time, many thought  it would lead to Lyft working almost exclusively with GM.  But since then,  both companies have branched out to also work with other tech and  transportation firms.  For example, Lyft has also struck a deal with Waymo,  the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary that is leading the development of  driverless vehicles.  </p><p> And just last week, Lyft announced it's working with the tech firm nuTonomy  to test self-driving vehicles with paying customers in Boston later this  year.  </p><p> Uber is also developing autonomous drive vehicles, testing them in  Pittsburgh.  But with the company embroiled in a number of controversies,  ranging from the culture of the firm to whether or not it's overcharging  customers, the time could be ripe for Lyft to gain ground on Uber,  especially in one or more of its partnerships takes off, and leaves the  company to greater growth.  </p><p> It's estimated the majority of the ride share business in the U.S. goes to  Uber.  Lyft says it has nearly 30 percent of the market.  But as Lyft  continues to expand and add new partnerships, it is slowly gaining ground  on Uber here in the U.S.</p><p> Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

The long- time CEO of General Electric (NYSE:GE) is stepping down.  A GE veteran is  stepping up.  And investors are cheering.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Techs tumble.  The best performing sector this year extends its losses.   But what happens next is up for debate.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Supreme decision.  A ruling by the highest court in the land could make  copies of biotech drugs available to consumers quicker.  </p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, June  12th.  </p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  Tyler Mathisen is  off tonight.  </p><p>The sell-off in technology shares intensified.  We'll have more on that in  a moment.  </p><p>But we begin tonight with a changing of the guard at General Electric  (NYSE:GE).  Chief executive Jeff Immelt will end his tenure this summer  after nearly 17 years.  Immelt engineered a shift in the industrial  company's focus but was under pressure to increase the price of the stock  which is widely owned by longtime investors and mutual funds.  Taking over  the top job is GE veteran John Flannery who heads up GE's health care  division.  Investors like the news, sending shares up 3.5 percent.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on the future of GE, a company that was an original  member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The change at the  top of General Electric (NYSE:GE) comes after 16 years.  Over that time,  there have been many grumblings about the stock price, a fact that hasn't  eluded the man soon to be in charge.  </p><p>JOHN FLANNERY, INCOMING GE CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  No one's happy with the stock  price right now, or some of the cash, you know, pictures that we've had.   We know we can be better at those things.  I want to focus on those things.  </p><p>So, I'm going to do basically what I've done in the health care business,  spend a lot of time with investors, with customers, with employees,  listening, hearing what, you know, people think about the company.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  John Flannery is a 30-year GE veteran.  He's held a number of top  posts, including health care where he turned around the flagging business. </p><p>Analysts say on the heels of some disappointing financial metrics, the key  will be how he plans to grow the company.  </p><p>JEFF WINDAU, EDWARD JONES ANALYST:  We're really looking for Mr. Flannery  to take a deep dive in the business, and really lay out the strategies and  where the growth's going to come from, help reassure us on the cash flow,  cash generation.  And we'd also like to see the -- some more information on  just where the capital's going to be spent, capital allocation.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  It also caps a dramatic 16-year tenure for Jeff Immelt, one  that's included the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the financial crisis, and a  flurry of deal activity that's fundamentally transformed the Dow component.   In 2001, GE derives nearly half its profit from its financial arm.  Today,  thanks to Immelt, roughly 90 percent comes from industrial businesses  instead.  </p><p>BILL GEORGE, HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL:  He's engineered a tremendous  strategic change in this company to move away from being a bank, which it  was moving towards when he turned over the rains in 2001 and emphasizing  high-tech and innovation and much more innovation.  Now, that takes time.  </p><p>Now, 16 years is a long time.  So, if I would be critical, I'd say move too  slowly, and to navigate two major crises, and it can be up to John Flannery  to prove that all these strategies are going to work.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  But the stock has performed poorly.  Down nearly 30 percent since  Immelt took the helm in 2001 and lagging this year on concerns about cash  flow and whether GE can reach its 2018 earnings target.  </p><p>But shares did jump today, even as management added some levity to a high- stakes scenario.  </p><p>Which talent would you most like to have?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Blues guitar and dunk a basketball.  Far up on both of  those.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Or maybe, maybe --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've gotten over that.  I've gotten over that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was hoping for great CEO of GE.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I thought you already felt that way.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can I do this over again? </p><p>BRENNAN:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And a new CEO isn't the only thing that happened at General  Electric (NYSE:GE) today.  The company also received regulatory approval  for its merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).  That deal was approved on the  condition that GE sell its water and process technologies business.  </p><p>On Wall Street overall, there was renewed pressure on the technology  sector.  The NASDAQ posted its biggest two-day slide since December, and  that took the rest of the market down with it.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the  worst performing stock on the Dow index, following an analyst's downgrade  today and a price target cut.  Dow Jones industrial average lost 36 points  to 21,235.  The NASDAQ was off 32, and the S&amp;P 500 fell two.  </p><p>But after outperforming the market this year, some say the pullback in the  tech sector is healthy.  Others say it is not.  </p><p>So, we asked Bob Pisani to lay out both sides of that debate.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This sudden movement is  generating a lot of healthy debate about whether the great technology run  of 2017 is over.  Tech, of course, has been the big mover this year, up 17  percent and far outperforming the 8 percent gain for the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>There are arguments on both the bull and bear side on this.  Now, the bears  argue tech is overall oversaturated or it's crowded trade.  It's all true,  particularly the so-called FAANG names, the Facebooks, Amazons, Apples,  Googles, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  </p><p>But the big tech names are better capitalized and have more stable profits  than their old counterparts during the dotcom boon.  That doesn't mean they  won't go down.  They're just more stable.  </p><p>Bears do have one big point.  These are traditionally cyclical stocks,  which means they can be volatile.  Investors are treating them more like  old-fashioned safety stocks like consumer staples with no volatility.   That's a mistake.  We saw that on Friday.  </p><p>The bulls' main argument is this, with the few exceptions, valuations of  even big tech names is not excessive.  True, some of the big names, the  Facebooks, and especially Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), they have priced earnings  ratios way above the S&amp;P norm of about 18.  That's because the market is  assuming very strong revenue growth for these companies, which is not  proven to be wrong, at least not yet.  </p><p>Take the biggest name of all, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which currently trades  at about 16 times 2017 earnings.  That's hardly inflated.  Apple's had very  high valuations in the past, but not today.  Tech is strong because tech  companies have plenty of new business opportunities.  Think about it,  there's the growth of artificial intelligence, there's robotics, there's  genomics, there's cloud computing, there's self-driving cars, and the  Internet of things.  No lack of opportunities for tech names.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, let's turn now to our bull and our bear guests for more on  technology.  We have Daniel Flax, senior technology at Neuberger Berman,  who is our bull, who sees more room for tech to run.  While our bear,  Charlie Bobrinskoy is the vice chairman at Arial Investments, and he says  some of the tech names do not deserve the run-up that we've seen.  </p><p>Gentlemen, welcome.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>CHARLES BOBRINSKOY, ARIEL INVESTMENT VICE CHAIRMAN:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>DANIEL FLAX, NEUBERGER BERMAN SR. TECH ANALYST:  Great to see you, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  Charlie, I'm going to start with you.  Bob laid out, you know,  kind of the -- both scenarios for us.  You do not own the FAANG stocks, the  Facebooks, the Apples, the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Why?  </p><p>BOBRINSKOY:  Because if there's anything history has shown us, it's that  people are too optimistic and overconfident about their ability to see the  future.  And by definitions, these stocks are trading at 144 times  earnings, because people think they're very confident that these companies  are going to grow massively in the future.  </p><p>And again, history just teaches us that in technology, yesterday's and even  today's leader are not necessarily tomorrow's winner.  Just look at IBM and  all the big computer companies, MySpace, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), even  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which was the leader so far ago.  </p><p>So, it's just a tough industry to predict.  And therefore, it shouldn't pay  144 times earnings for it.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Daniel, what about that?  I mean, you mentioned in my  notes at least that if you focus on companies that can disrupt and can look  through some of the noise that we're seeing today, a pullback in tech might  be a good buying opportunity.  </p><p>FLAX:  Thanks, Sue.  Look, at Neuberger Berman, we try to take a longer  term view on this.  While we expect a lot of these shares, including Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), to remain volatile, we think there's certain elements that  are underappreciated. </p><p>So, for example, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), you have a very strong ecosystem  which is underappreciated by the market.  And as we look out over the next  one to two years, we think growth could improve driven by the new iPhone 8  which is likely to come in the fall.  We would also add that Apple's  revenue and profit pull is more stable I think than people appreciate,  helped partly by their services growth.  </p><p>HERERA:  What about that, Charlie?  Some of these companies do have -- to  use Daniel's words -- an echo system that is well-developed.  </p><p>BOBRINSKOY:  Well, sure, that's what they always say.  But if we were  having this conversation 15 years ago, it would have been about how the  BlackBerry has this wonderful ecosystem.  Everyone had a BlackBerry in the  business world 15 years ago.  Now nobody does.  The stock is virtually  gone.  </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is earning more than half of its profits from phones,  from hardware, and there is just no predictability that they're going to be  the leader in ten years from now, in phones.  I'm predicting that they  actually won't be.  </p><p>HERERA:  Interesting.  </p><p>Daniel, what about that point?  I mean, mentioning the BlackBerry certainly  does bring back those days when everybody did have them.  That was the tech  stock that everybody had to own.  How do you make sure that when you do add  a tech stock, or when Neuberger adds a tech stock to the recommended list,  that you are going to have something that has longevity?  </p><p>FLAX:  I think which distinguishes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) from BlackBerry is  apple has been able to build a platform upon which others are able to build  and create.  And so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) builds integrated systems, which  include the hardware, the software and the services, but the key is that  the developer community has really been able to build on top of that.  </p><p>And so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has paid out over $70 billion to developers  over the last several years.  And so, by bringing others along with it, and  helping to create a differentiated user experience, this in our view is  what's going to help Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) attract new customers, and of  course, get their installed base to continue upgrading.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, Charlie, I know we had a pullback in the NASDAQ for the  last few days or so.  And in same case, on some stocks, it's been a little  worse than others.  But a number of these stocks have been big winners for  the year.  </p><p>Do you worry about missing out on that kind of growth?  </p><p>BOBRINSKOY:  No.  You want to be selling what others have been buying.  And  buy what others have been selling.  And, clearly, you're absolutely right,  apple has benefited from this big move in the index fund and the S&amp;P.   Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest name in the S&amp;P.  So, when people move  money into an S&amp;P index fund, that fund is forced to buy more Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- more Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) than anything else.  </p><p>So, as money's flown into indexes, it's flowing into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).   And that's what pushed all of these big tech names up.  When that slows  down, and it will, you're going to lose the big tailwind that you've had  behind these names.  </p><p>HERERA:  Daniel, have you been adding to your tech positions with the  downdraft that we've seen Thursday, Friday and today?  Or no?  </p><p>FLAX:  Sue, we can't speak to what specific funds are doing.  But what I  would say is, if you look back over time, many of these technology  companies' shares have been volatile.  At Neuberger Berman, our focus is  really on the fundamentals.  So, for example, we are looking for  significant earnings growth out of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next one to  two years.  Alphabet is another name that we think has attractive earnings  prospect.  </p><p>Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is a name where the shares are inexpensive, has  been a contrarian name.  That's a company that we continue to like, driven  by changes to its underlying mix.  And so, while the indices are at record  highs, we are really looking for names that we think can outperform  virtually regardless of the market environment, which, again, we expect is  going to remain pretty volatile.  </p><p>HERERA:  All righty.  On that note, gentlemen, thank you.  Good discussion.  </p><p>FLAX:  Thank you.  </p><p>BOBRINSKOY:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>HERERA:  Daniel Flax of Neuberger Berman and Charlie Bobrinskoy with Ariel  Investments.</p><p>A second federal appeals court ruled against President Trump's revised  travel ban.  The new ruling from a three-judge panel affirms a March  decision to block major parts of the order, which limited travel from six  predominantly Muslim countries.  The judges wrote that the order exceeded  the scope of the authority designated to the president by Congress.  The  ruling will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court, which is already  considering a similar case.  </p><p>There are a few other stories as well out of Washington that investors need  to be keeping an eye on.  </p><p>Not surprisingly.  John Harwood is here to talk about them with us.  </p><p>John, it's good to see you, as always.  </p><p>So, let's start with Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, testifying  tomorrow on Russia.  Why should investors specifically be watching closely?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is key  testimony in the investigation for the Senate Intelligence Committee, and  it may factor into the special counsel's investigation as well, because  Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, has been involved at both ends here.  </p><p>First of all, he had undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador that  he had not initially told Congress about, when he was up for confirmation.   And then in addition to that, having recused himself from the Russia  investigation, he was involved in the firing of James Comey, who is leading  that investigation.  </p><p>This is a scandal that has the potential to destabilize the administration,  and Jeff Sessions by testifying in public is raising the stakes.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, it certainly seems that way.  What about the impact that this  might have, the investigation, the testimony, et cetera, on the president's  agenda, most immediately health care, tax reform, last week was  infrastructure leak.  How will that be affected, if at all?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  The danger, Sue, is that the administration gets in a negative  downward spiral.  Gallup today had the president's approval rating at just  36 percent.  There's a special election coming up in Georgia in two weeks  to -- or in one week, rather, to fill the seat that Tom Price vacated, the  HHS secretary.  </p><p>If you see the president continue to go down, it makes it more difficult  for Republican members of Congress to stand with him on his priorities,  like health care, like tax reform, like infrastructure.  And you could get  into a situation if he continues to erode in his popularity, where it's  every person for him or herself in Washington, and that is not the kind of  unified front that Republicans need to push these agenda items through  Congress and get them on the president's desk.  </p><p>HERERA:  We will be watching closely, John.  Thank you, as always.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  You bet.  </p><p>HERERA:  John Harward in Washington.  </p><p>Still ahead tonight, did the Supreme Court just help get some drugs to  patients sooner?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Across the globe, in Qatar, financial markets there stabilized  after a week of losses.  This is as the government shows it can keep things  up and running despite being sanctioned by its neighbors.  </p><p>In an exclusive interview with CNBC, the Qatari finance minister dismissed  fears of an economic crisis and stressed his country's resilience.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALI SHERIFF AL EMADI, QATAR FINANCE MINISTER:  If you look at what's  happened, sometimes a lot of people think that we're the only one to lose  in this.  I don't think so.  </p><p>Qatar is a very strong economy, and it's a big economy.  And I think if  we're going to lose a dollar, they will lose a dollar also.  I think there  is a lot of business among everybody around us.  So, I think it's -- I  always like to have a win-win situation, but this incident, it's very  unfortunate.  It's put a lot of lives, especially human peoples in  difficulties.  Families are being disrupted around these countries.  </p><p>This is not a measure that we wanted to be.  It was forced on us, it was  taken by other countries.  But I will say that Qatar is always open for  business.  We'd like the people that live here, they have all the respects  and they have full accessibilities and actually getting in and out of the  country at their previous life.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  As we've reported, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt are  among the leading Arab governments who have cut ties with Doha last week.  </p><p>Puerto Rico votes to be the 51st state, but the legitimacy of that result  is being questioned because the turnout was so low.  The governor, however,  said that he will create a commission to appoint a panel to lobby Congress  for statehood.  Congress now has to approve any changes to the island's  political status.  Puerto Rico is in the midst of a financial crisis.  It  has a debt load of $70 billion, and last month filed for the largest  municipal bankruptcy in the U.S.</p><p>A clothing retailer has joined the ranks of many other of its peers.   Gymboree has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  This comes just  weeks after it partnered with a turnaround firm after missing a June 1st  debt payment.  The company says it expects the move to move through the  process quickly and emerge as a stronger organization.  </p><p>IMAX is cutting 14 percent of its workforce.  That's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The movie theater company announced a $20 million cost savings plan which  includes eliminating approximately 100 positions worldwide.  IMAX also  announced a new $200 million share buyback program.  Shares of IMAX fell a  dime to $24 even.  </p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) raised its quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share, up  from its 40 cents per share.  Investors liked the news, sending shares of  FedEx (NYSE:FDX) up more than 1 percent to $209.12.  </p><p>Merck (NYSE:MRK) said it would pause new enrollment in two late stage  studies of its immunotherapy drug Keytruda used in combination with other  treatments for multiple myeloma, which is a form of blood cancer.  The  stoppage was at the recommendation of an external data monitoring committee  to allow more information to be collected, to help understand why some  patients died given the therapy.  Keytruda is approved for lung and skin  cancer.  Shares of Merck (NYSE:MRK) initially dropped in afterhours  trading.  They were unchanged in the regular session at $64.39.  </p><p>And shares of Coherus Biosciences plunged after the FDA failed to approve a  bio similar drug that helps prevent infections for cancer patients who are  on chemotherapy.  Coherus Biosciences finished down nearly 24 percent at  $15.73.  </p><p>A ruling by the Supreme Court today could have wide-ranging implications  for the pharmaceutical industry.  The court's decision speeds up the time  that copycat versions of biologic drugs can get to market.  Biologics are  an expensive class of medicines that can boost sales for the drug  companies.  Biosimilars are copycat versions of those drugs.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell is following the story for us and she joins us here on the set.  </p><p>Always good to see you, Meg.  </p><p>So, what -- what was the case that the Supreme Court specifically ruled on?  </p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  That's right.  So,  this case is called Sandoz versus Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).  Sandoz is a unit of  Novartis.  And essentially it was over Amgen's drug Neupogen that is a  biologic drug.  Often, biologic drugs are administered through shots or  intravenously.  They're administered -- they're manufactured using living  cells.</p><p>And so, biosimilars are the copycat versions of biologics.  And the  industry calls them biosimilars because they argue because of the way  they're manufactured, they're not identical.  But we basically think of  generic drugs as sort of identical versions of the chemical versions of  drugs.  So --  </p><p>HERERA:  It's sort of a kind an equivalent.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  That's the idea.</p><p>And so, what this ruling did today was essentially overturn a lower court's  ruling that gave a six-month delay before when a biosimilar could be  introduced to market after it got approved.  It said no delay needed there  as long as you give the notice to the manufacturer early, you can launch.   Though it basically wiped out that six-month delay that would still  continue to allow accrual of sales for the original manufacturer.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, what are the broader implications for the drug industry?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  So, this essentially will have implications down the line as a  lot of these new drugs are introduced to market.  Right now, we only have  about five biosimilars currently approved in the United States.  And some  of them are still working their way through legal battles.  </p><p>But as we see more and more of these biosimilars being produced, it will  mean that they'll come to market a little bit sooner, and cut into the  original manufacturer sales more.  </p><p>HERERA:  Have you gotten any reaction yet from either the drug companies,  or, you know, the broader medical community that is using these products?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Yes, it's kind of interesting.  The reaction was a little bit  muted.  This has been a very long process to figuring out how to get  biosimilars to market.  It's actually taken years to continue figuring it  out.  Probably the strongest reaction we saw today was from the payer  community, from -- you know, the pharmacy benefits managers who are  encouraging use of these lower priced medicines.  </p><p>However, what we've seen is when these are introduced, maybe they're only  introduced at a 10 percent to 15 percent discount to the original drug.   So, it's not that gigantic cost savings you're looking to see.  </p><p>HERERA:  Right.  I was wondering about that because the drug companies have  been under such scrutiny about cost increases, and the pharmacy benefit  managers are right in the middle of that.  So, maybe a little bit of a  benefit, but not an extreme benefit for the consumer.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  That's right.  At the beginning, we're seeing them introduced at  these kind of smaller discounts than you might expect to see, but people  say as we see more and more of these entering the market, that competitions  should bring prices down overall.  That's going to be a little ways off,  but we're headed in that direction.</p><p>HERERA:  Well, you'll be following it, I know.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Definitely.  </p><p>HERERA:  Thank you so much, Meg.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  Meg Tirrell.  </p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas.  While Uber struggles, rival Lyft is quietly  making some big moves.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  And here's a look at what to watch for tomorrow.  It is day one of  the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.  As we reported, Attorney  General Jeff Sessions will testify in front of a Senate panel on Russia.   OPEC will release an update on supply and demand trends in the oil market.   And that is what to watch for on Tuesday.  </p><p>McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) wants to hire 250,000 workers in the U.S. this  summer.  And it's doing it in a very modern way.  It's using Snapchat.  The  chain plans to run ten-second videos on the social media service of current  employees talking about working at the company, at which point viewers can  then swipe to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) website and apply.  </p><p>There may be a new player in the U.S. grocery market.  A German low-cost  grocer called Aldi plans to invest roughly $3.5 billion to expand its store  base.  It's an aggressive plan that would make Aldi the third biggest  supermarket chain behind Walmart and Kruger by the year 2022.  The  investment comes at a time of intense competition in that industry.   Walmart, which is the largest U.S. grocer, is testing lower prices in 11  states and is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the  low-price leader.  </p><p>Uber's chief executive will likely take a leave of absence.  According to  reports, no final decision has been made, following a board meeting  yesterday.  The board met over the weekend to consider recommendations from  an investigation into sexual harassment and related issues.  A close ally  of the CEO, Travis Kalanick, has left the ride-hailing company, making him  the latest high-level executive to depart.  Uber is a privately held  company but it is valued at roughly $70 billion.  </p><p>While Uber continues to wrestle with high profile legal and public  relations problems, its rival Lyft is quietly making some strategic moves.   The latest has Jaguar Land Rover taking a stake in Lyft and Phil LeBeau has  those details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Uber may rule the road  when it comes to ride-sharing.  But its rival Lyft is putting together an  impressive group of partnerships that could pay off in the long run.  </p><p>That includes a new deal with Jaguar Land Rover.  The luxury auto brands  are investing $25 million in Lyft, and will work with the ride share  company developing mobility services.  The deal also calls for Jaguar Land  Rover to supply some vehicles to Lyft drivers.  </p><p>This is the second automaker to take a stake in Lyft, following GM's  investment of a half billion dollars last year.  At the time, many thought  it would lead to Lyft working almost exclusively with GM.  But since then,  both companies have branched out to also work with other tech and  transportation firms.  For example, Lyft has also struck a deal with Waymo,  the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary that is leading the development of  driverless vehicles.  </p><p>And just last week, Lyft announced it's working with the tech firm nuTonomy  to test self-driving vehicles with paying customers in Boston later this  year.  </p><p>Uber is also developing autonomous drive vehicles, testing them in  Pittsburgh.  But with the company embroiled in a number of controversies,  ranging from the culture of the firm to whether or not it's overcharging  customers, the time could be ripe for Lyft to gain ground on Uber,  especially in one or more of its partnerships takes off, and leaves the  company to greater growth.  </p><p>It's estimated the majority of the ride share business in the U.S. goes to  Uber.  Lyft says it has nearly 30 percent of the market.  But as Lyft  continues to expand and add new partnerships, it is slowly gaining ground  on Uber here in the U.S. </p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

The long- time CEO of General Electric (NYSE:GE) is stepping down. A <person><nameText>GE </nameText></person>veteran is stepping up. And investors are cheering.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Techs tumble. The best performing sector this year extends its losses. But what happens next is up for debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Supreme decision. A ruling by the highest court in the land could make copies of biotech drugs available to consumers quicker.</p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, June 12th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome. I`m Sue Herera. Tyler Mathisen is off tonight.</p><p>The sell-off in technology shares intensified. We`ll have more on that in a moment.</p><p>But we begin tonight with a changing of the guard at General Electric (NYSE:GE). Chief executive <person><nameText>Jeff Immelt </nameText></person>will end his tenure this summer after nearly 17 years. Immelt engineered a shift in the industrial company`s focus but was under pressure to increase the price of the stock which is widely owned by longtime investors and mutual funds. Taking over the top job is <person><nameText>GE </nameText></person>veteran <person><nameText>John Flannery </nameText></person>who heads up GE`s health care division. Investors like the news, sending shares up 3.5 percent.</p><p>Morgan Brennan has more on the future of <person><nameText>GE, </nameText></person>a company that was an original member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The change at the top of General Electric (NYSE:GE) comes after 16 years. Over that time, there have been many grumblings about the stock price, a fact that hasn`t eluded the man soon to be in charge.</p><p><person><nameText>JOHN FLANNERY, </nameText></person>INCOMING <person><nameText>GE </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: No one`s happy with the stock price right now, or some of the cash, you know, pictures that we`ve had. We know we can be better at those things. I want to focus on those things.</p><p>So, I`m going to do basically what I`ve done in the health care business, spend a lot of time with investors, with customers, with employees, listening, hearing what, you know, people think about the company.</p><p>BRENNAN: <person><nameText>John Flannery </nameText></person>is a 30-year <person><nameText>GE </nameText></person>veteran. He`s held a number of top posts, including health care where he turned around the flagging business.</p><p>Analysts say on the heels of some disappointing financial metrics, the key will be how he plans to grow the company.</p><p>JEFF WINDAU, EDWARD JONES ANALYST: We`re really looking for Mr. Flannery to take a deep dive in the business, and really lay out the strategies and where the growth`s going to come from, help reassure us on the cash flow, cash generation. And we`d also like to see the -- some more information on just where the capital`s going to be spent, capital allocation.</p><p>BRENNAN: It also caps a dramatic 16-year tenure for <person><nameText>Jeff Immelt, </nameText></person>one that`s included the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the financial crisis, and a flurry of deal activity that`s fundamentally transformed the Dow component. In 2001, <person><nameText>GE </nameText></person>derives nearly half its profit from its financial arm. Today, thanks to Immelt, roughly 90 percent comes from industrial businesses instead.</p><p>BILL GEORGE, HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL: He`s engineered a tremendous strategic change in this company to move away from being a bank, which it was moving towards when he turned over the rains in 2001 and emphasizing high-tech and innovation and much more innovation. Now, that takes time.</p><p>Now, 16 years is a long time. So, if I would be critical, I`d say move too slowly, and to navigate two major crises, and it can be up to <person><nameText>John Flannery </nameText></person>to prove that all these strategies are going to work.</p><p>BRENNAN: But the stock has performed poorly. Down nearly 30 percent since Immelt took the helm in 2001 and lagging this year on concerns about cash flow and whether <person><nameText>GE </nameText></person>can reach its 2018 earnings target.</p><p>But shares did jump today, even as management added some levity to a high- stakes scenario.</p><p>Which talent would you most like to have?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Blues guitar and dunk a basketball. Far up on both of those.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or maybe, maybe --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`ve gotten over that. I`ve gotten over that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was hoping for great CEO of <person><nameText>GE.</nameText></person></p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought you already felt that way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can I do this over again?</p><p>BRENNAN: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And a new CEO isn`t the only thing that happened at General Electric (NYSE:GE) today. The company also received regulatory approval for its merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI). That deal was approved on the condition that <person><nameText>GE </nameText></person>sell its water and process technologies business.</p><p>On Wall Street overall, there was renewed pressure on the technology sector. The NASDAQ posted its biggest two-day slide since December, and that took the rest of the market down with it. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the worst performing stock on the Dow index, following an analyst`s downgrade today and a price target cut. Dow Jones industrial average lost 36 points to 21,235. The NASDAQ was off 32, and the S&amp;P 500 fell two.</p><p>But after outperforming the market this year, some say the pullback in the tech sector is healthy. Others say it is not.</p><p>So, we asked Bob Pisani to lay out both sides of that debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This sudden movement is generating a lot of healthy debate about whether the great technology run of 2017 is over. Tech, of course, has been the big mover this year, up 17 percent and far outperforming the 8 percent gain for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>There are arguments on both the bull and bear side on this. Now, the bears argue tech is overall oversaturated or it`s crowded trade. It`s all true, particularly the so-called FAANG names, the Facebooks, Amazons, Apples, Googles, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).</p><p>But the big tech names are better capitalized and have more stable profits than their old counterparts during the dotcom boon. That doesn`t mean they won`t go down. They`re just more stable.</p><p>Bears do have one big point. These are traditionally cyclical stocks, which means they can be volatile. Investors are treating them more like old-fashioned safety stocks like consumer staples with no volatility. That`s a mistake. We saw that on Friday.</p><p>The bulls` main argument is this, with the few exceptions, valuations of even big tech names is not excessive. True, some of the big names, the Facebooks, and especially Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), they have priced earnings ratios way above the S&amp;P norm of about 18. That`s because the market is assuming very strong revenue growth for these companies, which is not proven to be wrong, at least not yet.</p><p>Take the biggest name of all, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which currently trades at about 16 times 2017 earnings. That`s hardly inflated. Apple`s had very high valuations in the past, but not today. Tech is strong because tech companies have plenty of new business opportunities. Think about it, there`s the growth of artificial intelligence, there`s robotics, there`s genomics, there`s cloud computing, there`s self-driving cars, and the Internet of things. No lack of opportunities for tech names.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, let`s turn now to our bull and our bear guests for more on technology. We have Daniel Flax, senior technology at Neuberger Berman, who is our bull, who sees more room for tech to run. While our bear, Charlie Bobrinskoy is the vice chairman at Arial Investments, and he says some of the tech names do not deserve the run-up that we`ve seen.</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome. Nice to have you here.</p><p>CHARLES BOBRINSKOY, ARIEL INVESTMENT VICE CHAIRMAN: Thanks for having us.</p><p>DANIEL FLAX, NEUBERGER BERMAN SR. TECH ANALYST: Great to see you, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: Charlie, I`m going to start with you. Bob laid out, you know, kind of the -- both scenarios for us. You do not own the FAANG stocks, the Facebooks, the Apples, the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Why?</p><p>BOBRINSKOY: Because if there`s anything history has shown us, it`s that people are too optimistic and overconfident about their ability to see the future. And by definitions, these stocks are trading at 144 times earnings, because people think they`re very confident that these companies are going to grow massively in the future.</p><p>And again, history just teaches us that in technology, yesterday`s and even today`s leader are not necessarily tomorrow`s winner. Just look at IBM and all the big computer companies, MySpace, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), even Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which was the leader so far ago.</p><p>So, it`s just a tough industry to predict. And therefore, it shouldn`t pay 144 times earnings for it.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Daniel, what about that? I mean, you mentioned in my notes at least that if you focus on companies that can disrupt and can look through some of the noise that we`re seeing today, a pullback in tech might be a good buying opportunity.</p><p>FLAX: Thanks, Sue. Look, at Neuberger Berman, we try to take a longer term view on this. While we expect a lot of these shares, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), to remain volatile, we think there`s certain elements that are underappreciated.</p><p>So, for example, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), you have a very strong ecosystem which is underappreciated by the market. And as we look out over the next one to two years, we think growth could improve driven by the new iPhone 8 which is likely to come in the fall. We would also add that Apple`s revenue and profit pull is more stable I think than people appreciate, helped partly by their services growth.</p><p>HERERA: What about that, Charlie? Some of these companies do have -- to use Daniel`s words -- an echo system that is well-developed.</p><p>BOBRINSKOY: Well, sure, that`s what they always say. But if we were having this conversation 15 years ago, it would have been about how the BlackBerry has this wonderful ecosystem. Everyone had a BlackBerry in the business world 15 years ago. Now nobody does. The stock is virtually gone.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is earning more than half of its profits from phones, from hardware, and there is just no predictability that they`re going to be the leader in ten years from now, in phones. I`m predicting that they actually won`t be.</p><p>HERERA: Interesting.</p><p>Daniel, what about that point? I mean, mentioning the BlackBerry certainly does bring back those days when everybody did have them. That was the tech stock that everybody had to own. How do you make sure that when you do add a tech stock, or when Neuberger adds a tech stock to the recommended list, that you are going to have something that has longevity?</p><p>FLAX: I think which distinguishes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) from BlackBerry is apple has been able to build a platform upon which others are able to build and create. And so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) builds integrated systems, which include the hardware, the software and the services, but the key is that the developer community has really been able to build on top of that.</p><p>And so, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has paid out over $70 billion to developers over the last several years. And so, by bringing others along with it, and helping to create a differentiated user experience, this in our view is what`s going to help Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) attract new customers, and of course, get their installed base to continue upgrading.</p><p>HERERA: You know, Charlie, I know we had a pullback in the NASDAQ for the last few days or so. And in same case, on some stocks, it`s been a little worse than others. But a number of these stocks have been big winners for the year.</p><p>Do you worry about missing out on that kind of growth?</p><p>BOBRINSKOY: No. You want to be selling what others have been buying. And buy what others have been selling. And, clearly, you`re absolutely right, apple has benefited from this big move in the index fund and the S&amp;P. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest name in the S&amp;P. So, when people move money into an S&amp;P index fund, that fund is forced to buy more Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- more Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) than anything else.</p><p>So, as money`s flown into indexes, it`s flowing into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And that`s what pushed all of these big tech names up. When that slows down, and it will, you`re going to lose the big tailwind that you`ve had behind these names.</p><p>HERERA: Daniel, have you been adding to your tech positions with the downdraft that we`ve seen Thursday, Friday and today? Or no?</p><p>FLAX: Sue, we can`t speak to what specific funds are doing. But what I would say is, if you look back over time, many of these technology companies` shares have been volatile. At Neuberger Berman, our focus is really on the fundamentals. So, for example, we are looking for significant earnings growth out of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next one to two years. Alphabet is another name that we think has attractive earnings prospect.</p><p>Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is a name where the shares are inexpensive, has been a contrarian name. That`s a company that we continue to like, driven by changes to its underlying mix. And so, while the indices are at record highs, we are really looking for names that we think can outperform virtually regardless of the market environment, which, again, we expect is going to remain pretty volatile.</p><p>HERERA: All righty. On that note, gentlemen, thank you. Good discussion.</p><p>FLAX: Thank you.</p><p>BOBRINSKOY: Thank you very much.</p><p>HERERA: Daniel Flax of Neuberger Berman and Charlie Bobrinskoy with Ariel Investments.</p><p>A second federal appeals court ruled against President Trump`s revised travel ban. The new ruling from a three-judge panel affirms a March decision to block major parts of the order, which limited travel from six predominantly Muslim countries. The judges wrote that the order exceeded the scope of the authority designated to the president by Congress. The ruling will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court, which is already considering a similar case.</p><p>There are a few other stories as well out of Washington that investors need to be keeping an eye on.</p><p>Not surprisingly. John Harwood is here to talk about them with us.</p><p>John, it`s good to see you, as always.</p><p>So, let`s start with Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, testifying tomorrow on Russia. Why should investors specifically be watching closely?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is key testimony in the investigation for the Senate Intelligence Committee, and it may factor into the special counsel`s investigation as well, because Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, has been involved at both ends here.</p><p>First of all, he had undisclosed meetings with the Russian ambassador that he had not initially told Congress about, when he was up for confirmation. And then in addition to that, having recused himself from the Russia investigation, he was involved in the firing of James Comey, who is leading that investigation.</p><p>This is a scandal that has the potential to destabilize the administration, and Jeff Sessions by testifying in public is raising the stakes.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, it certainly seems that way. What about the impact that this might have, the investigation, the testimony, et cetera, on the president`s agenda, most immediately health care, tax reform, last week was infrastructure leak. How will that be affected, if at all?</p><p>HARWOOD: The danger, Sue, is that the administration gets in a negative downward spiral. Gallup today had the president`s approval rating at just 36 percent. There`s a special election coming up in Georgia in two weeks to -- or in one week, rather, to fill the seat that Tom Price vacated, the HHS secretary.</p><p>If you see the president continue to go down, it makes it more difficult for Republican members of Congress to stand with him on his priorities, like health care, like tax reform, like infrastructure. And you could get into a situation if he continues to erode in his popularity, where it`s every person for him or herself in Washington, and that is not the kind of unified front that Republicans need to push these agenda items through Congress and get them on the president`s desk.</p><p>HERERA: We will be watching closely, John. Thank you, as always.</p><p>HARWOOD: You bet.</p><p>HERERA: John Harward in Washington.</p><p>Still ahead tonight, did the Supreme Court just help get some drugs to patients sooner?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Across the globe, in Qatar, financial markets there stabilized after a week of losses. This is as the government shows it can keep things up and running despite being sanctioned by its neighbors.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with CNBC, the Qatari finance minister dismissed fears of an economic crisis and stressed his country`s resilience.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALI SHERIFF AL EMADI, QATAR FINANCE MINISTER: If you look at what`s happened, sometimes a lot of people think that we`re the only one to lose in this. I don`t think so.</p><p>Qatar is a very strong economy, and it`s a big economy. And I think if we`re going to lose a dollar, they will lose a dollar also. I think there is a lot of business among everybody around us. So, I think it`s -- I always like to have a win-win situation, but this incident, it`s very unfortunate. It`s put a lot of lives, especially human peoples in difficulties. Families are being disrupted around these countries.</p><p>This is not a measure that we wanted to be. It was forced on us, it was taken by other countries. But I will say that Qatar is always open for business. We`d like the people that live here, they have all the respects and they have full accessibilities and actually getting in and out of the country at their previous life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: As we`ve reported, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Egypt are among the leading Arab governments who have cut ties with Doha last week.</p><p>Puerto Rico votes to be the 51st state, but the legitimacy of that result is being questioned because the turnout was so low. The governor, however, said that he will create a commission to appoint a panel to lobby Congress for statehood. Congress now has to approve any changes to the island`s political status. Puerto Rico is in the midst of a financial crisis. It has a debt load of $70 billion, and last month filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in the U.S.</p><p>A clothing retailer has joined the ranks of many other of its peers. Gymboree has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This comes just weeks after it partnered with a turnaround firm after missing a June 1st debt payment. The company says it expects the move to move through the process quickly and emerge as a stronger organization.</p><p>IMAX is cutting 14 percent of its workforce. That`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The movie theater company announced a $20 million cost savings plan which includes eliminating approximately 100 positions worldwide. IMAX also announced a new $200 million share buyback program. Shares of IMAX fell a dime to $24 even.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) raised its quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share, up from its 40 cents per share. Investors liked the news, sending shares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) up more than 1 percent to $209.12.</p><p>Merck (NYSE:MRK) said it would pause new enrollment in two late stage studies of its immunotherapy drug Keytruda used in combination with other treatments for multiple myeloma, which is a form of blood cancer. The stoppage was at the recommendation of an external data monitoring committee to allow more information to be collected, to help understand why some patients died given the therapy. Keytruda is approved for lung and skin cancer. Shares of Merck (NYSE:MRK) initially dropped in afterhours trading. They were unchanged in the regular session at $64.39.</p><p>And shares of Coherus Biosciences plunged after the FDA failed to approve a bio similar drug that helps prevent infections for cancer patients who are on chemotherapy. Coherus Biosciences finished down nearly 24 percent at $15.73.</p><p>A ruling by the Supreme Court today could have wide-ranging implications for the pharmaceutical industry. The court`s decision speeds up the time that copycat versions of biologic drugs can get to market. Biologics are an expensive class of medicines that can boost sales for the drug companies. Biosimilars are copycat versions of those drugs.</p><p>Meg Tirrell is following the story for us and she joins us here on the set.</p><p>Always good to see you, Meg.</p><p>So, what -- what was the case that the Supreme Court specifically ruled on?</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: That`s right. So, this case is called Sandoz versus Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Sandoz is a unit of Novartis. And essentially it was over Amgen`s drug Neupogen that is a biologic drug. Often, biologic drugs are administered through shots or intravenously. They`re administered -- they`re manufactured using living cells.</p><p>And so, biosimilars are the copycat versions of biologics. And the industry calls them biosimilars because they argue because of the way they`re manufactured, they`re not identical. But we basically think of generic drugs as sort of identical versions of the chemical versions of drugs. So --</p><p>HERERA: It`s sort of a kind an equivalent.</p><p>TIRRELL: That`s the idea.</p><p>And so, what this ruling did today was essentially overturn a lower court`s ruling that gave a six-month delay before when a biosimilar could be introduced to market after it got approved. It said no delay needed there as long as you give the notice to the manufacturer early, you can launch. Though it basically wiped out that six-month delay that would still continue to allow accrual of sales for the original manufacturer.</p><p>HERERA: So, what are the broader implications for the drug industry?</p><p>TIRRELL: So, this essentially will have implications down the line as a lot of these new drugs are introduced to market. Right now, we only have about five biosimilars currently approved in the United States. And some of them are still working their way through legal battles.</p><p>But as we see more and more of these biosimilars being produced, it will mean that they`ll come to market a little bit sooner, and cut into the original manufacturer sales more.</p><p>HERERA: Have you gotten any reaction yet from either the drug companies, or, you know, the broader medical community that is using these products?</p><p>TIRRELL: Yes, it`s kind of interesting. The reaction was a little bit muted. This has been a very long process to figuring out how to get biosimilars to market. It`s actually taken years to continue figuring it out. Probably the strongest reaction we saw today was from the payer community, from -- you know, the pharmacy benefits managers who are encouraging use of these lower priced medicines.</p><p>However, what we`ve seen is when these are introduced, maybe they`re only introduced at a 10 percent to 15 percent discount to the original drug. So, it`s not that gigantic cost savings you`re looking to see.</p><p>HERERA: Right. I was wondering about that because the drug companies have been under such scrutiny about cost increases, and the pharmacy benefit managers are right in the middle of that. So, maybe a little bit of a benefit, but not an extreme benefit for the consumer.</p><p>TIRRELL: That`s right. At the beginning, we`re seeing them introduced at these kind of smaller discounts than you might expect to see, but people say as we see more and more of these entering the market, that competitions should bring prices down overall. That`s going to be a little ways off, but we`re headed in that direction.</p><p>HERERA: Well, you`ll be following it, I know.</p><p>TIRRELL: Definitely.</p><p>HERERA: Thank you so much, Meg.</p><p>TIRRELL: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Meg Tirrell.</p><p>Coming up, hitting the gas. While Uber struggles, rival Lyft is quietly making some big moves.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: And here`s a look at what to watch for tomorrow. It is day one of the Federal Reserve`s two-day policy meeting. As we reported, Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify in front of a Senate panel on Russia. OPEC will release an update on supply and demand trends in the oil market. And that is what to watch for on Tuesday.</p><p>McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) wants to hire 250,000 workers in the U.S. this summer. And it`s doing it in a very modern way. It`s using Snapchat. The chain plans to run ten-second videos on the social media service of current employees talking about working at the company, at which point viewers can then swipe to McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) website and apply.</p><p>There may be a new player in the U.S. grocery market. A German low-cost grocer called Aldi plans to invest roughly $3.5 billion to expand its store base. It`s an aggressive plan that would make Aldi the third biggest supermarket chain behind Walmart and Kruger by the year 2022. The investment comes at a time of intense competition in that industry. Walmart, which is the largest U.S. grocer, is testing lower prices in 11 states and is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader.</p><p>Uber`s chief executive will likely take a leave of absence. According to reports, no final decision has been made, following a board meeting yesterday. The board met over the weekend to consider recommendations from an investigation into sexual harassment and related issues. A close ally of the CEO, Travis Kalanick, has left the ride-hailing company, making him the latest high-level executive to depart. Uber is a privately held company but it is valued at roughly $70 billion.</p><p>While Uber continues to wrestle with high profile legal and public relations problems, its rival Lyft is quietly making some strategic moves. The latest has Jaguar Land Rover taking a stake in Lyft and Phil LeBeau has those details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Uber may rule the road when it comes to ride-sharing. But its rival Lyft is putting together an impressive group of partnerships that could pay off in the long run.</p><p>That includes a new deal with Jaguar Land Rover. The luxury auto brands are investing $25 million in Lyft, and will work with the ride share company developing mobility services. The deal also calls for Jaguar Land Rover to supply some vehicles to Lyft drivers.</p><p>This is the second automaker to take a stake in Lyft, following GM`s investment of a half billion dollars last year. At the time, many thought it would lead to Lyft working almost exclusively with GM. But since then, both companies have branched out to also work with other tech and transportation firms. For example, Lyft has also struck a deal with Waymo, the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary that is leading the development of driverless vehicles.</p><p>And just last week, Lyft announced it`s working with the tech firm nuTonomy to test self-driving vehicles with paying customers in Boston later this year.</p><p>Uber is also developing autonomous drive vehicles, testing them in Pittsburgh. But with the company embroiled in a number of controversies, ranging from the culture of the firm to whether or not it`s overcharging customers, the time could be ripe for Lyft to gain ground on Uber, especially in one or more of its partnerships takes off, and leaves the company to greater growth.</p><p>It`s estimated the majority of the ride share business in the U.S. goes to Uber. Lyft says it has nearly 30 percent of the market. But as Lyft continues to expand and add new partnerships, it is slowly gaining ground on Uber here in the U.S.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

Consumer prices have barely budged and that could put pressure the Fed to cut interest rates sooner rather than later.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) under fire. E-mails have reportedly surfaced that could potentially link CEO Mark Zuckerberg to controversial privacy practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: Rolling along. Why General Motors (NYSE:GM) is spending millions to pick up production of pickups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, June 12th.</p><p>HERERA: And good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>It is often called the great rate debate, and tonight, that debate is coming into focus following the release of the latest economic report. It showed core inflation is cooling. That could bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, something that`s been a point of contention for the market and something investors are watching closely since the central bank and low rates have been a pillar of support for the decade-long expansion.</p><p>Steve Liesman starts us off tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Low inflation which the Fed had suggested was transitory hung around in May and failed to transit out of the economy. Headline inflation rose just a tenth of a percent, leading to a decline in the year over year rates just 1.8 percent and core inflation that takes out food and energy rose a tenth for the fourth month in a row, leading the year over year rates decline to 2 percent.</p><p>All of this means the Fed continues to miss its inflation target and at least markets to beat the Fed will cut interest rates to stoke the economy and try and revive inflation. The odds of a rate cut as soon as July spiked to as high as 84 percent, though something the market is getting ahead of the Fed.</p><p>LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHARLES SCHWAB: I think there is a risk that maybe the market has gotten too aggressive in terms of what it`s pricing in for the Fed. The Fed has been pretty clear that they want to see the actual data in the economy and that they`re not going to be swayed simply by market action, but let`s assume they are swayed by market action. The latest market action does not point to a need for a rate cut as early as June. I mean, maybe you get it in July, but I think they`re going to actually want to point to something in the data that`s concrete.</p><p>LIESMAN: There`s a distinct tale of two economies in the data. Service inflation remains a fairly robust 2.7 percent year over year, but commodity and goods prices appear to be back in deflationary mode, dragging down the overall averages and there`s a bit of debate over what role tariffs are playing in inflation, some see them driving up goods prices and others see them weakening the economy and driving down prices.</p><p>The Fed may want to wait and see how it all plays out before acting. Tariff issues right now look anything but transitory, and that means a complicated outlook for the economy for months to come.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Karissa McDonough joins us right now to talk about the factors from tariffs to inflation data that will go into any decision the Fed makes on interest rates. She is fixed income strategist with People`s United Advisors.</p><p>Karissa, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>KARISSA MCDONOUGH, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, PEOPLE`S UNITED ADVISORS: Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And for the record, you are forecasting maybe a couple of rate cuts, maybe July and September. How much of that is contingent on Chinese tariffs remaining in place?</p><p>MCDONOUGH: I think a good portion of that, in fact, we were really only looking for one hike before September, but the continuation of tariffs make us think that we really need to think about the Fed stepping in here and forcing the hand of, you know, whether it`s the market or just getting ahead of it. So, yes, those two hikes for sure, by September and that`s where we`re standing today.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And how important is each individual data point to the fed at this point? And also the conditions of the corporate credit market as well because the data`s been somewhat mixed, which is complicating things for the Fed.</p><p>MCDONOUGH: That`s right. Well, the Fed needs to build its case in terms of making these cuts. Kind of their shadow third mandate behind inflation and employment has been financial market stability. So they do pay attention, to a degree, to what the stock market is reacting to, but we haven`t seen that type of reaction from the credit market.</p><p>So, they`re really concerned about what each data point is showing them and the fact that inflation continues to not be at their target is a concern and it has been the cause of rate cuts in past cut cycles and we believe that that`s going to be the case this time around, as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Let me pursue again on the Chinese tariffs. Let`s assume that we get a deal in the near-term or let`s assume we get a rate cut of some kind and then suddenly the tariffs go away. Does that mean the Fed has to raise that rate that it just cut?</p><p>MCDONOUGH: No. That`s an excellent question. I would go back to comments that were made earlier in the show. We really only had monetary policy for the past ten years and it`s been a struggle to have fiscal policy here driving the economy. So that`s where we are today.</p><p>I mean, tariffs were potentially a drag or a deflationary measure on the global economy and just to have those removed doesn`t mean that, all of a sudden, we`re in a global reflationary environment. So I think a Fed cut, coupled with the tariffs potentially being taken away, those would be positives and not inflationary to the degree that the Fed will be concerned.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Karissa McDonough with People`s United Advisors -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MCDONOUGH: Thanks so much.</p><p>HERERA: That tame inflation report was not enough to give the market a lift. Stocks fell for a second straight day as questions about trade policy remain. Bank and tech stocks led the way lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 43 points to 26,004. The Nasdaq was down 29 and the S&amp;P 500 slipped five.</p><p>And today, oil prices sank 4 percent on supply concerns. A new report showed a large increase in crude stockpiles for the second straight week.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And when it comes to the economy, chief executives are not as confident as they once were. According to a new survey from the Business Roundtable, optimism has declined for the fifth straight quarter. The CEOs say that they`re concerned about trade relations with China and the resulting uncertainty about global growth. So their plans for hiring and capital investment have declined, as well, in the second quarter.</p><p>A separate survey shows that two-thirds of chief financial officers see a recession coming by the end of next year. They expect their business prospects to decline as a result. The cause, well, they cite tariffs and credit risks.</p><p>HERERA: It is no secret that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been plagued by privacy concerns and problems. Tonight, a new report and possible e-mails that link CEO Mark Zuckerberg to those controversial practices. That sent Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares lower by more than 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) e-mails uncovered as a result of the Federal Trade Commission`s privacy investigation suggest Mark Zuckerberg was aware of privacy problems at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The question, whether emails revealed practices that violate Facebook`s 2011 commitment to the FTC that it would protect users` privacy.</p><p>The article pointing to an exchange before the FTC consent decree went into effect, in which Mark Zuckerberg asked employees about an app that claimed to have compiled tens of millions of users` data, inquiring if that was possible, and that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) should stop that kind of stockpiling.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) suspended that particular app Zuckerberg asked about, but \"The Journal\" notes that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) did not take broader aggressive steps to protect users` policy.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) responding: We have fully cooperated with the FTC`s investigation and at no point Mark or any other Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) employee knowingly violate the company`s obligations under the FTC consent order, nor do any emails exist that indicate they did.</p><p>Senator Warner, who`s been critical of Facebook`s privacy practices, addressed this report on CNBC today.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): Part of the challenge with a lot of the tech companies is the founders, when they -- when they were great innovators, but they oftentimes created a sprit class of stock in terms of founder stock that means in many ways they get to enjoy the benefits of the public company without some of the oversight and restrictions. So, I think this is an issue that`s candidly bigger than just Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>BOORSTIN: This comes as we await the FTC settlement with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) over its privacy violations which Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has said will include a fine of up to $5 billion.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And as we have been reporting, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is one of those companies that has come under increased scrutiny from regulators who are investigating potential antitrust issues.</p><p>But as Ylan Mui reports now, it`s not just federal officials who are eyeing big tech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The big tech backlash isn`t just happening in Washington. Some of the loudest criticism of companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is coming from the states. New York has opened investigations into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Mississippi is preparing an antitrust case against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). California has passed a tough new privacy law to rein in the industry.</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA, CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Government from the feds on down treated the Internet industry with a lot of care, kid gloves because they want to spoil what we saw coming -- lots of new businesses, lots of new jobs, lots of increased economic capacity.</p><p>They`re not children anymore. They`re adults. They should be treated like adults and we`ll see where that takes us.</p><p>MUI: Today, state A.G.s gathered in Nebraska to meet with the Federal Trade Commission. That`s one of the agencies responsible for taking on monopolies. The Department of Justice is the other one, and both are looking into complaints that the tech giants are locking out their competition.</p><p>In a speech last night, the DOJ`s top antitrust official says his office will not shrink from the critical work of investigating and challenging anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>But states argue the feds aren`t doing enough. Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia are now calling for tougher enforcement and more data protection. They said they don`t want new technologies to get snuffed out.</p><p>JEFF LANDRY, LOUISIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) gets to pick the winners and losers because the system is rigged in their favor in ripe with conflicts.</p><p>MUI: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) declined to comment for this story and an industry group said tech companies aren`t monopolies and the Internet has brought consumers more choice than ever before.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) was downgraded to market perform from outperform at William Blair. The analyst cites tightening demand which could pressure growth. The firm also takes note of new competition. Shares fell 2 percent to $55.86.</p><p>And Beyond Meat was downgraded to market perform from outperform at Bernstein. This is its second downgrade in as many days. The analyst cites the stock`s valuation. The price target is $123. Despite the downgrade, the stock which has been volatile rose 12 percent to $141.97.</p><p>GRIFFETH: NXP Semiconductor was upgraded to overweight from equal weight at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The analyst cited margin improvement at the company. Price target now, $114. But shares did fall more than one and a half percent to $93.76 today.</p><p>Brinker International (NYSE:EAT) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Telsey Advisory Group. The analyst cited the restaurant company`s partnership with delivery service door DoorDash. Price target: $47. That stock rose more than 1 percent to $40.50.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, after a cool spring, is the summer home selling season about to heat up?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And FAA officials said today that Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft may not be back in the air until December. That is a date much later than earlier forecasts expected. The official emphasized though that there is still no official timeline.</p><p>But the CEO of American Airlines says he expects the aircraft to be flying by mid-August. Doug Parker also told his an airline annual shareholders meeting today that he expects the grounding of the 737 MAX to cost American Airlines about $350 million. As you know, that plane has been grounded since mid-March.</p><p>HERERA: The mega deal between United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) promised to redefine the aerospace industry. But in the days following the announcement, questions about the proposed get-together have started to swirl.</p><p>Morgan Brennan explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It could be the biggest defense deal ever, but Wall Street isn`t convinced on the merger of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).</p><p>Pershing Squares` Bill Ackman opposes the deal, telling United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) in a letter that it, quote, \"Makes no sense to us why you would consider a stock acquisition using today`s massively undervalued UTC common stock to buy a large business of inferior quality to the company`s existing businesses.\" And another activist investor Dan Loeb`s Third Point is reportedly against it as well. Both hold less than 1 percent stakes in the United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).</p><p>Many Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) shareholders owned it as a stable income-producing investment. United Tech investors are betting on a soon-to-be pure-play commercial aerospace manufacturer, once the carrier building systems and Otis elevator units are spun off.</p><p>And that`s why some analysts are skeptical too, calling it a re- conglomeration that muddies the investment thesis for shareholders, with few cost savings and a lot hanging on execution.</p><p>Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) declined to comment but United Tech saying, quote: We are confident that our shareholders will see the merits of this transaction and the value it brings to them and the company. We will be working diligently in the days and weeks ahead to make sure that the details of the transaction are presented to and fully understood by all shareholders.</p><p>Meantime, the stocks have fallen since the deal announced Monday and the selling has spread to the broader aerospace and defense group.</p><p>Bottom line: investors wonder whether this signal is a top for defense spending and whether the steel in particular will pay off.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: A new tech company soars in its trading debut and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Shares of CrowdStrike surged in its first day of trading after pricing its IPO at $34 a share. That values the company at $612 million initially. The cyber security firm provides cloud-based security to companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and to Credit Suisse.</p><p>The CEO said the company has an important role to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE KURTZ, CROWDSTRIKE CEO: The problem that most companies are trying to solve is not being breached and whether that`s, you know, network technology or endpoint technology, at the end of the day, we see the tip of the breach being the endpoint. That`s where the data resides, the servers, the endpoints, the desktops, and that`s what we`re protecting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Shares jumped in its debut by 70 percent to $58 even.</p><p>Elsewhere, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is warning that its annual revenue is going to likely come in at the low end of expectations. A bank executive said the current rate environment has already been factored into that outlook, but a decline in interest rates could pressure revenue even further. And the stock drop nearly 3 percent today to $44.91.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) have both been found liable in the case of a woman who blamed the company`s talc products for her rare cancer. A California jury concluded that asbestos found in Johnson &amp; Johnson`s baby powder and Colgate`s cashmere bouquet powder caused her mesothelioma, which is a cancer specifically linked to asbestos exposure.</p><p>J&amp;J shares were up more than 1 percent today, while Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) stock was down a fraction.</p><p>HERERA: The toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) rejected another merger offer from the Bratz doll maker MGA Entertainment. According to MGA`s CEO, Mattel`s board felt that the latest proposal was not in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) shares were up more than 5 percent to $11.38.</p><p>Investors had their first chance to respond to comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Musk told shareholders that the electric automaker has, quote, a decent shot at a record quarter and that there is not a demand problem for his product. Musk also said it won`t be long before the company has an electric car with a range of 400 miles. Shares nonetheless were down more than 3 percent to $209.26.</p><p>And after the bell, Lululemon posted better than expected earnings and saw revenue rise by 20 percent. Lululemon cites investments in its stores and its online operations. The stock initially rose in after-hours trading but closed the regular session down a fraction to $170.89.</p><p>RH, which is the retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware, raised its forecast and downplayed the impact from higher Chinese tariffs. The company said it renegotiated product costs and raise prices to mitigate the effects. It`s also moving production out of China and is looking to expand its manufacturing operations here in the U.S. The stock soared in initial after-hours trading. It finished the regular session at $94.89.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Borrowers saw an opportunity last week and, boy, did they take it. Applications for new mortgages surged, thanks to a big drop in rates, and the housing industry is hoping that it jump-starts some sales after an unremarkable spring season.</p><p>Diana Olick is in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A huge reaction to the big drop in mortgage rates total mortgage application volume surged nearly 27 percent for the week, up just over 40 percent annually. That`s according to the Mortgage Bankers Association`s seasonally adjusted index. And most of that was thanks to a refi boom. The average rate on the 30- year fixed fell to 4.12 percent for loans with a 20 percent down payment, and that`s the lowest level since September of 2017.</p><p>Now, refi has reacted up percent on the week and nearly double compared with the same week a year ago. Lenders must have been busy for sure, volume is up big in the past four weeks on these falling rates.</p><p>MATTHEW GRAHAM, MORTGAGE NEWS DAILY COO: It`s not nearly enough to get us back up to the refinancing surges that we`ve seen in the past in 2016, and then the huge numbers in 2011 through 2013, but it`s definitely a welcome relief for a mortgage market that was pretty borderline depressed heading into the end of 2018.</p><p>OLICK: Homebuyers also finally saw the light. They hadn`t really reacted to the rate drop the week before but purchase mortgage applications were 10 percent higher for the week and compared with a year ago. Purchase applications might have been even higher but there may be some pullback from buyers who are concerned about all the economic uncertainty with the trade war. Buyers are also still facing a tight and pricey housing market.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, let`s turn now to Susan Wachter to talk more about the housing market and its reaction to interest rates. She is a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania`s Wharton School of Business.</p><p>Welcome back, Susan. So nice to see you again.</p><p>SUSAN WACHTER, THE WHARTON SCHOOL PROFESSOR OF REAL ESTATE &amp; FINANCE: Pleasure to be here. Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: What do you make of the erratic nature of the housing market right now and its reaction to interest rates? I mean, yes, Diana pointed out the surge on refis. But interest rates have been low for a long time and we haven`t seen that kind of action.</p><p>WACHTER: Well, this is a price point in terms of interest rates. It`s a dramatic drop to 4.1 percent. We`re getting to historic lows. So, both refi opportunity is out there and opportunity to buy now lock into those fixed-rate mortgages at this 4.1.</p><p>It`s a significant decline. The decline is over time but compared to a year ago, its 100 basis points. Almost that`s big.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Is this a reason the Fed should cut interest rates at some point this summer, to try and revive what has been a more of a housing market this spring?</p><p>WACHTER: Well, yes, it`s almost -- it could go in either direction because the housing market -- these are signs that`s that it is back in play, that it`s not just refi, it`s also applications for purchases and we see some slowing down in the gains of prices, yes. But a 3.6 percent price rise which well is what we are facing now is moderating, it`s not a decline, it`s moderating.</p><p>At the high end, we see, of course, some decline in prices and multi- family, there is a excess supply out there. But entry-level prices are still daunting. Always lower interest rates are good for the housing market.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>HERERA: But you make the point that homeownership has not really increased meaningfully since the depth of the financial crisis.</p><p>WACHTER: This is true. There are still our millennials -- millions of millennials and there are somewhat older and younger peers who are out there still one-third living at home, still one-third renting, an all-time high rate at the age points that they are. So, there`s room for more growth in homeownership and demand for a single-family housing, and there sure is still an affordability crunch. They`re not fringe, not coming from interest rates, but coming from tide credit and high housing prices.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We`re going to do the stirring a little bit about how the treasury is really shut down the possibility of the SALT deductions coming back again, the state and local taxes. How much is that had an impact on housing as well?</p><p>WATCHTER: Well, it has, at certain geographies, not nationwide. But high- end and -- if I may say so, red states, New Jersey, California in particular markets, we can see that it has effect of those markets.</p><p>HERERA: Susan Wachter with the University of Pennsylvania`s Wharton School of Business, thanks so much.</p><p>WACHTER: Pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, GM`s latest push into profit rich pickups.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The Treasury Department has dealt a final blow to any SALT workaround. SALT, as Bill mentioned, refers to the deduction of state and local taxes that were capped in the new federal tax law. The regulation bars municipalities in high-tech states from creating charitable funds that could then be used to fund daily operations. House Democrats had been working on a plan to increase the SALT deduction but it is unclear what would happen if that measure actually reached the Senate.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And over in China, auto sales declined for an eleventh straight month. Sales in May fell by 16 percent from a year earlier, and experts say the drop is due in part to waning confidence in the economy there. The industry is also facing new emission standards which go into effect next month.</p><p>HERERA: Ford is recalling more than 1 million Explorers over a problem with the suspension, which can become damaged when driving over rough terrain. The SUVs are from the model years 2011 through 2017. The automaker said it will spend about $180 million to fix that issue which will come at no cost to the cars owners.</p><p>GRIFFETH: With auto profits being squeezed by higher costs and slowing sales, automakers are investing more in the one segment still rolling along, that would be pickup trucks. And today, GM said it`s going to spend another million dollars to help increase production at its plant in Flint, Michigan.</p><p>Phil LeBeau takes us along for a ride.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is ground zero in the battle of the big pickups. Just three months after GM said it would hire another 400 workers and ramp up production at its Flint, Michigan, plant, the automaker is making yet another investment of $150 million, to help truck assembly lines run more efficiently.</p><p>MARK REUSS, GENERAL MOTORS PRESIDENT: We`re selling everyone we can make literally, and that`s on our retail basis. So our retail share is in great shape and now we`re getting we`re getting to fan that out across the commercial fleets and across everybody that wants you know a work truck that makes a living with it.</p><p>LEBEAU: While overall auto sales have cooled off as buyers show less interest in cars, they are still buying trucks at a healthy clip, especially at FiatChrysler and Ford, where full-size pickup sales climbed in the first quarter. By comparison, GM`s truck sales fell almost 14 percent. GM blames some of that decline on a transition from previous versions of the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra into newer versions of those trucks, and as sales increase, GM expects to raise production.</p><p>REUSS: This is really all about bringing up, you know, our general assembly and our processing to be able to get another 40,000 units out of this plant which we think is a great upside for us.</p><p>LEBEAU: Pickup trucks are among the most profitable vehicles for automakers, so they consider investment in those models to be money well- spent.</p><p>And for GM, that investment has been paying off. In the first quarter, the average price paid for a new Silverado or Sierra was up almost $6,000 compared to the previous model.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Before we go, here`s a look at the final numbers from Wall Street today. The Dow fell 43 points, Nasdaq down 29, S&amp;P 500 slipped by five.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth.

Consumer prices have barely budged and that could put pressure the Fed to cut interest rates sooner rather than later.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) under fire.  E-mails have reportedly surfaced that could potentially link CEO Mark Zuckerberg to controversial privacy practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  Rolling along.  Why General Motors (NYSE:GM) is spending millions to pick up production of pickups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, June 12th.</p><p>HERERA:  And good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>It is often called the great rate debate, and tonight, that debate is coming into focus following the release of the latest economic report.  It showed core inflation is cooling.  That could bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, something that`s been a point of contention for the market and something investors are watching closely since the central bank and low rates have been a pillar of support for the decade-long expansion.</p><p>Steve Liesman starts us off tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Low inflation which the Fed had suggested was transitory hung around in May and failed to transit out of the economy.  Headline inflation rose just a tenth of a percent, leading to a decline in the year over year rates just 1.8 percent and core inflation that takes out food and energy rose a tenth for the fourth month in a row, leading the year over year rates decline to 2 percent.</p><p>All of this means the Fed continues to miss its inflation target and at least markets to beat the Fed will cut interest rates to stoke the economy and try and revive inflation.  The odds of a rate cut as soon as July spiked to as high as 84 percent, though something the market is getting ahead of the Fed.</p><p>LIZ ANN SONDERS, CHARLES SCHWAB:  I think there is a risk that maybe the market has gotten too aggressive in terms of what it`s pricing in for the Fed.  The Fed has been pretty clear that they want to see the actual data in the economy and that they`re not going to be swayed simply by market action, but let`s assume they are swayed by market action.  The latest market action does not point to a need for a rate cut as early as June.  I mean, maybe you get it in July, but I think they`re going to actually want to point to something in the data that`s concrete.</p><p>LIESMAN:  There`s a distinct tale of two economies in the data.  Service inflation remains a fairly robust 2.7 percent year over year, but commodity and goods prices appear to be back in deflationary mode, dragging down the overall averages and there`s a bit of debate over what role tariffs are playing in inflation, some see them driving up goods prices and others see them weakening the economy and driving down prices.</p><p>The Fed may want to wait and see how it all plays out before acting.  Tariff issues right now look anything but transitory, and that means a complicated outlook for the economy for months to come.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Karissa McDonough joins us right now to talk about the factors from tariffs to inflation data that will go into any decision the Fed makes on interest rates.  She is fixed income strategist with People`s United Advisors.</p><p>Karissa, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>KARISSA MCDONOUGH, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, PEOPLE`S UNITED ADVISORS:  Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And for the record, you are forecasting maybe a couple of rate cuts, maybe July and September.  How much of that is contingent on Chinese tariffs remaining in place?</p><p>MCDONOUGH:  I think a good portion of that, in fact, we were really only looking for one hike before September, but the continuation of tariffs make us think that we really need to think about the Fed stepping in here and forcing the hand of, you know, whether it`s the market or just getting ahead of it.  So, yes, those two hikes for sure, by September and that`s where we`re standing today.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And how important is each individual data point to the fed at this point?  And also the conditions of the corporate credit market as well because the data`s been somewhat mixed, which is complicating things for the Fed.</p><p>MCDONOUGH:  That`s right.  Well, the Fed needs to build its case in terms of making these cuts.  Kind of their shadow third mandate behind inflation and employment has been financial market stability.  So they do pay attention, to a degree, to what the stock market is reacting to, but we haven`t seen that type of reaction from the credit market.</p><p>So, they`re really concerned about what each data point is showing them and the fact that inflation continues to not be at their target is a concern and it has been the cause of rate cuts in past cut cycles and we believe that that`s going to be the case this time around, as well.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Let me pursue again on the Chinese tariffs.  Let`s assume that we get a deal in the near-term or let`s assume we get a rate cut of some kind and then suddenly the tariffs go away.  Does that mean the Fed has to raise that rate that it just cut?</p><p>MCDONOUGH:  No.  That`s an excellent question.  I would go back to comments that were made earlier in the show.  We really only had monetary policy for the past ten years and it`s been a struggle to have fiscal policy here driving the economy.  So that`s where we are today.</p><p>I mean, tariffs were potentially a drag or a deflationary measure on the global economy and just to have those removed doesn`t mean that, all of a sudden, we`re in a global reflationary environment.  So I think a Fed cut, coupled with the tariffs potentially being taken away, those would be positives and not inflationary to the degree that the Fed will be concerned.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Karissa McDonough with People`s United Advisors -- again, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MCDONOUGH:  Thanks so much.</p><p>HERERA:  That tame inflation report was not enough to give the market a lift.  Stocks fell for a second straight day as questions about trade policy remain.  Bank and tech stocks led the way lower.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 43 points to 26,004.  The Nasdaq was down 29 and the S&amp;P 500 slipped five.</p><p>And today, oil prices sank 4 percent on supply concerns.  A new report showed a large increase in crude stockpiles for the second straight week.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And when it comes to the economy, chief executives are not as confident as they once were.  According to a new survey from the Business Roundtable, optimism has declined for the fifth straight quarter.  The CEOs say that they`re concerned about trade relations with China and the resulting uncertainty about global growth.  So their plans for hiring and capital investment have declined, as well, in the second quarter.</p><p>A separate survey shows that two-thirds of chief financial officers see a recession coming by the end of next year.  They expect their business prospects to decline as a result.  The cause, well, they cite tariffs and credit risks.</p><p>HERERA:  It is no secret that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been plagued by privacy concerns and problems.  Tonight, a new report and possible e-mails that link CEO Mark Zuckerberg to those controversial practices.  That sent Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares lower by more than 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) e-mails uncovered as a result of the Federal Trade Commission`s privacy investigation suggest Mark Zuckerberg was aware of privacy problems at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  The question, whether emails revealed practices that violate Facebook`s 2011 commitment to the FTC that it would protect users` privacy.</p><p>The article pointing to an exchange before the FTC consent decree went into effect, in which Mark Zuckerberg asked employees about an app that claimed to have compiled tens of millions of users` data, inquiring if that was possible, and that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) should stop that kind of stockpiling.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) suspended that particular app Zuckerberg asked about, but \"The Journal\" notes that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) did not take broader aggressive steps to protect users` policy.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) responding: We have fully cooperated with the FTC`s investigation and at no point Mark or any other Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) employee knowingly violate the company`s obligations under the FTC consent order, nor do any emails exist that indicate they did.</p><p>Senator Warner, who`s been critical of Facebook`s privacy practices, addressed this report on CNBC today.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA):  Part of the challenge with a lot of the tech companies is the founders, when they -- when they were great innovators, but they oftentimes created a sprit class of stock in terms of founder stock that means in many ways they get to enjoy the benefits of the public company without some of the oversight and restrictions.  So, I think this is an issue that`s candidly bigger than just Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>BOORSTIN:  This comes as we await the FTC settlement with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) over its privacy violations which Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has said will include a fine of up to $5 billion.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And as we have been reporting, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is one of those companies that has come under increased scrutiny from regulators who are investigating potential antitrust issues.</p><p>But as Ylan Mui reports now, it`s not just federal officials who are eyeing big tech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The big tech backlash isn`t just happening in Washington.  Some of the loudest criticism of companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is coming from the states.  New York has opened investigations into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  Mississippi is preparing an antitrust case against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  California has passed a tough new privacy law to rein in the industry.</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA, CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Government from the feds on down treated the Internet industry with a lot of care, kid gloves because they want to spoil what we saw coming -- lots of new businesses, lots of new jobs, lots of increased economic capacity.</p><p>They`re not children anymore.  They`re adults.  They should be treated like adults and we`ll see where that takes us.</p><p>MUI:  Today, state A.G.s gathered in Nebraska to meet with the Federal Trade Commission.  That`s one of the agencies responsible for taking on monopolies.  The Department of Justice is the other one, and both are looking into complaints that the tech giants are locking out their competition.</p><p>In a speech last night, the DOJ`s top antitrust official says his office will not shrink from the critical work of investigating and challenging anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>But states argue the feds aren`t doing enough.  Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia are now calling for tougher enforcement and more data protection.  They said they don`t want new technologies to get snuffed out.</p><p>JEFF LANDRY, LOUISIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) gets to pick the winners and losers because the system is rigged in their favor in ripe with conflicts.</p><p>MUI:  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) declined to comment for this story and an industry group said tech companies aren`t monopolies and the Internet has brought consumers more choice than ever before.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) was downgraded to market perform from outperform at William Blair.  The analyst cites tightening demand which could pressure growth.  The firm also takes note of new competition.  Shares fell 2 percent to $55.86.</p><p>And Beyond Meat was downgraded to market perform from outperform at Bernstein.  This is its second downgrade in as many days.  The analyst cites the stock`s valuation.  The price target is $123.  Despite the downgrade, the stock which has been volatile rose 12 percent to $141.97.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  NXP Semiconductor was upgraded to overweight from equal weight at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).  The analyst cited margin improvement at the company.  Price target now, $114.  But shares did fall more than one and a half percent to $93.76 today.</p><p>Brinker International (NYSE:EAT) was upgraded to outperform from market perform at Telsey Advisory Group.  The analyst cited the restaurant company`s partnership with delivery service door DoorDash.  Price target: $47.  That stock rose more than 1 percent to $40.50.</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, after a cool spring, is the summer home selling season about to heat up?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And FAA officials said today that Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft may not be back in the air until December.  That is a date much later than earlier forecasts expected.  The official emphasized though that there is still no official timeline.</p><p>But the CEO of American Airlines says he expects the aircraft to be flying by mid-August.  Doug Parker also told his an airline annual shareholders meeting today that he expects the grounding of the 737 MAX to cost American Airlines about $350 million.  As you know, that plane has been grounded since mid-March.</p><p>HERERA:  The mega deal between United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) promised to redefine the aerospace industry.  But in the days following the announcement, questions about the proposed get-together have started to swirl.</p><p>Morgan Brennan explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It could be the biggest defense deal ever, but Wall Street isn`t convinced on the merger of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).</p><p>Pershing Squares` Bill Ackman opposes the deal, telling United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) in a letter that it, quote, \"Makes no sense to us why you would consider a stock acquisition using today`s massively undervalued UTC common stock to buy a large business of inferior quality to the company`s existing businesses.\"  And another activist investor Dan Loeb`s Third Point is reportedly against it as well.  Both hold less than 1 percent stakes in the United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).</p><p>Many Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) shareholders owned it as a stable income-producing investment.  United Tech investors are betting on a soon-to-be pure-play commercial aerospace manufacturer, once the carrier building systems and Otis elevator units are spun off.</p><p>And that`s why some analysts are skeptical too, calling it a re-conglomeration that muddies the investment thesis for shareholders, with few cost savings and a lot hanging on execution.</p><p>Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) declined to comment but United Tech saying, quote: We are confident that our shareholders will see the merits of this transaction and the value it brings to them and the company.  We will be working diligently in the days and weeks ahead to make sure that the details of the transaction are presented to and fully understood by all shareholders.</p><p>Meantime, the stocks have fallen since the deal announced Monday and the selling has spread to the broader aerospace and defense group.</p><p>Bottom line: investors wonder whether this signal is a top for defense spending and whether the steel in particular will pay off.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A new tech company soars in its trading debut and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Shares of CrowdStrike surged in its first day of trading after pricing its IPO at $34 a share.  That values the company at $612 million initially.  The cyber security firm provides cloud-based security to companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and to Credit Suisse.</p><p>The CEO said the company has an important role to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE KURTZ, CROWDSTRIKE CEO:  The problem that most companies are trying to solve is not being breached and whether that`s, you know, network technology or endpoint technology, at the end of the day, we see the tip of the breach being the endpoint.  That`s where the data resides, the servers, the endpoints, the desktops, and that`s what we`re protecting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Shares jumped in its debut by 70 percent to $58 even.</p><p>Elsewhere, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is warning that its annual revenue is going to likely come in at the low end of expectations.  A bank executive said the current rate environment has already been factored into that outlook, but a decline in interest rates could pressure revenue even further.  And the stock drop nearly 3 percent today to $44.91.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) have both been found liable in the case of a woman who blamed the company`s talc products for her rare cancer.  A California jury concluded that asbestos found in Johnson &amp; Johnson`s baby powder and Colgate`s cashmere bouquet powder caused her mesothelioma, which is a cancer specifically linked to asbestos exposure.</p><p>J&amp;J shares were up more than 1 percent today, while Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) stock was down a fraction.</p><p>HERERA:  The toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) rejected another merger offer from the Bratz doll maker MGA Entertainment.  According to MGA`s CEO, Mattel`s board felt that the latest proposal was not in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.  Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) shares were up more than 5 percent to $11.38.</p><p>Investors had their first chance to respond to comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  Musk told shareholders that the electric automaker has, quote, a decent shot at a record quarter and that there is not a demand problem for his product.  Musk also said it won`t be long before the company has an electric car with a range of 400 miles.  Shares nonetheless were down more than 3 percent to $209.26.</p><p>And after the bell, Lululemon posted better than expected earnings and saw revenue rise by 20 percent.  Lululemon cites investments in its stores and its online operations.  The stock initially rose in after-hours trading but closed the regular session down a fraction to $170.89.</p><p>RH, which is the retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware, raised its forecast and downplayed the impact from higher Chinese tariffs.  The company said it renegotiated product costs and raise prices to mitigate the effects.  It`s also moving production out of China and is looking to expand its manufacturing operations here in the U.S.  The stock soared in initial after-hours trading.  It finished the regular session at $94.89.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Borrowers saw an opportunity last week and, boy, did they take it.  Applications for new mortgages surged, thanks to a big drop in rates, and the housing industry is hoping that it jump-starts some sales after an unremarkable spring season.</p><p>Diana Olick is in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A huge reaction to the big drop in mortgage rates total mortgage application volume surged nearly 27 percent for the week, up just over 40 percent annually.  That`s according to the Mortgage Bankers Association`s seasonally adjusted index.  And most of that was thanks to a refi boom.  The average rate on the 30-year fixed fell to 4.12 percent for loans with a 20 percent down payment, and that`s the lowest level since September of 2017.</p><p>Now, refi has reacted up percent on the week and nearly double compared with the same week a year ago.  Lenders must have been busy for sure, volume is up big in the past four weeks on these falling rates.</p><p>MATTHEW GRAHAM, MORTGAGE NEWS DAILY COO:  It`s not nearly enough to get us back up to the refinancing surges that we`ve seen in the past in 2016, and then the huge numbers in 2011 through 2013, but it`s definitely a welcome relief for a mortgage market that was pretty borderline depressed heading into the end of 2018.</p><p>OLICK:  Homebuyers also finally saw the light.  They hadn`t really reacted to the rate drop the week before but purchase mortgage applications were 10 percent higher for the week and compared with a year ago.  Purchase applications might have been even higher but there may be some pullback from buyers who are concerned about all the economic uncertainty with the trade war.  Buyers are also still facing a tight and pricey housing market.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, let`s turn now to Susan Wachter to talk more about the housing market and its reaction to interest rates.  She is a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania`s Wharton School of Business.</p><p>Welcome back, Susan.  So nice to see you again.</p><p>SUSAN WACHTER, THE WHARTON SCHOOL PROFESSOR OF REAL ESTATE &amp; FINANCE:  Pleasure to be here.  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  What do you make of the erratic nature of the housing market right now and its reaction to interest rates?  I mean, yes, Diana pointed out the surge on refis.  But interest rates have been low for a long time and we haven`t seen that kind of action.</p><p>WACHTER:  Well, this is a price point in terms of interest rates.  It`s a dramatic drop to 4.1 percent.  We`re getting to historic lows.  So, both refi opportunity is out there and opportunity to buy now lock into those fixed-rate mortgages at this 4.1.</p><p>It`s a significant decline.  The decline is over time but compared to a year ago, its 100 basis points.  Almost that`s big.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Is this a reason the Fed should cut interest rates at some point this summer, to try and revive what has been a more of a housing market this spring?</p><p>WACHTER:  Well, yes, it`s almost -- it could go in either direction because the housing market -- these are signs that`s that it is back in play, that it`s not just refi, it`s also applications for purchases and we see some slowing down in the gains of prices, yes.  But a 3.6 percent price rise which well is what we are facing now is moderating, it`s not a decline, it`s moderating.</p><p>At the high end, we see, of course, some decline in prices and multi-family, there is a excess supply out there.  But entry-level prices are still daunting.  Always lower interest rates are good for the housing market.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>HERERA:  But you make the point that homeownership has not really increased meaningfully since the depth of the financial crisis.</p><p>WACHTER:  This is true.  There are still our millennials -- millions of millennials and there are somewhat older and younger peers who are out there still one-third living at home, still one-third renting, an all-time high rate at the age points that they are.  So, there`s room for more growth in homeownership and demand for a single-family housing, and there sure is still an affordability crunch.  They`re not fringe, not coming from interest rates, but coming from tide credit and high housing prices.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We`re going to do the stirring a little bit about how the treasury is really shut down the possibility of the SALT deductions coming back again, the state and local taxes.  How much is that had an impact on housing as well?</p><p>WATCHTER:  Well, it has, at certain geographies, not nationwide.  But high-end and -- if I may say so, red states, New Jersey, California in particular markets, we can see that it has effect of those markets.</p><p>HERERA:  Susan Wachter with the University of Pennsylvania`s Wharton School of Business, thanks so much.</p><p>WACHTER:  Pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, GM`s latest push into profit rich pickups.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The Treasury Department has dealt a final blow to any SALT workaround.  SALT, as Bill mentioned, refers to the deduction of state and local taxes that were capped in the new federal tax law.  The regulation bars municipalities in high-tech states from creating charitable funds that could then be used to fund daily operations.  House Democrats had been working on a plan to increase the SALT deduction but it is unclear what would happen if that measure actually reached the Senate.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And over in China, auto sales declined for an eleventh straight month.  Sales in May fell by 16 percent from a year earlier, and experts say the drop is due in part to waning confidence in the economy there.  The industry is also facing new emission standards which go into effect next month.</p><p>HERERA:  Ford is recalling more than 1 million Explorers over a problem with the suspension, which can become damaged when driving over rough terrain.  The SUVs are from the model years 2011 through 2017.  The automaker said it will spend about $180 million to fix that issue which will come at no cost to the cars owners.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  With auto profits being squeezed by higher costs and slowing sales, automakers are investing more in the one segment still rolling along, that would be pickup trucks.  And today, GM said it`s going to spend another million dollars to help increase production at its plant in Flint, Michigan.</p><p>Phil LeBeau takes us along for a ride.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This is ground zero in the battle of the big pickups.  Just three months after GM said it would hire another 400 workers and ramp up production at its Flint, Michigan, plant, the automaker is making yet another investment of $150 million, to help truck assembly lines run more efficiently.</p><p>MARK REUSS, GENERAL MOTORS PRESIDENT:  We`re selling everyone we can make literally, and that`s on our retail basis.  So our retail share is in great shape and now we`re getting we`re getting to fan that out across the commercial fleets and across everybody that wants you know a work truck that makes a living with it.</p><p>LEBEAU:  While overall auto sales have cooled off as buyers show less interest in cars, they are still buying trucks at a healthy clip, especially at FiatChrysler and Ford, where full-size pickup sales climbed in the first quarter.  By comparison, GM`s truck sales fell almost 14 percent.  GM blames some of that decline on a transition from previous versions of the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra into newer versions of those trucks, and as sales increase, GM expects to raise production.</p><p>REUSS:  This is really all about bringing up, you know, our general assembly and our processing to be able to get another 40,000 units out of this plant which we think is a great upside for us.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Pickup trucks are among the most profitable vehicles for automakers, so they consider investment in those models to be money well-spent.</p><p>And for GM, that investment has been paying off.  In the first quarter, the average price paid for a new Silverado or Sierra was up almost $6,000 compared to the previous model.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here`s a look at the final numbers from Wall Street today.  The Dow fell 43 points, Nasdaq down 29, S&amp;P 500 slipped by five.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.

The Fed holds interest rates steady today but signals that one could still be coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Top heavy market. A quarter of the gains this year are concentrated in four stocks. Is that cause for concern among investors?</p><p>GRIFFETH: Quality control. Why car buyers are finding plenty of problems with the new technology designed to keep them safe.</p><p>Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, June 19th.</p><p>HERERA: And good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>The Federal Reserve appears close to cutting interest rates. The chairman of the world`s most powerful central bank said what the market wanted to hear, that the case for more accommodating policy has strengthened. Today, the Fed held rates steady but it raised the prospect of lowering them in the future and stocks rose.</p><p>The Dow Jones rose 38 points, 26,504. The Nasdaq was up 33. The S&amp;P added eight. It is now less than 1 percent away from a record.</p><p>Steve Liesman starts us off tonight in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the June meeting but made a major change in its outlook that`s just in. It could cut interest rates in the months ahead, maybe even at the next meeting in July. The big changes the Federal Reserve effectively ended its policy of patience where saying it wouldn`t do anything for many months. That word came out of the policy statement.</p><p>Instead, it emphasized uncertainties in the economic outlook and said it would, quote, act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion. As recently as March, no Fed official forecast a rate cut this year. Now, eight Fed officials forecast at least one in 2019 and seven of them forecast two.</p><p>Fed Chair Jay Powell said even those who are not forecasting cuts in the survey are leaning that way.</p><p>POWELL: A number of those who wrote down a flat rate pass agree that the case for additional accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting. This added on accommodation would support economic activity and inflation`s return to our objective. Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting. It is important however that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment. Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the jot look.</p><p>LIESMAN: So, what will it take for the fed to actually cut rates? Powell made clear the committee wants more clarity in the outlook and how much the economy is really going to weaken. And he wants to see how trade talks with China work out.</p><p>If those concerns about the economy are proven right in the data, it seems clear the fed would respond with rate cuts and it could happen as soon as July.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And let`s turn now to Diane Swonk for more analysis of today`s Fed meeting. She`s chief economist at Grant Thornton.</p><p>Always good to see you.</p><p>And we should point out, you were among those who were pointing out we could get what you called an insurance cut today. But what did you make of what we got today?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, GRANT THORNTON CHIEF ECONOMIST: Well, we didn`t get an insurance cut today but we sure got Powell punted to July, but I think they`re gearing up for take cut in July. Steve is absolutely right. They`ve got a little more data they would like to see.</p><p>They`re really worried now that inflation -- I know many of your viewers say, hey, I`m paying too much for things, but they would like to see a much warmer economy given how long the expansion is. They would like to see a bit of a heat wave and we`re not getting it. And that`s something they`re concerned about. They really miss that.</p><p>Something else important for viewers to understand is in the statement itself, Steve read that part of the statement, they said they want to extend, actually do whatever necessary to extend the length of the expansion. I think that`s something that`s really unusual for the Fed. We really don`t usually hear the Fed talking about sustaining expansions.</p><p>We hear all of this other stuff that is, you know, more abstract like full employment, price stability. But the idea they want to sustain the expansion, and I was at the meeting that Jay Powell was at and he was talking to people getting a second chance in the economy. He only sees the method he has for opening up the economy to more people participating in the marathon (ph) of expansion is to extend the length of the expansion.</p><p>HERERA: So, Diane, how important is the upcoming G20 meeting in all of this, and, you know, rather, the flat talks between the U.S. and China? We haven`t really seen any progress on that front.</p><p>SWONK: Exactly. And that`s -- we really need to see progress on that front and some backing off of tariffs as well. That`s something that the Fed is concerned about, that already the tariffs we have -- because the Mexican situation did flare up and that scared the Fed. That settled down, with the idea we would tear up everything from Mexico, but now, we`re going to see another round of tariffs with China or at least a backing off of tariffs with China.</p><p>That is going to be one of the many factors they take into account. The trade situation is something they`re very concerned about. The issue on uncertainty, too, and in sentiment, this is something -- they really got spooked last December because not only did businesses pull back when we had the huge market swoon, but we also saw consumers pull back, and there are in better economic situation and the overall economic data showing more momentum in it than there is today, and that`s something they are really worried about.</p><p>So, they are still talking about a preemptive cut.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>SWONK: They`re talking about cutting before the economy falls apart and insurance.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Diane Swonk with Grant Thornton, always good to see you. Thanks, Diane.</p><p>SWONK: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: And now to trade and that changing tone out of China. The rhetoric used to be defiant but not anymore.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Chinese Foreign Ministry struck a warmer tone today, saying that the history of U.S.-China relations shows that positive outcomes are possible. State media was quoting President Xi Jinping as saying that the world wants a U.S.-China trade deal and that he is willing to meet with President Trump to exchange views on fundamental issues.</p><p>However, President Xi also laid out some parameters that the two should talk as equals, accommodate each other`s legitimate concerns, and that the U.S. should treat Chinese companies fairly -- a possible hint at what China sees as a U.S. is unfair treatment of Chinese tech giant Huawei.</p><p>And I spoke with people on the Chinese side who followed the talks closely and they say that China is cautious. There`s concern that President Trump could decide to hit Beijing with tariffs on issues of the Chinese see as unrelated to trade and economics, such as the Hong Kong protests. He did it with Mexico and the flow of migrants over the border.</p><p>So, the way he was explained to me is what would stop President Trump from doing that again with China, in which case a trade deal would be meaningless and it might be better to wait things out.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, China`s Huawei as Eunice just mentioned, has become one of the most controversial companies in the world. The U.S. has barred suppliers from doing business with a telecom giant, citing national security issues. The concern is that Huawei`s cozy relationship with the Chinese government leads to fears that it could use its devices to spy on other countries and companies. And the ban has clearly had an impact on its business.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa spoke today with Huawei`s founder and CEO in Shenzhen, China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Currently blacklisted by the Trump administration and possibly a key pawn in the U.S.-China trade war, China`s biggest tech company Huawei is in the midst of a public relations battle, and a costly one at that.</p><p>But for a company trying to prove to the world that it`s embracing transparency and trying to earn the trust of governments, Huawei CEO and founder Ren Zhengfei was very unforthcoming. He downplayed the company`s importance and denied its role in the trade war.</p><p>REN ZHENGFEI, HUAWEI CEO AND FOUNDER (through translator): Huawei is a very small issue. And on the table of the U.S. side, it is not even as big as a sesame. So, it is not worthwhile to talk about our issues and we will counter ourselves to address the issue. We still do trust the judicial system in the U.S. and we believe the judicial system will address the issue.</p><p>BOSA: Mr. Ren, how can you say this? You have 180,000 employees. You are one of the biggest companies not only in China but in the world. Why would it be strange to talk to Chinese government officials when you are such an important company to China and in the world?</p><p>REN: Because we are fully capable to deal with those issues on our own.</p><p>BOSA: Earlier this week, the world`s number two cell phone maker said it could take a $30 billion hit to revenue on those U.S. sanctions, but that massive number doesn`t scare Ren. He told me that $30 billion is a very small thing, and that the company does not attach importance to high numbers, rather they focus on performance.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Deirdre Bosa in Shenzhen, China.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly looking to move 15 to 30 percent of its production capacity out of China and to Southeast Asia. Such a move would reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing.</p><p>Separately, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) inked a deal to build smaller motorcycles in China. The bike will be sold in China and likely in other Asian markets as well. It is expected to go on sale at the end of 2020.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Back here, White House officials were on Capitol Hill today to talk about another looming issue that would be the debt ceiling, certainly something that lawmakers have to increase so the government can pay its bills and avoid defaulting on its obligations.</p><p>Ylan Mui joins us from Washington tonight.</p><p>Here we go again. Where do things stand right now?</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, we`re certainly closer to a deal than we were hours ago. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, they met with congressional leaders today and they`re really trying to do three things, not just raise the debt ceiling but also make sure they can fund the government and avoid a sequester, very painful steep cuts to government spending that would take effect by the end of the year if they can`t reach this deal.</p><p>So, these negotiations are ongoing and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put out a statement saying that they feel today`s discussions advanced those bipartisan negotiations.</p><p>HERERA: So, Ylan, you hinted at this a minute ago but what happens if they don`t or can`t reach a compromise?</p><p>MUI: Well, particularly when we`re talking about the debt ceiling, it could be devastating for investors. That`s something that could shake the faith that investors have in the United States credit. However, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that if they can`t reach a broader deal, the White House is prepared to offer a one-year increase in the debt ceiling as well as a one-year continuing resolution that would keep the government funded at its current levels. He said that President Trump wants to keep the government open and does not want to play around with the debt ceiling.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. But what is their deadline right now to reach an agreement?</p><p>MUI: So they do have some time here to continue those negotiations. The deadline for raising the debt ceiling is sometime in the fall, likely late September or early October they need to keep the government funded however by the end of the fiscal year which ends on September the 30th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: A little bit of time.</p><p>Ylan Mui in Washington, thanks, Ylan, for staying late for us tonight.</p><p>MUI: Absolutely.</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>U.S. Steel was upgraded to buy from sell at Vertical Group. The analyst cites the company`s decision to idle two of its U.S. plants. The price target is $17. The shares rose 4 percent to $15.17.</p><p>TripAdvisor was upgraded to buy from hold at SunTrust. The analyst cites the company`s growth outlook and potential revenue acceleration. The price target is $60. The shares were up nearly 2 percent to $47.19.</p><p>Six Flags was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Wedbush Securities. The analyst cites spending improvements and the development of its parks in China. The price target is $62. The shares rose 2 percent to $57.67.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, a growing concern for advertisers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Julia Boorstin in Cannes, France, at the Annual Advertising Festival here, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are out in force, but so is talk of tech lash. We`ll look at what potential regulatory scrutiny could mean for the other players in the space. That`s coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: As we mentioned earlier, the stock markets` major averages are nearing new highs and the biggest gains have been concentrated in just a handful of stocks.</p><p>Bob Pisani explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: We`re just about halfway through the year and stocks have enjoyed a strong first half. All three major averages are up double-digit so far in 2019, but the gains have been concentrated in one sector in particular, technology.</p><p>Tech is the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500. It`s up 25 percent and we should point out that almost a quarter of the gains this year have come from four big names alone: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Why? The investors have been searching for growth and protection from the trade tensions. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in particular has been rallying to all-time high several days in a row and now it`s firmly above the trillion dollar mark in market capitalization.</p><p>The S&amp;P, remember, is a market cap weighted index. Those four stocks, they comprised about 15 percent of the S&amp;P`s overall weighting, four stocks. Remember, May was a very bumpy month for big tech as a whirlwind of privacy and regulatory concerns hit the sector primarily around lawmakers looking into putting tech titans on a tighter leash, and trade sensitive semiconductors have been at the mercy of these U.S.-China trade talks but they stopped believe it or not more than 20 percent on the year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So with most of the stock market gains concentrated in four of the biggest names in tech, what are the risks and should investors be concerned?</p><p>Joining us now to discuss this is Erin Gibbs. She`s a portfolio manager at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Welcome. Nice to have you here, Erin.</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: So are you concerned about this top-heavy market or not?</p><p>GIBBS: So I am concerned that they are concentrated in really what we consider two different sectors. I know -- I know you call them technology, but when you actually look at them, two of the top five are in pure technology, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the other two are communications, so the Facebooks, the Googles. And then the last one, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), is actually consumer discretionary, remember, it`s all about buying stuff. It`s not a tech company.</p><p>But even so, those are very concentrated and that is somewhat unusual that we have so few sectors representative. When you look at the overall weightings and you say, oh these top five, these top four stocks are such a big way to the index, it`s actually not that different from the past 20 years, and it has been a bit of a gradual increased over the past five years.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>GIBBS: But when you look back 20 years, it`s actually very much in line and much like what we kind of saw the average weights in the early aughts. So I`m not as concerned about them being big and having these mega cap stocks. I am concerned that investors are too focused in very much more volatile sectors and they may not be getting the diversification that they really need.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I mean, if there is a concentration you`re concerned about, it`s that all five could be considered growth stocks, right?</p><p>GIBBS: And that`s --</p><p>GRIFFETH: You don`t have a value stock per se in this group, right?</p><p>GIBBS: Exactly and all you have to do is just go down to sort of the top ten stocks and you start getting some value stocks and some financials. But that`s another problem is that you are very much in these growth stocks and growth stocks are the ones that have by far the highest prices, and not just higher than value even historically when you`re looking at the past ten to fifteen years, growth stocks are priced at about 50 percent higher for every dollar that they earn versus what a dollar of value stock earns.</p><p>So, you`re paying 50 percent more for every dollar that they earn. And so, that`s concerning that you`re paying so much more for growth stocks versus of value, and it is something that we definitely want to recommend to investors to be diversified and have some value as well as growth in your portfolio.</p><p>HERERA: I was just going to ask you if the average investor should take a look at that and maybe say you know I need to diversify in some other sectors.</p><p>GIBBS: Certainly, if you have all of these very low growth stocks have been doing well and it is healthy to have an overweight in growth stocks when the economy is growing is well, but we`re actually expecting a bit of a slowdown over the next 12 months and particularly when we`re seeing just increased volatility over the past 12 months, where you see these big huge up days and down days, concerns about Chinese tariff wars, whether we`re going to have a rate cut, there`s some big unknowns out there.</p><p>And so, a little diversification at this point in the economic cycle is not a bad thing.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, Erin, thanks so much for joining us. Erin Gibbs with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Southwest pilots want reimbursement from Boeing (NYSE:BA), and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the pilots union for the airline asking Boeing (NYSE:BA) for compensation to cover legal costs and lost income due to the grounding of the 737 MAX planes and the canceled flights that that has caused. Southwest, by the way, also said it has extended those cancellations through early September, but the airline did raise its full-year revenue even though its overall fuel efficiency was reduced by the groundings. Shares were down a fraction today to $51.51.</p><p>Meanwhile, American Airlines agreed to buy 50 of Airbus`s new a 321 XLR planes, the aircraft maker`s longest range single aisle plane. American becomes the first major U.S. carrier to purchase the new narrow-body jet since it was unveiled at the Paris Air Show earlier in the week. Shares of American rose more than 2 percent today to $33.21.</p><p>Target`s CEO today publicly apologized to customers after cash registers at its stores went down for a couple of hours on Saturday and then a credit card glitch prevented sales on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN CORNELL, TARGET CEO: I need to start out by apologizing to the thousands of guests who were shopping our stores on Saturday and again on Sunday. And unfortunately, we had issues both days. On Saturday, we had an internal issue, just tied to standard maintenance that knocked us down for a couple of hours. And on Sunday, we had an issue with our partner NCR (NYSE:NCR), one of their upstream data centers. So, a disappointing weekend for us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Target (NYSE:TGT) shares fell another fraction today to $86.16.</p><p>HERERA: Winnebago posted better than expected earnings due to lower costs and a more favorable tax rate. But the recreational vehicle maker did miss revenue estimates because of what it called a challenging R.V. wholesale market. The stock was up more than three and a half percent to $40 even.</p><p>MGA Entertainment says it is no longer interested in trying to merge with Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) after the rival toy maker rejected MGA`s second merger attempt. MGA CEO said it was in the best interest for his company not to move forward with an offer and that Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), quote, cannot be salvaged, end quote. Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) shares were off more than 5 percent to $11.41.</p><p>And after the bell, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) reported better than expected earnings. The software maker also topped revenue estimates, thanks to an increase in cloud services and license support. Shares initially rose in the after-hours trading, but closed the regular session down a fraction to $52.68.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Hundreds of billions of dollars will be spent on digital ads this year and much of that money will likely go to companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). But before making spending decisions, advertisers are taking in consideration the regulatory backlash against these tech giants sometimes referred to as tech lash.</p><p>Julia Boorstin reports once again tonight from the Cannes Lions Conference in France.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOORSTIN: The annual gathering of advertising giants discussing where to put the $600 billion that would be spent on ads worldwide this year comes amid growing tech lash, criticism of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), that digital duopoly that together controlled the majority of all digital ad spending. With the CEO of the largest ad conglomerate WPP`s Mark Read says breaking up those two giants would not help consumers.</p><p>MARK READ, WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY) CEO: Clearly, you know, with the shift online, these two companies are ever more powerful. But I didn`t have to ask ourselves, you know, what are we really trying to achieve by and if you would have call for them to be broken up? And is that really going to make, you know, the world a better place?</p><p>The great benefit of these platforms for consumers is most of their products are free. The advertisers fund it, advertisers support it, and I think in balance that`s a good thing.</p><p>BOORSTIN: And with so many other options out in force here in Cannes, from Snap to Twitter, the CEO of another conglomerate, IPG`s Michael Roth, says advertisers will start to move their dollars if Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) don`t make meaningful changes around issues of brand safety, not having ads placed next to offensive content and privacy protections.</p><p>MICHAEL ROTH, IPG CEO: You know, everyone talks about government regulation and breaking them up. But what really will happen is our clients will not start spending with them, and that will be the biggest effect eventually if it doesn`t get corrected.</p><p>BOORSTIN: And there are a range of companies here that are positioning themselves as alternatives to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), by focusing on professionally created content which doesn`t have the risks around a brand safety. One of those is AT&amp;T`s ad tech division Xandr.</p><p>BRIAN LESSER, XANDR CEO: That`s a big opportunity for us because frankly I think that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have had a hard time managing the content on their platforms and assuring advertisers that they`re not going to end up advertising in a place that is inconsistent with the brand.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Others such as Pinterest and videogames streaming service Twitch are ramping up their presence here to explain to advertisers the depth of their devoted audiences, while magazine publisher Conde Nast positions itself as a premium filter for YouTube.</p><p>ROGER LYNCH, CONDE NAST CEO: Advertisers who may not want to advertise just broadly on YouTube will advertise through us on YouTube because their content maybe they want endemic content for their advertising, or they`re concerned about brand safety.</p><p>BOORSTIN: And as the tech companies here host parties and panels for advertisers, those brands have more options than ever.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Cannes, France.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, why car quality is stalling out.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: A new report says car buyers are finding plenty of problems with the latest models and showrooms. In particular, they`re seeing issues with the technology design to make driving cars safer.</p><p>Here`s Phil LeBeau.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you`re looking to buy a new car or truck, you know one of the big selling points -- technology that makes driving easier and safer. Take lane departure warnings, the goal is to keep cars from colliding during lane changes. But a new report by J.D. Power says driver assist technology is not always intuitive or easy to use.</p><p>DAVE SARGENT, J.D. POWER: One of the dangers is that automakers overcomplicate the technology and engineers need to remember that they are designing for normal people and not for other automotive engineers.</p><p>LEBEAU: While automakers may be struggling with driver assist technology, J.D. Power says buyers are seeing fewer problems with connectivity and infotainment systems. And this year`s report shows Korean brands continue to have the most problem-free new vehicles with Genesis, Kia and Hyundai leading the way.</p><p>SARGENT: They deliver as much technology as most other brands but they are very, very good at keeping it simple and giving consumers exactly what they want.</p><p>LEBEAU: By comparison, the luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover both owned by the same company are rated as among the newest models with the most issues. Jaguar, Land Rover, along with Mitsubishi, are rated the worst in initial quality.</p><p>J.D. Power says new car reliability is still at a record high, but his automakers add new features especially technology to help us drive safer, the challenge is making sure not only that that technology works but that it`s easy to use.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The billionaire founder of Blackstone is giving the University of Oxford $188 million dollars to research the ethics of artificial intelligence. It is believed to be the largest single gift to oxford since the Renaissance. Steve Schwarzman said he hopes that gift will help the rollout of the technology and limit the disorder to society.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And finally tonight, an exclusive club has a new member. Bernard Arnault is now worth $100 billion, joining the ranks of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates. Mr. Arnault is chairman of luxury goods maker LVMH. He is also the richest person in Europe and owns a 97 percent stake in the fashion house Christian Dior.</p><p>HERERA: Here`s a look at the final days numbers on Wall Street. The Dow rose 38 points, the Nasdaq up 33, S&amp;P 500 added eight, less than 1 percent away from a record.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herrera.

The Fed holds interest rates steady today but signals that one could still be coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Top heavy market.  A quarter of the gains this year are concentrated in four stocks.  Is that cause for concern among investors?</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Quality control.  Why car buyers are finding plenty of problems with the new technology designed to keep them safe.</p><p>Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, June 19th.</p><p>HERERA:  And good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>The Federal Reserve appears close to cutting interest rates.  The chairman of the world`s most powerful central bank said what the market wanted to hear, that the case for more accommodating policy has strengthened.  Today, the Fed held rates steady but it raised the prospect of lowering them in the future and stocks rose.</p><p>The Dow Jones rose 38 points, 26,504.  The Nasdaq was up 33.  The S&amp;P added eight.  It is now less than 1 percent away from a record.</p><p>Steve Liesman starts us off tonight in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the June meeting but made a major change in its outlook that`s just in.  It could cut interest rates in the months ahead, maybe even at the next meeting in July.  The big changes the Federal Reserve effectively ended its policy of patience where saying it wouldn`t do anything for many months.  That word came out of the policy statement.</p><p>Instead, it emphasized uncertainties in the economic outlook and said it would, quote, act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion.  As recently as March, no Fed official forecast a rate cut this year.  Now, eight Fed officials forecast at least one in 2019 and seven of them forecast two.</p><p>Fed Chair Jay Powell said even those who are not forecasting cuts in the survey are leaning that way.</p><p>POWELL:  A number of those who wrote down a flat rate pass agree that the case for additional accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting.  This added on accommodation would support economic activity and inflation`s return to our objective.  Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting.  It is important however that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment.  Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the jot look.</p><p>LIESMAN:  So, what will it take for the fed to actually cut rates?  Powell made clear the committee wants more clarity in the outlook and how much the economy is really going to weaken.  And he wants to see how trade talks with China work out.</p><p>If those concerns about the economy are proven right in the data, it seems clear the fed would respond with rate cuts and it could happen as soon as July.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And let`s turn now to Diane Swonk for more analysis of today`s Fed meeting.  She`s chief economist at Grant Thornton.</p><p>Always good to see you.</p><p>And we should point out, you were among those who were pointing out we could get what you called an insurance cut today.  But what did you make of what we got today?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, GRANT THORNTON CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Well, we didn`t get an insurance cut today but we sure got Powell punted to July, but I think they`re gearing up for take cut in July.  Steve is absolutely right.  They`ve got a little more data they would like to see.</p><p>They`re really worried now that inflation -- I know many of your viewers say, hey, I`m paying too much for things, but they would like to see a much warmer economy given how long the expansion is.  They would like to see a bit of a heat wave and we`re not getting it.  And that`s something they`re concerned about.  They really miss that.</p><p>Something else important for viewers to understand is in the statement itself, Steve read that part of the statement, they said they want to extend, actually do whatever necessary to extend the length of the expansion.  I think that`s something that`s really unusual for the Fed.  We really don`t usually hear the Fed talking about sustaining expansions.</p><p>We hear all of this other stuff that is, you know, more abstract like full employment, price stability.  But the idea they want to sustain the expansion, and I was at the meeting that Jay Powell was at and he was talking to people getting a second chance in the economy.  He only sees the method he has for opening up the economy to more people participating in the marathon (ph) of expansion is to extend the length of the expansion.</p><p>HERERA:  So, Diane, how important is the upcoming G20 meeting in all of this, and, you know, rather, the flat talks between the U.S. and China?  We haven`t really seen any progress on that front.</p><p>SWONK:  Exactly.  And that`s -- we really need to see progress on that front and some backing off of tariffs as well.  That`s something that the Fed is concerned about, that already the tariffs we have -- because the Mexican situation did flare up and that scared the Fed.  That settled down, with the idea we would tear up everything from Mexico, but now, we`re going to see another round of tariffs with China or at least a backing off of tariffs with China.</p><p>That is going to be one of the many factors they take into account.  The trade situation is something they`re very concerned about.  The issue on uncertainty, too, and in sentiment, this is something -- they really got spooked last December because not only did businesses pull back when we had the huge market swoon, but we also saw consumers pull back, and there are in better economic situation and the overall economic data showing more momentum in it than there is today, and that`s something they are really worried about.</p><p>So, they are still talking about a preemptive cut.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>SWONK:  They`re talking about cutting before the economy falls apart and insurance.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Diane Swonk with Grant Thornton, always good to see you.  Thanks, Diane.</p><p>SWONK:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  And now to trade and that changing tone out of China.  The rhetoric used to be defiant but not anymore.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Chinese Foreign Ministry struck a warmer tone today, saying that the history of U.S.-China relations shows that positive outcomes are possible.  State media was quoting President Xi Jinping as saying that the world wants a U.S.-China trade deal and that he is willing to meet with President Trump to exchange views on fundamental issues.</p><p>However, President Xi also laid out some parameters that the two should talk as equals, accommodate each other`s legitimate concerns, and that the U.S. should treat Chinese companies fairly -- a possible hint at what China sees as a U.S. is unfair treatment of Chinese tech giant Huawei.</p><p>And I spoke with people on the Chinese side who followed the talks closely and they say that China is cautious.  There`s concern that President Trump could decide to hit Beijing with tariffs on issues of the Chinese see as unrelated to trade and economics, such as the Hong Kong protests.  He did it with Mexico and the flow of migrants over the border.</p><p>So, the way he was explained to me is what would stop President Trump from doing that again with China, in which case a trade deal would be meaningless and it might be better to wait things out.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, China`s Huawei as Eunice just mentioned, has become one of the most controversial companies in the world.  The U.S. has barred suppliers from doing business with a telecom giant, citing national security issues.  The concern is that Huawei`s cozy relationship with the Chinese government leads to fears that it could use its devices to spy on other countries and companies.  And the ban has clearly had an impact on its business.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa spoke today with Huawei`s founder and CEO in Shenzhen, China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Currently blacklisted by the Trump administration and possibly a key pawn in the U.S.-China trade war, China`s biggest tech company Huawei is in the midst of a public relations battle, and a costly one at that.</p><p>But for a company trying to prove to the world that it`s embracing transparency and trying to earn the trust of governments, Huawei CEO and founder Ren Zhengfei was very unforthcoming.  He downplayed the company`s importance and denied its role in the trade war.</p><p>REN ZHENGFEI, HUAWEI CEO AND FOUNDER (through translator):  Huawei is a very small issue.  And on the table of the U.S. side, it is not even as big as a sesame.  So, it is not worthwhile to talk about our issues and we will counter ourselves to address the issue.  We still do trust the judicial system in the U.S. and we believe the judicial system will address the issue.</p><p>BOSA:  Mr. Ren, how can you say this?  You have 180,000 employees.  You are one of the biggest companies not only in China but in the world.  Why would it be strange to talk to Chinese government officials when you are such an important company to China and in the world?</p><p>REN:  Because we are fully capable to deal with those issues on our own.</p><p>BOSA:  Earlier this week, the world`s number two cell phone maker said it could take a $30 billion hit to revenue on those U.S. sanctions, but that massive number doesn`t scare Ren.  He told me that $30 billion is a very small thing, and that the company does not attach importance to high numbers, rather they focus on performance.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Deirdre Bosa in Shenzhen, China.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly looking to move 15 to 30 percent of its production capacity out of China and to Southeast Asia.  Such a move would reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing.</p><p>Separately, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) inked a deal to build smaller motorcycles in China.  The bike will be sold in China and likely in other Asian markets as well.  It is expected to go on sale at the end of 2020.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Back here, White House officials were on Capitol Hill today to talk about another looming issue that would be the debt ceiling, certainly something that lawmakers have to increase so the government can pay its bills and avoid defaulting on its obligations.</p><p>Ylan Mui joins us from Washington tonight.</p><p>Here we go again.  Where do things stand right now?</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we`re certainly closer to a deal than we were hours ago.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, they met with congressional leaders today and they`re really trying to do three things, not just raise the debt ceiling but also make sure they can fund the government and avoid a sequester, very painful steep cuts to government spending that would take effect by the end of the year if they can`t reach this deal.</p><p>So, these negotiations are ongoing and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put out a statement saying that they feel today`s discussions advanced those bipartisan negotiations.</p><p>HERERA:  So, Ylan, you hinted at this a minute ago but what happens if they don`t or can`t reach a compromise?</p><p>MUI:  Well, particularly when we`re talking about the debt ceiling, it could be devastating for investors.  That`s something that could shake the faith that investors have in the United States credit.  However, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that if they can`t reach a broader deal, the White House is prepared to offer a one-year increase in the debt ceiling as well as a one-year continuing resolution that would keep the government funded at its current levels.  He said that President Trump wants to keep the government open and does not want to play around with the debt ceiling.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  But what is their deadline right now to reach an agreement?</p><p>MUI:  So they do have some time here to continue those negotiations.  The deadline for raising the debt ceiling is sometime in the fall, likely late September or early October they need to keep the government funded however by the end of the fiscal year which ends on September the 30th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A little bit of time.</p><p>Ylan Mui in Washington, thanks, Ylan, for staying late for us tonight.</p><p>MUI:  Absolutely.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>U.S. Steel was upgraded to buy from sell at Vertical Group.  The analyst cites the company`s decision to idle two of its U.S. plants.  The price target is $17.  The shares rose 4 percent to $15.17.</p><p>TripAdvisor was upgraded to buy from hold at SunTrust.  The analyst cites the company`s growth outlook and potential revenue acceleration.  The price target is $60.  The shares were up nearly 2 percent to $47.19.</p><p>Six Flags was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Wedbush Securities.  The analyst cites spending improvements and the development of its parks in China.  The price target is $62.  The shares rose 2 percent to $57.67.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, a growing concern for advertisers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I`m Julia Boorstin in Cannes, France, at the Annual Advertising Festival here, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are out in force, but so is talk of tech lash.  We`ll look at what potential regulatory scrutiny could mean for the other players in the space.  That`s coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As we mentioned earlier, the stock markets` major averages are nearing new highs and the biggest gains have been concentrated in just a handful of stocks.</p><p>Bob Pisani explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We`re just about halfway through the year and stocks have enjoyed a strong first half.  All three major averages are up double-digit so far in 2019, but the gains have been concentrated in one sector in particular, technology.</p><p>Tech is the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500.  It`s up 25 percent and we should point out that almost a quarter of the gains this year have come from four big names alone: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  Why?  The investors have been searching for growth and protection from the trade tensions.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in particular has been rallying to all-time high several days in a row and now it`s firmly above the trillion dollar mark in market capitalization.</p><p>The S&amp;P, remember, is a market cap weighted index.  Those four stocks, they comprised about 15 percent of the S&amp;P`s overall weighting, four stocks.  Remember, May was a very bumpy month for big tech as a whirlwind of privacy and regulatory concerns hit the sector primarily around lawmakers looking into putting tech titans on a tighter leash, and trade sensitive semiconductors have been at the mercy of these U.S.-China trade talks but they stopped believe it or not more than 20 percent on the year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So with most of the stock market gains concentrated in four of the biggest names in tech, what are the risks and should investors be concerned?</p><p>Joining us now to discuss this is Erin Gibbs.  She`s a portfolio manager at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Welcome.  Nice to have you here, Erin.</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  So are you concerned about this top-heavy market or not?</p><p>GIBBS:  So I am concerned that they are concentrated in really what we consider two different sectors.  I know -- I know you call them technology, but when you actually look at them, two of the top five are in pure technology, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the other two are communications, so the Facebooks, the Googles.  And then the last one, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), is actually consumer discretionary, remember, it`s all about buying stuff.  It`s not a tech company.</p><p>But even so, those are very concentrated and that is somewhat unusual that we have so few sectors representative.  When you look at the overall weightings and you say, oh these top five, these top four stocks are such a big way to the index, it`s actually not that different from the past 20 years, and it has been a bit of a gradual increased over the past five years.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>GIBBS:  But when you look back 20 years, it`s actually very much in line and much like what we kind of saw the average weights in the early aughts.  So I`m not as concerned about them being big and having these mega cap stocks.  I am concerned that investors are too focused in very much more volatile sectors and they may not be getting the diversification that they really need.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I mean, if there is a concentration you`re concerned about, it`s that all five could be considered growth stocks, right?</p><p>GIBBS:  And that`s --</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You don`t have a value stock per se in this group, right?</p><p>GIBBS:  Exactly and all you have to do is just go down to sort of the top ten stocks and you start getting some value stocks and some financials.  But that`s another problem is that you are very much in these growth stocks and growth stocks are the ones that have by far the highest prices, and not just higher than value even historically when you`re looking at the past ten to fifteen years, growth stocks are priced at about 50 percent higher for every dollar that they earn versus what a dollar of value stock earns.</p><p>So, you`re paying 50 percent more for every dollar that they earn.  And so, that`s concerning that you`re paying so much more for growth stocks versus of value, and it is something that we definitely want to recommend to investors to be diversified and have some value as well as growth in your portfolio.</p><p>HERERA:  I was just going to ask you if the average investor should take a look at that and maybe say you know I need to diversify in some other sectors.</p><p>GIBBS:  Certainly, if you have all of these very low growth stocks have been doing well and it is healthy to have an overweight in growth stocks when the economy is growing is well, but we`re actually expecting a bit of a slowdown over the next 12 months and particularly when we`re seeing just increased volatility over the past 12 months, where you see these big huge up days and down days, concerns about Chinese tariff wars, whether we`re going to have a rate cut, there`s some big unknowns out there.</p><p>And so, a little diversification at this point in the economic cycle is not a bad thing.</p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Erin, thanks so much for joining us.  Erin Gibbs with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Southwest pilots want reimbursement from Boeing (NYSE:BA), and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the pilots union for the airline asking Boeing (NYSE:BA) for compensation to cover legal costs and lost income due to the grounding of the 737 MAX planes and the canceled flights that that has caused.  Southwest, by the way, also said it has extended those cancellations through early September, but the airline did raise its full-year revenue even though its overall fuel efficiency was reduced by the groundings.  Shares were down a fraction today to $51.51.</p><p>Meanwhile, American Airlines agreed to buy 50 of Airbus`s new a 321 XLR planes, the aircraft maker`s longest range single aisle plane.  American becomes the first major U.S. carrier to purchase the new narrow-body jet since it was unveiled at the Paris Air Show earlier in the week.  Shares of American rose more than 2 percent today to $33.21.</p><p>Target`s CEO today publicly apologized to customers after cash registers at its stores went down for a couple of hours on Saturday and then a credit card glitch prevented sales on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN CORNELL, TARGET CEO:  I need to start out by apologizing to the thousands of guests who were shopping our stores on Saturday and again on Sunday.  And unfortunately, we had issues both days.  On Saturday, we had an internal issue, just tied to standard maintenance that knocked us down for a couple of hours.  And on Sunday, we had an issue with our partner NCR (NYSE:NCR), one of their upstream data centers.  So, a disappointing weekend for us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Target (NYSE:TGT) shares fell another fraction today to $86.16.</p><p>HERERA:  Winnebago posted better than expected earnings due to lower costs and a more favorable tax rate.  But the recreational vehicle maker did miss revenue estimates because of what it called a challenging R.V. wholesale market.  The stock was up more than three and a half percent to $40 even.</p><p>MGA Entertainment says it is no longer interested in trying to merge with Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) after the rival toy maker rejected MGA`s second merger attempt.  MGA CEO said it was in the best interest for his company not to move forward with an offer and that Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), quote, cannot be salvaged, end quote.  Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) shares were off more than 5 percent to $11.41.</p><p>And after the bell, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) reported better than expected earnings.  The software maker also topped revenue estimates, thanks to an increase in cloud services and license support.  Shares initially rose in the after-hours trading, but closed the regular session down a fraction to $52.68.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Hundreds of billions of dollars will be spent on digital ads this year and much of that money will likely go to companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  But before making spending decisions, advertisers are taking in consideration the regulatory backlash against these tech giants sometimes referred to as tech lash.</p><p>Julia Boorstin reports once again tonight from the Cannes Lions Conference in France.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOORSTIN:  The annual gathering of advertising giants discussing where to put the $600 billion that would be spent on ads worldwide this year comes amid growing tech lash, criticism of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), that digital duopoly that together controlled the majority of all digital ad spending.  With the CEO of the largest ad conglomerate WPP`s Mark Read says breaking up those two giants would not help consumers.</p><p>MARK READ, WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY) CEO:  Clearly, you know, with the shift online, these two companies are ever more powerful.  But I didn`t have to ask ourselves, you know, what are we really trying to achieve by and if you would have call for them to be broken up?  And is that really going to make, you know, the world a better place?</p><p>The great benefit of these platforms for consumers is most of their products are free.  The advertisers fund it, advertisers support it, and I think in balance that`s a good thing.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  And with so many other options out in force here in Cannes, from Snap to Twitter, the CEO of another conglomerate, IPG`s Michael Roth, says advertisers will start to move their dollars if Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) don`t make meaningful changes around issues of brand safety, not having ads placed next to offensive content and privacy protections.</p><p>MICHAEL ROTH, IPG CEO:  You know, everyone talks about government regulation and breaking them up.  But what really will happen is our clients will not start spending with them, and that will be the biggest effect eventually if it doesn`t get corrected.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  And there are a range of companies here that are positioning themselves as alternatives to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), by focusing on professionally created content which doesn`t have the risks around a brand safety.  One of those is AT&amp;T`s ad tech division Xandr.</p><p>BRIAN LESSER, XANDR CEO:  That`s a big opportunity for us because frankly I think that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have had a hard time managing the content on their platforms and assuring advertisers that they`re not going to end up advertising in a place that is inconsistent with the brand.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Others such as Pinterest and videogames streaming service Twitch are ramping up their presence here to explain to advertisers the depth of their devoted audiences, while magazine publisher Conde Nast positions itself as a premium filter for YouTube.</p><p>ROGER LYNCH, CONDE NAST CEO:  Advertisers who may not want to advertise just broadly on YouTube will advertise through us on YouTube because their content maybe they want endemic content for their advertising, or they`re concerned about brand safety.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  And as the tech companies here host parties and panels for advertisers, those brands have more options than ever.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Cannes, France.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, why car quality is stalling out.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A new report says car buyers are finding plenty of problems with the latest models and showrooms.  In particular, they`re seeing issues with the technology design to make driving cars safer.</p><p>Here`s Phil LeBeau.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you`re looking to buy a new car or truck, you know one of the big selling points -- technology that makes driving easier and safer.  Take lane departure warnings, the goal is to keep cars from colliding during lane changes.  But a new report by J.D. Power says driver assist technology is not always intuitive or easy to use.</p><p>DAVE SARGENT, J.D. POWER:  One of the dangers is that automakers overcomplicate the technology and engineers need to remember that they are designing for normal people and not for other automotive engineers.</p><p>LEBEAU:  While automakers may be struggling with driver assist technology, J.D. Power says buyers are seeing fewer problems with connectivity and infotainment systems.  And this year`s report shows Korean brands continue to have the most problem-free new vehicles with Genesis, Kia and Hyundai leading the way.</p><p>SARGENT:  They deliver as much technology as most other brands but they are very, very good at keeping it simple and giving consumers exactly what they want.</p><p>LEBEAU:  By comparison, the luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover both owned by the same company are rated as among the newest models with the most issues.  Jaguar, Land Rover, along with Mitsubishi, are rated the worst in initial quality.</p><p>J.D. Power says new car reliability is still at a record high, but his automakers add new features especially technology to help us drive safer, the challenge is making sure not only that that technology works but that it`s easy to use.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The billionaire founder of Blackstone is giving the University of Oxford $188 million dollars to research the ethics of artificial intelligence.

The Fed holds interest rates steady today but signals that one could still be coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Top heavy market.  A quarter of the gains this year are concentrated in four stocks.  Is that cause for concern among investors?</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Quality control.  Why car buyers are finding plenty of problems with the new technology designed to keep them safe.</p><p>Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, June 19th.</p><p>HERERA:  And good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>The Federal Reserve appears close to cutting interest rates.  The chairman of the world`s most powerful central bank said what the market wanted to hear, that the case for more accommodating policy has strengthened.  Today, the Fed held rates steady but it raised the prospect of lowering them in the future and stocks rose.</p><p>The Dow Jones rose 38 points, 26,504.  The Nasdaq was up 33.  The S&amp;P added eight.  It is now less than 1 percent away from a record.</p><p>Steve Liesman starts us off tonight in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the June meeting but made a major change in its outlook that`s just in.  It could cut interest rates in the months ahead, maybe even at the next meeting in July.  The big changes the Federal Reserve effectively ended its policy of patience where saying it wouldn`t do anything for many months.  That word came out of the policy statement.</p><p>Instead, it emphasized uncertainties in the economic outlook and said it would, quote, act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion.  As recently as March, no Fed official forecast a rate cut this year.  Now, eight Fed officials forecast at least one in 2019 and seven of them forecast two.</p><p>Fed Chair Jay Powell said even those who are not forecasting cuts in the survey are leaning that way.</p><p>POWELL:  A number of those who wrote down a flat rate pass agree that the case for additional accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting.  This added on accommodation would support economic activity and inflation`s return to our objective.  Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting.  It is important however that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment.  Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the jot look.</p><p>LIESMAN:  So, what will it take for the fed to actually cut rates?  Powell made clear the committee wants more clarity in the outlook and how much the economy is really going to weaken.  And he wants to see how trade talks with China work out.</p><p>If those concerns about the economy are proven right in the data, it seems clear the fed would respond with rate cuts and it could happen as soon as July.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And let`s turn now to Diane Swonk for more analysis of today`s Fed meeting.  She`s chief economist at Grant Thornton.</p><p>Always good to see you.</p><p>And we should point out, you were among those who were pointing out we could get what you called an insurance cut today.  But what did you make of what we got today?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, GRANT THORNTON CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Well, we didn`t get an insurance cut today but we sure got Powell punted to July, but I think they`re gearing up for take cut in July.  Steve is absolutely right.  They`ve got a little more data they would like to see.</p><p>They`re really worried now that inflation -- I know many of your viewers say, hey, I`m paying too much for things, but they would like to see a much warmer economy given how long the expansion is.  They would like to see a bit of a heat wave and we`re not getting it.  And that`s something they`re concerned about.  They really miss that.</p><p>Something else important for viewers to understand is in the statement itself, Steve read that part of the statement, they said they want to extend, actually do whatever necessary to extend the length of the expansion.  I think that`s something that`s really unusual for the Fed.  We really don`t usually hear the Fed talking about sustaining expansions.</p><p>We hear all of this other stuff that is, you know, more abstract like full employment, price stability.  But the idea they want to sustain the expansion, and I was at the meeting that Jay Powell was at and he was talking to people getting a second chance in the economy.  He only sees the method he has for opening up the economy to more people participating in the marathon (ph) of expansion is to extend the length of the expansion.</p><p>HERERA:  So, Diane, how important is the upcoming G20 meeting in all of this, and, you know, rather, the flat talks between the U.S. and China?  We haven`t really seen any progress on that front.</p><p>SWONK:  Exactly.  And that`s -- we really need to see progress on that front and some backing off of tariffs as well.  That`s something that the Fed is concerned about, that already the tariffs we have -- because the Mexican situation did flare up and that scared the Fed.  That settled down, with the idea we would tear up everything from Mexico, but now, we`re going to see another round of tariffs with China or at least a backing off of tariffs with China.</p><p>That is going to be one of the many factors they take into account.  The trade situation is something they`re very concerned about.  The issue on uncertainty, too, and in sentiment, this is something -- they really got spooked last December because not only did businesses pull back when we had the huge market swoon, but we also saw consumers pull back, and there are in better economic situation and the overall economic data showing more momentum in it than there is today, and that`s something they are really worried about.</p><p>So, they are still talking about a preemptive cut.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>SWONK:  They`re talking about cutting before the economy falls apart and insurance.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Diane Swonk with Grant Thornton, always good to see you.  Thanks, Diane.</p><p>SWONK:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  And now to trade and that changing tone out of China.  The rhetoric used to be defiant but not anymore.</p><p>Eunice Yoon is in Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Chinese Foreign Ministry struck a warmer tone today, saying that the history of U.S.-China relations shows that positive outcomes are possible.  State media was quoting President Xi Jinping as saying that the world wants a U.S.-China trade deal and that he is willing to meet with President Trump to exchange views on fundamental issues.</p><p>However, President Xi also laid out some parameters that the two should talk as equals, accommodate each other`s legitimate concerns, and that the U.S. should treat Chinese companies fairly -- a possible hint at what China sees as a U.S. is unfair treatment of Chinese tech giant Huawei.</p><p>And I spoke with people on the Chinese side who followed the talks closely and they say that China is cautious.  There`s concern that President Trump could decide to hit Beijing with tariffs on issues of the Chinese see as unrelated to trade and economics, such as the Hong Kong protests.  He did it with Mexico and the flow of migrants over the border.</p><p>So, the way he was explained to me is what would stop President Trump from doing that again with China, in which case a trade deal would be meaningless and it might be better to wait things out.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, China`s Huawei as Eunice just mentioned, has become one of the most controversial companies in the world.  The U.S. has barred suppliers from doing business with a telecom giant, citing national security issues.  The concern is that Huawei`s cozy relationship with the Chinese government leads to fears that it could use its devices to spy on other countries and companies.  And the ban has clearly had an impact on its business.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa spoke today with Huawei`s founder and CEO in Shenzhen, China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Currently blacklisted by the Trump administration and possibly a key pawn in the U.S.-China trade war, China`s biggest tech company Huawei is in the midst of a public relations battle, and a costly one at that.</p><p>But for a company trying to prove to the world that it`s embracing transparency and trying to earn the trust of governments, Huawei CEO and founder Ren Zhengfei was very unforthcoming.  He downplayed the company`s importance and denied its role in the trade war.</p><p>REN ZHENGFEI, HUAWEI CEO AND FOUNDER (through translator):  Huawei is a very small issue.  And on the table of the U.S. side, it is not even as big as a sesame.  So, it is not worthwhile to talk about our issues and we will counter ourselves to address the issue.  We still do trust the judicial system in the U.S. and we believe the judicial system will address the issue.</p><p>BOSA:  Mr. Ren, how can you say this?  You have 180,000 employees.  You are one of the biggest companies not only in China but in the world.  Why would it be strange to talk to Chinese government officials when you are such an important company to China and in the world?</p><p>REN:  Because we are fully capable to deal with those issues on our own.</p><p>BOSA:  Earlier this week, the world`s number two cell phone maker said it could take a $30 billion hit to revenue on those U.S. sanctions, but that massive number doesn`t scare Ren.  He told me that $30 billion is a very small thing, and that the company does not attach importance to high numbers, rather they focus on performance.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Deirdre Bosa in Shenzhen, China.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly looking to move 15 to 30 percent of its production capacity out of China and to Southeast Asia.  Such a move would reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing.</p><p>Separately, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) inked a deal to build smaller motorcycles in China.  The bike will be sold in China and likely in other Asian markets as well.  It is expected to go on sale at the end of 2020.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Back here, White House officials were on Capitol Hill today to talk about another looming issue that would be the debt ceiling, certainly something that lawmakers have to increase so the government can pay its bills and avoid defaulting on its obligations.</p><p>Ylan Mui joins us from Washington tonight.</p><p>Here we go again.  Where do things stand right now?</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we`re certainly closer to a deal than we were hours ago.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, they met with congressional leaders today and they`re really trying to do three things, not just raise the debt ceiling but also make sure they can fund the government and avoid a sequester, very painful steep cuts to government spending that would take effect by the end of the year if they can`t reach this deal.</p><p>So, these negotiations are ongoing and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put out a statement saying that they feel today`s discussions advanced those bipartisan negotiations.</p><p>HERERA:  So, Ylan, you hinted at this a minute ago but what happens if they don`t or can`t reach a compromise?</p><p>MUI:  Well, particularly when we`re talking about the debt ceiling, it could be devastating for investors.  That`s something that could shake the faith that investors have in the United States credit.  However, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said that if they can`t reach a broader deal, the White House is prepared to offer a one-year increase in the debt ceiling as well as a one-year continuing resolution that would keep the government funded at its current levels.  He said that President Trump wants to keep the government open and does not want to play around with the debt ceiling.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  But what is their deadline right now to reach an agreement?</p><p>MUI:  So they do have some time here to continue those negotiations.  The deadline for raising the debt ceiling is sometime in the fall, likely late September or early October they need to keep the government funded however by the end of the fiscal year which ends on September the 30th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A little bit of time.</p><p>Ylan Mui in Washington, thanks, Ylan, for staying late for us tonight.</p><p>MUI:  Absolutely.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>U.S. Steel was upgraded to buy from sell at Vertical Group.  The analyst cites the company`s decision to idle two of its U.S. plants.  The price target is $17.  The shares rose 4 percent to $15.17.</p><p>TripAdvisor was upgraded to buy from hold at SunTrust.  The analyst cites the company`s growth outlook and potential revenue acceleration.  The price target is $60.  The shares were up nearly 2 percent to $47.19.</p><p>Six Flags was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Wedbush Securities.  The analyst cites spending improvements and the development of its parks in China.  The price target is $62.  The shares rose 2 percent to $57.67.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, a growing concern for advertisers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I`m Julia Boorstin in Cannes, France, at the Annual Advertising Festival here, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are out in force, but so is talk of tech lash.  We`ll look at what potential regulatory scrutiny could mean for the other players in the space.  That`s coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As we mentioned earlier, the stock markets` major averages are nearing new highs and the biggest gains have been concentrated in just a handful of stocks.</p><p>Bob Pisani explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We`re just about halfway through the year and stocks have enjoyed a strong first half.  All three major averages are up double-digit so far in 2019, but the gains have been concentrated in one sector in particular, technology.</p><p>Tech is the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500.  It`s up 25 percent and we should point out that almost a quarter of the gains this year have come from four big names alone: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  Why?  The investors have been searching for growth and protection from the trade tensions.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in particular has been rallying to all-time high several days in a row and now it`s firmly above the trillion dollar mark in market capitalization.</p><p>The S&amp;P, remember, is a market cap weighted index.  Those four stocks, they comprised about 15 percent of the S&amp;P`s overall weighting, four stocks.  Remember, May was a very bumpy month for big tech as a whirlwind of privacy and regulatory concerns hit the sector primarily around lawmakers looking into putting tech titans on a tighter leash, and trade sensitive semiconductors have been at the mercy of these U.S.-China trade talks but they stopped believe it or not more than 20 percent on the year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So with most of the stock market gains concentrated in four of the biggest names in tech, what are the risks and should investors be concerned?</p><p>Joining us now to discuss this is Erin Gibbs.  She`s a portfolio manager at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Welcome.  Nice to have you here, Erin.</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  So are you concerned about this top-heavy market or not?</p><p>GIBBS:  So I am concerned that they are concentrated in really what we consider two different sectors.  I know -- I know you call them technology, but when you actually look at them, two of the top five are in pure technology, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the other two are communications, so the Facebooks, the Googles.  And then the last one, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), is actually consumer discretionary, remember, it`s all about buying stuff.  It`s not a tech company.</p><p>But even so, those are very concentrated and that is somewhat unusual that we have so few sectors representative.  When you look at the overall weightings and you say, oh these top five, these top four stocks are such a big way to the index, it`s actually not that different from the past 20 years, and it has been a bit of a gradual increased over the past five years.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>GIBBS:  But when you look back 20 years, it`s actually very much in line and much like what we kind of saw the average weights in the early aughts.  So I`m not as concerned about them being big and having these mega cap stocks.  I am concerned that investors are too focused in very much more volatile sectors and they may not be getting the diversification that they really need.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I mean, if there is a concentration you`re concerned about, it`s that all five could be considered growth stocks, right?</p><p>GIBBS:  And that`s --</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You don`t have a value stock per se in this group, right?</p><p>GIBBS:  Exactly and all you have to do is just go down to sort of the top ten stocks and you start getting some value stocks and some financials.  But that`s another problem is that you are very much in these growth stocks and growth stocks are the ones that have by far the highest prices, and not just higher than value even historically when you`re looking at the past ten to fifteen years, growth stocks are priced at about 50 percent higher for every dollar that they earn versus what a dollar of value stock earns.</p><p>So, you`re paying 50 percent more for every dollar that they earn.  And so, that`s concerning that you`re paying so much more for growth stocks versus of value, and it is something that we definitely want to recommend to investors to be diversified and have some value as well as growth in your portfolio.</p><p>HERERA:  I was just going to ask you if the average investor should take a look at that and maybe say you know I need to diversify in some other sectors.</p><p>GIBBS:  Certainly, if you have all of these very low growth stocks have been doing well and it is healthy to have an overweight in growth stocks when the economy is growing is well, but we`re actually expecting a bit of a slowdown over the next 12 months and particularly when we`re seeing just increased volatility over the past 12 months, where you see these big huge up days and down days, concerns about Chinese tariff wars, whether we`re going to have a rate cut, there`s some big unknowns out there.</p><p>And so, a little diversification at this point in the economic cycle is not a bad thing.</p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Erin, thanks so much for joining us.  Erin Gibbs with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Southwest pilots want reimbursement from Boeing (NYSE:BA), and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the pilots union for the airline asking Boeing (NYSE:BA) for compensation to cover legal costs and lost income due to the grounding of the 737 MAX planes and the canceled flights that that has caused.  Southwest, by the way, also said it has extended those cancellations through early September, but the airline did raise its full-year revenue even though its overall fuel efficiency was reduced by the groundings.  Shares were down a fraction today to $51.51.</p><p>Meanwhile, American Airlines agreed to buy 50 of Airbus`s new a 321 XLR planes, the aircraft maker`s longest range single aisle plane.  American becomes the first major U.S. carrier to purchase the new narrow-body jet since it was unveiled at the Paris Air Show earlier in the week.  Shares of American rose more than 2 percent today to $33.21.</p><p>Target`s CEO today publicly apologized to customers after cash registers at its stores went down for a couple of hours on Saturday and then a credit card glitch prevented sales on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN CORNELL, TARGET CEO:  I need to start out by apologizing to the thousands of guests who were shopping our stores on Saturday and again on Sunday.  And unfortunately, we had issues both days.  On Saturday, we had an internal issue, just tied to standard maintenance that knocked us down for a couple of hours.  And on Sunday, we had an issue with our partner NCR (NYSE:NCR), one of their upstream data centers.  So, a disappointing weekend for us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Target (NYSE:TGT) shares fell another fraction today to $86.16.</p><p>HERERA:  Winnebago posted better than expected earnings due to lower costs and a more favorable tax rate.  But the recreational vehicle maker did miss revenue estimates because of what it called a challenging R.V. wholesale market.  The stock was up more than three and a half percent to $40 even.</p><p>MGA Entertainment says it is no longer interested in trying to merge with Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) after the rival toy maker rejected MGA`s second merger attempt.  MGA CEO said it was in the best interest for his company not to move forward with an offer and that Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), quote, cannot be salvaged, end quote.  Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) shares were off more than 5 percent to $11.41.</p><p>And after the bell, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) reported better than expected earnings.  The software maker also topped revenue estimates, thanks to an increase in cloud services and license support.  Shares initially rose in the after-hours trading, but closed the regular session down a fraction to $52.68.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Hundreds of billions of dollars will be spent on digital ads this year and much of that money will likely go to companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).  But before making spending decisions, advertisers are taking in consideration the regulatory backlash against these tech giants sometimes referred to as tech lash.</p><p>Julia Boorstin reports once again tonight from the Cannes Lions Conference in France.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOORSTIN:  The annual gathering of advertising giants discussing where to put the $600 billion that would be spent on ads worldwide this year comes amid growing tech lash, criticism of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), that digital duopoly that together controlled the majority of all digital ad spending.  With the CEO of the largest ad conglomerate WPP`s Mark Read says breaking up those two giants would not help consumers.</p><p>MARK READ, WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY) CEO:  Clearly, you know, with the shift online, these two companies are ever more powerful.  But I didn`t have to ask ourselves, you know, what are we really trying to achieve by and if you would have call for them to be broken up?  And is that really going to make, you know, the world a better place?</p><p>The great benefit of these platforms for consumers is most of their products are free.  The advertisers fund it, advertisers support it, and I think in balance that`s a good thing.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  And with so many other options out in force here in Cannes, from Snap to Twitter, the CEO of another conglomerate, IPG`s Michael Roth, says advertisers will start to move their dollars if Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) don`t make meaningful changes around issues of brand safety, not having ads placed next to offensive content and privacy protections.</p><p>MICHAEL ROTH, IPG CEO:  You know, everyone talks about government regulation and breaking them up.  But what really will happen is our clients will not start spending with them, and that will be the biggest effect eventually if it doesn`t get corrected.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  And there are a range of companies here that are positioning themselves as alternatives to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), by focusing on professionally created content which doesn`t have the risks around a brand safety.  One of those is AT&amp;T`s ad tech division Xandr.</p><p>BRIAN LESSER, XANDR CEO:  That`s a big opportunity for us because frankly I think that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have had a hard time managing the content on their platforms and assuring advertisers that they`re not going to end up advertising in a place that is inconsistent with the brand.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Others such as Pinterest and videogames streaming service Twitch are ramping up their presence here to explain to advertisers the depth of their devoted audiences, while magazine publisher Conde Nast positions itself as a premium filter for YouTube.</p><p>ROGER LYNCH, CONDE NAST CEO:  Advertisers who may not want to advertise just broadly on YouTube will advertise through us on YouTube because their content maybe they want endemic content for their advertising, or they`re concerned about brand safety.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  And as the tech companies here host parties and panels for advertisers, those brands have more options than ever.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Cannes, France.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, why car quality is stalling out.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A new report says car buyers are finding plenty of problems with the latest models and showrooms.  In particular, they`re seeing issues with the technology design to make driving cars safer.</p><p>Here`s Phil LeBeau.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you`re looking to buy a new car or truck, you know one of the big selling points -- technology that makes driving easier and safer.  Take lane departure warnings, the goal is to keep cars from colliding during lane changes.  But a new report by J.D. Power says driver assist technology is not always intuitive or easy to use.</p><p>DAVE SARGENT, J.D. POWER:  One of the dangers is that automakers overcomplicate the technology and engineers need to remember that they are designing for normal people and not for other automotive engineers.</p><p>LEBEAU:  While automakers may be struggling with driver assist technology, J.D. Power says buyers are seeing fewer problems with connectivity and infotainment systems.  And this year`s report shows Korean brands continue to have the most problem-free new vehicles with Genesis, Kia and Hyundai leading the way.</p><p>SARGENT:  They deliver as much technology as most other brands but they are very, very good at keeping it simple and giving consumers exactly what they want.</p><p>LEBEAU:  By comparison, the luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover both owned by the same company are rated as among the newest models with the most issues.  Jaguar, Land Rover, along with Mitsubishi, are rated the worst in initial quality.</p><p>J.D. Power says new car reliability is still at a record high, but his automakers add new features especially technology to help us drive safer, the challenge is making sure not only that that technology works but that it`s easy to use.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The billionaire founder of Blackstone is giving the University of Oxford $188 million dollars to research the ethics of artificial intelligence.  It is believed to be the largest single gift to oxford since the Renaissance.

Bernard Arnault is now worth $100 billion, joining the ranks of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates.  Mr. Arnault is chairman of luxury goods maker LVMH.  He is also the richest person in Europe and owns a 97 percent stake in the fashion house Christian Dior.</p><p>HERERA:  Here`s a look at the final days numbers on Wall Street.  The Dow rose 38 points, the Nasdaq up 33, S&amp;P 500 added eight, less than 1 percent away from a record.</p><p>And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I`m Sue Herrera.

The Dow  nears a new high and heads towards its best June in decades, but a critical  meeting between the U.S. and China still looms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Healthy prognosis?  The Trump administration wants to make hospital and  doctor fees public as part of its push to drive down costs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And data disclosure.  What`s your personal information worth to big tech?   A new bill would put a price tag on your privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this  Monday, June 24th.</p><p>And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome.  Sue is off  tonight.</p><p>Now, don`t be fooled by today`s modest moves in the stock market.  This  month has been big for investors.  In fact, it could be one of the very  best for a long time.  Optimism has been improving over the past few weeks,  but today, there was some caution ahead of the trade talks between the U.S.  and China which are set to take place later this week at the G20 summit in  Japan.</p><p>So, today, the Dow Jones Industrial Rose just eight points to 26,727.   Nasdaq was down 26.  The S&amp;P was down 5.  And today, despite these small  moves, recent rallies have sent the major indexes close to new highs.</p><p>But does this month`s move higher have staying power?</p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This trip to a fresh  record is perhaps the most confusing in terms of how it happened and what  comes next.  It`s come with treasury yields anchored near 30 month lows,  recession fears slowing and manufacturing stalling.  The rally has been  driven by defensive stock sectors such as utilities and gold has broken out  to a multi-year high.  Investor sentiment has been quite cautious, which  has a way of boosting stocks in contrarian fashion.</p><p>Purely based on the historic probability, the market at a new high ended up  more than 17 percent not quite halfway through the year are reasons to  believe more upside lies ahead.  But also are cause to keep expectations in  check.  The Dow Jones Industrials have made a record high in the month of  June and 33 previous years, second half performance in those years is  roughly at historical average for all years.  That`s a gain of more than 4  percent.</p><p>And the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for the strongest first half since 1997 and one  of the five best in recent decades.  All years with similar returns by this  point finished the year with further gains.  Such historical studies  provide context but no clear course of action, of course.  The big picture  is the market has been in a wide swinging but ultimately side swinging in  the year and a half.  It`s now stretching the top of the range.  Earnings  have flattened and the market fully expects the Federal Reserve to start  cutting rates next month.</p><p>The initial market reaction tends to be quite positive but the strength  only lasts if recession is averted.  So, have stocks already priced in this  Fed effect?  And will the second half confirm the market`s implicit belief  that the economy can keep outrunning a sharper down turn?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So what is the market expecting from the upcoming trade talks  between President Trump and China`s President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit  later this week?</p><p>Joining us, David Lebovitz.  He`s global market strategist at J.P. Morgan  Asset Management.</p><p>David, good to see you again.  Welcome back.</p><p>DAVID LEBOVITZ, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, here we sit near these all-time highs as Mike was pointing  out here.  Does that mean a deal with China is already priced in?  We don`t  get much more upside if there is a deal and downside if we do -- or if we  don`t?  What do you think is going on?</p><p>LEBOVITZ:  So, I think that this is a little bit of a buy the rumor and  sell the news.  I think that the market`s assumption all along is that we  will see a deal done with China.  And, frankly, at this juncture, I think  the market would be comfortable with no escalation in the current state of  affairs with China.  So, as long as we don`t put tariffs on the additional  $300 billion of imports, I think the market will be able to handle that.</p><p>But I don`t really see a ton of upside here stemming from a positive  resolution to these talks, maybe if some of the existing tariffs are rolled  back, you would see markets melt higher.  But I don`t think that, you know,  investors are expecting that.  I think they`re just expecting no big  changes going forward.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Add to the mixture, the geopolitical problems in Middle East  with Iran.  Oil had a spectacular gain last week and it`s up a little bit  again today.  Gold is moving higher as well.</p><p>What do you think is going on here?</p><p>LEBOVITZ:  So, I mean, the oil point I think is relatively clear.  People  are worried about supply chain disruption, and that`s putting upward  pressure on the price.  The gold move has been more interesting.  And, you  know, frankly, over the past couple of days, couple of weeks we`ve seen  less traditional assets, whether that be gold, cryptocurrency begin to move  higher.</p><p>What that says to me is there`s an expectation of central bank easing  further.  There will be a need for investors to find returns and previously  uninvestigated corners of the market.  And you`re seeing people re-embrace  these trades that have frankly struggled over the past couple of years as  people have prepared for a Federal Reserve and global monetary policy  stance which is a bit tighter than it looks where we`re headed today.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And along those lines, our treasury yields have been close to  three year lows.  The ten year still hovering just above 2 percent right  now.</p><p>LEBOVITZ:  Yes, it`s interesting to see that because the stock market and  bond market are clearly seeing two very different things at the current  juncture.  I think you have the stock market per our conversation earlier  pricing, you know, in some sort of resolution on trade, obviously an easier  Federal Reserve.  Earnings growth, which is relatively solid over the next  12 to 18 months whereas you have the bond market looking at things and  saying the economic data is beginning to deteriorate.  There is no  inflation no matter where we look outside of financial asset prices.</p><p>So, I think that this, you know, dichotomy between the bond market and  stock market will need to be resolved.  But from where I sit, I think the  stock market has got this one right.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  David Lebovitz with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, always good to  see you, David.  Thanks again.</p><p>LEBOVITZ:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Elsewhere, President Trump today signed an executive order  prescribing what`s hard-hitting new sanctions on Iran.  They are in  response to the downing of that unmanned U.S. drone last week.  President  Trump said that his administration will increase pressure on Tehran until  the regime abandons its dangerous activities.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  America is a peace-loving  nation.  We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country.  I look  forward to the day when sanctions can be finally lifted.  I look forward to  discussing whatever we have to discuss with anybody that wants to speak.</p><p>In the meantime, who knows what`s going to happen.  I can only tell you we  cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  These new sanctions deny Iran`s supreme leader and his office  access to key financial resources but Iran said today that the sanctions  show the U.S. has no respect for international law and order.  It is  something the energy markets are watching and today the price of domestic  crude did settle slightly higher after last week`s huge 9 percent rally.</p><p>President of the Dallas Fed said it`s too soon to decide if interest rates  need to be cut.  Robert Kaplan called on his fellow policymakers to be  patient and wait and see how economic events unfold.  Those events include,  of course, the trade war between U.S. and China, as well as decelerating  global growth.</p><p>President Trump signed a second executive order today.  This one pushes for  transparency in health care prices.  The goal is to lower prices that  patients pay.  Hospitals and insurance companies say that they will fight  this order.  Their shares fell in trading today.</p><p>Bertha Coombs puts it all together for us now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump`s  latest executive order is aimed at providing transparency on hospital  prices, so that patients know what they`ll pay before they`re treated, not  after the fact when they get a sky high bill.</p><p>TRUMP:  Patients face significant obstacles shopping for the best care at  the best price, driving up health care costs for everyone.  With today`s  historic action, we are fundamentally changing the nature of the health  care marketplace.</p><p>COOMBS:  Earlier this year, the administration required hospitals to post  their list prices but insured patients don`t pay those prices.  Under the  new executive order, the government will require hospitals to make their  negotiated insured rates public and require insurers to provide members  with out-of-pocket cost estimates for procedures ahead of time.</p><p>Analysts say the price transparency rules could help increase competition  on services like MRIs where consumers have alternatives and can find scans  with lower out-of-pocket costs.  But with high-cost procedures like  surgery, some say the move could actually backfire.</p><p>CRAIG GARTHWAITE, KELLOGG SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT:  If this is about a knee  replacement or any other kind of surgery, the cost is so higher on your  deductible, the deductible is not really a feature of your shopping  decision.  Then you might start thinking that price is a substitute for  quality and you just go to the high price place because you want to go to  the highest quality place.</p><p>COOMBS:  Some analysts worry transparency could encourage collusion,  helping hospitals keep prices sky high in some markets.</p><p>PAUL KECKLEY, THE KECKLEY REPORT:  The bigger question might be in the long  term will that drive prices down?  Doubtful.</p><p>COOMBS:  The executive order is just the beginning.  The administration now  has to draft the rules and give the industry time to comment.  New rules on  changing Medicare drug price rebates initiated last year still have not  been finalized, but it`s clear the pressure is on the health care industry  from Washington and from consumers to do better on prices.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The Supreme Court has agreed to hear an Affordable Care Act- related lawsuit where insurance companies -- health insurance companies say  the federal government owes them $12 billion for losses they sustained  under that law.  One facet of the Affordable Care Act was designed to  encourage insurers to cover riskier, previously uninsured people which the  government would then reimburse them for.</p><p>But two years ago, Republicans blocked those payments, saying that they  were a bailout for the insurance industry.  Insurers allege the government  pulled a bait-and-switch and withheld the money that they are entitled to.</p><p>Elsewhere in Washington, they continue to bear down on big tech.  The  latest push came today.  A proposal was introduced that would force well- known companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) to tell users what kind of data they are collecting on you  and how much it`s worth.</p><p>Ylan Mui has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  There`s a new bipartisan  effort to put a price tag on privacy.  Democratic Senator Mark Warner and  Republican Josh Hawley want big tech to calculate the value of all the data  they collect and disclose that number to their users.  The new rules would  apply to companies with more than 100 million active monthly users and the  FCC would be in charge of creating the formulas that determine the value of  that data.  And companies would have to file a report every year that  includes contracts with third parties that collect data and allow users to  delete their information.</p><p>In a tweet, Senator Warner said social media companies have told the public  that their products are free, but that`s not true.  He said you`re paying  with your data instead of your wallet and you have a right to know what  that information is worth.  Tech groups are fighting back.  One think tank,  the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation argued that the  premise of the bill is all wrong.</p><p>Unlike with money, you don`t have less data and often the more data you  share, the better your service.  They say that trade helps consumers come  out ahead.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui, in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today`s \"Upgrades and  Downgrades\".</p><p>We begin with United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).  Shares were upgraded to  outperform from market perform at Cohen, with the analyst citing the  company`s merger with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).  The price target is $150.  That  stock rose 1 percent to $130.18.</p><p>Deere was upgraded to buy from hold at Jefferies.  The analyst cited the  improved sentiment in the farm economy right now.  And price target raised  to $190.  That rose to 1.5 percent to $166.80 today.</p><p>Dunkin Brands was upgraded from outperform from neutral at Wedbush.  The  analyst cited the potential for new growth in same store sales and improved  operations.  Price target, $92.  Shares rose more than 1 percent to $80.98.</p><p>And Hostess Brands was upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS.  The analyst  cited accelerating sales trends and the company`s new breakfast product  line.  Price target $17.  Those shares rose more than 2 percent to $14.26.</p><p>Still ahead, a new kind of food fight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAHEL SOLOMON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I`m Rahel Solomon  for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.  Coming up, what does the aerospace industry  have to do with tariffs on specialty foods?  I`m at a specialty foods  convention in New York City and I`ll have that answer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is watching the tariff situation closely  even though 70 percent of the goods it sells are made domestically.  The  CEO of the home improvement retailer said today that there are ways it can  minimize the potential impact of tariffs on customer prices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRAIG MENEAR, HOME DEPOT CEO:  The first step that we`ll do is try to  protect the customer in the project.  We`ll do everything we can to try to  take other costs out of the business working with our suppliers, whether  that`s opportunities in supply chain, other elements of the business and  then we`ll try to protect the customer on the project.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Stocks fell in today`s session.</p><p>Well, there`s another potential tariff fight brewing these days, but this  one is not with China, it`s with Europe.  And it could result in higher  prices for specialty foods.  As you saw, Rahel Solomon is in New York with  that story tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOLOMON:  For European companies at a global specialty foods convention,  there is a looming threat -- tariffs proposed by the U.S. and because of  aerospace.</p><p>PHIL KAFARAKIS, SPECIALTY FOOD ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT:  This is the  political gamesmanship that`s going on around the world.  We just -- we  just came out of it with Mexico.  It has to do with immigration policy.  We  have a problem with China when we talk about soy beans and what happened  there.  So, it seems that agriculture and food products are becoming a  little bit of a weapon as it relates to policy that have nothing to do with  food.</p><p>SOLOMON:  For nearly 14 years, the U.S. has maintained the European Union  has provided illegal subsidies to Airbus, unfairly giving them advantage  over American companies, mainly Boeing (NYSE:BA).  The E.U. claims the U.S.  indirectly subsidizes Boeing (NYSE:BA) with defense purchases and tax  breaks.  In April, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer issued a  list of imported foods that could be subject to retaliatory tariffs if the  E.U. does not stop subsidizing airbus.  Foods like cheese, meats and jams.</p><p>ARIANE DAGUIN, D`ARTAGNAN CEO:  Our annual revenues are $150 million and I  think out of that, if 10 percent is affected, it would be devastating for  our business.</p><p>MARIA LOI, LOI ESTIATORIO EXEC. CHIEF:  It`s not only me, it`s the whole  team, you know, that works for that.  And yes, they are like can we make  it?  I said, yes, of course we will make it, but it will be more expensive  for the consumer and I say, yes, for the homes.</p><p>SOLOMON:  French, Italian and Greek companies are most at risk, although  according to a U.S. major importer, the impact will be felt across the food  industry.  Possible tariffs could be 100 percent of the product`s cost,  according to the specialty food association.</p><p>TOM GELLERT, ATALANTA PRESIDENT:  Feta cheeses, parmesan Reggiano, imported  Gouda, imported Asiago, any fine cheese that you buy, and, you know, these  are not just at Whole Foods.  You find imported cheeses from anywhere from  whole foods to Aldi, Walmart, Wegmans.  So, it turns the gamut.</p><p>SOLOMON:  The WTO was expected to weigh in again soon, perhaps this summer.   That`s what everyone is waiting for.  If a decision isn`t favorable to the  U.S., that`s when we could see those tariffs.  But businesses here tell me  this is a food fight they don`t want anything to do with.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Rahel Solomon in New York City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Eldorado rolls the dice on Caesars.  And that`s where we begin  tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with Eldorado Resorts buying Caesars for more  than $17 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of debt.  The  merger will put about 60 casinos and resorts in 16 states under a single  name, Caesars, making it the largest gaming operator in the country.   Eldorado shares fell 10 percent to $45.77 while Caesars rose to $11.44.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is reportedly offering big discounts in an effort to have  online merchants to its express delivery services.  \"The Wall Street  Journal\" says the carrier is trying to win over shippers from rival UPS by  offering guaranteed two-day air service for the same price as shipping by  ground.  The stock was down nearly 3 percent today to $160.90.</p><p>Bristol-Myers said that its planned $74 billion merger will now close later  than originally planned.  The deal is now expected to close by the end of  the year or the start of 2020 as opposed to the third quarter of this year.   Bristol will divest Celgene`s most profitable drug Otezla which treats  psoriasis, to help ease concerns of antitrust regulators.  Bristol-Myers  fell more than 7 percent on this news today to $45.68 while Celgene  (NASDAQ:CELG) dropped 5-1/2 percent to $93.47.</p><p>Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is opening a beauty store for professionals that will  offer stylist and barber supplies typically found in salons and spas.   Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rose a fraction to $1,913.90.  But the news  sent shares of competitors like Sally Beauty and Alta Beauty down today.   Sally fell almost 17 percent to $12.30, while Alta dropped more than 2.5  percent to $346.54.</p><p>The fire at that Philadelphia refinery last week that we told you about on  Friday was extinguished over the weekend.  Now that the blaze is out, the  investigation into the cause is set to begin.  And right now, many  questions remained unanswered.</p><p>Brian Sullivan traveled to that facility which is the largest on the East  Coast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The fireball, 4:00  a.m. Friday morning here at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, could be seen from space.  It was felt miles  away but luckily the worst was avoided from a human perspective.</p><p>Only a couple of workers were injured.  They were treated on scene despite  the blast which was simply incredible to behold.  You can see in background  there, the burnt out hooks (ph) of one of the refining units, that what was  burning on Friday morning.  The fire was put out over the weekend.</p><p>That cause is still being investigated.  At least three different federal  agencies as well as local officials will be involved in that investigation.</p><p>What the current status of this refining plant, the largest on the East  Coast is unknown.  The company has been tight lipped about exactly how much  gasoline and other products are currently being refined.</p><p>But there was a separate fire two weeks which shut down one of the  complexes.  This is actually two separate refineries in one, that refinery  is supposed to come back online last Friday, the day that this refinery  actually exploded.  The status of that refinery and both are currently not  known.</p><p>What we do know is this, the worst of the human toll was avoided.  This is  one of the largest refineries in the United States that still uses hydrogen  chloride, a toxic and often deadly chemical used in the mixing of gasoline.</p><p>A clean energy fund lawyer explained what could have happened had hydrogen  chloride been released from the explosion.</p><p>ALEX BOMSTEIN, CLEAN AIR COUNCIL SENIOR LITIGATION ATTTORNEY:  Philadelphia  itself is in the worst position within the country with the most number of  people living close to hydrogen fluoride-using refinery.  This refinery is  right next to residential neighborhoods throughout South Philadelphia and  Southwest Philadelphia.  If it had hit those homes, those neighborhoods,  those people would, first of all, be burned and they could die very  quickly.  It`s a horrible scenario.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  Thankfully, that did not happen, but now, the toll turns to the  economic side.  This refinery, 27 percent of all mid-Atlantic gasoline  supplies.  From now on, other refineries will be able to make up that lack  of supply.</p><p>However, the longer this factory is offline, the tighter factories could  get and the higher the prices could go.  Some estimates say it could take  more than a year and possibly $100 million to get this refinery, the oldest  operating refinery in America back on line and that the if they ultimately  have the money, because they will not be refining anything here on any  large scale, at least through the summer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Brian Sullivan, Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, did Disney`s \"Toy Story 4\" go to infinity and  beyond at the box office?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Here`s what we`re watching tomorrow.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports earnings.  The company`s results are often viewed  as a barometer for the health of the global economy.  We`ll find out if  lower mortgage rates helped fuel new home sales and report of consumer  confidence will tell us if sentiment is holding up amid rising geopolitical  tensions.  So, an interesting day coming up tomorrow.</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders has a plan to wipe out the $1.6 trillion of student  debt owed by more than 40 million Americans.  It will also provide $48  billion in funding for free tuition at state colleges and universities.   The Democratic presidential candidate would pay for his plan by taxing Wall  Street transactions like stock and bond trades.  His campaign estimates  that the taxes would generate $2.4 trillion over a decade.</p><p>Meanwhile, 19 billionaires have released a letter asking all 2020  presidential candidates to support a tax on America`s families with the  largest fortunes.  The bipartisan letter says the next dollar of new tax  revenue should come from the most financially fortunate, not from middle  income and lower income Americans.  The letter was signed by George Soros,  Abigail Disney (NYSE:DIS) and members of the Pritzker family among many  other billionaires.</p><p>Toys \"R\" Us could make a comeback this year.  A new company called True  Kids reportedly plans to open two Toys \"R\" Us stores, which would be about  a third of the size of the old ones.  True kids won the rights of the Toys  \"R\" Us brand last year.  It also took over the rights of other assets,  including Babies \"R\" Us, Jeffrey the Giraffe and Imaginarium.  More than  700 Toys \"R\" Us locations were closed last year.</p><p>Well, we are entering a critical time of year for Hollywood.  This year,  the entertainment industry is betting on a hot summer box office with hopes  that the return of Disney`s \"Toy Story\" franchise would lead the way.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Woody and Buzz  light year return to the big screen after nine years.  Disney`s \"Toy Story  4\" flew into the theaters around the country this past weekend.  The film  brought in $118 million at the domestic box office, the biggest ever  opening from the franchise, with $120 million coming in from overseas.</p><p>This film gives Disney (NYSE:DIS) the four biggest opening weekends of the  year and more than 1/3 of box office market share year-to-date.</p><p>JESSICA REIF EHRLICH, BANK OF AMERICAMERRILL LYNCH:  We figure there`s 20  percent upside in the stock driven by, of course, films.  While this film,  \"Toy Story 4\", may have under performed initially expectations, it`s still  the best debut of all the four franchise, of the four films in the  franchise.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  But the film fell far short of expectations.  The studio  projecting about $140 million opening weekend while some analysts expected  as much as $200 million at the domestic box office.</p><p>The shortfall could be contributed to a number of different factors.   Disney`s skipped its usual Father`s Day slot which is considered better for  drawing families.</p><p>Last year`s Father`s Day weekend release of \"Incredibles 2\" smashed  records.  The box office is also suffering from weak momentum following  last weekend`s disappointing performance.  And kids` movies seldom have  huge debuts, more likely to have steady performance over time.</p><p>But Disney (NYSE:DIS) is expected to profit and not just from ticket sales  but also from its inclusion in the company`s streaming service Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Plus, which is launching in November.</p><p>ED LEE, NEW YORK TIMES:  Ultimately, this will be redound back to Disney  (NYSE:DIS), right?  It will be on Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus streaming service.   I mean, that`s where you`ll be able to watch these things as a family.  You  missed it.  You want to catch up later on.  You want to watch all the \"Toy  Stories\" in one.  That`s where you`re going to have to pay for it.  So,  eventually it will come back and make up whatever shortfall.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  And Disney (NYSE:DIS) is expected to continue to dominate with  the studio`s \"Lion King\" remake, hitting theaters in July.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And before we go, a final look at the day on Wall Street.  Kind  of a wait and see day as the market anticipates the G20 Summit later this  week.  The Dow rose just eight points.  Nasdaq was down 26.  The S&amp;P down  five.</p><p>That is NBR for tonight, I`m Bill Griffeth.  Thanks so much for watching.   We`ll see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Dow nears a new high and heads towards its best June in decades, but a critical meeting between the U.S. and China still looms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Healthy prognosis? The Trump administration wants to make hospital and doctor fees public as part of its push to drive down costs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And data disclosure. What`s your personal information worth to big tech? A new bill would put a price tag on your privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Monday, June 24th.</p><p>And we do bid you a good evening, everybody, and welcome. Sue is off tonight.</p><p>Now, don`t be fooled by today`s modest moves in the stock market. This month has been big for investors. In fact, it could be one of the very best for a long time. Optimism has been improving over the past few weeks, but today, there was some caution ahead of the trade talks between the U.S. and China which are set to take place later this week at the G20 summit in Japan.</p><p>So, today, the Dow Jones Industrial Rose just eight points to 26,727. Nasdaq was down 26. The S&amp;P was down 5. And today, despite these small moves, recent rallies have sent the major indexes close to new highs.</p><p>But does this month`s move higher have staying power?</p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This trip to a fresh record is perhaps the most confusing in terms of how it happened and what comes next. It`s come with treasury yields anchored near 30 month lows, recession fears slowing and manufacturing stalling. The rally has been driven by defensive stock sectors such as utilities and gold has broken out to a multi-year high. Investor sentiment has been quite cautious, which has a way of boosting stocks in contrarian fashion.</p><p>Purely based on the historic probability, the market at a new high ended up more than 17 percent not quite halfway through the year are reasons to believe more upside lies ahead. But also are cause to keep expectations in check. The Dow Jones Industrials have made a record high in the month of June and 33 previous years, second half performance in those years is roughly at historical average for all years. That`s a gain of more than 4 percent.</p><p>And the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for the strongest first half since 1997 and one of the five best in recent decades. All years with similar returns by this point finished the year with further gains. Such historical studies provide context but no clear course of action, of course. The big picture is the market has been in a wide swinging but ultimately side swinging in the year and a half. It`s now stretching the top of the range. Earnings have flattened and the market fully expects the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates next month.</p><p>The initial market reaction tends to be quite positive but the strength only lasts if recession is averted. So, have stocks already priced in this Fed effect? And will the second half confirm the market`s implicit belief that the economy can keep outrunning a sharper down turn?</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So what is the market expecting from the upcoming trade talks between President Trump and China`s President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit later this week?</p><p>Joining us, David Lebovitz. He`s global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p><p>David, good to see you again. Welcome back.</p><p>DAVID LEBOVITZ, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT: Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, here we sit near these all-time highs as Mike was pointing out here. Does that mean a deal with China is already priced in? We don`t get much more upside if there is a deal and downside if we do -- or if we don`t? What do you think is going on?</p><p>LEBOVITZ: So, I think that this is a little bit of a buy the rumor and sell the news. I think that the market`s assumption all along is that we will see a deal done with China. And, frankly, at this juncture, I think the market would be comfortable with no escalation in the current state of affairs with China. So, as long as we don`t put tariffs on the additional $300 billion of imports, I think the market will be able to handle that.</p><p>But I don`t really see a ton of upside here stemming from a positive resolution to these talks, maybe if some of the existing tariffs are rolled back, you would see markets melt higher. But I don`t think that, you know, investors are expecting that. I think they`re just expecting no big changes going forward.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Add to the mixture, the geopolitical problems in Middle East with Iran. Oil had a spectacular gain last week and it`s up a little bit again today. Gold is moving higher as well.</p><p>What do you think is going on here?</p><p>LEBOVITZ: So, I mean, the oil point I think is relatively clear. People are worried about supply chain disruption, and that`s putting upward pressure on the price. The gold move has been more interesting. And, you know, frankly, over the past couple of days, couple of weeks we`ve seen less traditional assets, whether that be gold, cryptocurrency begin to move higher.</p><p>What that says to me is there`s an expectation of central bank easing further. There will be a need for investors to find returns and previously uninvestigated corners of the market. And you`re seeing people re-embrace these trades that have frankly struggled over the past couple of years as people have prepared for a Federal Reserve and global monetary policy stance which is a bit tighter than it looks where we`re headed today.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And along those lines, our treasury yields have been close to three year lows. The ten year still hovering just above 2 percent right now.</p><p>LEBOVITZ: Yes, it`s interesting to see that because the stock market and bond market are clearly seeing two very different things at the current juncture. I think you have the stock market per our conversation earlier pricing, you know, in some sort of resolution on trade, obviously an easier Federal Reserve. Earnings growth, which is relatively solid over the next 12 to 18 months whereas you have the bond market looking at things and saying the economic data is beginning to deteriorate. There is no inflation no matter where we look outside of financial asset prices.</p><p>So, I think that this, you know, dichotomy between the bond market and stock market will need to be resolved. But from where I sit, I think the stock market has got this one right.</p><p>GRIFFETH: David Lebovitz with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, always good to see you, David. Thanks again.</p><p>LEBOVITZ: Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, President Trump today signed an executive order prescribing what`s hard-hitting new sanctions on Iran. They are in response to the downing of that unmanned U.S. drone last week. President Trump said that his administration will increase pressure on Tehran until the regime abandons its dangerous activities.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is a peace-loving nation. We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country. I look forward to the day when sanctions can be finally lifted. I look forward to discussing whatever we have to discuss with anybody that wants to speak.</p><p>In the meantime, who knows what`s going to happen. I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: These new sanctions deny Iran`s supreme leader and his office access to key financial resources but Iran said today that the sanctions show the U.S. has no respect for international law and order. It is something the energy markets are watching and today the price of domestic crude did settle slightly higher after last week`s huge 9 percent rally.</p><p>President of the Dallas Fed said it`s too soon to decide if interest rates need to be cut. Robert Kaplan called on his fellow policymakers to be patient and wait and see how economic events unfold. Those events include, of course, the trade war between U.S. and China, as well as decelerating global growth.</p><p>President Trump signed a second executive order today. This one pushes for transparency in health care prices. The goal is to lower prices that patients pay. Hospitals and insurance companies say that they will fight this order. Their shares fell in trading today.</p><p>Bertha Coombs puts it all together for us now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: President Trump`s latest executive order is aimed at providing transparency on hospital prices, so that patients know what they`ll pay before they`re treated, not after the fact when they get a sky high bill.</p><p>TRUMP: Patients face significant obstacles shopping for the best care at the best price, driving up health care costs for everyone. With today`s historic action, we are fundamentally changing the nature of the health care marketplace.</p><p>COOMBS: Earlier this year, the administration required hospitals to post their list prices but insured patients don`t pay those prices. Under the new executive order, the government will require hospitals to make their negotiated insured rates public and require insurers to provide members with out-of-pocket cost estimates for procedures ahead of time.</p><p>Analysts say the price transparency rules could help increase competition on services like MRIs where consumers have alternatives and can find scans with lower out-of-pocket costs. But with high-cost procedures like surgery, some say the move could actually backfire.</p><p>CRAIG GARTHWAITE, KELLOGG SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT: If this is about a knee replacement or any other kind of surgery, the cost is so higher on your deductible, the deductible is not really a feature of your shopping decision. Then you might start thinking that price is a substitute for quality and you just go to the high price place because you want to go to the highest quality place.</p><p>COOMBS: Some analysts worry transparency could encourage collusion, helping hospitals keep prices sky high in some markets.</p><p>PAUL KECKLEY, THE KECKLEY REPORT: The bigger question might be in the long term will that drive prices down? Doubtful.</p><p>COOMBS: The executive order is just the beginning. The administration now has to draft the rules and give the industry time to comment. New rules on changing Medicare drug price rebates initiated last year still have not been finalized, but it`s clear the pressure is on the health care industry from Washington and from consumers to do better on prices.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The Supreme Court has agreed to hear an Affordable Care Act- related lawsuit where insurance companies -- health insurance companies say the federal government owes them $12 billion for losses they sustained under that law. One facet of the Affordable Care Act was designed to encourage insurers to cover riskier, previously uninsured people which the government would then reimburse them for.</p><p>But two years ago, Republicans blocked those payments, saying that they were a bailout for the insurance industry. Insurers allege the government pulled a bait-and-switch and withheld the money that they are entitled to.</p><p>Elsewhere in Washington, they continue to bear down on big tech. The latest push came today. A proposal was introduced that would force well- known companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to tell users what kind of data they are collecting on you and how much it`s worth.</p><p>Ylan Mui has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: There`s a new bipartisan effort to put a price tag on privacy. Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Josh Hawley want big tech to calculate the value of all the data they collect and disclose that number to their users. The new rules would apply to companies with more than 100 million active monthly users and the FCC would be in charge of creating the formulas that determine the value of that data. And companies would have to file a report every year that includes contracts with third parties that collect data and allow users to delete their information.</p><p>In a tweet, Senator Warner said social media companies have told the public that their products are free, but that`s not true. He said you`re paying with your data instead of your wallet and you have a right to know what that information is worth. Tech groups are fighting back. One think tank, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation argued that the premise of the bill is all wrong.</p><p>Unlike with money, you don`t have less data and often the more data you share, the better your service. They say that trade helps consumers come out ahead.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui, in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look now at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>We begin with United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). Shares were upgraded to outperform from market perform at Cohen, with the analyst citing the company`s merger with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN). The price target is $150. That stock rose 1 percent to $130.18.</p><p>Deere was upgraded to buy from hold at Jefferies. The analyst cited the improved sentiment in the farm economy right now. And price target raised to $190. That rose to 1.5 percent to $166.80 today.</p><p>Dunkin Brands was upgraded from outperform from neutral at Wedbush. The analyst cited the potential for new growth in same store sales and improved operations. Price target, $92. Shares rose more than 1 percent to $80.98.</p><p>And Hostess Brands was upgraded to buy from neutral at UBS. The analyst cited accelerating sales trends and the company`s new breakfast product line. Price target $17. Those shares rose more than 2 percent to $14.26.</p><p>Still ahead, a new kind of food fight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAHEL SOLOMON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Rahel Solomon for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. Coming up, what does the aerospace industry have to do with tariffs on specialty foods? I`m at a specialty foods convention in New York City and I`ll have that answer.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is watching the tariff situation closely even though 70 percent of the goods it sells are made domestically. The CEO of the home improvement retailer said today that there are ways it can minimize the potential impact of tariffs on customer prices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRAIG MENEAR, HOME DEPOT CEO: The first step that we`ll do is try to protect the customer in the project. We`ll do everything we can to try to take other costs out of the business working with our suppliers, whether that`s opportunities in supply chain, other elements of the business and then we`ll try to protect the customer on the project.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Stocks fell in today`s session.</p><p>Well, there`s another potential tariff fight brewing these days, but this one is not with China, it`s with Europe. And it could result in higher prices for specialty foods. As you saw, Rahel Solomon is in New York with that story tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOLOMON: For European companies at a global specialty foods convention, there is a looming threat -- tariffs proposed by the U.S. and because of aerospace.</p><p>PHIL KAFARAKIS, SPECIALTY FOOD ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT: This is the political gamesmanship that`s going on around the world. We just -- we just came out of it with Mexico. It has to do with immigration policy. We have a problem with China when we talk about soy beans and what happened there. So, it seems that agriculture and food products are becoming a little bit of a weapon as it relates to policy that have nothing to do with food.</p><p>SOLOMON: For nearly 14 years, the U.S. has maintained the European Union has provided illegal subsidies to Airbus, unfairly giving them advantage over American companies, mainly Boeing (NYSE:BA). The E.U. claims the U.S. indirectly subsidizes Boeing (NYSE:BA) with defense purchases and tax breaks. In April, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer issued a list of imported foods that could be subject to retaliatory tariffs if the E.U. does not stop subsidizing airbus. Foods like cheese, meats and jams.</p><p>ARIANE DAGUIN, D`ARTAGNAN CEO: Our annual revenues are $150 million and I think out of that, if 10 percent is affected, it would be devastating for our business.</p><p>MARIA LOI, LOI ESTIATORIO EXEC. CHIEF: It`s not only me, it`s the whole team, you know, that works for that. And yes, they are like can we make it? I said, yes, of course we will make it, but it will be more expensive for the consumer and I say, yes, for the homes.</p><p>SOLOMON: French, Italian and Greek companies are most at risk, although according to a U.S. major importer, the impact will be felt across the food industry. Possible tariffs could be 100 percent of the product`s cost, according to the specialty food association.</p><p>TOM GELLERT, ATALANTA PRESIDENT: Feta cheeses, parmesan Reggiano, imported Gouda, imported Asiago, any fine cheese that you buy, and, you know, these are not just at Whole Foods. You find imported cheeses from anywhere from whole foods to Aldi, Walmart, Wegmans. So, it turns the gamut.</p><p>SOLOMON: The WTO was expected to weigh in again soon, perhaps this summer. That`s what everyone is waiting for. If a decision isn`t favorable to the U.S., that`s when we could see those tariffs. But businesses here tell me this is a food fight they don`t want anything to do with.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Rahel Solomon in New York City.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Eldorado rolls the dice on Caesars. And that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with Eldorado Resorts buying Caesars for more than $17 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of debt. The merger will put about 60 casinos and resorts in 16 states under a single name, Caesars, making it the largest gaming operator in the country. Eldorado shares fell 10 percent to $45.77 while Caesars rose to $11.44.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is reportedly offering big discounts in an effort to have online merchants to its express delivery services. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says the carrier is trying to win over shippers from rival UPS by offering guaranteed two-day air service for the same price as shipping by ground. The stock was down nearly 3 percent today to $160.90.</p><p>Bristol-Myers said that its planned $74 billion merger will now close later than originally planned. The deal is now expected to close by the end of the year or the start of 2020 as opposed to the third quarter of this year. Bristol will divest Celgene`s most profitable drug Otezla which treats psoriasis, to help ease concerns of antitrust regulators. Bristol-Myers fell more than 7 percent on this news today to $45.68 while Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) dropped 5-1/2 percent to $93.47.</p><p>Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is opening a beauty store for professionals that will offer stylist and barber supplies typically found in salons and spas. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rose a fraction to $1,913.90. But the news sent shares of competitors like Sally Beauty and Alta Beauty down today. Sally fell almost 17 percent to $12.30, while Alta dropped more than 2.5 percent to $346.54.</p><p>The fire at that Philadelphia refinery last week that we told you about on Friday was extinguished over the weekend. Now that the blaze is out, the investigation into the cause is set to begin. And right now, many questions remained unanswered.</p><p>Brian Sullivan traveled to that facility which is the largest on the East Coast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The fireball, 4:00 a.m. Friday morning here at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, could be seen from space. It was felt miles away but luckily the worst was avoided from a human perspective.</p><p>Only a couple of workers were injured. They were treated on scene despite the blast which was simply incredible to behold. You can see in background there, the burnt out hooks (ph) of one of the refining units, that what was burning on Friday morning. The fire was put out over the weekend.</p><p>That cause is still being investigated. At least three different federal agencies as well as local officials will be involved in that investigation.</p><p>What the current status of this refining plant, the largest on the East Coast is unknown. The company has been tight lipped about exactly how much gasoline and other products are currently being refined.</p><p>But there was a separate fire two weeks which shut down one of the complexes. This is actually two separate refineries in one, that refinery is supposed to come back online last Friday, the day that this refinery actually exploded. The status of that refinery and both are currently not known.</p><p>What we do know is this, the worst of the human toll was avoided. This is one of the largest refineries in the United States that still uses hydrogen chloride, a toxic and often deadly chemical used in the mixing of gasoline.</p><p>A clean energy fund lawyer explained what could have happened had hydrogen chloride been released from the explosion.</p><p>ALEX BOMSTEIN, CLEAN AIR COUNCIL SENIOR LITIGATION ATTTORNEY: Philadelphia itself is in the worst position within the country with the most number of people living close to hydrogen fluoride-using refinery. This refinery is right next to residential neighborhoods throughout South Philadelphia and Southwest Philadelphia. If it had hit those homes, those neighborhoods, those people would, first of all, be burned and they could die very quickly. It`s a horrible scenario.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Thankfully, that did not happen, but now, the toll turns to the economic side. This refinery, 27 percent of all mid-Atlantic gasoline supplies. From now on, other refineries will be able to make up that lack of supply.</p><p>However, the longer this factory is offline, the tighter factories could get and the higher the prices could go. Some estimates say it could take more than a year and possibly $100 million to get this refinery, the oldest operating refinery in America back on line and that the if they ultimately have the money, because they will not be refining anything here on any large scale, at least through the summer.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Brian Sullivan, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, did Disney`s \"Toy Story 4\" go to infinity and beyond at the box office?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Here`s what we`re watching tomorrow.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports earnings. The company`s results are often viewed as a barometer for the health of the global economy. We`ll find out if lower mortgage rates helped fuel new home sales and report of consumer confidence will tell us if sentiment is holding up amid rising geopolitical tensions. So, an interesting day coming up tomorrow.</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders has a plan to wipe out the $1.6 trillion of student debt owed by more than 40 million Americans. It will also provide $48 billion in funding for free tuition at state colleges and universities. The Democratic presidential candidate would pay for his plan by taxing Wall Street transactions like stock and bond trades. His campaign estimates that the taxes would generate $2.4 trillion over a decade.</p><p>Meanwhile, 19 billionaires have released a letter asking all 2020 presidential candidates to support a tax on America`s families with the largest fortunes. The bipartisan letter says the next dollar of new tax revenue should come from the most financially fortunate, not from middle income and lower income Americans. The letter was signed by George Soros, Abigail Disney (NYSE:DIS) and members of the Pritzker family among many other billionaires.</p><p>Toys \"R\" Us could make a comeback this year. A new company called True Kids reportedly plans to open two Toys \"R\" Us stores, which would be about a third of the size of the old ones. True kids won the rights of the Toys \"R\" Us brand last year. It also took over the rights of other assets, including Babies \"R\" Us, Jeffrey the Giraffe and Imaginarium. More than 700 Toys \"R\" Us locations were closed last year.</p><p>Well, we are entering a critical time of year for Hollywood. This year, the entertainment industry is betting on a hot summer box office with hopes that the return of Disney`s \"Toy Story\" franchise would lead the way.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Woody and Buzz light year return to the big screen after nine years. Disney`s \"Toy Story 4\" flew into the theaters around the country this past weekend. The film brought in $118 million at the domestic box office, the biggest ever opening from the franchise, with $120 million coming in from overseas.</p><p>This film gives Disney (NYSE:DIS) the four biggest opening weekends of the year and more than 1/3 of box office market share year-to-date.</p><p>JESSICA REIF EHRLICH, BANK OF AMERICAMERRILL LYNCH: We figure there`s 20 percent upside in the stock driven by, of course, films. While this film, \"Toy Story 4\", may have under performed initially expectations, it`s still the best debut of all the four franchise, of the four films in the franchise.</p><p>BOORSTIN: But the film fell far short of expectations. The studio projecting about $140 million opening weekend while some analysts expected as much as $200 million at the domestic box office.</p><p>The shortfall could be contributed to a number of different factors. Disney`s skipped its usual Father`s Day slot which is considered better for drawing families.</p><p>Last year`s Father`s Day weekend release of \"Incredibles 2\" smashed records. The box office is also suffering from weak momentum following last weekend`s disappointing performance. And kids` movies seldom have huge debuts, more likely to have steady performance over time.</p><p>But Disney (NYSE:DIS) is expected to profit and not just from ticket sales but also from its inclusion in the company`s streaming service Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus, which is launching in November.</p><p>ED LEE, NEW YORK TIMES: Ultimately, this will be redound back to Disney (NYSE:DIS), right? It will be on Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus streaming service. I mean, that`s where you`ll be able to watch these things as a family. You missed it. You want to catch up later on. You want to watch all the \"Toy Stories\" in one. That`s where you`re going to have to pay for it. So, eventually it will come back and make up whatever shortfall.</p><p>BOORSTIN: And Disney (NYSE:DIS) is expected to continue to dominate with the studio`s \"Lion King\" remake, hitting theaters in July.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And before we go, a final look at the day on Wall Street.

The best performing sector of the year so far has another rough day and dragged the broader market down with it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Lacing up. Despite intensifying competition, Nike (NYSE:NKE) surprises investors with better than expected results. As demands grows in key markets around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Ten years ago, the iPhone revolution began, and it changed pretty much everything about how we live our lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, June 29th.</p><p>Good evening, everybody. And welcome.</p><p>Tech stocks take a tumble. The sector that has soared past all others this year came under renewed selling today led by the mega caps, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Weakness in technology put a dumper on the rally if financial shares which were higher following the results of the stress test that we told you about last night.</p><p>Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 167 points to 21287. It had been down more than 250 points midday. The Nasdaq dropped 90, almost 1-1/2 percent. And S&amp;P 500 was off 21.</p><p>And although today`s pullback may look concerning, it might not be as bad as it appears.</p><p>Bob Pisani explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Today was anything but a sleepy summer day for the stock market. The Dow plummeted as much as 257 points before recovering to end down 167 points, largely weighed down by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as tech stocks took another drubbing.</p><p>But for the moment, this doesn`t look so much like the start of a broader sell off as it does a healthy rotation. Investors are moving money out over-owned semi conductor stocks and the big tech names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and into under-loved and beaten off sectors like banks and energy. Those were the only two sectors in the green today and there`s some reason for that.</p><p>Bank stocks for example bounced after the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of all 34 banks under review in the second round of its bank stress test. That hasn`t happened since the financial crisis back in 2008. They`re raising all of the dividends.</p><p>Energy stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) traded higher because crude oil price are drifting back up towards a $45 a barrel mark. And beyond that, the price of copper, a key industrial precious metal, has risen about 3 percent this week and bond yields are also up 5 percent to levels not seen since May, for the reflation trade here.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It looks like a slam dunk quarter for Nike (NYSE:NKE). The world`s largest sportswear maker reported better than expected earnings. Even in the face of increasing competition. The Dow component earned 60 cents in the most recent quarter, 10 cents above estimates. Revenue up 5 percent from a year ago to more than $8.5 billion. Investors liked the result, sending the stock hire in initial afterhours trading as you see right there.</p><p>Susan Li has more on Nike`s quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Back to their winning ways it seems for Nike (NYSE:NKE) after revenues came up short last quarterly earnings. The North American market which had been lagging Nike`s international business so far this year showing signs of life in the quarter with revenues slightly higher than expected, while emerging market sales were slightly less than anticipated and in just a few day`s time.</p><p>The world`s largest apparel maker is finally expected to sell their goods directly Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), something Nike (NYSE:NKE) had resisted for a long time, but now recognizing the change in consumer habits, so the swish maker is finally embracing online direct selling.</p><p>Nike (NYSE:NKE) also announcing recently, a reduction in their headcount by just around 2 percent. So, that`s about a thousand jobs being cut. And they`re also reducing the number of styles they sell by a quarter in an effort to streamline their operations.</p><p>But if there was a weaker point in this report card, it`s in the inventories, going up 4 percent in the three months, where as we saw a decline in the previous quarter. And some see inventories as maybe a sign into the strength of sales.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Susan Li.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, what does Nike`s earnings beat mean for the stock and your investments?</p><p>Eric Ervin is president and CEO of Reality Shares and he joins us now to discuss that.</p><p>Welcome, Eric. It`s nice to have you here.</p><p>ERIC ERVIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, REALITY SHARES: Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA: So, let`s start, first of all, with the report and I know your index owns the stock. Would you be adding to your position at this point?</p><p>ERVIN: Yes. So, we`re a systematic investor. So, at Reality Shares, we have to follow the rules. But the reason that Nike (NYSE:NKE) made it into the indexes because of its strong history of dividend growth, as well its future potential for growth. And if anything, this was just a sign that`s going to continue into the future.</p><p>So, for individual investors thinking about how do I protect my investments over time but also grow my income, Nike`s the perfect positioning for them.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, as you look at some of the numbers in the report, Susan Li just pointed out that inventory was up about 4 percent. That was something that one of the analysts we spoke to earlier today was very concerned about. He said watch the inventory number. If it`s growing if in line with sales and this looks like it`s roughly in line, OK, but we`d rather see it going down a little bit. Does that number give you any concern?</p><p>ERVIN: No. And actually to that point, I think as long as it`s growing in line or better or you know, shrinking, then both of those are good.</p><p>With Nike (NYSE:NKE), I think the biggest thing people have to concern themselves about right now is international. I mean, imagine if you could have owned Nike (NYSE:NKE) 20 years ago as they were penetrating the U.S. basketball market, look at the emerging market sales just in this quarter alone. It was up almost 21 percent. That`s going to continue as we see this emerging market consumer just get wealthier and more sophisticated in their buying habits.</p><p>HERERA: You listed a couple of things that you think will help the stock going forward. One of which is the upcoming World Cup.</p><p>ERVIN: Yes, not just the upcoming World Cup, but the Olympics as well. You know, so the Olympics are going to corporate this three-by-three format, which is very popular in China, incredibly popular, and Nike (NYSE:NKE) owns basketball. They just dominate.</p><p>So, not only do we have soccer, but we also have this global presence with the basketball. It`s going to be very strong for Nike (NYSE:NKE).</p><p>MATHISEN: The three-by-three is a new basketball format. Not so big in the U.S., but bigger around the world.</p><p>What about the U.S. competitive situation? You know, Adidas has been doing very nicely. Under Armour (NYSE:UA) has hit some speed bumps. They don`t own the space, but they`re certainly dominant Nike (NYSE:NKE), that is.</p><p>ERVIN: Yes. I think -- I was on about two quarters ago and one of the things I said was you never want to throw in the towel in Nike (NYSE:NKE). That was when everyone was talking about how Under Armour (NYSE:UA) was going to come in and start gobbling up market share. Nike (NYSE:NKE) just continues to innovate and create new products and they really are a fashion that doesn`t go out of style because they constantly figure out ways to talk to their consumer and to surprise them and delight them. And that`s what they`re going to continue to do here in this market.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, thank you, Eric, for joining us.</p><p>Eric Ervin --</p><p>ERVIN: You bet. Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: -- with Reality Shares.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, there`s good news and some less good news on economic growth. First the good, gross domestic product grew by more than expected, at 1.4 percent in the first quarter. This is the final reading on it now.</p><p>Now the bad news: economy grew at just 1.4 percent. The reading was the worst since the second quarter of last year. The White House wants to see the economy grow upwards at 3 percent, a growth rate that has been achieved in the U.S. since the 1990s.</p><p>HERERA: A Federal Reserve official does not support raising short-term interest rates again this year. James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said the current level of interest rates is appropriate for a low growth, low inflation economy. And that he does not think the decline in the unemployment rate would push up inflation all that dramatically.</p><p>MATHISEN: The multibillion dollar merger between two of the nation`s largest drugstores has fallen apart, but not completely. Walgreens scrapping its takeover for rival Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) and instead, will buy about half of its. That sent shares of Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) down 26 percent, Walgreens up slightly.</p><p>Bertha Coombs has more on this unusual move.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Walgreens and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) say they decided to scrap their nearly $9.5 billion merger deal because after 18 months of negotiating with regulators, it was clear the deal would be blocked.</p><p>JOHN STANDLEY, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, RITE AIDE CORPORATION: Based upon feedback that we have received from the FTC that led us to believe that the FTC would not approve the consummation of the merger.</p><p>COOMBS: Instead, Walgreens will buy about 2,200 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stores for around $5 billion and will give Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) access to drugs at a bigger discount through Walgreens wholesalers.</p><p>STEFANO PESSINA, CEO, WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE: I am pleased to have once again being proved right in my firm belief that, as the English say, where there is a will, there is a way. That two willing partners can despite adversity find a deal that delivers benefit for both. .</p><p>COOMBS: The firms say they structured the new deal around the antitrust issues raised during their merger process, but analysts say the FTC may still have concerns about consolidation.</p><p>EVAN HOFFMAN, IBISWORLD ANALYST: There could be some difficulty because it doesn`t give Walgreens some more negotiation leverage in terms of negotiating drug prices, things of that nature. It also gives them kind of a competitive edge and grows their market share in the industry beyond what they already have and they`re already the largest player there.</p><p>COOMBS: Walgreens CEO says this smaller deal will still help the company achieve the growth it needs. An environment that could even get more challenging with reports Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now exploring the pharmacy business. Though Walgreens` chief expressed doubt.</p><p>PESSINA: I don`t believe that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be interested in the near future, in the next few years, in these markets because they have so many opportunities, around the world and many categories which are much, much simpler than health care, which is a very regulated business.</p><p>COOMBS: Rite Aid`s CEO laughed when asked about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but said everyone in the industry is looking at selling prescriptions beyond the pharmacy counters.</p><p>STANDLEY: I think all of us retailers have, you know, been trying to figure out how to crack the code on that kind of economic model.</p><p>COOMBS: If approved, the firms expect the new deal to close within six months.</p><p>Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, lawmakers are considering changing the way Americans save for retirement.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The Treasury Department is taking new steps to increase economic pressure on North Korea. It is targeting a few Chinese entities including small bank that allegedly acts as a conduit for illicit North Korean financial activity, including facilitating transactions for the country`s ballistics weapons program. Secretary Steven Mnuchin made it clear the focus is on North Korea, not China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: We look forward to continuing working closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving North Korea. We are in no way targeting China with these actions. We will be meeting with China and other countries of G-20 next week to further our efforts to cut off North Korea`s illicit activities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The White House also confirmed that President Trump will meet with Russian President Putin at the G-20 gathering of world leaders.</p><p>MATHISEN: Republican senators are now negotiating changes to health care legislation that would overhaul the industry. According to reports, lawmakers are considering keeping the Affordable Care Act`s tax on investment income. The nearly 4 percent tax would ensure there is funding for subsidies for consumers who acquire insurance. According to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" no final decision has been reached.</p><p>HERERA: Wall Street, as you know, has been focused on the prospect of tax reform, a key part of the Trump agenda. And there is talk about potential changes that could change the way you save for retirement.</p><p>Ylan Mui has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The fight over tax reform is starting to get personal. Much of the debate here in Washington has focused on the need to overhaul the corporate tax code. But a new coalition of consumers and industry groups is calling attention to the prospect for major changes for individuals, particularly when it comes to retirement.</p><p>(voice-over): That`s because the taxes you get to defer on retirement savings are worth $584 billion in federal revenue through 2020.</p><p>Former Congressman Jim McCrery works with the Save Our Savings Coalition. He called that a piggy bank that`s tough for lawmakers to resist.</p><p>JIM MCCRERY, SAVE OUR SAVINGS COALITION: Retirement security pot of money is pretty big, in the United States. So if policymakers are looking for revenue, to do a revenue neutral tax bill, for example, it`s a logical place for them to look. .</p><p>MUI: In other words, if Washington wants to cut taxes, it needs to find a way to pay for it. Among the proposals the coalition is concerned about, limiting deductions for 401(k)s and IRAs, lowering the cap on how much individuals can contribute and creating a new after-tax universal savings account.</p><p>Romina Boccia is a policy expert from the conservative Heritage Foundation. She said that Americans should be open to new ways to save for retirement.</p><p>ROMINA BOCCIA, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Universal (NYSE:UVV) savings account which has been proposed by Dave Brat and Jeff Flake, it allows them to participate in our requirement savings system, while still being able to gain access to those funds when they need them without having to pay a tax penalty.</p><p>MUI: Now, a spokeswoman for the House tax writing committee did say that 401(k)s remain a critical savings tool. The White House has also said it would preserve the 401(k) deduction.</p><p>But the coalition is still worried there`s wiggle room in those promises. Seventy-five percent of private sector workers have access to a retirement plan. So, any change to the system could be felt far and wide, and no one can guarantee that retirement will be golden.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui, in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And to read more about how tax reform could potentially change the way we save for retirement, you can head to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>MATHISEN: Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) sees better earnings on tap and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The liquor company raised its earnings outlook for the year following a better than expected profit, helped in large part by strong beer sales. Overall, revenue rose, but it wasn`t enough however to beat expectations. Still, shares up 5 percent to $192.79.</p><p>The food giant Conagra saw its profit rise. It`s the maker of Slim Jims and Reddi-wip, do not combine the two. They don`t go well together. They cut cost and shed low margin products. Those results as well as total sales matched analysts` estimates.</p><p>The company said it would buy back an additional 1 billion in shares. That`s lot of Slim Jims. But shares took a hit because of Conagra`s lower than expected margins, and a 2018 profit forecast that was below many analyst`s projections. Shares were off about 3-1/2 percent at $36.08.</p><p>The meal delivery service, almost said male delivery service. The meal delivery service Blue Apron began trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, pricing its IPO at $10 a share, on the button. That was much lower that the company`s initial range of $15 to $17 a share.</p><p>The company`s CEO says he still sees a lot of growth potential.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT SALZBERG, BLUE APRON CEO: One of the big opportunities for Blue Apron quite frankly going forward is to even grow that revenue generation for customers by going into new categories, so we can sell more products to the same customers we`ve already acquired and deliver and develop new products for some of the customers today that we don`t currently serve.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. So, they opened at $10 a share. And they closed at $10 a share. Ending the day flat.</p><p>HERERA: Twenty-First Century Fox`s nearly $12 billion deal to buy the rest of European broadcaster Sky hit a roadblock today. British regulators raised concerns that billionaire Fox owner, Rupert Murdoch, would have too much control over the U.K. media. The deal will be examined by Britain`s regulators. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox rose 8 cents to $28.19.</p><p>The spice maker McCormick (NYSE:MKC) said acquisitions and new product demand helped the company report higher than expected revenue. Profit also came in ahead of forecast, but the company slashed its guidance for annual operating income and earnings per share. And that sent shares lower by 3 percent to $95.36.</p><p>And the semiconductor maker Micron Technologies said cost cuts and improved prices of memory chips helped sales grow and top estimates. The company also beat earnings expectations and gave guidance for the current quarter above forecasts. The shares were initially flat in after-hours trading but ended the regular session down 2 percent $31.47.</p><p>MATHISEN: After calling Connecticut home for more than 160 years, Aetna (NYSE:AET) is relocating its corporate headquarters to New York City. The move comes as Connecticut faces budget deficit problems. The insurance giant said it does plan to retain thousands of employees at its Hartford campus. But it also noted that could change down the road depending on the state`s economic health.</p><p>HERERA: New York City apartment prices get a new high. According to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" apartment sales in the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 20 percent in the second quarter compared to last year, making it the strongest second quarter since 2008. The report noted that buying activity though may be getting too cool as there are less new home contracts being signed.</p><p>MATHISEN: The infrastructure in the country`s largest city is in such poor shape that the governor declared a state of emergency. Andrew Cuomo of New York plans to sign an executive order to accelerate efforts to improve the city`s subway system and its service, including in this, needed repairs and cars and other equipment. There have been lots of derailments lately.</p><p>The governor pledged to direct an additional billion dollars for capital improvement. This comes just days after a subway train derailed, increasing concerns that the system is not just unreliable and not on time, but unsafe.</p><p>HERERA: Meantime, across the country in Los Angeles, a tunneling start up began digging under the city to create a transportation network. Elon Musk`s venture called the Boring Company, just completed the first segment of the tunnel in L.A. Last month, Musk said that the first tunnel would run from the airport known as LAX to Culver City, Santa Monica, Westwood and Sherman Oaks. The plan calls for other tunnels to cover more of the greater L.A. area.</p><p>MATHISEN: Maybe he wants to consider the name of the Boring Company. I don`t know.</p><p>Coming up, in 10 years, the iPhone has transformed the way we live. It`s created whole industries, disrupted businesses. So, what`s next for the smart phone?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Artificial intelligence will add nearly $16 trillion to the global economy. According to a new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, that is the equivalent of boosting global GDP by as much as 14 percent by the year 2030. The technology would increase productivity and spur shoppers to spend more. The report calculates that shoppers driven to work by autonomous cars will use their extra time and resources to buy more higher quality goods.</p><p>HERERA: Ten years ago, people lined up to buy the first iPhone. No one knew then what we would know now, and that is that it would change the way we live and it would change the business world. It created entire industries while crippling some others.</p><p>Josh Lipton takes a look at the device`s impact on just about everything.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE JOBS, FORMER CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, APPLE: An iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator. An iPod, a phone. Are you getting it?</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Not even Steve Jobs could have known just how transformative this device could be. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has sold more than 1 billion iPhones and its flagship product now accounts for the majority of its sales.</p><p>The iPhone didn`t just reinvent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The product upended and redefined many markets. It put an end to the flip phone and it made the once ubiquitous BlackBerry all but obsolete. It also created an app economy that is now valued at more than $1 trillion and it`s the App Store that helped fuel the growth of so many young, mobile first companies from Snap to Uber.</p><p>(on camera): So, what do consumers want to see from the iPhone 10 years from now?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Facetime should be multi-way, like conference call.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It should be able to test for carcinogens (ph) in the air, carcinogens in the food, making sure that air quality is good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would not like it to be integrated to the human body yet. I heard some people say it will happen.</p><p>LIPTON: This anniversary comes at a critical time for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). With iPhone sales coming off their first year of decline, but investors have high hopes for that latest version of the iPhone expected in the fall.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Apple`s smart phone is by some accounts, the mother of all smartphones and a game changer for the industry. But with so many smartphone makers in the market, what will this mean for the future of the smartphone? And will it be even around in 10 years as we know it today?</p><p>Scott Stein is senior editor at CNET and he joins us now to discuss.</p><p>Scott, I heard someone say that the -- ultimately, the smartphone won`t even have a phone.</p><p>SCOTT STEIN, CNET SR. EDITOR: Well, that`s the question is. Will you still be looking at a screen? I feel like that`s the part that could end up looking really old-fashioned. As these devices connect easily to other things, do you want to be looking at the screen or do you want to be looking at the thing that connects to. And I think that`s the proposition you see in smart home --</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, if it connects to my refrigerator, I don`t want to look at my refrigerator. I`d rather look at the screen.</p><p>STEIN: Yes, I know. Me too.</p><p>But, you know, I think the idea of carrying a huge phone around with me is not always that appealing. I would like it be able to, you know, be smaller in some ways. I think it`s kind of ballooned in size and in ambition.</p><p>The other question, too, is how much of that will be controlled outside of screens. I mean, you see a lot of voice connected stuff and I feel like that has is ups and downs, and it`s probably hitting a wall as far as how many things you can do with it.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also is challenged as far as you know, the idea of artificial intelligence, can they rise up against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others and provide and prove to be a powerhouse in the A.I. field. Also, what you can do with a screen and a phone, possibly augmented reality, which is what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is going towards. Now, is that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEIN: Go ahead.</p><p>HERERA: Let me go back to something that you mentioned and that is the voice controlled technology. Like the Alexas that are in the house. That seems to be the most immediate challenge to me, to the iPhone and the other smartphone makers. How do they either integrate that, go around it, enterprise things that are better than that?</p><p>STEIN: It`s a good question. I think it`s a huge challenge. I mean, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri has a lot of issues. It doesn`t work well for me a lot of the time.</p><p>And there`s also a war going on in voice-controlled tech where, you know, whether you`re using Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), you`re picking one ecosystem and you can`t talk to multiple A.I.s at once or multiple voices like you can launch apps. So, you know, that`s something -- and if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launches more than one device, which they will, with home pod sitting in the home and listening.</p><p>How do you handle, how do you talk and have one thing listen or have it do things in an intelligent way. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs to tackle that and everyone else needs to as well.</p><p>MATHISEN: Very quickly, the iPhone 8 is supposed to come out later this year. What do you expect to see on it and will the changes be really evolutionary and incremental, or they could be revolutionary?</p><p>STEIN: I think a lot of focus is going to be on the camera. Augmented reality is something that Tim Cook and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are talking a lot about, and that`s going to be in OS. But the camera could actually enable some more 3D scanning type capabilities. I would think that they would push that maybe for the idea of -- combined with A.I. to identify things, to feel like a lens on the world, and to explore how it can map and navigate your world.</p><p>MATHISEN: Right.</p><p>STEIN: That could be used in other types of tech, too. Sure, larger screen and contactless, you know, wireless charging, but I think the camera could stand the most improvements.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Scott, thanks very much. Appreciate your time.</p><p>STEIN: Yes, thanks.</p><p>MATHISEN: We`ll check back with you. Scott Stein with CNET.</p><p>HERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well. Have a great evening, everybody.

The best  performing sector of the year so far has another rough day and dragged the  broader market down with it.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Lacing up.  Despite  intensifying competition, Nike (NYSE:NKE) surprises investors with better  than expected results.  As demands grows in key markets around the world.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Ten years ago, the iPhone revolution began, and it changed pretty  much everything about how we live our lives.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  June 29th.  </p><p>Good evening, everybody.  And welcome.  </p><p>Tech stocks take a tumble.  The sector that has soared past all others this  year came under renewed selling today led by the mega caps, Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Weakness in technology put a dumper on the rally if  financial shares which were higher following the results of the stress test  that we told you about last night.  </p><p>Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 167 points to 21287.  It had  been down more than 250 points midday.  The Nasdaq dropped 90, almost 1-1/2  percent.  And S&amp;P 500 was off 21.  </p><p>And although today's pullback may look concerning, it might not be as bad  as it appears.  </p><p>Bob Pisani explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Today was anything but  a sleepy summer day for the stock market.  The Dow plummeted as much as 257  points before recovering to end down 167 points, largely weighed down by  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as tech stocks took another drubbing.  </p><p>But for the moment, this doesn't look so much like the start of a broader  sell off as it does a healthy rotation.  Investors are moving money out  over-owned semi conductor stocks and the big tech names like Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and into  under-loved and beaten off sectors like banks and energy.  Those were the  only two sectors in the green today and there's some reason for that.  </p><p>Bank stocks for example bounced after the Federal Reserve approved the  capital plans of all 34 banks under review in the second round of its bank  stress test.  That hasn't happened since the financial crisis back in 2008.   They're raising all of the dividends. </p><p>Energy stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) traded higher because crude oil price  are drifting back up towards a $45 a barrel mark.  And beyond that, the  price of copper, a key industrial precious metal, has risen about 3 percent  this week and bond yields are also up 5 percent to levels not seen since  May, for the reflation trade here.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It looks like a slam dunk quarter for Nike (NYSE:NKE).  The  world's largest sportswear maker reported better than expected earnings.   Even in the face of increasing competition.  The Dow component earned 60  cents in the most recent quarter, 10 cents above estimates.  Revenue up 5  percent from a year ago to more than $8.5 billion.  Investors liked the  result, sending the stock hire in initial afterhours trading as you see  right there.  </p><p>Susan Li has more on Nike's quarter. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Back to their winning  ways it seems for Nike (NYSE:NKE) after revenues came up short last  quarterly earnings.  The North American market which had been lagging  Nike's international business so far this year showing signs of life in the  quarter with revenues slightly higher than expected, while emerging market  sales were slightly less than anticipated and in just a few day's time.  </p><p>The world's largest apparel maker is finally expected to sell their goods  directly Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), something Nike (NYSE:NKE) had resisted for a  long time, but now recognizing the change in consumer habits, so the swish  maker is finally embracing online direct selling.  </p><p>Nike (NYSE:NKE) also announcing recently, a reduction in their headcount by  just around 2 percent.  So, that's about a thousand jobs being cut.  And  they're also reducing the number of styles they sell by a quarter in an  effort to streamline their operations. </p><p>But if there was a weaker point in this report card, it's in the  inventories, going up 4 percent in the three months, where as we saw a  decline in the previous quarter.  And some see inventories as maybe a sign  into the strength of sales.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Susan Li. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, what does Nike's earnings beat mean for the stock and your  investments?  </p><p>Eric Ervin is president and CEO of Reality Shares and he joins us now to  discuss that.  </p><p>Welcome, Eric.  It's nice to have you here.  </p><p>ERIC ERVIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, REALITY SHARES:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  So, let's start, first of all, with the report and I know your  index owns the stock.  Would you be adding to your position at this point?  </p><p>ERVIN:  Yes.  So, we're a systematic investor.  So, at Reality Shares, we  have to follow the rules.  But the reason that Nike (NYSE:NKE) made it into  the indexes because of its strong history of dividend growth, as well its  future potential for growth.  And if anything, this was just a sign that's  going to continue into the future.  </p><p>So, for individual investors thinking about how do I protect my investments  over time but also grow my income, Nike's the perfect positioning for them.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, as you look at some of the numbers in the report,  Susan Li just pointed out that inventory was up about 4 percent.  That was  something that one of the analysts we spoke to earlier today was very  concerned about.  He said watch the inventory number.  If it's growing if  in line with sales and this looks like it's roughly in line, OK, but we'd  rather see it going down a little bit.  Does that number give you any  concern?</p><p>ERVIN:  No.  And actually to that point, I think as long as it's growing in  line or better or you know, shrinking, then both of those are good.  </p><p>With Nike (NYSE:NKE), I think the biggest thing people have to concern  themselves about right now is international.  I mean, imagine if you could  have owned Nike (NYSE:NKE) 20 years ago as they were penetrating the U.S.  basketball market, look at the emerging market sales just in this quarter  alone.  It was up almost 21 percent.  That's going to continue as we see  this emerging market consumer just get wealthier and more sophisticated in  their buying habits.  </p><p>HERERA:  You listed a couple of things that you think will help the stock  going forward.  One of which is the upcoming World Cup.  </p><p>ERVIN:  Yes, not just the upcoming World Cup, but the Olympics as well.   You know, so the Olympics are going to corporate this three-by-three  format, which is very popular in China, incredibly popular, and Nike  (NYSE:NKE) owns basketball.  They just dominate. </p><p>So, not only do we have soccer, but we also have this global presence with  the basketball.  It's going to be very strong for Nike (NYSE:NKE).</p><p>MATHISEN:  The three-by-three is a new basketball format.  Not so big in  the U.S., but bigger around the world.  </p><p>What about the U.S. competitive situation?  You know, Adidas has been doing  very nicely.  Under Armour (NYSE:UA) has hit some speed bumps.  They don't  own the space, but they're certainly dominant Nike (NYSE:NKE), that is.  </p><p>ERVIN:  Yes.  I think -- I was on about two quarters ago and one of the  things I said was you never want to throw in the towel in Nike (NYSE:NKE).   That was when everyone was talking about how Under Armour (NYSE:UA) was  going to come in and start gobbling up market share.  Nike (NYSE:NKE) just  continues to innovate and create new products and they really are a fashion  that doesn't go out of style because they constantly figure out ways to  talk to their consumer and to surprise them and delight them.  And that's  what they're going to continue to do here in this market.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, thank you, Eric, for joining us.  </p><p>Eric Ervin -- </p><p>ERVIN:  You bet.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  -- with Reality Shares.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, there's good news and some less good news on economic  growth.  First the good, gross domestic product grew by more than expected,  at 1.4 percent in the first quarter.  This is the final reading on it now.  </p><p>Now the bad news: economy grew at just 1.4 percent.  The reading was the  worst since the second quarter of last year.  The White House wants to see  the economy grow upwards at 3 percent, a growth rate that has been achieved  in the U.S. since the 1990s.  </p><p>HERERA:  A Federal Reserve official does not support raising short-term  interest rates again this year.  James Bullard, president of the St. Louis  Fed, said the current level of interest rates is appropriate for a low  growth, low inflation economy.  And that he does not think the decline in  the unemployment rate would push up inflation all that dramatically.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The multibillion dollar merger between two of the nation's  largest drugstores has fallen apart, but not completely.  Walgreens  scrapping its takeover for rival Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) and instead, will buy  about half of its.  That sent shares of Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) down 26  percent, Walgreens up slightly.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs has more on this unusual move.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Walgreens and Rite  Aid (NYSE:RAD) say they decided to scrap their nearly $9.5 billion merger  deal because after 18 months of negotiating with regulators, it was clear  the deal would be blocked.  </p><p>JOHN STANDLEY, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, RITE AIDE CORPORATION:  Based upon feedback  that we have received from the FTC that led us to believe that the FTC  would not approve the consummation of the merger.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Instead, Walgreens will buy about 2,200 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stores  for around $5 billion and will give Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) access to drugs at  a bigger discount through Walgreens wholesalers.  </p><p>STEFANO PESSINA, CEO, WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE:  I am pleased to have once  again being proved right in my firm belief that, as the English say, where  there is a will, there is a way.  That two willing partners can despite  adversity find a deal that delivers benefit for both.  .  </p><p>COOMBS:  The firms say they structured the new deal around the antitrust  issues raised during their merger process, but analysts say the FTC may  still have concerns about consolidation.  </p><p>EVAN HOFFMAN, IBISWORLD ANALYST:  There could be some difficulty because it  doesn't give Walgreens some more negotiation leverage in terms of  negotiating drug prices, things of that nature.  It also gives them kind of  a competitive edge and grows their market share in the industry beyond what  they already have and they're already the largest player there.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Walgreens CEO says this smaller deal will still help the company  achieve the growth it needs.  An environment that could even get more  challenging with reports Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now exploring the pharmacy  business.  Though Walgreens' chief expressed doubt.  </p><p>PESSINA:  I don't believe that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be interested in  the near future, in the next few years, in these markets because they have  so many opportunities, around the world and many categories which are much,  much simpler than health care, which is a very regulated business.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Rite Aid's CEO laughed when asked about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but  said everyone in the industry is looking at selling prescriptions beyond  the pharmacy counters.  </p><p>STANDLEY:  I think all of us retailers have, you know, been trying to  figure out how to crack the code on that kind of economic model.  </p><p>COOMBS:  If approved, the firms expect the new deal to close within six  months.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, lawmakers are considering changing the way Americans  save for retirement.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The Treasury Department is taking new steps to increase economic  pressure on North Korea.  It is targeting a few Chinese entities including  small bank that allegedly acts as a conduit for illicit North Korean  financial activity, including facilitating transactions for the country's  ballistics weapons program.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin made it clear the  focus is on North Korea, not China.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We look forward to continuing working  closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving  North Korea.  We are in no way targeting China with these actions.  We will  be meeting with China and other countries of G-20 next week to further our  efforts to cut off North Korea's illicit activities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The White House also confirmed that President Trump will meet with  Russian President Putin at the G-20 gathering of world leaders.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Republican senators are now negotiating changes to health care  legislation that would overhaul the industry.  According to reports,  lawmakers are considering keeping the Affordable Care Act's tax on  investment income.  The nearly 4 percent tax would ensure there is funding  for subsidies for consumers who acquire insurance.  According to the \"Wall  Street Journal,\" no final decision has been reached.  </p><p>HERERA:  Wall Street, as you know, has been focused on the prospect of tax  reform, a key part of the Trump agenda.  And there is talk about potential  changes that could change the way you save for retirement.  </p><p>Ylan Mui has the details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The fight over tax reform  is starting to get personal.  Much of the debate here in Washington has  focused on the need to overhaul the corporate tax code.  But a new  coalition of consumers and industry groups is calling attention to the  prospect for major changes for individuals, particularly when it comes to  retirement.  </p><p>(voice-over):  That's because the taxes you get to defer on retirement  savings are worth $584 billion in federal revenue through 2020.  </p><p>Former Congressman Jim McCrery works with the Save Our Savings Coalition.   He called that a piggy bank that's tough for lawmakers to resist.  </p><p>JIM MCCRERY, SAVE OUR SAVINGS COALITION:  Retirement security pot of money  is pretty big, in the United States.  So if policymakers are looking for  revenue, to do a revenue neutral tax bill, for example, it's a logical  place for them to look.  .  </p><p>MUI:  In other words, if Washington wants to cut taxes, it needs to find a  way to pay for it.  Among the proposals the coalition is concerned about,  limiting deductions for 401(k)s and IRAs, lowering the cap on how much  individuals can contribute and creating a new after-tax universal savings  account.  </p><p>Romina Boccia is a policy expert from the conservative Heritage Foundation.   She said that Americans should be open to new ways to save for retirement.  </p><p>ROMINA BOCCIA, HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  Universal (NYSE:UVV) savings account  which has been proposed by Dave Brat and Jeff Flake, it allows them to  participate in our requirement savings system, while still being able to  gain access to those funds when they need them without having to pay a tax  penalty.  </p><p>MUI:  Now, a spokeswoman for the House tax writing committee did say that  401(k)s remain a critical savings tool.  The White House has also said it  would preserve the 401(k) deduction.  </p><p>But the coalition is still worried there's wiggle room in those promises.   Seventy-five percent of private sector workers have access to a retirement  plan.  So, any change to the system could be felt far and wide, and no one  can guarantee that retirement will be golden.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Ylan Mui, in Washington. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And to read more about how tax reform could potentially change the  way we save for retirement, you can head to our Web site, NBR.com.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) sees better earnings on tap and  that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The liquor company raised its earnings outlook for the year following a  better than expected profit, helped in large part by strong beer sales.   Overall, revenue rose, but it wasn't enough however to beat expectations.   Still, shares up 5 percent to $192.79.  </p><p>The food giant Conagra saw its profit rise.  It's the maker of Slim Jims  and Reddi-wip, do not combine the two.  They don't go well together.  They  cut cost and shed low margin products.  Those results as well as total  sales matched analysts' estimates. </p><p>The company said it would buy back an additional 1 billion in shares.   That's lot of Slim Jims.  But shares took a hit because of Conagra's lower  than expected margins, and a 2018 profit forecast that was below many  analyst's projections.  Shares were off about 3-1/2 percent at $36.08.  </p><p>The meal delivery service, almost said male delivery service.  The meal  delivery service Blue Apron began trading on the New York Stock Exchange  today, pricing its IPO at $10 a share, on the button.  That was much lower  that the company's initial range of $15 to $17 a share. </p><p>The company's CEO says he still sees a lot of growth potential.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT SALZBERG, BLUE APRON CEO:  One of the big opportunities for Blue Apron  quite frankly going forward is to even grow that revenue generation for  customers by going into new categories, so we can sell more products to the  same customers we've already acquired and deliver and develop new products  for some of the customers today that we don't currently serve.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  So, they opened at $10 a share.  And they closed at  $10 a share.  Ending the day flat.</p><p>HERERA:  Twenty-First Century Fox's nearly $12 billion deal to buy the rest  of European broadcaster Sky hit a roadblock today.  British regulators  raised concerns that billionaire Fox owner, Rupert Murdoch, would have too  much control over the U.K. media.  The deal will be examined by Britain's  regulators.  Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox rose 8 cents to $28.19.  </p><p>The spice maker McCormick (NYSE:MKC) said acquisitions and new product  demand helped the company report higher than expected revenue.  Profit also  came in ahead of forecast, but the company slashed its guidance for annual  operating income and earnings per share.  And that sent shares lower by 3  percent to $95.36. </p><p>And the semiconductor maker Micron Technologies said cost cuts and improved  prices of memory chips helped sales grow and top estimates.  The company  also beat earnings expectations and gave guidance for the current quarter  above forecasts.  The shares were initially flat in after-hours trading but  ended the regular session down 2 percent $31.47.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  After calling Connecticut home for more than 160 years, Aetna  (NYSE:AET) is relocating its corporate headquarters to New York City.  The  move comes as Connecticut faces budget deficit problems.  The insurance  giant said it does plan to retain thousands of employees at its Hartford  campus.  But it also noted that could change down the road depending on the  state's economic health.  </p><p>HERERA:  New York City apartment prices get a new high.  According to the  \"Wall Street Journal,\" apartment sales in the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose  20 percent in the second quarter compared to last year, making it the  strongest second quarter since 2008.  The report noted that buying activity  though may be getting too cool as there are less new home contracts being  signed.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The infrastructure in the country's largest city is in such poor  shape that the governor declared a state of emergency.  Andrew Cuomo of New  York plans to sign an executive order to accelerate efforts to improve the  city's subway system and its service, including in this, needed repairs and  cars and other equipment.  There have been lots of derailments lately.  </p><p>The governor pledged to direct an additional billion dollars for capital  improvement.  This comes just days after a subway train derailed,  increasing concerns that the system is not just unreliable and not on time,  but unsafe.  </p><p>HERERA:  Meantime, across the country in Los Angeles, a tunneling start up  began digging under the city to create a transportation network.  Elon  Musk's venture called the Boring Company, just completed the first segment  of the tunnel in L.A.  Last month, Musk said that the first tunnel would  run from the airport known as LAX to Culver City, Santa Monica, Westwood  and Sherman Oaks.  The plan calls for other tunnels to cover more of the  greater L.A. area.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Maybe he wants to consider the name of the Boring Company.  I  don't know.  </p><p>Coming up, in 10 years, the iPhone has transformed the way we live.  It's  created whole industries, disrupted businesses.  So, what's next for the  smart phone?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Artificial intelligence will add nearly $16 trillion to the  global economy.  According to a new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, that  is the equivalent of boosting global GDP by as much as 14 percent by the  year 2030.  The technology would increase productivity and spur shoppers to  spend more.  The report calculates that shoppers driven to work by  autonomous cars will use their extra time and resources to buy more higher  quality goods.  </p><p>HERERA:  Ten years ago, people lined up to buy the first iPhone.  No one  knew then what we would know now, and that is that it would change the way  we live and it would change the business world.  It created entire  industries while crippling some others.  </p><p>Josh Lipton takes a look at the device's impact on just about everything.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE JOBS, FORMER CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  An iPod, a phone, and an  Internet communicator.  An iPod, a phone.  Are you getting it?  </p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Not even  Steve Jobs could have known just how transformative this device could be.   Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has sold more than 1 billion iPhones and its flagship  product now accounts for the majority of its sales.  </p><p>The iPhone didn't just reinvent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  The product upended  and redefined many markets.  It put an end to the flip phone and it made  the once ubiquitous BlackBerry all but obsolete.  It also created an app  economy that is now valued at more than $1 trillion and it's the App Store  that helped fuel the growth of so many young, mobile first companies from  Snap to Uber.</p><p>(on camera):  So, what do consumers want to see from the iPhone 10 years  from now?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Facetime should be multi-way, like conference call.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It should be able to test for carcinogens (ph) in the  air, carcinogens in the food, making sure that air quality is good.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would not like it to be integrated to the human body  yet.  I heard some people say it will happen.</p><p>LIPTON:  This anniversary comes at a critical time for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).   With iPhone sales coming off their first year of decline, but investors  have high hopes for that latest version of the iPhone expected in the fall. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Apple's smart phone is by some accounts, the mother of all  smartphones and a game changer for the industry.  But with so many  smartphone makers in the market, what will this mean for the future of the  smartphone?  And will it be even around in 10 years as we know it today? </p><p>Scott Stein is senior editor at CNET and he joins us now to discuss.  </p><p>Scott, I heard someone say that the -- ultimately, the smartphone won't  even have a phone.  </p><p>SCOTT STEIN, CNET SR. EDITOR:  Well, that's the question is.  Will you  still be looking at a screen?  I feel like that's the part that could end  up looking really old-fashioned.  As these devices connect easily to other  things, do you want to be looking at the screen or do you want to be  looking at the thing that connects to.  And I think that's the proposition  you see in smart home -- </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, if it connects to my refrigerator, I don't want to look at  my refrigerator.  I'd rather look at the screen.  </p><p>STEIN:  Yes, I know.  Me too. </p><p>But, you know, I think the idea of carrying a huge phone around with me is  not always that appealing.  I would like it be able to, you know, be  smaller in some ways.  I think it's kind of ballooned in size and in  ambition.  </p><p>The other question, too, is how much of that will be controlled outside of  screens.  I mean, you see a lot of voice connected stuff and I feel like  that has is ups and downs, and it's probably hitting a wall as far as how  many things you can do with it. </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also is challenged as far as you know, the idea of  artificial intelligence, can they rise up against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG),  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others and provide and prove to be a powerhouse in  the A.I. field.  Also, what you can do with a screen and a phone, possibly  augmented reality, which is what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is going towards.   Now, is that --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEIN:  Go ahead.  </p><p>HERERA:  Let me go back to something that you mentioned and that is the  voice controlled technology.  Like the Alexas that are in the house.  That  seems to be the most immediate challenge to me, to the iPhone and the other  smartphone makers.  How do they either integrate that, go around it,  enterprise things that are better than that?  </p><p>STEIN:  It's a good question.  I think it's a huge challenge.  I mean,  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri has a lot of issues.  It doesn't work well for me  a lot of the time.  </p><p>And there's also a war going on in voice-controlled tech where, you know,  whether you're using Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), you're picking one ecosystem and you can't talk to multiple  A.I.s at once or multiple voices like you can launch apps.  So, you know,  that's something -- and if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launches more than one  device, which they will, with home pod sitting in the home and listening.  </p><p>How do you handle, how do you talk and have one thing listen or have it do  things in an intelligent way.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs to tackle that and  everyone else needs to as well.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Very quickly, the iPhone 8 is supposed to come out later this  year.  What do you expect to see on it and will the changes be really  evolutionary and incremental, or they could be revolutionary?  </p><p>STEIN:  I think a lot of focus is going to be on the camera.  Augmented  reality is something that Tim Cook and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are talking a  lot about, and that's going to be in OS.  But the camera could actually  enable some more 3D scanning type capabilities.  I would think that they  would push that maybe for the idea of -- combined with A.I. to identify  things, to feel like a lens on the world, and to explore how it can map and  navigate your world.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Right. </p><p>STEIN:  That could be used in other types of tech, too.  Sure, larger  screen and contactless, you know, wireless charging, but I think the camera  could stand the most improvements.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Scott, thanks very much.  Appreciate your time.  </p><p>STEIN:  Yes, thanks. </p><p>MATHISEN:  We'll check back with you.  Scott Stein with CNET.</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a great  evening, everybody.  We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The best  performing sector of the year so far has another rough day and dragged the  broader market down with it.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Lacing up.  Despite  intensifying competition, Nike (NYSE:NKE) surprises investors with better  than expected results.  As demands grows in key markets around the world.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Ten years ago, the iPhone revolution began, and it changed pretty  much everything about how we live our lives.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  June 29th.  </p><p>Good evening, everybody.  And welcome.  </p><p>Tech stocks take a tumble.  The sector that has soared past all others this  year came under renewed selling today led by the mega caps, Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Weakness in technology put a dumper on the rally if  financial shares which were higher following the results of the stress test  that we told you about last night.  </p><p>Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 167 points to 21287.  It had  been down more than 250 points midday.  The Nasdaq dropped 90, almost 1-1/2  percent.  And S&amp;P 500 was off 21.  </p><p>And although today's pullback may look concerning, it might not be as bad  as it appears.  </p><p>Bob Pisani explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Today was anything but  a sleepy summer day for the stock market.  The Dow plummeted as much as 257  points before recovering to end down 167 points, largely weighed down by  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as tech stocks took another drubbing.  </p><p>But for the moment, this doesn't look so much like the start of a broader  sell off as it does a healthy rotation.  Investors are moving money out  over-owned semi conductor stocks and the big tech names like Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and into  under-loved and beaten off sectors like banks and energy.  Those were the  only two sectors in the green today and there's some reason for that.  </p><p>Bank stocks for example bounced after the Federal Reserve approved the  capital plans of all 34 banks under review in the second round of its bank  stress test.  That hasn't happened since the financial crisis back in 2008.   They're raising all of the dividends. </p><p>Energy stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) traded higher because crude oil price  are drifting back up towards a $45 a barrel mark.  And beyond that, the  price of copper, a key industrial precious metal, has risen about 3 percent  this week and bond yields are also up 5 percent to levels not seen since  May, for the reflation trade here.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It looks like a slam dunk quarter for Nike (NYSE:NKE).  The  world's largest sportswear maker reported better than expected earnings.   Even in the face of increasing competition.  The Dow component earned 60  cents in the most recent quarter, 10 cents above estimates.  Revenue up 5  percent from a year ago to more than $8.5 billion.  Investors liked the  result, sending the stock hire in initial afterhours trading as you see  right there.  </p><p>Susan Li has more on Nike's quarter. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Back to their winning  ways it seems for Nike (NYSE:NKE) after revenues came up short last  quarterly earnings.  The North American market which had been lagging  Nike's international business so far this year showing signs of life in the  quarter with revenues slightly higher than expected, while emerging market  sales were slightly less than anticipated and in just a few day's time.  </p><p>The world's largest apparel maker is finally expected to sell their goods  directly Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), something Nike (NYSE:NKE) had resisted for a  long time, but now recognizing the change in consumer habits, so the swish  maker is finally embracing online direct selling.  </p><p>Nike (NYSE:NKE) also announcing recently, a reduction in their headcount by  just around 2 percent.  So, that's about a thousand jobs being cut.  And  they're also reducing the number of styles they sell by a quarter in an  effort to streamline their operations. </p><p>But if there was a weaker point in this report card, it's in the  inventories, going up 4 percent in the three months, where as we saw a  decline in the previous quarter.  And some see inventories as maybe a sign  into the strength of sales.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Susan Li. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, what does Nike's earnings beat mean for the stock and your  investments?  </p><p>Eric Ervin is president and CEO of Reality Shares and he joins us now to  discuss that.  </p><p>Welcome, Eric.  It's nice to have you here.  </p><p>ERIC ERVIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, REALITY SHARES:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  So, let's start, first of all, with the report and I know your  index owns the stock.  Would you be adding to your position at this point?  </p><p>ERVIN:  Yes.  So, we're a systematic investor.  So, at Reality Shares, we  have to follow the rules.  But the reason that Nike (NYSE:NKE) made it into  the indexes because of its strong history of dividend growth, as well its  future potential for growth.  And if anything, this was just a sign that's  going to continue into the future.  </p><p>So, for individual investors thinking about how do I protect my investments  over time but also grow my income, Nike's the perfect positioning for them.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, as you look at some of the numbers in the report,  Susan Li just pointed out that inventory was up about 4 percent.  That was  something that one of the analysts we spoke to earlier today was very  concerned about.  He said watch the inventory number.  If it's growing if  in line with sales and this looks like it's roughly in line, OK, but we'd  rather see it going down a little bit.  Does that number give you any  concern?</p><p>ERVIN:  No.  And actually to that point, I think as long as it's growing in  line or better or you know, shrinking, then both of those are good.  </p><p>With Nike (NYSE:NKE), I think the biggest thing people have to concern  themselves about right now is international.  I mean, imagine if you could  have owned Nike (NYSE:NKE) 20 years ago as they were penetrating the U.S.  basketball market, look at the emerging market sales just in this quarter  alone.  It was up almost 21 percent.  That's going to continue as we see  this emerging market consumer just get wealthier and more sophisticated in  their buying habits.  </p><p>HERERA:  You listed a couple of things that you think will help the stock  going forward.  One of which is the upcoming World Cup.  </p><p>ERVIN:  Yes, not just the upcoming World Cup, but the Olympics as well.   You know, so the Olympics are going to corporate this three-by-three  format, which is very popular in China, incredibly popular, and Nike  (NYSE:NKE) owns basketball.  They just dominate. </p><p>So, not only do we have soccer, but we also have this global presence with  the basketball.  It's going to be very strong for Nike (NYSE:NKE).</p><p>MATHISEN:  The three-by-three is a new basketball format.  Not so big in  the U.S., but bigger around the world.  </p><p>What about the U.S. competitive situation?  You know, Adidas has been doing  very nicely.  Under Armour (NYSE:UA) has hit some speed bumps.  They don't  own the space, but they're certainly dominant Nike (NYSE:NKE), that is.  </p><p>ERVIN:  Yes.  I think -- I was on about two quarters ago and one of the  things I said was you never want to throw in the towel in Nike (NYSE:NKE).   That was when everyone was talking about how Under Armour (NYSE:UA) was  going to come in and start gobbling up market share.  Nike (NYSE:NKE) just  continues to innovate and create new products and they really are a fashion  that doesn't go out of style because they constantly figure out ways to  talk to their consumer and to surprise them and delight them.  And that's  what they're going to continue to do here in this market.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, thank you, Eric, for joining us.  </p><p>Eric Ervin -- </p><p>ERVIN:  You bet.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  -- with Reality Shares.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, there's good news and some less good news on economic  growth.  First the good, gross domestic product grew by more than expected,  at 1.4 percent in the first quarter.  This is the final reading on it now.  </p><p>Now the bad news: economy grew at just 1.4 percent.  The reading was the  worst since the second quarter of last year.  The White House wants to see  the economy grow upwards at 3 percent, a growth rate that has been achieved  in the U.S. since the 1990s.  </p><p>HERERA:  A Federal Reserve official does not support raising short-term  interest rates again this year.  James Bullard, president of the St. Louis  Fed, said the current level of interest rates is appropriate for a low  growth, low inflation economy.  And that he does not think the decline in  the unemployment rate would push up inflation all that dramatically.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The multibillion dollar merger between two of the nation's  largest drugstores has fallen apart, but not completely.  Walgreens  scrapping its takeover for rival Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) and instead, will buy  about half of its.  That sent shares of Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) down 26  percent, Walgreens up slightly.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs has more on this unusual move.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Walgreens and Rite  Aid (NYSE:RAD) say they decided to scrap their nearly $9.5 billion merger  deal because after 18 months of negotiating with regulators, it was clear  the deal would be blocked.  </p><p>JOHN STANDLEY, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, RITE AIDE CORPORATION:  Based upon feedback  that we have received from the FTC that led us to believe that the FTC  would not approve the consummation of the merger.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Instead, Walgreens will buy about 2,200 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stores  for around $5 billion and will give Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) access to drugs at  a bigger discount through Walgreens wholesalers.  </p><p>STEFANO PESSINA, CEO, WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE:  I am pleased to have once  again being proved right in my firm belief that, as the English say, where  there is a will, there is a way.  That two willing partners can despite  adversity find a deal that delivers benefit for both.  .  </p><p>COOMBS:  The firms say they structured the new deal around the antitrust  issues raised during their merger process, but analysts say the FTC may  still have concerns about consolidation.  </p><p>EVAN HOFFMAN, IBISWORLD ANALYST:  There could be some difficulty because it  doesn't give Walgreens some more negotiation leverage in terms of  negotiating drug prices, things of that nature.  It also gives them kind of  a competitive edge and grows their market share in the industry beyond what  they already have and they're already the largest player there.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Walgreens CEO says this smaller deal will still help the company  achieve the growth it needs.  An environment that could even get more  challenging with reports Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now exploring the pharmacy  business.  Though Walgreens' chief expressed doubt.  </p><p>PESSINA:  I don't believe that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be interested in  the near future, in the next few years, in these markets because they have  so many opportunities, around the world and many categories which are much,  much simpler than health care, which is a very regulated business.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Rite Aid's CEO laughed when asked about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but  said everyone in the industry is looking at selling prescriptions beyond  the pharmacy counters.  </p><p>STANDLEY:  I think all of us retailers have, you know, been trying to  figure out how to crack the code on that kind of economic model.  </p><p>COOMBS:  If approved, the firms expect the new deal to close within six  months.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, lawmakers are considering changing the way Americans  save for retirement.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The Treasury Department is taking new steps to increase economic  pressure on North Korea.  It is targeting a few Chinese entities including  small bank that allegedly acts as a conduit for illicit North Korean  financial activity, including facilitating transactions for the country's  ballistics weapons program.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin made it clear the  focus is on North Korea, not China.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We look forward to continuing working  closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving  North Korea.  We are in no way targeting China with these actions.  We will  be meeting with China and other countries of G-20 next week to further our  efforts to cut off North Korea's illicit activities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The White House also confirmed that President Trump will meet with  Russian President Putin at the G-20 gathering of world leaders.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Republican senators are now negotiating changes to health care  legislation that would overhaul the industry.  According to reports,  lawmakers are considering keeping the Affordable Care Act's tax on  investment income.  The nearly 4 percent tax would ensure there is funding  for subsidies for consumers who acquire insurance.  According to the \"Wall  Street Journal,\" no final decision has been reached.  </p><p>HERERA:  Wall Street, as you know, has been focused on the prospect of tax  reform, a key part of the Trump agenda.  And there is talk about potential  changes that could change the way you save for retirement.  </p><p>Ylan Mui has the details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The fight over tax reform  is starting to get personal.  Much of the debate here in Washington has  focused on the need to overhaul the corporate tax code.  But a new  coalition of consumers and industry groups is calling attention to the  prospect for major changes for individuals, particularly when it comes to  retirement.  </p><p>(voice-over):  That's because the taxes you get to defer on retirement  savings are worth $584 billion in federal revenue through 2020.  </p><p>Former Congressman Jim McCrery works with the Save Our Savings Coalition.   He called that a piggy bank that's tough for lawmakers to resist.  </p><p>JIM MCCRERY, SAVE OUR SAVINGS COALITION:  Retirement security pot of money  is pretty big, in the United States.  So if policymakers are looking for  revenue, to do a revenue neutral tax bill, for example, it's a logical  place for them to look.  .  </p><p>MUI:  In other words, if Washington wants to cut taxes, it needs to find a  way to pay for it.  Among the proposals the coalition is concerned about,  limiting deductions for 401(k)s and IRAs, lowering the cap on how much  individuals can contribute and creating a new after-tax universal savings  account.  </p><p>Romina Boccia is a policy expert from the conservative Heritage Foundation.   She said that Americans should be open to new ways to save for retirement.  </p><p>ROMINA BOCCIA, HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  Universal (NYSE:UVV) savings account  which has been proposed by Dave Brat and Jeff Flake, it allows them to  participate in our requirement savings system, while still being able to  gain access to those funds when they need them without having to pay a tax  penalty.  </p><p>MUI:  Now, a spokeswoman for the House tax writing committee did say that  401(k)s remain a critical savings tool.  The White House has also said it  would preserve the 401(k) deduction.  </p><p>But the coalition is still worried there's wiggle room in those promises.   Seventy-five percent of private sector workers have access to a retirement  plan.  So, any change to the system could be felt far and wide, and no one  can guarantee that retirement will be golden.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Ylan Mui, in Washington. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And to read more about how tax reform could potentially change the  way we save for retirement, you can head to our Web site, NBR.com.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) sees better earnings on tap and  that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The liquor company raised its earnings outlook for the year following a  better than expected profit, helped in large part by strong beer sales.   Overall, revenue rose, but it wasn't enough however to beat expectations.   Still, shares up 5 percent to $192.79.  </p><p>The food giant Conagra saw its profit rise.  It's the maker of Slim Jims  and Reddi-wip, do not combine the two.  They don't go well together.  They  cut cost and shed low margin products.  Those results as well as total  sales matched analysts' estimates. </p><p>The company said it would buy back an additional 1 billion in shares.   That's lot of Slim Jims.  But shares took a hit because of Conagra's lower  than expected margins, and a 2018 profit forecast that was below many  analyst's projections.  Shares were off about 3-1/2 percent at $36.08.  </p><p>The meal delivery service, almost said male delivery service.  The meal  delivery service Blue Apron began trading on the New York Stock Exchange  today, pricing its IPO at $10 a share, on the button.  That was much lower  that the company's initial range of $15 to $17 a share. </p><p>The company's CEO says he still sees a lot of growth potential.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT SALZBERG, BLUE APRON CEO:  One of the big opportunities for Blue Apron  quite frankly going forward is to even grow that revenue generation for  customers by going into new categories, so we can sell more products to the  same customers we've already acquired and deliver and develop new products  for some of the customers today that we don't currently serve.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  So, they opened at $10 a share.  And they closed at  $10 a share.  Ending the day flat.</p><p>HERERA:  Twenty-First Century Fox's nearly $12 billion deal to buy the rest  of European broadcaster Sky hit a roadblock today.  British regulators  raised concerns that billionaire Fox owner, Rupert Murdoch, would have too  much control over the U.K. media.  The deal will be examined by Britain's  regulators.  Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox rose 8 cents to $28.19.  </p><p>The spice maker McCormick (NYSE:MKC) said acquisitions and new product  demand helped the company report higher than expected revenue.  Profit also  came in ahead of forecast, but the company slashed its guidance for annual  operating income and earnings per share.  And that sent shares lower by 3  percent to $95.36. </p><p>And the semiconductor maker Micron Technologies said cost cuts and improved  prices of memory chips helped sales grow and top estimates.  The company  also beat earnings expectations and gave guidance for the current quarter  above forecasts.  The shares were initially flat in after-hours trading but  ended the regular session down 2 percent $31.47.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  After calling Connecticut home for more than 160 years, Aetna  (NYSE:AET) is relocating its corporate headquarters to New York City.  The  move comes as Connecticut faces budget deficit problems.  The insurance  giant said it does plan to retain thousands of employees at its Hartford  campus.  But it also noted that could change down the road depending on the  state's economic health.  </p><p>HERERA:  New York City apartment prices get a new high.  According to the  \"Wall Street Journal,\" apartment sales in the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose  20 percent in the second quarter compared to last year, making it the  strongest second quarter since 2008.  The report noted that buying activity  though may be getting too cool as there are less new home contracts being  signed.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The infrastructure in the country's largest city is in such poor  shape that the governor declared a state of emergency.  Andrew Cuomo of New  York plans to sign an executive order to accelerate efforts to improve the  city's subway system and its service, including in this, needed repairs and  cars and other equipment.  There have been lots of derailments lately.  </p><p>The governor pledged to direct an additional billion dollars for capital  improvement.  This comes just days after a subway train derailed,  increasing concerns that the system is not just unreliable and not on time,  but unsafe.  </p><p>HERERA:  Meantime, across the country in Los Angeles, a tunneling start up  began digging under the city to create a transportation network.  Elon  Musk's venture called the Boring Company, just completed the first segment  of the tunnel in L.A.  Last month, Musk said that the first tunnel would  run from the airport known as LAX to Culver City, Santa Monica, Westwood  and Sherman Oaks.  The plan calls for other tunnels to cover more of the  greater L.A. area.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Maybe he wants to consider the name of the Boring Company.  I  don't know.  </p><p>Coming up, in 10 years, the iPhone has transformed the way we live.  It's  created whole industries, disrupted businesses.  So, what's next for the  smart phone?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Artificial intelligence will add nearly $16 trillion to the  global economy.  According to a new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, that  is the equivalent of boosting global GDP by as much as 14 percent by the  year 2030.  The technology would increase productivity and spur shoppers to  spend more.  The report calculates that shoppers driven to work by  autonomous cars will use their extra time and resources to buy more higher  quality goods.  </p><p>HERERA:  Ten years ago, people lined up to buy the first iPhone.  No one  knew then what we would know now, and that is that it would change the way  we live and it would change the business world.  It created entire  industries while crippling some others.  </p><p>Josh Lipton takes a look at the device's impact on just about everything.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE JOBS, FORMER CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  An iPod, a phone, and an  Internet communicator.  An iPod, a phone.  Are you getting it?  </p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Not even  Steve Jobs could have known just how transformative this device could be.   Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has sold more than 1 billion iPhones and its flagship  product now accounts for the majority of its sales.  </p><p>The iPhone didn't just reinvent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  The product upended  and redefined many markets.  It put an end to the flip phone and it made  the once ubiquitous BlackBerry all but obsolete.  It also created an app  economy that is now valued at more than $1 trillion and it's the App Store  that helped fuel the growth of so many young, mobile first companies from  Snap to Uber.</p><p>(on camera):  So, what do consumers want to see from the iPhone 10 years  from now?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Facetime should be multi-way, like conference call.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It should be able to test for carcinogens (ph) in the  air, carcinogens in the food, making sure that air quality is good.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would not like it to be integrated to the human body  yet.  I heard some people say it will happen.</p><p>LIPTON:  This anniversary comes at a critical time for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).   With iPhone sales coming off their first year of decline, but investors  have high hopes for that latest version of the iPhone expected in the fall. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Apple's smart phone is by some accounts, the mother of all  smartphones and a game changer for the industry.  But with so many  smartphone makers in the market, what will this mean for the future of the  smartphone?  And will it be even around in 10 years as we know it today? </p><p>Scott Stein is senior editor at CNET and he joins us now to discuss.  </p><p>Scott, I heard someone say that the -- ultimately, the smartphone won't  even have a phone.  </p><p>SCOTT STEIN, CNET SR. EDITOR:  Well, that's the question is.  Will you  still be looking at a screen?  I feel like that's the part that could end  up looking really old-fashioned.  As these devices connect easily to other  things, do you want to be looking at the screen or do you want to be  looking at the thing that connects to.  And I think that's the proposition  you see in smart home -- </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, if it connects to my refrigerator, I don't want to look at  my refrigerator.  I'd rather look at the screen.  </p><p>STEIN:  Yes, I know.  Me too. </p><p>But, you know, I think the idea of carrying a huge phone around with me is  not always that appealing.  I would like it be able to, you know, be  smaller in some ways.  I think it's kind of ballooned in size and in  ambition.  </p><p>The other question, too, is how much of that will be controlled outside of  screens.  I mean, you see a lot of voice connected stuff and I feel like  that has is ups and downs, and it's probably hitting a wall as far as how  many things you can do with it. </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also is challenged as far as you know, the idea of  artificial intelligence, can they rise up against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG),  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others and provide and prove to be a powerhouse in  the A.I. field.  Also, what you can do with a screen and a phone, possibly  augmented reality, which is what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is going towards.   Now, is that --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEIN:  Go ahead.  </p><p>HERERA:  Let me go back to something that you mentioned and that is the  voice controlled technology.  Like the Alexas that are in the house.  That  seems to be the most immediate challenge to me, to the iPhone and the other  smartphone makers.  How do they either integrate that, go around it,  enterprise things that are better than that?  </p><p>STEIN:  It's a good question.  I think it's a huge challenge.  I mean,  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri has a lot of issues.  It doesn't work well for me  a lot of the time.  </p><p>And there's also a war going on in voice-controlled tech where, you know,  whether you're using Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), you're picking one ecosystem and you can't talk to multiple  A.I.s at once or multiple voices like you can launch apps.  So, you know,  that's something -- and if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launches more than one  device, which they will, with home pod sitting in the home and listening.  </p><p>How do you handle, how do you talk and have one thing listen or have it do  things in an intelligent way.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs to tackle that and  everyone else needs to as well.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Very quickly, the iPhone 8 is supposed to come out later this  year.  What do you expect to see on it and will the changes be really  evolutionary and incremental, or they could be revolutionary?  </p><p>STEIN:  I think a lot of focus is going to be on the camera.  Augmented  reality is something that Tim Cook and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are talking a  lot about, and that's going to be in OS.  But the camera could actually  enable some more 3D scanning type capabilities.  I would think that they  would push that maybe for the idea of -- combined with A.I. to identify  things, to feel like a lens on the world, and to explore how it can map and  navigate your world.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Right. </p><p>STEIN:  That could be used in other types of tech, too.  Sure, larger  screen and contactless, you know, wireless charging, but I think the camera  could stand the most improvements.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Scott, thanks very much.  Appreciate your time.  </p><p>STEIN:  Yes, thanks. </p><p>MATHISEN:  We'll check back with you.  Scott Stein with CNET.</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a great  evening, everybody.  We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The best  performing sector of the year so far has another rough day and dragged the  broader market down with it.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Lacing up.  Despite  intensifying competition, Nike (NYSE:NKE) surprises investors with better  than expected results.  As demands grows in key markets around the world.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Ten years ago, the iPhone revolution began, and it changed pretty  much everything about how we live our lives.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  June 29th.  </p><p>Good evening, everybody.  And welcome.  </p><p>Tech stocks take a tumble.  The sector that has soared past all others this  year came under renewed selling today led by the mega caps, Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG).  Weakness in technology put a dumper on the rally if  financial shares which were higher following the results of the stress test  that we told you about last night.  </p><p>Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 167 points to 21287.  It had  been down more than 250 points midday.  The Nasdaq dropped 90, almost 1-1/2  percent.  And S&amp;P 500 was off 21.  </p><p>And although today's pullback may look concerning, it might not be as bad  as it appears.  </p><p>Bob Pisani explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Today was anything but  a sleepy summer day for the stock market.  The Dow plummeted as much as 257  points before recovering to end down 167 points, largely weighed down by  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as tech stocks took another drubbing.  </p><p>But for the moment, this doesn't look so much like the start of a broader  sell off as it does a healthy rotation.  Investors are moving money out  over-owned semi conductor stocks and the big tech names like Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and into  under-loved and beaten off sectors like banks and energy.  Those were the  only two sectors in the green today and there's some reason for that.  </p><p>Bank stocks for example bounced after the Federal Reserve approved the  capital plans of all 34 banks under review in the second round of its bank  stress test.  That hasn't happened since the financial crisis back in 2008.   They're raising all of the dividends. </p><p>Energy stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) traded higher because crude oil price  are drifting back up towards a $45 a barrel mark.  And beyond that, the  price of copper, a key industrial precious metal, has risen about 3 percent  this week and bond yields are also up 5 percent to levels not seen since  May, for the reflation trade here.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It looks like a slam dunk quarter for Nike (NYSE:NKE).  The  world's largest sportswear maker reported better than expected earnings.   Even in the face of increasing competition.  The Dow component earned 60  cents in the most recent quarter, 10 cents above estimates.  Revenue up 5  percent from a year ago to more than $8.5 billion.  Investors liked the  result, sending the stock hire in initial afterhours trading as you see  right there.  </p><p>Susan Li has more on Nike's quarter. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Back to their winning  ways it seems for Nike (NYSE:NKE) after revenues came up short last  quarterly earnings.  The North American market which had been lagging  Nike's international business so far this year showing signs of life in the  quarter with revenues slightly higher than expected, while emerging market  sales were slightly less than anticipated and in just a few day's time.  </p><p>The world's largest apparel maker is finally expected to sell their goods  directly Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), something Nike (NYSE:NKE) had resisted for a  long time, but now recognizing the change in consumer habits, so the swish  maker is finally embracing online direct selling.  </p><p>Nike (NYSE:NKE) also announcing recently, a reduction in their headcount by  just around 2 percent.  So, that's about a thousand jobs being cut.  And  they're also reducing the number of styles they sell by a quarter in an  effort to streamline their operations. </p><p>But if there was a weaker point in this report card, it's in the  inventories, going up 4 percent in the three months, where as we saw a  decline in the previous quarter.  And some see inventories as maybe a sign  into the strength of sales.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Susan Li. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, what does Nike's earnings beat mean for the stock and your  investments?  </p><p>Eric Ervin is president and CEO of Reality Shares and he joins us now to  discuss that.  </p><p>Welcome, Eric.  It's nice to have you here.  </p><p>ERIC ERVIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, REALITY SHARES:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  So, let's start, first of all, with the report and I know your  index owns the stock.  Would you be adding to your position at this point?  </p><p>ERVIN:  Yes.  So, we're a systematic investor.  So, at Reality Shares, we  have to follow the rules.  But the reason that Nike (NYSE:NKE) made it into  the indexes because of its strong history of dividend growth, as well its  future potential for growth.  And if anything, this was just a sign that's  going to continue into the future.  </p><p>So, for individual investors thinking about how do I protect my investments  over time but also grow my income, Nike's the perfect positioning for them.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, as you look at some of the numbers in the report,  Susan Li just pointed out that inventory was up about 4 percent.  That was  something that one of the analysts we spoke to earlier today was very  concerned about.  He said watch the inventory number.  If it's growing if  in line with sales and this looks like it's roughly in line, OK, but we'd  rather see it going down a little bit.  Does that number give you any  concern?</p><p>ERVIN:  No.  And actually to that point, I think as long as it's growing in  line or better or you know, shrinking, then both of those are good.  </p><p>With Nike (NYSE:NKE), I think the biggest thing people have to concern  themselves about right now is international.  I mean, imagine if you could  have owned Nike (NYSE:NKE) 20 years ago as they were penetrating the U.S.  basketball market, look at the emerging market sales just in this quarter  alone.  It was up almost 21 percent.  That's going to continue as we see  this emerging market consumer just get wealthier and more sophisticated in  their buying habits.  </p><p>HERERA:  You listed a couple of things that you think will help the stock  going forward.  One of which is the upcoming World Cup.  </p><p>ERVIN:  Yes, not just the upcoming World Cup, but the Olympics as well.   You know, so the Olympics are going to corporate this three-by-three  format, which is very popular in China, incredibly popular, and Nike  (NYSE:NKE) owns basketball.  They just dominate. </p><p>So, not only do we have soccer, but we also have this global presence with  the basketball.  It's going to be very strong for Nike (NYSE:NKE).</p><p>MATHISEN:  The three-by-three is a new basketball format.  Not so big in  the U.S., but bigger around the world.  </p><p>What about the U.S. competitive situation?  You know, Adidas has been doing  very nicely.  Under Armour (NYSE:UA) has hit some speed bumps.  They don't  own the space, but they're certainly dominant Nike (NYSE:NKE), that is.  </p><p>ERVIN:  Yes.  I think -- I was on about two quarters ago and one of the  things I said was you never want to throw in the towel in Nike (NYSE:NKE).   That was when everyone was talking about how Under Armour (NYSE:UA) was  going to come in and start gobbling up market share.  Nike (NYSE:NKE) just  continues to innovate and create new products and they really are a fashion  that doesn't go out of style because they constantly figure out ways to  talk to their consumer and to surprise them and delight them.  And that's  what they're going to continue to do here in this market.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that note, thank you, Eric, for joining us.  </p><p>Eric Ervin -- </p><p>ERVIN:  You bet.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  -- with Reality Shares.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, there's good news and some less good news on economic  growth.  First the good, gross domestic product grew by more than expected,  at 1.4 percent in the first quarter.  This is the final reading on it now.  </p><p>Now the bad news: economy grew at just 1.4 percent.  The reading was the  worst since the second quarter of last year.  The White House wants to see  the economy grow upwards at 3 percent, a growth rate that has been achieved  in the U.S. since the 1990s.  </p><p>HERERA:  A Federal Reserve official does not support raising short-term  interest rates again this year.  James Bullard, president of the St. Louis  Fed, said the current level of interest rates is appropriate for a low  growth, low inflation economy.  And that he does not think the decline in  the unemployment rate would push up inflation all that dramatically.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The multibillion dollar merger between two of the nation's  largest drugstores has fallen apart, but not completely.  Walgreens  scrapping its takeover for rival Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) and instead, will buy  about half of its.  That sent shares of Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) down 26  percent, Walgreens up slightly.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs has more on this unusual move.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Walgreens and Rite  Aid (NYSE:RAD) say they decided to scrap their nearly $9.5 billion merger  deal because after 18 months of negotiating with regulators, it was clear  the deal would be blocked.  </p><p>JOHN STANDLEY, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, RITE AIDE CORPORATION:  Based upon feedback  that we have received from the FTC that led us to believe that the FTC  would not approve the consummation of the merger.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Instead, Walgreens will buy about 2,200 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stores  for around $5 billion and will give Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) access to drugs at  a bigger discount through Walgreens wholesalers.  </p><p>STEFANO PESSINA, CEO, WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE:  I am pleased to have once  again being proved right in my firm belief that, as the English say, where  there is a will, there is a way.  That two willing partners can despite  adversity find a deal that delivers benefit for both.  .  </p><p>COOMBS:  The firms say they structured the new deal around the antitrust  issues raised during their merger process, but analysts say the FTC may  still have concerns about consolidation.  </p><p>EVAN HOFFMAN, IBISWORLD ANALYST:  There could be some difficulty because it  doesn't give Walgreens some more negotiation leverage in terms of  negotiating drug prices, things of that nature.  It also gives them kind of  a competitive edge and grows their market share in the industry beyond what  they already have and they're already the largest player there.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Walgreens CEO says this smaller deal will still help the company  achieve the growth it needs.  An environment that could even get more  challenging with reports Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is now exploring the pharmacy  business.  Though Walgreens' chief expressed doubt.  </p><p>PESSINA:  I don't believe that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be interested in  the near future, in the next few years, in these markets because they have  so many opportunities, around the world and many categories which are much,  much simpler than health care, which is a very regulated business.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Rite Aid's CEO laughed when asked about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but  said everyone in the industry is looking at selling prescriptions beyond  the pharmacy counters.  </p><p>STANDLEY:  I think all of us retailers have, you know, been trying to  figure out how to crack the code on that kind of economic model.  </p><p>COOMBS:  If approved, the firms expect the new deal to close within six  months.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, lawmakers are considering changing the way Americans  save for retirement.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The Treasury Department is taking new steps to increase economic  pressure on North Korea.  It is targeting a few Chinese entities including  small bank that allegedly acts as a conduit for illicit North Korean  financial activity, including facilitating transactions for the country's  ballistics weapons program.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin made it clear the  focus is on North Korea, not China.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  We look forward to continuing working  closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving  North Korea.  We are in no way targeting China with these actions.  We will  be meeting with China and other countries of G-20 next week to further our  efforts to cut off North Korea's illicit activities.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The White House also confirmed that President Trump will meet with  Russian President Putin at the G-20 gathering of world leaders.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Republican senators are now negotiating changes to health care  legislation that would overhaul the industry.  According to reports,  lawmakers are considering keeping the Affordable Care Act's tax on  investment income.  The nearly 4 percent tax would ensure there is funding  for subsidies for consumers who acquire insurance.  According to the \"Wall  Street Journal,\" no final decision has been reached.  </p><p>HERERA:  Wall Street, as you know, has been focused on the prospect of tax  reform, a key part of the Trump agenda.  And there is talk about potential  changes that could change the way you save for retirement.  </p><p>Ylan Mui has the details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The fight over tax reform  is starting to get personal.  Much of the debate here in Washington has  focused on the need to overhaul the corporate tax code.  But a new  coalition of consumers and industry groups is calling attention to the  prospect for major changes for individuals, particularly when it comes to  retirement.  </p><p>(voice-over):  That's because the taxes you get to defer on retirement  savings are worth $584 billion in federal revenue through 2020.  </p><p>Former Congressman Jim McCrery works with the Save Our Savings Coalition.   He called that a piggy bank that's tough for lawmakers to resist.  </p><p>JIM MCCRERY, SAVE OUR SAVINGS COALITION:  Retirement security pot of money  is pretty big, in the United States.  So if policymakers are looking for  revenue, to do a revenue neutral tax bill, for example, it's a logical  place for them to look.  .  </p><p>MUI:  In other words, if Washington wants to cut taxes, it needs to find a  way to pay for it.  Among the proposals the coalition is concerned about,  limiting deductions for 401(k)s and IRAs, lowering the cap on how much  individuals can contribute and creating a new after-tax universal savings  account.  </p><p>Romina Boccia is a policy expert from the conservative Heritage Foundation.   She said that Americans should be open to new ways to save for retirement.  </p><p>ROMINA BOCCIA, HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  Universal (NYSE:UVV) savings account  which has been proposed by Dave Brat and Jeff Flake, it allows them to  participate in our requirement savings system, while still being able to  gain access to those funds when they need them without having to pay a tax  penalty.  </p><p>MUI:  Now, a spokeswoman for the House tax writing committee did say that  401(k)s remain a critical savings tool.  The White House has also said it  would preserve the 401(k) deduction.  </p><p>But the coalition is still worried there's wiggle room in those promises.   Seventy-five percent of private sector workers have access to a retirement  plan.  So, any change to the system could be felt far and wide, and no one  can guarantee that retirement will be golden.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Ylan Mui, in Washington. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And to read more about how tax reform could potentially change the  way we save for retirement, you can head to our Web site, NBR.com.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) sees better earnings on tap and  that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The liquor company raised its earnings outlook for the year following a  better than expected profit, helped in large part by strong beer sales.   Overall, revenue rose, but it wasn't enough however to beat expectations.   Still, shares up 5 percent to $192.79.  </p><p>The food giant Conagra saw its profit rise.  It's the maker of Slim Jims  and Reddi-wip, do not combine the two.  They don't go well together.  They  cut cost and shed low margin products.  Those results as well as total  sales matched analysts' estimates. </p><p>The company said it would buy back an additional 1 billion in shares.   That's lot of Slim Jims.  But shares took a hit because of Conagra's lower  than expected margins, and a 2018 profit forecast that was below many  analyst's projections.  Shares were off about 3-1/2 percent at $36.08.  </p><p>The meal delivery service, almost said male delivery service.  The meal  delivery service Blue Apron began trading on the New York Stock Exchange  today, pricing its IPO at $10 a share, on the button.  That was much lower  that the company's initial range of $15 to $17 a share. </p><p>The company's CEO says he still sees a lot of growth potential.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT SALZBERG, BLUE APRON CEO:  One of the big opportunities for Blue Apron  quite frankly going forward is to even grow that revenue generation for  customers by going into new categories, so we can sell more products to the  same customers we've already acquired and deliver and develop new products  for some of the customers today that we don't currently serve.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  So, they opened at $10 a share.  And they closed at  $10 a share.  Ending the day flat.</p><p>HERERA:  Twenty-First Century Fox's nearly $12 billion deal to buy the rest  of European broadcaster Sky hit a roadblock today.  British regulators  raised concerns that billionaire Fox owner, Rupert Murdoch, would have too  much control over the U.K. media.  The deal will be examined by Britain's  regulators.  Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox rose 8 cents to $28.19.  </p><p>The spice maker McCormick (NYSE:MKC) said acquisitions and new product  demand helped the company report higher than expected revenue.  Profit also  came in ahead of forecast, but the company slashed its guidance for annual  operating income and earnings per share.  And that sent shares lower by 3  percent to $95.36. </p><p>And the semiconductor maker Micron Technologies said cost cuts and improved  prices of memory chips helped sales grow and top estimates.  The company  also beat earnings expectations and gave guidance for the current quarter  above forecasts.  The shares were initially flat in after-hours trading but  ended the regular session down 2 percent $31.47.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  After calling Connecticut home for more than 160 years, Aetna  (NYSE:AET) is relocating its corporate headquarters to New York City.  The  move comes as Connecticut faces budget deficit problems.  The insurance  giant said it does plan to retain thousands of employees at its Hartford  campus.  But it also noted that could change down the road depending on the  state's economic health.  </p><p>HERERA:  New York City apartment prices get a new high.  According to the  \"Wall Street Journal,\" apartment sales in the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose  20 percent in the second quarter compared to last year, making it the  strongest second quarter since 2008.  The report noted that buying activity  though may be getting too cool as there are less new home contracts being  signed.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The infrastructure in the country's largest city is in such poor  shape that the governor declared a state of emergency.  Andrew Cuomo of New  York plans to sign an executive order to accelerate efforts to improve the  city's subway system and its service, including in this, needed repairs and  cars and other equipment.  There have been lots of derailments lately.  </p><p>The governor pledged to direct an additional billion dollars for capital  improvement.  This comes just days after a subway train derailed,  increasing concerns that the system is not just unreliable and not on time,  but unsafe.  </p><p>HERERA:  Meantime, across the country in Los Angeles, a tunneling start up  began digging under the city to create a transportation network.  Elon  Musk's venture called the Boring Company, just completed the first segment  of the tunnel in L.A.  Last month, Musk said that the first tunnel would  run from the airport known as LAX to Culver City, Santa Monica, Westwood  and Sherman Oaks.  The plan calls for other tunnels to cover more of the  greater L.A. area.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Maybe he wants to consider the name of the Boring Company.  I  don't know.  </p><p>Coming up, in 10 years, the iPhone has transformed the way we live.  It's  created whole industries, disrupted businesses.  So, what's next for the  smart phone?  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Artificial intelligence will add nearly $16 trillion to the  global economy.  According to a new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, that  is the equivalent of boosting global GDP by as much as 14 percent by the  year 2030.  The technology would increase productivity and spur shoppers to  spend more.  The report calculates that shoppers driven to work by  autonomous cars will use their extra time and resources to buy more higher  quality goods.  </p><p>HERERA:  Ten years ago, people lined up to buy the first iPhone.  No one  knew then what we would know now, and that is that it would change the way  we live and it would change the business world.  It created entire  industries while crippling some others.  </p><p>Josh Lipton takes a look at the device's impact on just about everything.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE JOBS, FORMER CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  An iPod, a phone, and an  Internet communicator.  An iPod, a phone.  Are you getting it?  </p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Not even  Steve Jobs could have known just how transformative this device could be.   Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has sold more than 1 billion iPhones and its flagship  product now accounts for the majority of its sales.  </p><p>The iPhone didn't just reinvent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  The product upended  and redefined many markets.  It put an end to the flip phone and it made  the once ubiquitous BlackBerry all but obsolete.  It also created an app  economy that is now valued at more than $1 trillion and it's the App Store  that helped fuel the growth of so many young, mobile first companies from  Snap to Uber.</p><p>(on camera):  So, what do consumers want to see from the iPhone 10 years  from now?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Facetime should be multi-way, like conference call.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It should be able to test for carcinogens (ph) in the  air, carcinogens in the food, making sure that air quality is good.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would not like it to be integrated to the human body  yet.  I heard some people say it will happen.</p><p>LIPTON:  This anniversary comes at a critical time for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).   With iPhone sales coming off their first year of decline, but investors  have high hopes for that latest version of the iPhone expected in the fall. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Apple's smart phone is by some accounts, the mother of all  smartphones and a game changer for the industry.  But with so many  smartphone makers in the market, what will this mean for the future of the  smartphone?  And will it be even around in 10 years as we know it today? </p><p>Scott Stein is senior editor at CNET and he joins us now to discuss.  </p><p>Scott, I heard someone say that the -- ultimately, the smartphone won't  even have a phone.  </p><p>SCOTT STEIN, CNET SR. EDITOR:  Well, that's the question is.  Will you  still be looking at a screen?  I feel like that's the part that could end  up looking really old-fashioned.  As these devices connect easily to other  things, do you want to be looking at the screen or do you want to be  looking at the thing that connects to.  And I think that's the proposition  you see in smart home -- </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, if it connects to my refrigerator, I don't want to look at  my refrigerator.  I'd rather look at the screen.  </p><p>STEIN:  Yes, I know.  Me too. </p><p>But, you know, I think the idea of carrying a huge phone around with me is  not always that appealing.  I would like it be able to, you know, be  smaller in some ways.  I think it's kind of ballooned in size and in  ambition.  </p><p>The other question, too, is how much of that will be controlled outside of  screens.  I mean, you see a lot of voice connected stuff and I feel like  that has is ups and downs, and it's probably hitting a wall as far as how  many things you can do with it. </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also is challenged as far as you know, the idea of  artificial intelligence, can they rise up against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG),  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others and provide and prove to be a powerhouse in  the A.I. field.  Also, what you can do with a screen and a phone, possibly  augmented reality, which is what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is going towards.   Now, is that --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEIN:  Go ahead.  </p><p>HERERA:  Let me go back to something that you mentioned and that is the  voice controlled technology.  Like the Alexas that are in the house.  That  seems to be the most immediate challenge to me, to the iPhone and the other  smartphone makers.  How do they either integrate that, go around it,  enterprise things that are better than that?  </p><p>STEIN:  It's a good question.  I think it's a huge challenge.  I mean,  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri has a lot of issues.  It doesn't work well for me  a lot of the time.  </p><p>And there's also a war going on in voice-controlled tech where, you know,  whether you're using Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL), you're picking one ecosystem and you can't talk to multiple  A.I.s at once or multiple voices like you can launch apps.  So, you know,  that's something -- and if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launches more than one  device, which they will, with home pod sitting in the home and listening.  </p><p>How do you handle, how do you talk and have one thing listen or have it do  things in an intelligent way.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs to tackle that and  everyone else needs to as well.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Very quickly, the iPhone 8 is supposed to come out later this  year.  What do you expect to see on it and will the changes be really  evolutionary and incremental, or they could be revolutionary?  </p><p>STEIN:  I think a lot of focus is going to be on the camera.  Augmented  reality is something that Tim Cook and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are talking a  lot about, and that's going to be in OS.  But the camera could actually  enable some more 3D scanning type capabilities.  I would think that they  would push that maybe for the idea of -- combined with A.I. to identify  things, to feel like a lens on the world, and to explore how it can map and  navigate your world.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Right. </p><p>STEIN:  That could be used in other types of tech, too.  Sure, larger  screen and contactless, you know, wireless charging, but I think the camera  could stand the most improvements.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Scott, thanks very much.  Appreciate your time.  </p><p>STEIN:  Yes, thanks. </p><p>MATHISEN:  We'll check back with you.  Scott Stein with CNET.</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.

The first half was marked by the return of volatility. Should investors expect more of the same in the second?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Oh, Canada. Our neighbor to the north moves ahead now with tariffs on U.S. products as tensions escalate with one of our closest allies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Market monitor. A top-rated fund manager who`s outperforming the market this year has a list of under-the-radar stocks he says are worth buying.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June 29th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you good Friday evening, everybody.</p><p>Stocks got a lift today as -- get this -- we closed out the week, the month, the quarter and the first half of this year. The market was helped by a big move higher in Dow component Nike (NYSE:NKE) following that strong earnings report that we told you about last night.</p><p>At its peak today, the Dow was up 293 points but that rally fizzled as the closing bell approached this afternoon. And when all was said and done, the Dow gained just 55 points to 24,271, the Nasdaq was up the six, the S&amp;P rose by two. And for the week, the major indexes were all lower.</p><p>So, now, we`re at the midway point of the year after a choppy six months on Wall Street, to say the least.</p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look now at what defined that first half and what may lie ahead for the second.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks worked their way to modest gains in the first half of 2018, but they did it the hard way. The biggest January surged in three decades gave way to a swift percent drop into February for the S&amp;P 500 index. Since then, the broad market has been recovering in a choppy, fitful pattern, finishing the first half with a gain of a bit more than 2 percent.</p><p>Among the issues investors have had to grapple with, a rise in interest rates to multi-year highs, a spurt in oil prices above $70 a barrel and a flare-up in tensions and tariff threats with America`s trading partners. These headwinds slowed the major indexes after a very strong 2017, but didn`t stop them. That`s thanks to a pickup in U.S. economic growth, strong consumer spending and record corporate profits, in part due to the December tax cut package.</p><p>In these opposing currents, some areas of the market have thrived others have struggled. Big tech stocks remain the clear leaders, driving the Nasdaq to nearly a nine percent gain. Energy also came to life, climbing almost 6 percent, and shares of smaller companies were favored as havens from a trade war, helping the Russell 2000 to a 7 percent first half rally.</p><p>On the downside, big industrial stocks suffered from the heated trade rhetoric, slipping some percent and pressuring the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a slim 1 percent loss for the first half, and consumer staples sank close to 10 percent on steady shortfalls and profits from big food and household product companies. The outlook for the second half of the year will hinge on how the Federal Reserve recedes with interest rate policies whether the trade issues need or some resolution and how much economic and corporate profit growth might slow toward year-end.</p><p>History shows that midterm election years are often choppy for stocks through the summer which is yet another complication.</p><p>But with profit growth set to rise close to 20 percent for the full year and stock valuations well off their January highs Wall Street`s bulls are betting that business conditions are sturdy enough to absorb some more political noise and perhaps even two more rate hikes from the Fed.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So let`s talk a little bit more about the second half with Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.</p><p>Good to see you again, Kristina. Welcome back.</p><p>KRISTINA HOOPER, CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO: Great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: We`ll the second half of the year do you think be marked by the type of disruption and volatility that has been characteristic of the first half?</p><p>KRISTINA HOOPER, INVESCO CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST: Absolutely. I think it`s very likely we`re going to see that because we have the same drivers in place, specifically monetary policy is being unwound, and this isn`t just ordinary monetary policy, this is experimental monetary policy. And so unwinding it is an experiment in and of itself.</p><p>What I think is going to happen is we`re going to see continued normalization of capital markets as we normalize that monetary policy.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You also see higher prices. You see a little slow roll. Is it enough that you would tell investors to start thinking about investing in traditional inflation hedges?</p><p>HOOPER: Traditional inflation hedges should always be part of an investor`s portfolio. So, if it isn`t, they should include it in there. And there`s a wide array of options from commodities to treasury inflation- protected securities, to income producing areas like dividends which have historically held up well in rising inflation environments. So, there`s a lot of options to choose from.</p><p>HERERA: What about going globally, Kristina? I mean, the U.S., you expect growth to slow a little bit certainly, but the trajectory is still higher. What about investing outside of the United States?</p><p>HOOPER: Well, if you were to have invested outside the U.S. in the first half of this year, you would have been disappointed relative to the U.S. It`s pretty much a sea of red year-to-date.</p><p>But having said that there are different drivers for different economies and markets and so it makes sense to be very well-diversified. Yesterday`s winners may not be tomorrow`s winners and so, we need to hedge our bets with diversification.</p><p>HERERA: Kristina, thank you so much as always. Kristina Hooper with Invesco.</p><p>Bill?</p><p>HOOPER: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And on this last day of the first half, a new report show that inflation has in fact hit the Fed`s target of 2 percent. It`s the first time the so-called PCE index, which is the Central Bank`s preferred inflation gauge, first time it`s hit that level in six years.</p><p>The acceleration and the inflation came despite a moderation in consumer spending though. Another report showed at 0.2 percent gained last month. That was below expectations. In fact, consumer spending is closely watched because it does account for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.</p><p>HERERA: But consumer sentiment improved slightly this month. According to the University of Michigan index, Americans are feeling better about the current state of the economy, but details of that report were mixed.</p><p>Americans lowered their expectations about the future with many citing trade and tariff concerns.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And those trade tensions were ratcheted up today when Canada said that it was moving ahead with tariffs on U.S. products.</p><p>Kayla Tausche is in Washington for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: One month after Canada started paying new tariffs to send steel and aluminum to the U.S., Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland flanked by steel workers says they`re striking back.</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: We are acting very much in sorrow not in anger. But the U.S. tariffs leave Canada no choice but to defend our industries, our workers and our communities.</p><p>TAUSCHE: Starting Sunday, U.S. ketchup, candy and toilet papers as well as steel and aluminum will see new fees at the border. Canada`s retaliation comes after similar actions from Europe, Mexico, and China, some $20 billion in U.S. goods targeted in all, from politically sensitive states like Pennsylvania and Kentucky.</p><p>This week, top U.S. trade official Robert Lighthizer called the retaliation unjustified, saying it showed blatant disregard for WTO rules, referring to the World Trade Organization which governs cross-border business. The White House believes its actions are WTO compliant but the counter punches are not.</p><p>The moves against the U.S. have bolstered President Trump`s disdain for the organization, a new report suggests he`ll move to withdraw. An outside advisor to the president says this may indeed be the catalyst.</p><p>Even Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser, an avowed free trader, has raised his own doubts.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: The World Trade Organization, for example, has become completely ineffectual and even when it makes decisions, even in the rare moments when it makes decisions, important countries don`t even abide by them.</p><p>TAUSCHE: President Trump believes the tariffs while painful for now are working.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Many countries are calling, saying, let`s negotiate. They were never doing that. They`re saying, let`s negotiate, please, please, we want to negotiate.</p><p>TAUSCHE: That strategy will be tested again next week. On July 6th, the U.S. will add new fees on $34 billion in Chinese imports, and China will add new tariffs in return. White House officials are telling businesses to expect those to go into effect, barring any last-minute deal.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: General Motors (NYSE:GM) warns that some of the tariffs on imported vehicles being considered by the Trump administration could lead to a, quote, smaller GM. The largest U.S. automaker also said that expansive tariffs risk isolating the company from the global market. In May, the White House launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat. Shares of GM were down more than 2-1/2 percent in today`s session.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Mexican voters are heading to the polls this Sunday in an election that could shift the political paradigm in that country and the results could have far-reaching implications for trade and business as well here in the U.S.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The next president of Mexico is likely to be a man who goes by the nickname AMLO. It`s an acronym for Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. He has run for president twice before, looks like the third time is going to be the charm because he is way out ahead in the polls.</p><p>He`s historically been known as a real radical leftist, sometimes he`s been compared to Hugo Chavez. This time around, during this campaign, he`s moved much more to the center even though he`s definitely left-leaning in his economics, right leaning in his social policies.</p><p>Some in the administration had been worried about his rise to power and had tried to push for NAFTA to be renegotiated before the election because they thought it might be tougher to get a deal done with AMLO in power.</p><p>There`s some thinking however that maybe it actually might be easier to get a deal done. He`s very much a nationalist and maybe the president might actually like him a little more than the current president of Mexico. Additionally, the U.S. would like Mexico to raise wages. Right now, manufacturing jobs down there pay only four dollars an hour compared to $39 an hour here in the United States, and that`s why so many companies often move their businesses down there, at least their manufacturing jobs down there.</p><p>AMLO pretty much agrees that we just should go up and so maybe there`s some place to find consensus there in a way that previously hadn`t been thought. Still, there`s a long way to go before the NAFTA negotiations are done.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>Walgreens was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies. The analyst cites new competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which we told you about yesterday. That the analyst says could weigh on future earnings. The price target is $65. The stock rose just a fraction to $60.02.</p><p>Nike`s price target was raised to $84 a share at Bernstein. The analyst cites the Dow component`s strong quarterly results. The firm maintains an overweight rating on that stock and it rallied 11 percent to $79.68.</p><p>GRIFFETH: A different analysts at Bernstein cut Diageo`s rating to market perform from outperform. The analysts there says he believes the rally in that stock has come to an end. Shares have risen about 19 percent in the past year. The firm also notes that the potential for some Diageo brands to face challenges in case of a global trade war breaking out. The stock rose one penny today $144.0.1.</p><p>Shares of KB Homes were upgraded to buy from underperform at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The analyst there says concerns surrounding the homebuilding sector are overblown. Price target $37. That stock rose 8 percent today to $27.24.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, fire sale. Why the young California cannabis industry is offering deep discounts to its customers.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: California has now passed the strictest online privacy law in the country. This law gives consumers sweeping control over their personal data and grants them to the right to know what information companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are collecting on them. The law takes effect in 2020.</p><p>HERERA: Also in California, new laws governing the cannabis industry take effect this weekend, and that means a lot of businesses are scrambling to sell inventory that won`t meet those new requirements.</p><p>Aditi Roy is in Berkeley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Marijuana is flying off the shelves at the Green Cross dispensary in San Francisco. The lines are long because the discounts are deep. Some cannabis products, up to 80 percent off.</p><p>JOHN DIXON, CUSTOMER: Seaweedy (ph) used to be wild like $30. Now, guys, Green Cross got it over here for $5 at eight, which is way better. It`s not hurting my pockets.</p><p>ROY: The reason, six months after the state of California legalized recreational marijuana. New regulations are scheduled to take effect July 1st, which require all cannabis products on store shelves undergo extensive lab testing for pesticides, pathogens and potency. So, pot shops are trying desperately to unload their untested inventory before it becomes illegal.</p><p>The president of the Green Cross dispensary Kevin Reed says they slash prices as low as possible so they won`t have to toss out the pot.</p><p>KEVIN REED, THE GREEN CROSS PRESIDENT: There`s lines going out the door and down the sidewalk. It`s like it`s 4:20 every single day.</p><p>ROY: But labs that test cannabis products are busy too.</p><p>TONY DANIEL, STEEP HILL CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER: We have seen about a tenfold increase in inbound inquiries.</p><p>ROY: The new testing requirements are creating a backlog at marijuana labs like Steep Hill in Berkeley. It`s one of only 31 marijuana testing labs in California, a state with more than 400 licensed retailers.</p><p>Chief revenue officer Tony Daniels says he doesn`t expect a man to subside any time soon, so they`re hiring 200 workers by the end of the year and moving into a bigger building.</p><p>DANIEL: Sales looks kind of like a hockey stick right now, and we anticipate that trend to continue. You know, cannabis is here to stay and the genies out of the bottle, so we`re moving into every legal jurisdiction and internationally as well.</p><p>ROY: Other labs are experiencing turnaround delays. Reed says the lab he works with is taking several days longer to get his weed back to him, forcing him to leave inventory in quarantine while he waits for the test results. While he waits, he worries.</p><p>REED: We`re going to have a lot of empty shelves come July 1st and we`re going to do what we can to get those shelves full again as quickly as possible.</p><p>ROY: Some in the industry worried that this latest set of regulations will drive out some of the mom-and-pop retailers and lead to bigger more corporate names driving California`s marijuana market.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, Berkeley, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: A buzzkill for the maker of Corona Beer and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) reported quarterly profit that was below expectations. Freight costs coupled with a rising dollar pressured its operating margins and marketing expenses were also higher. Shares fell more than 5-1/2 percent as a result today to $218.87.</p><p>Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank`s CEO said today he remains committed to his company`s U.S. unit despite failing the Fed`s stress test this week, something we`ve reported on yesterday. In an interview today, he added that he is confident that his bank is on the right path.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING, DEUTSCHE BANK CEO: First of all, we have done a lot already. We see the progress, but we also where that more needs to be done. That is all in the plan and therefore we are confident to get over this over the next 12 months.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Shares of the Deutsche Bank rose more than 1 percent today to $10.62.</p><p>HERERA: Novartis and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) won the backing of a key European panel for their separate cancer cell therapies. That move likely clears the way for approval within months. The European commission has the final say before those medicines can be sold. Novartis gained more than 3 percent to $75.54. Gilead Shares were also higher.</p><p>Greenbrier reported earnings that blew past analysts estimates for the second straight quarter. The freight transportation equipment supplier reported a rise in new orders that were helped by strong demand for its rail cars. The shares rallied 12 percent to $52.75, its best one-day percentage gain in more than a year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time for our market monitor. He`s investing in midcap stocks, a -- he`s got a five-star rated fun of by Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN). His fund is up 14 percent so far this year, easily outpacing the broader market.</p><p>We welcome back Stephen Denichilo. He is portfolio manager at the Federated Kauffman Funds.</p><p>Stephen, good to see you again. Welcome back.</p><p>STEPHEN DENICHILO, FEDERATED KAUFFMAN FUNDS PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Hey, great to see you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: These midcaps now -- I mean, I keep hearing that people are expecting the small caps and the midcaps to outperform in the second half, maybe the over -- the large caps have become too expensive, trade worries, all those things.</p><p>Is that what you`re looking at here as well?</p><p>DENICHILO: Right. Well, actually, I think the appropriate way to look at it is not so much small versus mid versus large, but is actually value versus growth. Right now, we`re coming off seven and this is what the last day of the second quarter from a training perspective, we`re coming off of seven consecutive quarters of accelerating GDP on a year-over-year rate. We have never had that time type of growth before, it`s only happened one other time since the 1940s.</p><p>So, in that environment everything has won, right? We`ve had low volatility high growth and an accelerating economy. Now, while we well we don`t think the economy is necessarily slowing, it`s still going to be good, that rate of change is going to slow. Meaning, we`re going to be getting better but at a slower rate.</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>DENICHILO: In that environment, coupled with higher interest rates, typically growth stocks outperform. Companies where you don`t need to worry about who`s president, trade wars, interest rates what`s going on in the government -- these are companies that are creating their own innovative solutions and helping customers make money and improve their own assets.</p><p>HERERA: So, let`s talk about -- you gave us three picks. I don`t know if I`m going to pronounce this correctly.</p><p>DENICHILO: Sure.</p><p>HERERA: But it`s a play on the electric vehicle growth. Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) Corporation.</p><p>DENICHILO: Correct.</p><p>HERERA: ALB?</p><p>DENICHILO: Absolutely. Look, we are at the dawn of a revolution in electric vehicles, electric vehicles. For all the press they get with Tesla are only 1 percent of overall new car sales in the world.</p><p>We think that 1 percent is going to go to 10 to 12 percent over the next five to seven years, electric vehicle sales globally are up over 50 percent in 2018. You are going to need a lot of lithium.</p><p>Right now, there`s this narrative on Wall Street that says lithium is oversupplied, we don`t think that`s the case. This is a specialty material, not a commodity. And Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is the most profitable point of the value chain to invest in electric vehicles today.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Couple of seconds left to talk about these other two companies which are similar in business model. You`ve got Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) and Veeva Systems, sort of like Salesforce I guess, huh?</p><p>DENICHILO: Absolutely, like Salesforce. Look, the comparison between the two is they make governments and life sciences companies more efficient they make their sales process better and more efficient. Both companies have very high customer retention rate and very high recurring revenue.</p><p>So, again, in this volatile time and look, 2018 is already twice as volatile as we saw in 2017, you`re going to need companies that have high recurring revenue in good line-of-sight into growth.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very good. Stephen Denichilo with the Federated Kauffman Funds -- good to see you again. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>DENICHILO: Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, ride-sharing in the sky is causing annoyances on the ground at some tony summer getaway towns.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The president`s new tax law was passed six months ago today, and today, the Treasury Department and the IRS unveiled a draft of a revamped 1040 tax form and yes, it really is the size of a postcard. The agencies claim that the new form will streamline the tax filing process for more than 150 million people next year. One thing though, the IRS does say that nearly 90 percent of Americans filed online this year.</p><p>HERERA: Citigroup (NYSE:C) will refund more than $330 million to credit card customers. Those customers may have been overpaying interest on their credit cards. The settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will refund more than 1.7 million customers.</p><p>Earlier this year, Citi disclosed that it had used a flawed methodology when determining which customers were eligible for a rate reduction.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Well, a part of toy history is now gone. The last of the remaining Toys \"R\" Us stores are closing their doors for good this week and as you know, the once popular toy chain filed for bankruptcy back in September. And today, a simple message was posted on Toys \"R\" Us Website that read: don`t ever grow up, play on.</p><p>HERERA: Are you tired of getting stuck in traffic heading to that resort town maybe for this weekend`s getaway? Well, helicopters have been the desired mode of transport for several years now and they`re now swarming over rich beach towns around the country. New technology making it easier and cheaper to book and that could mean more headaches for the residents in years to come.</p><p>Robert Frank is in East Hampton, New York, with more on the battle brewing over helicopters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s a picture- perfect day here in the Hamptons, which means cocktails, parties and noisy helicopters.</p><p>The business of ride-sharing in the sky has exploded across the country as companies make booking a seat on a chopper as easy as booking an Uber. Here in the Hamptons, Blade was the pioneer, offering seats for $700 to $800 from Manhattan to the Hamptons, turning a three or four-hour wait in traffic into a quick 40-minute chopper ride.</p><p>This summer, a new competitor has landed, Blackbird, founded by a tech entrepreneur, there are more like Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in the sky. You could go on their app and book a seat on any of the local operators. They already have 100,000 people on their app, and they`ve flown four thousand people to the Hamptons just since Memorial Day. We booked a flight today on Blackbird and flew on a carrier called Foxtrot.</p><p>We are just landing in the East Hamptons 42 minutes after takeoff from Manhattan.</p><p>RUDD DAVIS, BLACKBIRD CEO: We are like Airbnb for flights most private flights only have about 15 percent occupancy on those flights, tons of open seats. And so, we bring together all those flights for people to book.</p><p>Now, Davis said that new technologies and helicopters could make that ride even cheaper, perhaps in 10 years, the ride from Manhattan to East Hampton could be as low as $50. But that would make the caravan of loud helicopters flowing into quiet mountain retreats and beach towns like this one even noisier.</p><p>Last summer there were more than 6,000 helicopter takeoffs and landings at this small airport. In August, that averages nearly a day, creating what some locals call a warzone.</p><p>SHERYL GOLD, EAST HAMPTON RESIDENT: It`s very loud. It`s stressful. It`s distracting. You could be on the phone -- you could be reading, you could be having a meal with friends, you could be sitting on the deck just trying to relax or enjoy the peace and quiet of your home, and it`s constantly disrupted.</p><p>FRANKK: Blade and other companies say they are buying quieter aircraft and try to spread out the traffic over multiple airports.</p><p>But there are only so many places to land in the Hamptons. And the town of East Hampton is threatening to shut down the airport in three years if things don`t improve.</p><p>Hamptonites also complained that the choppers are bringing in a much younger and rowdier group they call riffraff, who don`t respect the community. Of course, only in the Hamptons would people who pay $700 for a helicopter ride be considered riffraff.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Robert Frank in East Hampton, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: OK. Before we go, let`s take a look final look at the day on Wall Street. The Dow was up 293 points at one time but just finished up 55 points. Nasdaq up six, the S&amp;P was up two. Now, it was the worst first half for the Dow since 2010 by being down nearly 2 percent. The Nasdaq had its seventh first half gained in the last eight years and the S&amp;P, first half has been positive now for the last eight years.</p><p>HERERA: Wow.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Pretty good.</p><p>HERERA: Pretty good indeed.</p><p>That`ll do it for us tonight. Thanks for joining us. I`m Sue Herera.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a wonderful weekend.

The first half  was marked by the return of volatility.  Should investors expect more of  the same in the second?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Oh, Canada.  Our neighbor  to the north moves ahead now with tariffs on U.S. products as tensions  escalate with one of our closest allies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  Market monitor.  A top-rated fund manager who's outperforming the  market this year has a list of under-the-radar stocks he says are worth  buying.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June  29th.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you good Friday evening, everybody.  </p><p> Stocks got a lift today as -- get this -- we closed out the week, the  month, the quarter and the first half of this year.  The market was helped  by a big move higher in Dow component Nike (NYSE:NKE) following that strong  earnings report that we told you about last night.</p><p> At its peak today, the Dow was up 293 points but that rally fizzled as the  closing bell approached this afternoon.  And when all was said and done,  the Dow gained just 55 points to 24,271, the Nasdaq was up the six, the S&amp;P  rose by two.  And for the week, the major indexes were all lower.  </p><p> So, now, we're at the midway point of the year after a choppy six months on  Wall Street, to say the least.</p><p> Mike Santoli takes a look now at what defined that first half and what may  lie ahead for the second.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks worked their  way to modest gains in the first half of 2018, but they did it the hard  way.  The biggest January surged in three decades gave way to a swift  percent drop into February for the S&amp;P 500 index.  Since then, the broad  market has been recovering in a choppy, fitful pattern, finishing the first  half with a gain of a bit more than 2 percent.</p><p> Among the issues investors have had to grapple with, a rise in interest  rates to multi-year highs, a spurt in oil prices above $70 a barrel and a  flare-up in tensions and tariff threats with America's trading partners.   These headwinds slowed the major indexes after a very strong 2017, but  didn't stop them.  That's thanks to a pickup in U.S. economic growth,  strong consumer spending and record corporate profits, in part due to the  December tax cut package.</p><p> In these opposing currents, some areas of the market have thrived others  have struggled.  Big tech stocks remain the clear leaders, driving the  Nasdaq to nearly a nine percent gain.  Energy also came to life, climbing  almost 6 percent, and shares of smaller companies were favored as havens  from a trade war, helping the Russell 2000 to a 7 percent first half rally.</p><p> On the downside, big industrial stocks suffered from the heated trade  rhetoric, slipping some percent and pressuring the Dow Jones Industrial  Average to a slim 1 percent loss for the first half, and consumer staples  sank close to 10 percent on steady shortfalls and profits from big food and  household product companies.  The outlook for the second half of the year  will hinge on how the Federal Reserve recedes with interest rate policies  whether the trade issues need or some resolution and how much economic and  corporate profit growth might slow toward year-end.  </p><p> History shows that midterm election years are often choppy for stocks  through the summer which is yet another complication.  </p><p> But with profit growth set to rise close to 20 percent for the full year  and stock valuations well off their January highs Wall Street's bulls are  betting that business conditions are sturdy enough to absorb some more  political noise and perhaps even two more rate hikes from the Fed.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  So let's talk a little bit more about the second half with  Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.</p><p> Good to see you again, Kristina.  Welcome back.</p><p> KRISTINA HOOPER, CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO:  Great to see  you.  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  We'll the second half of the year do you think be marked by the  type of disruption and volatility that has been characteristic of the first  half?</p><p> KRISTINA HOOPER, INVESCO CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST:  Absolutely.  I  think it's very likely we're going to see that because we have the same  drivers in place, specifically monetary policy is being unwound, and this  isn't just ordinary monetary policy, this is experimental monetary policy.   And so unwinding it is an experiment in and of itself.</p><p> What I think is going to happen is we're going to see continued  normalization of capital markets as we normalize that monetary policy.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  You also see higher prices.  You see a little slow roll.  Is it  enough that you would tell investors to start thinking about investing in  traditional inflation hedges?</p><p> HOOPER:  Traditional inflation hedges should always be part of an  investor's portfolio.  So, if it isn't, they should include it in there.   And there's a wide array of options from commodities to treasury inflation- protected securities, to income producing areas like dividends which have  historically held up well in rising inflation environments.  So, there's a  lot of options to choose from.</p><p> HERERA:  What about going globally, Kristina?  I mean, the U.S., you expect  growth to slow a little bit certainly, but the trajectory is still higher.   What about investing outside of the United States?</p><p> HOOPER:  Well, if you were to have invested outside the U.S. in the first  half of this year, you would have been disappointed relative to the U.S.   It's pretty much a sea of red year-to-date.</p><p> But having said that there are different drivers for different economies  and markets and so it makes sense to be very well-diversified.  Yesterday's  winners may not be tomorrow's winners and so, we need to hedge our bets  with diversification.</p><p> HERERA:  Kristina, thank you so much as always.  Kristina Hooper with  Invesco.</p><p> Bill?</p><p> HOOPER:  Thank you.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And on this last day of the first half, a new report show that  inflation has in fact hit the Fed's target of 2 percent.  It's the first  time the so-called PCE index, which is the Central Bank's preferred  inflation gauge, first time it's hit that level in six years.  </p><p> The acceleration and the inflation came despite a moderation in consumer  spending though.  Another report showed at 0.2 percent gained last month.   That was below expectations.  In fact, consumer spending is closely watched  because it does account for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.</p><p> HERERA:  But consumer sentiment improved slightly this month.  According to  the University of Michigan index, Americans are feeling better about the  current state of the economy, but details of that report were mixed.  </p><p> Americans lowered their expectations about the future with many citing  trade and tariff concerns.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And those trade tensions were ratcheted up today when Canada  said that it was moving ahead with tariffs on U.S. products.</p><p> Kayla Tausche is in Washington for us tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One month after  Canada started paying new tariffs to send steel and aluminum to the U.S.,  Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland flanked by steel workers says they're  striking back.</p><p> CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  We are acting very much in  sorrow not in anger.  But the U.S. tariffs leave Canada no choice but to  defend our industries, our workers and our communities.</p><p> TAUSCHE:  Starting Sunday, U.S. ketchup, candy and toilet papers as well as  steel and aluminum will see new fees at the border.  Canada's retaliation  comes after similar actions from Europe, Mexico, and China, some $20  billion in U.S. goods targeted in all, from politically sensitive states  like Pennsylvania and Kentucky.</p><p> This week, top U.S. trade official Robert Lighthizer called the retaliation  unjustified, saying it showed blatant disregard for WTO rules, referring to  the World Trade Organization which governs cross-border business.  The  White House believes its actions are WTO compliant but the counter punches  are not.  </p><p> The moves against the U.S. have bolstered President Trump's disdain for the  organization, a new report suggests he'll move to withdraw.  An outside  advisor to the president says this may indeed be the catalyst.</p><p> Even Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser, an avowed free trader, has  raised his own doubts.</p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  The World Trade  Organization, for example, has become completely ineffectual and even when  it makes decisions, even in the rare moments when it makes decisions,  important countries don't even abide by them.</p><p> TAUSCHE:  President Trump believes the tariffs while painful for now are  working.</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Many countries are calling,  saying, let's negotiate.  They were never doing that.  They're saying,  let's negotiate, please, please, we want to negotiate.</p><p> TAUSCHE:  That strategy will be tested again next week.  On July 6th, the  U.S. will add new fees on $34 billion in Chinese imports, and China will  add new tariffs in return.  White House officials are telling businesses to  expect those to go into effect, barring any last-minute deal.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  General Motors (NYSE:GM) warns that some of the tariffs on  imported vehicles being considered by the Trump administration could lead  to a, quote, smaller GM.  The largest U.S. automaker also said that  expansive tariffs risk isolating the company from the global market.  In  May, the White House launched an investigation into whether imported  vehicles pose a national security threat.  Shares of GM were down more than  2-1/2 percent in today's session. </p><p> GRIFFETH:  Mexican voters are heading to the polls this Sunday in an  election that could shift the political paradigm in that country and the  results could have far-reaching implications for trade and business as well  here in the U.S.</p><p> Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more for us.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The next  president of Mexico is likely to be a man who goes by the nickname AMLO.   It's an acronym for Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.  He has run for president  twice before, looks like the third time is going to be the charm because he  is way out ahead in the polls.</p><p> He's historically been known as a real radical leftist, sometimes he's been  compared to Hugo Chavez.  This time around, during this campaign, he's  moved much more to the center even though he's definitely left-leaning in  his economics, right leaning in his social policies.  </p><p> Some in the administration had been worried about his rise to power and had  tried to push for NAFTA to be renegotiated before the election because they  thought it might be tougher to get a deal done with AMLO in power.  </p><p> There's some thinking however that maybe it actually might be easier to get  a deal done.  He's very much a nationalist and maybe the president might  actually like him a little more than the current president of Mexico.   Additionally, the U.S. would like Mexico to raise wages.  Right now,  manufacturing jobs down there pay only four dollars an hour compared to $39  an hour here in the United States, and that's why so many companies often  move their businesses down there, at least their manufacturing jobs down  there.</p><p> AMLO pretty much agrees that we just should go up and so maybe there's some  place to find consensus there in a way that previously hadn't been thought.   Still, there's a long way to go before the NAFTA negotiations are done.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.</p><p> Walgreens was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies.  The analyst cites  new competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which we told you about  yesterday.  That the analyst says could weigh on future earnings.  The  price target is $65.  The stock rose just a fraction to $60.02.</p><p> Nike's price target was raised to $84 a share at Bernstein.  The analyst  cites the Dow component's strong quarterly results.  The firm maintains an  overweight rating on that stock and it rallied 11 percent to $79.68.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  A different analysts at Bernstein cut Diageo's rating to market  perform from outperform.  The analysts there says he believes the rally in  that stock has come to an end.  Shares have risen about 19 percent in the  past year.  The firm also notes that the potential for some Diageo brands  to face challenges in case of a global trade war breaking out.  The stock  rose one penny today $144.0.1.</p><p> Shares of KB Homes were upgraded to buy from underperform at Bank of  America (NYSE:BAC).  The analyst there says concerns surrounding the  homebuilding sector are overblown.  Price target $37.  That stock rose 8  percent today to $27.24. </p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, fire sale.  Why the young California cannabis  industry is offering deep discounts to its customers.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  California has now passed the strictest online privacy law in  the country.  This law gives consumers sweeping control over their personal  data and grants them to the right to know what information companies like  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are collecting on them.  The  law takes effect in 2020.</p><p> HERERA:  Also in California, new laws governing the cannabis industry take  effect this weekend, and that means a lot of businesses are scrambling to  sell inventory that won't meet those new requirements.  </p><p> Aditi Roy is in Berkeley.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Marijuana is flying off  the shelves at the Green Cross dispensary in San Francisco.  The lines are  long because the discounts are deep.  Some cannabis products, up to 80  percent off.</p><p> JOHN DIXON, CUSTOMER:  Seaweedy (ph) used to be wild like $30.  Now, guys,  Green Cross got it over here for $5 at eight, which is way better.  It's  not hurting my pockets.</p><p> ROY:  The reason, six months after the state of California legalized  recreational marijuana.  New regulations are scheduled to take effect July  1st, which require all cannabis products on store shelves undergo extensive  lab testing for pesticides, pathogens and potency.  So, pot shops are  trying desperately to unload their untested inventory before it becomes  illegal.</p><p> The president of the Green Cross dispensary Kevin Reed says they slash  prices as low as possible so they won't have to toss out the pot.</p><p> KEVIN REED, THE GREEN CROSS PRESIDENT:  There's lines going out the door  and down the sidewalk.  It's like it's 4:20 every single day.</p><p> ROY:  But labs that test cannabis products are busy too. </p><p> TONY DANIEL, STEEP HILL CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER:  We have seen about a  tenfold increase in inbound inquiries.</p><p> ROY:  The new testing requirements are creating a backlog at marijuana labs  like Steep Hill in Berkeley.  It's one of only 31 marijuana testing labs in  California, a state with more than 400 licensed retailers.  </p><p> Chief revenue officer Tony Daniels says he doesn't expect a man to subside  any time soon, so they're hiring 200 workers by the end of the year and  moving into a bigger building.</p><p> DANIEL:  Sales looks kind of like a hockey stick right now, and we  anticipate that trend to continue.  You know, cannabis is here to stay and  the genies out of the bottle, so we're moving into every legal jurisdiction  and internationally as well.</p><p> ROY:  Other labs are experiencing turnaround delays.  Reed says the lab he  works with is taking several days longer to get his weed back to him,  forcing him to leave inventory in quarantine while he waits for the test  results.  While he waits, he worries.</p><p> REED:  We're going to have a lot of empty shelves come July 1st and we're  going to do what we can to get those shelves full again as quickly as  possible.</p><p> ROY:  Some in the industry worried that this latest set of regulations will  drive out some of the mom-and-pop retailers and lead to bigger more  corporate names driving California's marijuana market.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, Berkeley, California.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  A buzzkill for the maker of Corona Beer and that is where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) reported quarterly profit that was below  expectations.  Freight costs coupled with a rising dollar pressured its  operating margins and marketing expenses were also higher.  Shares fell  more than 5-1/2 percent as a result today to $218.87.</p><p> Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank's CEO said today he remains committed to his  company's U.S. unit despite failing the Fed's stress test this week,  something we've reported on yesterday.  In an interview today, he added  that he is confident that his bank is on the right path.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRISTIAN SEWING, DEUTSCHE BANK CEO:  First of all, we have done a lot  already.  We see the progress, but we also where that more needs to be  done.  That is all in the plan and therefore we are confident to get over  this over the next 12 months.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Shares of the Deutsche Bank rose more than 1 percent today to  $10.62.</p><p> HERERA:  Novartis and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) won the backing of a  key European panel for their separate cancer cell therapies.  That move  likely clears the way for approval within months.  The European commission  has the final say before those medicines can be sold.  Novartis gained more  than 3 percent to $75.54.  Gilead Shares were also higher.</p><p> Greenbrier reported earnings that blew past analysts estimates for the  second straight quarter.  The freight transportation equipment supplier  reported a rise in new orders that were helped by strong demand for its  rail cars.  The shares rallied 12 percent to $52.75, its best one-day  percentage gain in more than a year.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Time for our market monitor.  He's investing in midcap stocks, a  -- he's got a five-star rated fun of by Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN).  His  fund is up 14 percent so far this year, easily outpacing the broader  market.  </p><p> We welcome back Stephen Denichilo.  He is portfolio manager at the  Federated Kauffman Funds.</p><p> Stephen, good to see you again.  Welcome back.</p><p> STEPHEN DENICHILO, FEDERATED KAUFFMAN FUNDS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Hey, great  to see you. Thanks for having me.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  These midcaps now -- I mean, I keep hearing that people are  expecting the small caps and the midcaps to outperform in the second half,  maybe the over -- the large caps have become too expensive, trade worries,  all those things.</p><p> Is that what you're looking at here as well?</p><p> DENICHILO:  Right.  Well, actually, I think the appropriate way to look at  it is not so much small versus mid versus large, but is actually value  versus growth.  Right now, we're coming off seven and this is what the last  day of the second quarter from a training perspective, we're coming off of  seven consecutive quarters of accelerating GDP on a year-over-year rate.   We have never had that time type of growth before, it's only happened one  other time since the 1940s.</p><p> So, in that environment everything has won, right?  We've had low  volatility high growth and an accelerating economy.  Now, while we well we  don't think the economy is necessarily slowing, it's still going to be  good, that rate of change is going to slow.  Meaning, we're going to be  getting better but at a slower rate.</p><p> HERERA:  OK.</p><p> DENICHILO:  In that environment, coupled with higher interest rates,  typically growth stocks outperform.  Companies where you don't need to  worry about who's president, trade wars, interest rates what's going on in  the government -- these are companies that are creating their own  innovative solutions and helping customers make money and improve their own  assets.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, let's talk about -- you gave us three picks.  I don't know if  I'm going to pronounce this correctly.</p><p> DENICHILO:  Sure.</p><p> HERERA:  But it's a play on the electric vehicle growth.  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corporation.</p><p> DENICHILO:  Correct.</p><p> HERERA:  ALB?</p><p> DENICHILO:  Absolutely.  Look, we are at the dawn of a revolution in  electric vehicles, electric vehicles.  For all the press they get with  Tesla are only 1 percent of overall new car sales in the world.  </p><p> We think that 1 percent is going to go to 10 to 12 percent over the next  five to seven years, electric vehicle sales globally are up over 50 percent  in 2018.  You are going to need a lot of lithium.  </p><p> Right now, there's this narrative on Wall Street that says lithium is  oversupplied, we don't think that's the case.  This is a specialty  material, not a commodity.  And Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is the most profitable  point of the value chain to invest in electric vehicles today.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Couple of seconds left to talk about these other two companies  which are similar in business model.  You've got Tyler Technologies  (NYSE:TYL) and Veeva Systems, sort of like Salesforce I guess, huh?</p><p> DENICHILO:  Absolutely, like Salesforce.  Look, the comparison between the  two is they make governments and life sciences companies more efficient  they make their sales process better and more efficient.  Both companies  have very high customer retention rate and very high recurring revenue.</p><p> So, again, in this volatile time and look, 2018 is already twice as  volatile as we saw in 2017, you're going to need companies that have high  recurring revenue in good line-of-sight into growth.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Very good.  Stephen Denichilo with the Federated Kauffman Funds  -- good to see you again.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p> DENICHILO:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  And coming up, ride-sharing in the sky is causing annoyances on  the ground at some tony summer getaway towns.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  The president's new tax law was passed six months ago today, and  today, the Treasury Department and the IRS unveiled a draft of a revamped  1040 tax form and yes, it really is the size of a postcard.  The agencies  claim that the new form will streamline the tax filing process for more  than 150 million people next year.  One thing though, the IRS does say that  nearly 90 percent of Americans filed online this year.</p><p> HERERA:  Citigroup (NYSE:C) will refund more than $330 million to credit  card customers.  Those customers may have been overpaying interest on their  credit cards.  The settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  will refund more than 1.7 million customers.</p><p> Earlier this year, Citi disclosed that it had used a flawed methodology  when determining which customers were eligible for a rate reduction.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Well, a part of toy history is now gone.  The last of the  remaining Toys \"R\" Us stores are closing their doors for good this week and  as you know, the once popular toy chain filed for bankruptcy back in  September.  And today, a simple message was posted on Toys \"R\" Us Website  that read: don't ever grow up, play on.</p><p> HERERA:  Are you tired of getting stuck in traffic heading to that resort  town maybe for this weekend's getaway?  Well, helicopters have been the  desired mode of transport for several years now and they're now swarming  over rich beach towns around the country.  New technology making it easier  and cheaper to book and that could mean more headaches for the residents in  years to come.  </p><p> Robert Frank is in East Hampton, New York, with more on the battle brewing  over helicopters.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's a picture- perfect day here in the Hamptons, which means cocktails, parties and noisy  helicopters.  </p><p> The business of ride-sharing in the sky has exploded across the country as  companies make booking a seat on a chopper as easy as booking an Uber.   Here in the Hamptons, Blade was the pioneer, offering seats for $700 to  $800 from Manhattan to the Hamptons, turning a three or four-hour wait in  traffic into a quick 40-minute chopper ride.  </p><p> This summer, a new competitor has landed, Blackbird, founded by a tech  entrepreneur, there are more like Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in the sky.  You  could go on their app and book a seat on any of the local operators.  They  already have 100,000 people on their app, and they've flown four thousand  people to the Hamptons just since Memorial Day.  We booked a flight today  on Blackbird and flew on a carrier called Foxtrot.  </p><p> We are just landing in the East Hamptons 42 minutes after takeoff from  Manhattan.</p><p> RUDD DAVIS, BLACKBIRD CEO:   We are like Airbnb for flights most private  flights only have about 15 percent occupancy on those flights, tons of open  seats.  And so, we bring together all those flights for people to book.</p><p> Now, Davis said that new technologies and helicopters could make that ride  even cheaper, perhaps in 10 years, the ride from Manhattan to East Hampton  could be as low as $50.  But that would make the caravan of loud  helicopters flowing into quiet mountain retreats and beach towns like this  one even noisier.  </p><p> Last summer there were more than 6,000 helicopter takeoffs and landings at  this small airport.  In August, that averages nearly a day, creating what  some locals call a warzone.</p><p> SHERYL GOLD, EAST HAMPTON RESIDENT:  It's very loud.  It's stressful.  It's  distracting.  You could be on the phone -- you could be reading, you could  be having a meal with friends, you could be sitting on the deck just trying  to relax or enjoy the peace and quiet of your home, and it's constantly  disrupted.</p><p> FRANKK:  Blade and other companies say they are buying quieter aircraft and  try to spread out the traffic over multiple airports.</p><p> But there are only so many places to land in the Hamptons.  And the town of  East Hampton is threatening to shut down the airport in three years if  things don't improve.</p><p> Hamptonites also complained that the choppers are bringing in a much  younger and rowdier group they call riffraff, who don't respect the  community.  Of course, only in the Hamptons would people who pay $700 for a  helicopter ride be considered riffraff.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank in East Hampton, New York.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GRIFFETH:  OK.  Before we go, let's take a look final look at the day on  Wall Street.  The Dow was up 293 points at one time but just finished up 55  points.  Nasdaq up six, the S&amp;P was up two.  Now, it was the worst first  half for the Dow since 2010 by being down nearly 2 percent.  The Nasdaq had  its seventh first half gained in the last eight years and the S&amp;P, first  half has been positive now for the last eight years. </p><p> HERERA:  Wow.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  Pretty good.</p><p> HERERA:  Pretty good indeed.  </p><p> That'll do it for us tonight.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Sue Herera.</p><p> GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a wonderful weekend.  See you Monday.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The first half  was marked by the return of volatility.  Should investors expect more of  the same in the second?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Oh, Canada.  Our neighbor  to the north moves ahead now with tariffs on U.S. products as tensions  escalate with one of our closest allies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Market monitor.  A top-rated fund manager who's outperforming the  market this year has a list of under-the-radar stocks he says are worth  buying.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, June  29th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you good Friday evening, everybody.  </p><p>Stocks got a lift today as -- get this -- we closed out the week, the  month, the quarter and the first half of this year.  The market was helped  by a big move higher in Dow component Nike (NYSE:NKE) following that strong  earnings report that we told you about last night.</p><p>At its peak today, the Dow was up 293 points but that rally fizzled as the  closing bell approached this afternoon.  And when all was said and done,  the Dow gained just 55 points to 24,271, the Nasdaq was up the six, the S&amp;P  rose by two.  And for the week, the major indexes were all lower.  </p><p>So, now, we're at the midway point of the year after a choppy six months on  Wall Street, to say the least.</p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look now at what defined that first half and what may  lie ahead for the second.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks worked their  way to modest gains in the first half of 2018, but they did it the hard  way.  The biggest January surged in three decades gave way to a swift  percent drop into February for the S&amp;P 500 index.  Since then, the broad  market has been recovering in a choppy, fitful pattern, finishing the first  half with a gain of a bit more than 2 percent.</p><p>Among the issues investors have had to grapple with, a rise in interest  rates to multi-year highs, a spurt in oil prices above $70 a barrel and a  flare-up in tensions and tariff threats with America's trading partners.   These headwinds slowed the major indexes after a very strong 2017, but  didn't stop them.  That's thanks to a pickup in U.S. economic growth,  strong consumer spending and record corporate profits, in part due to the  December tax cut package.</p><p>In these opposing currents, some areas of the market have thrived others  have struggled.  Big tech stocks remain the clear leaders, driving the  Nasdaq to nearly a nine percent gain.  Energy also came to life, climbing  almost 6 percent, and shares of smaller companies were favored as havens  from a trade war, helping the Russell 2000 to a 7 percent first half rally.</p><p>On the downside, big industrial stocks suffered from the heated trade  rhetoric, slipping some percent and pressuring the Dow Jones Industrial  Average to a slim 1 percent loss for the first half, and consumer staples  sank close to 10 percent on steady shortfalls and profits from big food and  household product companies.  The outlook for the second half of the year  will hinge on how the Federal Reserve recedes with interest rate policies  whether the trade issues need or some resolution and how much economic and  corporate profit growth might slow toward year-end.  </p><p>History shows that midterm election years are often choppy for stocks  through the summer which is yet another complication.  </p><p>But with profit growth set to rise close to 20 percent for the full year  and stock valuations well off their January highs Wall Street's bulls are  betting that business conditions are sturdy enough to absorb some more  political noise and perhaps even two more rate hikes from the Fed.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So let's talk a little bit more about the second half with  Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.</p><p>Good to see you again, Kristina.  Welcome back.</p><p>KRISTINA HOOPER, CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO:  Great to see  you.  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  We'll the second half of the year do you think be marked by the  type of disruption and volatility that has been characteristic of the first  half?</p><p>KRISTINA HOOPER, INVESCO CHIEF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST:  Absolutely.  I  think it's very likely we're going to see that because we have the same  drivers in place, specifically monetary policy is being unwound, and this  isn't just ordinary monetary policy, this is experimental monetary policy.   And so unwinding it is an experiment in and of itself.</p><p>What I think is going to happen is we're going to see continued  normalization of capital markets as we normalize that monetary policy.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You also see higher prices.  You see a little slow roll.  Is it  enough that you would tell investors to start thinking about investing in  traditional inflation hedges?</p><p>HOOPER:  Traditional inflation hedges should always be part of an  investor's portfolio.  So, if it isn't, they should include it in there.   And there's a wide array of options from commodities to treasury inflation- protected securities, to income producing areas like dividends which have  historically held up well in rising inflation environments.  So, there's a  lot of options to choose from.</p><p>HERERA:  What about going globally, Kristina?  I mean, the U.S., you expect  growth to slow a little bit certainly, but the trajectory is still higher.   What about investing outside of the United States?</p><p>HOOPER:  Well, if you were to have invested outside the U.S. in the first  half of this year, you would have been disappointed relative to the U.S.   It's pretty much a sea of red year-to-date.</p><p>But having said that there are different drivers for different economies  and markets and so it makes sense to be very well-diversified.  Yesterday's  winners may not be tomorrow's winners and so, we need to hedge our bets  with diversification.</p><p>HERERA:  Kristina, thank you so much as always.  Kristina Hooper with  Invesco.</p><p>Bill?</p><p>HOOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And on this last day of the first half, a new report show that  inflation has in fact hit the Fed's target of 2 percent.  It's the first  time the so-called PCE index, which is the Central Bank's preferred  inflation gauge, first time it's hit that level in six years.  </p><p>The acceleration and the inflation came despite a moderation in consumer  spending though.  Another report showed at 0.2 percent gained last month.   That was below expectations.  In fact, consumer spending is closely watched  because it does account for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.</p><p>HERERA:  But consumer sentiment improved slightly this month.  According to  the University of Michigan index, Americans are feeling better about the  current state of the economy, but details of that report were mixed.  </p><p>Americans lowered their expectations about the future with many citing  trade and tariff concerns.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And those trade tensions were ratcheted up today when Canada  said that it was moving ahead with tariffs on U.S. products.</p><p>Kayla Tausche is in Washington for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One month after  Canada started paying new tariffs to send steel and aluminum to the U.S.,  Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland flanked by steel workers says they're  striking back.</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  We are acting very much in  sorrow not in anger.  But the U.S. tariffs leave Canada no choice but to  defend our industries, our workers and our communities.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  Starting Sunday, U.S. ketchup, candy and toilet papers as well as  steel and aluminum will see new fees at the border.  Canada's retaliation  comes after similar actions from Europe, Mexico, and China, some $20  billion in U.S. goods targeted in all, from politically sensitive states  like Pennsylvania and Kentucky.</p><p>This week, top U.S. trade official Robert Lighthizer called the retaliation  unjustified, saying it showed blatant disregard for WTO rules, referring to  the World Trade Organization which governs cross-border business.  The  White House believes its actions are WTO compliant but the counter punches  are not.  </p><p>The moves against the U.S. have bolstered President Trump's disdain for the  organization, a new report suggests he'll move to withdraw.  An outside  advisor to the president says this may indeed be the catalyst.</p><p>Even Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser, an avowed free trader, has  raised his own doubts.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  The World Trade  Organization, for example, has become completely ineffectual and even when  it makes decisions, even in the rare moments when it makes decisions,  important countries don't even abide by them.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  President Trump believes the tariffs while painful for now are  working.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Many countries are calling,  saying, let's negotiate.  They were never doing that.  They're saying,  let's negotiate, please, please, we want to negotiate.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  That strategy will be tested again next week.  On July 6th, the  U.S. will add new fees on $34 billion in Chinese imports, and China will  add new tariffs in return.  White House officials are telling businesses to  expect those to go into effect, barring any last-minute deal.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  General Motors (NYSE:GM) warns that some of the tariffs on  imported vehicles being considered by the Trump administration could lead  to a, quote, smaller GM.  The largest U.S. automaker also said that  expansive tariffs risk isolating the company from the global market.  In  May, the White House launched an investigation into whether imported  vehicles pose a national security threat.  Shares of GM were down more than  2-1/2 percent in today's session. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Mexican voters are heading to the polls this Sunday in an  election that could shift the political paradigm in that country and the  results could have far-reaching implications for trade and business as well  here in the U.S.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera has more for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The next  president of Mexico is likely to be a man who goes by the nickname AMLO.   It's an acronym for Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.  He has run for president  twice before, looks like the third time is going to be the charm because he  is way out ahead in the polls.</p><p>He's historically been known as a real radical leftist, sometimes he's been  compared to Hugo Chavez.  This time around, during this campaign, he's  moved much more to the center even though he's definitely left-leaning in  his economics, right leaning in his social policies.  </p><p>Some in the administration had been worried about his rise to power and had  tried to push for NAFTA to be renegotiated before the election because they  thought it might be tougher to get a deal done with AMLO in power.  </p><p>There's some thinking however that maybe it actually might be easier to get  a deal done.  He's very much a nationalist and maybe the president might  actually like him a little more than the current president of Mexico.   Additionally, the U.S. would like Mexico to raise wages.  Right now,  manufacturing jobs down there pay only four dollars an hour compared to $39  an hour here in the United States, and that's why so many companies often  move their businesses down there, at least their manufacturing jobs down  there.</p><p>AMLO pretty much agrees that we just should go up and so maybe there's some  place to find consensus there in a way that previously hadn't been thought.   Still, there's a long way to go before the NAFTA negotiations are done.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and  downgrades.</p><p>Walgreens was downgraded to hold from buy at Jefferies.  The analyst cites  new competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which we told you about  yesterday.  That the analyst says could weigh on future earnings.  The  price target is $65.  The stock rose just a fraction to $60.02.</p><p>Nike's price target was raised to $84 a share at Bernstein.  The analyst  cites the Dow component's strong quarterly results.  The firm maintains an  overweight rating on that stock and it rallied 11 percent to $79.68.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A different analysts at Bernstein cut Diageo's rating to market  perform from outperform.  The analysts there says he believes the rally in  that stock has come to an end.  Shares have risen about 19 percent in the  past year.  The firm also notes that the potential for some Diageo brands  to face challenges in case of a global trade war breaking out.  The stock  rose one penny today $144.0.1.</p><p>Shares of KB Homes were upgraded to buy from underperform at Bank of  America (NYSE:BAC).  The analyst there says concerns surrounding the  homebuilding sector are overblown.  Price target $37.  That stock rose 8  percent today to $27.24. </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, fire sale.  Why the young California cannabis  industry is offering deep discounts to its customers.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  California has now passed the strictest online privacy law in  the country.  This law gives consumers sweeping control over their personal  data and grants them to the right to know what information companies like  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are collecting on them.  The  law takes effect in 2020.</p><p>HERERA:  Also in California, new laws governing the cannabis industry take  effect this weekend, and that means a lot of businesses are scrambling to  sell inventory that won't meet those new requirements.  </p><p>Aditi Roy is in Berkeley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Marijuana is flying off  the shelves at the Green Cross dispensary in San Francisco.  The lines are  long because the discounts are deep.  Some cannabis products, up to 80  percent off.</p><p>JOHN DIXON, CUSTOMER:  Seaweedy (ph) used to be wild like $30.  Now, guys,  Green Cross got it over here for $5 at eight, which is way better.  It's  not hurting my pockets.</p><p>ROY:  The reason, six months after the state of California legalized  recreational marijuana.  New regulations are scheduled to take effect July  1st, which require all cannabis products on store shelves undergo extensive  lab testing for pesticides, pathogens and potency.  So, pot shops are  trying desperately to unload their untested inventory before it becomes  illegal.</p><p>The president of the Green Cross dispensary Kevin Reed says they slash  prices as low as possible so they won't have to toss out the pot.</p><p>KEVIN REED, THE GREEN CROSS PRESIDENT:  There's lines going out the door  and down the sidewalk.  It's like it's 4:20 every single day.</p><p>ROY:  But labs that test cannabis products are busy too. </p><p>TONY DANIEL, STEEP HILL CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER:  We have seen about a  tenfold increase in inbound inquiries.</p><p>ROY:  The new testing requirements are creating a backlog at marijuana labs  like Steep Hill in Berkeley.  It's one of only 31 marijuana testing labs in  California, a state with more than 400 licensed retailers.  </p><p>Chief revenue officer Tony Daniels says he doesn't expect a man to subside  any time soon, so they're hiring 200 workers by the end of the year and  moving into a bigger building.</p><p>DANIEL:  Sales looks kind of like a hockey stick right now, and we  anticipate that trend to continue.  You know, cannabis is here to stay and  the genies out of the bottle, so we're moving into every legal jurisdiction  and internationally as well.</p><p>ROY:  Other labs are experiencing turnaround delays.  Reed says the lab he  works with is taking several days longer to get his weed back to him,  forcing him to leave inventory in quarantine while he waits for the test  results.  While he waits, he worries.</p><p>REED:  We're going to have a lot of empty shelves come July 1st and we're  going to do what we can to get those shelves full again as quickly as  possible.</p><p>ROY:  Some in the industry worried that this latest set of regulations will  drive out some of the mom-and-pop retailers and lead to bigger more  corporate names driving California's marijuana market.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Aditi Roy, Berkeley, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A buzzkill for the maker of Corona Beer and that is where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) reported quarterly profit that was below  expectations.  Freight costs coupled with a rising dollar pressured its  operating margins and marketing expenses were also higher.  Shares fell  more than 5-1/2 percent as a result today to $218.87.</p><p>Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank's CEO said today he remains committed to his  company's U.S. unit despite failing the Fed's stress test this week,  something we've reported on yesterday.  In an interview today, he added  that he is confident that his bank is on the right path.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTIAN SEWING, DEUTSCHE BANK CEO:  First of all, we have done a lot  already.  We see the progress, but we also where that more needs to be  done.  That is all in the plan and therefore we are confident to get over  this over the next 12 months.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Shares of the Deutsche Bank rose more than 1 percent today to  $10.62.</p><p>HERERA:  Novartis and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) won the backing of a  key European panel for their separate cancer cell therapies.  That move  likely clears the way for approval within months.  The European commission  has the final say before those medicines can be sold.  Novartis gained more  than 3 percent to $75.54.  Gilead Shares were also higher.</p><p>Greenbrier reported earnings that blew past analysts estimates for the  second straight quarter.  The freight transportation equipment supplier  reported a rise in new orders that were helped by strong demand for its  rail cars.  The shares rallied 12 percent to $52.75, its best one-day  percentage gain in more than a year.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time for our market monitor.  He's investing in midcap stocks, a  -- he's got a five-star rated fun of by Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN).  His  fund is up 14 percent so far this year, easily outpacing the broader  market.  </p><p>We welcome back Stephen Denichilo.  He is portfolio manager at the  Federated Kauffman Funds.</p><p>Stephen, good to see you again.  Welcome back.</p><p>STEPHEN DENICHILO, FEDERATED KAUFFMAN FUNDS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Hey, great  to see you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  These midcaps now -- I mean, I keep hearing that people are  expecting the small caps and the midcaps to outperform in the second half,  maybe the over -- the large caps have become too expensive, trade worries,  all those things.</p><p>Is that what you're looking at here as well?</p><p>DENICHILO:  Right.  Well, actually, I think the appropriate way to look at  it is not so much small versus mid versus large, but is actually value  versus growth.  Right now, we're coming off seven and this is what the last  day of the second quarter from a training perspective, we're coming off of  seven consecutive quarters of accelerating GDP on a year-over-year rate.   We have never had that time type of growth before, it's only happened one  other time since the 1940s.</p><p>So, in that environment everything has won, right?  We've had low  volatility high growth and an accelerating economy.  Now, while we well we  don't think the economy is necessarily slowing, it's still going to be  good, that rate of change is going to slow.  Meaning, we're going to be  getting better but at a slower rate.</p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>DENICHILO:  In that environment, coupled with higher interest rates,  typically growth stocks outperform.  Companies where you don't need to  worry about who's president, trade wars, interest rates what's going on in  the government -- these are companies that are creating their own  innovative solutions and helping customers make money and improve their own  assets.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, let's talk about -- you gave us three picks.  I don't know if  I'm going to pronounce this correctly.</p><p>DENICHILO:  Sure.</p><p>HERERA:  But it's a play on the electric vehicle growth.  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corporation.</p><p>DENICHILO:  Correct.</p><p>HERERA:  ALB?</p><p>DENICHILO:  Absolutely.  Look, we are at the dawn of a revolution in  electric vehicles, electric vehicles.  For all the press they get with  Tesla are only 1 percent of overall new car sales in the world.  </p><p>We think that 1 percent is going to go to 10 to 12 percent over the next  five to seven years, electric vehicle sales globally are up over 50 percent  in 2018.  You are going to need a lot of lithium.  </p><p>Right now, there's this narrative on Wall Street that says lithium is  oversupplied, we don't think that's the case.  This is a specialty  material, not a commodity.  And Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is the most profitable  point of the value chain to invest in electric vehicles today.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Couple of seconds left to talk about these other two companies  which are similar in business model.  You've got Tyler Technologies  (NYSE:TYL) and Veeva Systems, sort of like Salesforce I guess, huh?</p><p>DENICHILO:  Absolutely, like Salesforce.  Look, the comparison between the  two is they make governments and life sciences companies more efficient  they make their sales process better and more efficient.  Both companies  have very high customer retention rate and very high recurring revenue.</p><p>So, again, in this volatile time and look, 2018 is already twice as  volatile as we saw in 2017, you're going to need companies that have high  recurring revenue in good line-of-sight into growth.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Very good.  Stephen Denichilo with the Federated Kauffman Funds  -- good to see you again.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>DENICHILO:  Good to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, ride-sharing in the sky is causing annoyances on  the ground at some tony summer getaway towns.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The president's new tax law was passed six months ago today, and  today, the Treasury Department and the IRS unveiled a draft of a revamped  1040 tax form and yes, it really is the size of a postcard.  The agencies  claim that the new form will streamline the tax filing process for more  than 150 million people next year.  One thing though, the IRS does say that  nearly 90 percent of Americans filed online this year.</p><p>HERERA:  Citigroup (NYSE:C) will refund more than $330 million to credit  card customers.  Those customers may have been overpaying interest on their  credit cards.  The settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  will refund more than 1.7 million customers.</p><p>Earlier this year, Citi disclosed that it had used a flawed methodology  when determining which customers were eligible for a rate reduction.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Well, a part of toy history is now gone.  The last of the  remaining Toys \"R\" Us stores are closing their doors for good this week and  as you know, the once popular toy chain filed for bankruptcy back in  September.  And today, a simple message was posted on Toys \"R\" Us Website  that read: don't ever grow up, play on.</p><p>HERERA:  Are you tired of getting stuck in traffic heading to that resort  town maybe for this weekend's getaway?  Well, helicopters have been the  desired mode of transport for several years now and they're now swarming  over rich beach towns around the country.  New technology making it easier  and cheaper to book and that could mean more headaches for the residents in  years to come.  </p><p>Robert Frank is in East Hampton, New York, with more on the battle brewing  over helicopters.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERT FRANK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's a picture- perfect day here in the Hamptons, which means cocktails, parties and noisy  helicopters.  </p><p>The business of ride-sharing in the sky has exploded across the country as  companies make booking a seat on a chopper as easy as booking an Uber.   Here in the Hamptons, Blade was the pioneer, offering seats for $700 to  $800 from Manhattan to the Hamptons, turning a three or four-hour wait in  traffic into a quick 40-minute chopper ride.  </p><p>This summer, a new competitor has landed, Blackbird, founded by a tech  entrepreneur, there are more like Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) in the sky.  You  could go on their app and book a seat on any of the local operators.  They  already have 100,000 people on their app, and they've flown four thousand  people to the Hamptons just since Memorial Day.  We booked a flight today  on Blackbird and flew on a carrier called Foxtrot.  </p><p>We are just landing in the East Hamptons 42 minutes after takeoff from  Manhattan.</p><p>RUDD DAVIS, BLACKBIRD CEO:   We are like Airbnb for flights most private  flights only have about 15 percent occupancy on those flights, tons of open  seats.  And so, we bring together all those flights for people to book.</p><p>Now, Davis said that new technologies and helicopters could make that ride  even cheaper, perhaps in 10 years, the ride from Manhattan to East Hampton  could be as low as $50.  But that would make the caravan of loud  helicopters flowing into quiet mountain retreats and beach towns like this  one even noisier.  </p><p>Last summer there were more than 6,000 helicopter takeoffs and landings at  this small airport.  In August, that averages nearly a day, creating what  some locals call a warzone.</p><p>SHERYL GOLD, EAST HAMPTON RESIDENT:  It's very loud.  It's stressful.  It's  distracting.  You could be on the phone -- you could be reading, you could  be having a meal with friends, you could be sitting on the deck just trying  to relax or enjoy the peace and quiet of your home, and it's constantly  disrupted.</p><p>FRANKK:  Blade and other companies say they are buying quieter aircraft and  try to spread out the traffic over multiple airports.</p><p>But there are only so many places to land in the Hamptons.  And the town of  East Hampton is threatening to shut down the airport in three years if  things don't improve.</p><p>Hamptonites also complained that the choppers are bringing in a much  younger and rowdier group they call riffraff, who don't respect the  community.  Of course, only in the Hamptons would people who pay $700 for a  helicopter ride be considered riffraff.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Robert Frank in East Hampton, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  OK.  Before we go, let's take a look final look at the day on  Wall Street.  The Dow was up 293 points at one time but just finished up 55  points.  Nasdaq up six, the S&amp;P was up two.  Now, it was the worst first  half for the Dow since 2010 by being down nearly 2 percent.  The Nasdaq had  its seventh first half gained in the last eight years and the S&amp;P, first  half has been positive now for the last eight years. </p><p>HERERA:  Wow.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Pretty good.</p><p>HERERA:  Pretty good indeed.  </p><p>That'll do it for us tonight.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm Sue Herera.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a wonderful weekend.

Concerns mount over Boeing`s newest plane following a deadly crash over the weekend and the FAA weighs in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Budget battle. The White House tells Congress how it wants to spend your tax dollars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: Energy boom. Why the U.S. is now a force to be reckoned with in the global oil market and it`s reshaping the industry as we know it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March 11th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we do bid you a good evening, everybody. And welcome.</p><p>We saw an epic tug of war on Wall Street today. The Dow was down 242 points at its low when its highest priced and therefore most influential component Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell as much as 12 percent in response to that Ethiopian flight crash yesterday.</p><p>It involved the aerospace company`s newest model, and we`ll have more on that in just a moment. But the Dow did stage a strong reversal because of a gain in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares after that company received a buy recommendation from an influential analyst. Other stocks then followed suit and the Dow`s big decline became a big gain.</p><p>And at the close, the industrial average was up 200 points. It closed at 25,650. The Nasdaq was up 149, its best day in six weeks. And the S&amp;P 500 added 40.</p><p>HERERA: And now to Boeing (NYSE:BA) which fell more than 5 percent in trading today, though it was down as much as 12 percent during the trading session. That is because of the plane crash over the weekend that involved Boeing`s 737 Max 8. The FAA says the plane is still airworthy. Investigators are on the scene looking to see if there`s a problem with the aircraft that many consider to be an important part of Boeing`s future.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: One day after the crash of an Ethiopian airline 737 Max 8, investigators have recovered the black boxes that could explain what went wrong. Shortly after takeoff, the pilot said there was a problem and struggled to control the plane before it crashed. Eerily similar to what happened before a Lion Air 737 Max 8 crashed in the Java Sea last October.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB BOARD MEMBER: It certainly is too early to rush to judgment. The accidents may be similar. There`s two different accidents in two different countries, but until we get a little more facts, we can`t compare them.</p><p>LEBEAU: Boeing (NYSE:BA) says the Max 8 is safe, despite concerns the plane`s design could create certain situations where faulty data might force the Max 8`s automatic anti-stall technology to kick in. When that happens, it pushes the plane`s nose lower. Some pilots have complained they didn`t know about that technology or how to deal with it.</p><p>Late last year, the FAA ordered Boeing (NYSE:BA) to tell airlines more explicitly exactly how crews should respond in those situations. Both the FAA and the NTSB are probing the crash in Ethiopia. It may be too early to know what caused the accident, but China, Indonesia, as well as some airlines are worried enough to ground their 737 Max 8s, raising concerns about Boeing`s most popular plane.</p><p>With monthly production steadily rising, the 737 generates billions in cash for Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>SHEILA KAHYAOGLU, JEFFERIES: Given the magnitude of how big the 737 is for growth drivers, that`s what`s driving the fear factor.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEBEAU: Here in the United States, American and Southwest are the two airlines that fly the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 max 8. While there were plenty of people on social media saying I`m not sure I want to get on this plane, both Southwest and American say the plane is solid and they stand by it and will continue flying it.</p><p>Guys, back to you.</p><p>HERERA: Phil, tell us more about the FAA`s directive late this afternoon and the agency`s decision not to ground the plane.</p><p>LEBEAU: Well, essentially what they`re saying, I`m looking at it right here, they just issued it. It basically is them, the FAA, saying, look, we haven`t seen enough here that tells us this plane is unsafe and it should be grounded immediately. In addition, as part of this airworthiness continuation from the FAA, they are saying that Boeing (NYSE:BA) will be making some design changes to the 737 Max 8 by no later than next month.</p><p>So, it`s partly them saying to the world, it`s safe. It`s also partly the FAA saying, Boeing (NYSE:BA) understands some of the changes that need to be made to this plane and they will be making those changes, at least by next month.</p><p>GRIFFETH: By the way, we should point out 350 of these Max 8s are in service around the world. There are about 54 airlines so, you know, there are other airlines that are going to have to make a decision, not just American and Southwest on this, right?</p><p>LEBEAU: Correct. Correct. And as the FAA goes, they pretty much set the table in terms of how the rest of the world views whether or not to use a particular aircraft.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Phil LeBeau in Chicago, as always, thanks, Phil.</p><p>LEBEAU: You bet.</p><p>HERERA: The bull market turned ten over the weekend and inevitably investors want to know if it can continue. Well, the chairman of the Federal Reserve was asked that very question during an interview last night on \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: I would just say there`s no reason why it can`t continue.</p><p>INTERVIEWER: For years?</p><p>POWELL: Eventually, expansions come to an end. The business cycle has not been repealed, but I would say there`s no reason why this economy cannot continue to expand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: But just last week, the man who is credited for calling the 2008 financial crisis said he feels long-term investors should get used to lower real returns.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEREMY GRANTHAM, GRANTHAM, MAYO, &amp; VAN OTTERLOO CO-FOUNDER: Over a long horizon, like 20 years, U.S. market will be delivering 2 or 3 percent real, and for the last 100 years, we`re used to it delivering perhaps 6 percent real. This is very painful -- it`s not the end of the world, but it`s going to break a lot of hearts when we`re right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, what should investors make of those comments from two very influential figures?</p><p>Joining us from Boston tonight, Art Hogan, who`s chief market strategist at National Securities.</p><p>Welcome back, Arthur.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES: Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Just last week, there were those who were saying we should get used to lower interest rates down the road with the Fed on hold at least for now. So, lower rates, lower returns. Do you agree?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, you know, I think you have to put things in context and talk about what time frame both of these speakers were talking about. Jay Powell was asked a question about them both continuing and he said, yes, he might have said for a couple of years. I think he`s talking short term.</p><p>Jimmy Grantham has been talking about this for a long time. And he`s certainly talking about what are real returns going to be like for the next 10 or 20 years. I think looking at this right now and saying the last ten years we had 17 1/2 percent average annual returns, we`re not going to see that for the next 10 years. We were coming out of a big hole with the S&amp;P 500 off 55 percent at its low point.</p><p>So, yes, obviously we bounced back significantly, but I think if you look at the natural history of the market, for us to expect normal returns over the next 10 years I think probably makes sense. Normal returns would be anywhere between 6 and 8 percent, which should be -- which is probably going to outpace fixed income. So, in my mind, the time horizon has to be set such as we look at this at a normal fashion. What does it mean to you and I, the investor? Would we make any changes to our investment plans because Jeremy Grantham thinks the total returns might be less than average?</p><p>HERERA: Right. You`ve always advocated, and I assume you still do, a balanced portfolio, take a look at it every once in a while, rebalance if you have to when we get those inflection points.</p><p>HOGAN: Sue, that`s the most important, to have a plan, right? And then to stick to that plan and try to tune out some of the noise. And part of sticking to that plan is knowing exactly you`re your risk tolerance is, setting that up so that you feel comfortable at night. You`re able to sleep with the portfolio that you have and then setting a calendar item such that you know that you have to look at this.</p><p>You know, has the movement in the market had me overweight in the market and not enough exposure to fixed income? So, that rebalancing on a regular basis certainly helps that. But you have to have a plan and want to stick to it.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Indeed. Art Hogan, words of wisdom as always, of National Securities. Good to see you again. Thanks, Art.</p><p>HOGAN: Good to see you. Thanks.</p><p>HERERA: Across the Atlantic, a critical Brexit vote will take place tomorrow. The country is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29th. But as of now, there is no deal outlining exactly how that will happen.</p><p>And as Willem Marx explains, the political fighting has become a parliamentary game of Brexit chutes and ladders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLEM MARX, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Several months ago, British Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated an agreement for the U.K. to leave the European Union. In January, a majority in the British parliament voted against it. Since then, May and members of her cabinet have shuttled between Brussels and Westminster, trying to make tweaks to the deal so the House of Commons can finally approve it.</p><p>March 29 is the current deadline for Brexit. That`s less than three weeks away. So, how can May get from here to there? Well, by March 12th she must offer parliament another up or down vote on her divorce agreement with or without revisions? If lawmakers approve it, she could still try to make Brexit happen by March 29th.</p><p>But it`s possible she might need more time to rush through all the necessary legislation in which case she could ask for a brief extension to the deadline with an uncertain end date. If her deal loses that first vote, May`s promised a separate second vote on March 13th. That could allow parliament to decide whether it wants the U.K. to exit the E.U. with a deal, just not May`s deal, or with no deal.</p><p>Now, if no deal wins the majority, then without any comprehensive arrangements over trade, customs or citizens` rights, Britain would still leave the E.U. on March 29th. But if enough lawmakers dislike that option, May`s guaranteed a third vote on March 14th to consider a possible extension. If that idea wins parliamentary support, the U.K. would ask Europe for more time to consider its options.</p><p>Theresa May wants to limit any extension to three months but it`s not clear whether the E.U. will suggest more time than that, demand less time than that, or offer no time at all. If that third vote fails on March 14th, the U.K. could be back to square one.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Willem Marx in London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>We begin with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). We mentioned this earlier, they were upgraded to buy from neutral at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Merrill Lynch. That analyst cites stability in its supply chain and the likely boost from the rollout of the 5G networks later this year. Price target now: $210. That stock rose about 3 1/2 percent to boost the Dow today to 178.90.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Nomura. The analyst cited its new focus on messaging and faster than expected transition to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stories. Price target now $215 and that stock rose about 1 1/2 percent to $172.07.</p><p>HERERA: Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) was downgraded to reduce from buy at Nomura. The analyst says Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) is under investing in research and development and that Oracle`s pace of buy backs can`t last forever. The price target is $42. The stock fell a fraction to $52.66.</p><p>FireEye was upgraded to overweight from neutral at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). The analyst cites the potential for billings to accelerate through the year. The price target is $20. The stock rose more than 5 percent to $16.97.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And still ahead, the budget battle taking shape in Washington.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Retail sales rebounded in January. Only a month after their biggest decline in ten years, Commerce Department reported this morning that sales were up 0.2 percent. That was better than expected thanks to strong demand for building materials. But December`s number was actually revised even lower to a decline of 1.6 percent compared to the originally reported decline of 1.2 percent.</p><p>HERERA: Business inventories rose in December as sales dropped. Economists say that could potentially lead to a pileup of unsold goods. Inventories are closely watched because they are a key component of gross domestic product. This release of this report was delayed because of the partial government shutdown.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The White House said its $4.7 trillion budget proposal to Capitol Hill today laying out its priorities for the next fiscal year.</p><p>And as Ylan Mui reports now, it is expected to spark a lot of debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: President Trump`s budget calls for a record $2.7 trillion in cuts to federal spending over the next decade. Most of that amount, $1.9 trillion, comes from changes to mandatory spending programs. Among them, new restrictions on Medicare`s prescription drug benefits and work requirements to qualify for Medicaid and food stamps.</p><p>But there are also new costs like making all of the current tax cuts permanent and a big increase in defense spending to $750 billion for next fiscal year alone.</p><p>RUSSELL VOUGHT, ACTING WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR: This budget is yet another physician responsible spending plan from President Trump. The president has continually called for fiscal restraint and will persist in his efforts to end the wasteful spending.</p><p>MUI: The president`s budget also relies on optimistic economic forecast, 3 percent growth over the next 10 years. That is way above the projections of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office which expects growth to come in under 2 percent.</p><p>Even so, the White House anticipates the deficit will still hit a trillion dollars this year and the budget won`t balance until 2034. On Capitol Hill, Democrats say Trump`s budget is dead on arrival, especially since it includes $8.6 billion for the border wall.</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY: I think this is actually a recipe for the decline of America. It`s very disappointing, and unfortunately, it`s the same type of budget that Republicans have been proposing for several years now, one that decimates important investments in human resources in the country and basically says the federal government has no role in making sure that we have an opportunity-based society.</p><p>MUI: Congress ultimately has the power of the purse, but the president has the power of the veto. These are just the opening salvos in what promises to be a bitter battle over the budget.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Nvidia goes shopping for more chips and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Nvidia is buying fellow chip maker Mellanox for just about $7 billion in what is Nvidia`s largest acquisition ever. The combination of the two chip makers is designed to reduce Nvidia`s dependence on the video game industry and increase its presence in the data center market. Shares of both companies were up 7 percent. Nvidia closed at $161.14 and Mellanox at $117.89.</p><p>Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX) is dropping its $18 billion hostile bid to take over Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) which would have created the world`s largest gold producer. Instead, the two have entered into a joint venture for their operations in Nevada. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says Newmont gets about a third of its revenue from Nevada while Barrick generates more than 40 percent from its operations in that state. Barrick shares rose 2 percent to $13.18, but Newmont fell a fraction to $33.45.</p><p>Deutsche Bank has reportedly agreed to hold talks with rival Commerce Bank to explore strategic options, including a possible merger between Germany`s two largest banks. Multiple reports suggest the talks were agreed to after the German government increase pressure to address Deutsche`s sagging performance. Deutsche Bank rose 5-1/2 percent to $9.12.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Helen of Troy (NASDAQ:HELE) is reportedly putting its beauty unit up for sale. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says the division which makes products like Pert shampoo and Revlon (NYSE:REV) hair dryers is expected to bring in about $300 million if sold. Shares rose more than 1 percent today to $111.97.</p><p>Tesla is now planning to raise prices on its high end vehicles by about 3 percent but the electric automaker will keep the most basic version of its Model 3 at $35,000. The company also said it`s going to keep more of its retail sales open -- locations open than it had originally planned. Shares were up more than 2 percent today to $290.92.</p><p>And Transocean (NYSE:RIG) has signed two new contracts for offshore oil rigs with Brazil`s Petrobras. The two deals combined are worth nearly a quarter of a billion dollars. And that is more than was expected. That`s why the stock was up about 6-1/2 percent today to $8.63.</p><p>America`s growing influence in the energy market was on display at one of the world`s biggest oil and energy conferences.</p><p>Brian Sullivan traveled to Texas where the talk at CERAWeek focused on the shale oil boom, geo politics and the future of OPEC.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: More than 5,000 people from over 70 countries drilling into Houston, attended by the CEOs of nearly every major oil and gas company, heads of state and two members of the Trump cabinet. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. CNBC spoke with Secretary Perry and we asked him how energy and national security come together right now.</p><p>RICK PERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE: So the United States with the shale boom, with this revolution that`s occurred in this country, and I might add with the development and the growth that we`re seeing in our renewables in the nuclear side of things, all of this basically says to the United States, you do not have to worry about being held hostage by any country in the world with any type of fuel. You can do it yourself right here.</p><p>SULLIVAN: American energy independence has been talked about by every president dating back to Richard Nixon. And while it is unlikely that all imports of crude oil will be replaced by U.S. production, Perry, a Texas native, believes that the energy boom will continue to reshape global markets, particularly with liquefied natural gas, a huge and growing market and a commodity that China desperately needs.</p><p>In fact, gas is so vital to Asia, it`s playing a big role in the trade talks. We asked Secretary Perry how important.</p><p>PERRY: It`s part of the mix. May not be the driver, but it`s always hanging out there as part of the matrix, if you will. So very important, and America now has the ability to use that in a very positive way when it comes to trade negotiations.</p><p>SULLIVAN: In fact, as we produce more oil and gas, we will need to sell more of both around the world. The International Energy Agency says that not only will crude exports keep growing, but we will soon pass Russia and even close in on Saudi Arabia on shipping oil around the world.</p><p>Energy expert Dan Yergin, a founder of this conference, says the United States is now the force to be reckoned with in oil and energy.</p><p>DAN YERGIN, IHS (NYSE:IHS) MARKIT VICE CHAIRMAN: The U.S. has a big impact. You see the kind of growth at the end of this year the U.S. will be producing around 13 million barrels a day, 2 1/2 times what it produced in 2008. What a big change, and I think the other producers around the world are really having to react to the amount of U.S. oil coming to the market.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Even just ten years ago, the women and men here would have barely talked about sending our oil and gas outside the country. All the conversation would have been about imports not exports. But America`s shale oil boom and energy renaissance has changed all of that. Just as it is changing energy policy both here and abroad. And made Texas and in many ways this conference the center of the energy world.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Brian Sullivan, Houston, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, building a brand. Wait until you see what some companies are doing to get noticed.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The South by Southwest Conference actually started 32 years ago as a music festival, but today it`s much more than that. Among other things, it has become a place where companies go to draw attention to their brand, and this year the marketing is very high tech and extreme.</p><p>Julia Boorstin takes us to Austin, Texas, tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: South by Southwest draws innovative tech companies from around the world. The demos, conversations and technologies here set the stage for trends to watch. Robots, electric scooters crowding the streets, virtual reality to enter new immersive worlds and augmented reality to make trying on earrings and glasses virtually possible.</p><p>And what would a tech conference be without drones? One company is here showcasing its personal drone aircraft set to take flight later this year.</p><p>MATT CHASEN, LIFT AIRCRAFT FOUNDER &amp; CEO: This is not the future of personal aviation. It`s the present of personal aviation. We`re starting now.</p><p>BOORSTIN: This conference in Austin is also a key battleground for media companies to reach the consumers who are here and encourage them to spread the word to their social media following. The most dramatic experiential marketing in Austin, HBO`s creation of the world of Westeros, drawing some 3,000 visitors and hoping to reach millions of fans.</p><p>HBO investing millions of dollars to bring fans into this world of \"Game of Thrones\", shipping in not just the iron throne but also costumes from Ireland, to outfit the 80 actors who have a script over 100 pages long. The goal: to make the experience as authentic and immersive as possible.</p><p>BOORSTIN: HBO spent six months working on this experience, including bringing in a dialect coach and creating original score for a choir. With this experience kicking off a nationwide partnership with the Red Cross.</p><p>STEVE CARDWEL, HBO DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM MARKETING: The Red Cross saw over 40 percent uplift in new donors. And that`s really the goal because it becomes a lifetime value proposition for these people.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) promoting its upcoming show \"Good Omens.\" The story of the demon and an angel with this garden of earthly delights, Vice creating a roller rink to promote it shows, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) creating a 1930-style speakeasy to promote its upcoming film the \"The Highwaymen\".</p><p>But it`s not just Hollywood here. High profile names from Washington making the trip to Austin to talk to this crowd about the future of regulation.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: We want to keep that marketplace competitive.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Senator Elizabeth Warren doubled down to break up big tech companies, while senator Amy Klobuchar advocated for taxing big tech companies` use of data.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Austin, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Before we go, here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street. The Dow gained 200 points. The Nasdaq was up 149, its best day in six weeks, and the S&amp;P 500 added 40.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, are you planning to take a drone down the West Side Highway now that the future is here?</p><p>HERERA: I think it could be. I really do. I won`t be in it but that`s OK.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Me either.</p><p>HERERA: That does it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>We`d like to remind you, this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Thank you very much for that support. Have a great evening. We`ll see you tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Concerns mount over Boeing`s newest plane following a deadly crash over the weekend and the FAA weighs in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Budget battle.  The White House tells Congress how it wants to spend your tax dollars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Energy boom.  Why the U.S. is now a force to be reckoned with in the global oil market and it`s reshaping the industry as we know it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March 11th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we do bid you a good evening, everybody.  And welcome.</p><p>We saw an epic tug of war on Wall Street today.  The Dow was down 242 points at its low when its highest priced and therefore most influential component Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell as much as 12 percent in response to that Ethiopian flight crash yesterday.</p><p>It involved the aerospace company`s newest model, and we`ll have more on that in just a moment.  But the Dow did stage a strong reversal because of a gain in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares after that company received a buy recommendation from an influential analyst.  Other stocks then followed suit and the Dow`s big decline became a big gain.</p><p>And at the close, the industrial average was up 200 points.  It closed at 25,650.  The Nasdaq was up 149, its best day in six weeks.  And the S&amp;P 500 added 40.</p><p>HERERA:  And now to Boeing (NYSE:BA) which fell more than 5 percent in trading today, though it was down as much as 12 percent during the trading session.  That is because of the plane crash over the weekend that involved Boeing`s 737 Max 8.  The FAA says the plane is still airworthy.  Investigators are on the scene looking to see if there`s a problem with the aircraft that many consider to be an important part of Boeing`s future.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One day after the crash of an Ethiopian airline 737 Max 8, investigators have recovered the black boxes that could explain what went wrong.  Shortly after takeoff, the pilot said there was a problem and struggled to control the plane before it crashed.  Eerily similar to what happened before a Lion Air 737 Max 8 crashed in the Java Sea last October.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB BOARD MEMBER:  It certainly is too early to rush to judgment.  The accidents may be similar.  There`s two different accidents in two different countries, but until we get a little more facts, we can`t compare them.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Boeing (NYSE:BA) says the Max 8 is safe, despite concerns the plane`s design could create certain situations where faulty data might force the Max 8`s automatic anti-stall technology to kick in.  When that happens, it pushes the plane`s nose lower.  Some pilots have complained they didn`t know about that technology or how to deal with it.</p><p>Late last year, the FAA ordered Boeing (NYSE:BA) to tell airlines more explicitly exactly how crews should respond in those situations.  Both the FAA and the NTSB are probing the crash in Ethiopia.  It may be too early to know what caused the accident, but China, Indonesia, as well as some airlines are worried enough to ground their 737 Max 8s, raising concerns about Boeing`s most popular plane.</p><p>With monthly production steadily rising, the 737 generates billions in cash for Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>SHEILA KAHYAOGLU, JEFFERIES:  Given the magnitude of how big the 737 is for growth drivers, that`s what`s driving the fear factor.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEBEAU:  Here in the United States, American and Southwest are the two airlines that fly the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 max 8.  While there were plenty of people on social media saying I`m not sure I want to get on this plane, both Southwest and American say the plane is solid and they stand by it and will continue flying it.</p><p>Guys, back to you.</p><p>HERERA:  Phil, tell us more about the FAA`s directive late this afternoon and the agency`s decision not to ground the plane.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Well, essentially what they`re saying, I`m looking at it right here, they just issued it.  It basically is them, the FAA, saying, look, we haven`t seen enough here that tells us this plane is unsafe and it should be grounded immediately.  In addition, as part of this airworthiness continuation from the FAA, they are saying that Boeing (NYSE:BA) will be making some design changes to the 737 Max 8 by no later than next month.</p><p>So, it`s partly them saying to the world, it`s safe.  It`s also partly the FAA saying, Boeing (NYSE:BA) understands some of the changes that need to be made to this plane and they will be making those changes, at least by next month.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  By the way, we should point out 350 of these Max 8s are in service around the world.  There are about 54 airlines so, you know, there are other airlines that are going to have to make a decision, not just American and Southwest on this, right?</p><p>LEBEAU:  Correct.  Correct.  And as the FAA goes, they pretty much set the table in terms of how the rest of the world views whether or not to use a particular aircraft.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Phil LeBeau in Chicago, as always, thanks, Phil.</p><p>LEBEAU:  You bet.</p><p>HERERA:  The bull market turned ten over the weekend and inevitably investors want to know if it can continue.  Well, the chairman of the Federal Reserve was asked that very question during an interview last night on \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN:  I would just say there`s no reason why it can`t continue.</p><p>INTERVIEWER:  For years?</p><p>POWELL:  Eventually, expansions come to an end.  The business cycle has not been repealed, but I would say there`s no reason why this economy cannot continue to expand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But just last week, the man who is credited for calling the 2008 financial crisis said he feels long-term investors should get used to lower real returns.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEREMY GRANTHAM, GRANTHAM, MAYO, &amp; VAN OTTERLOO CO-FOUNDER:  Over a long horizon, like 20 years, U.S. market will be delivering 2 or 3 percent real, and for the last 100 years, we`re used to it delivering perhaps 6 percent real.  This is very painful -- it`s not the end of the world, but it`s going to break a lot of hearts when we`re right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, what should investors make of those comments from two very influential figures?</p><p>Joining us from Boston tonight, Art Hogan, who`s chief market strategist at National Securities.</p><p>Welcome back, Arthur.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Just last week, there were those who were saying we should get used to lower interest rates down the road with the Fed on hold at least for now.  So, lower rates, lower returns.  Do you agree?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, you know, I think you have to put things in context and talk about what time frame both of these speakers were talking about.  Jay Powell was asked a question about them both continuing and he said, yes, he might have said for a couple of years.  I think he`s talking short term.</p><p>Jimmy Grantham has been talking about this for a long time.  And he`s certainly talking about what are real returns going to be like for the next 10 or 20 years.  I think looking at this right now and saying the last ten years we had 17 1/2 percent average annual returns, we`re not going to see that for the next 10 years.  We were coming out of a big hole with the S&amp;P 500 off 55 percent at its low point.</p><p>So, yes, obviously we bounced back significantly, but I think if you look at the natural history of the market, for us to expect normal returns over the next 10 years I think probably makes sense.  Normal returns would be anywhere between 6 and 8 percent, which should be -- which is probably going to outpace fixed income.  So, in my mind, the time horizon has to be set such as we look at this at a normal fashion.  What does it mean to you and I, the investor?  Would we make any changes to our investment plans because Jeremy Grantham thinks the total returns might be less than average?</p><p>HERERA:  Right.  You`ve always advocated, and I assume you still do, a balanced portfolio, take a look at it every once in a while, rebalance if you have to when we get those inflection points.</p><p>HOGAN:  Sue, that`s the most important, to have a plan, right?  And then to stick to that plan and try to tune out some of the noise.  And part of sticking to that plan is knowing exactly you`re your risk tolerance is, setting that up so that you feel comfortable at night.  You`re able to sleep with the portfolio that you have and then setting a calendar item such that you know that you have to look at this.</p><p>You know, has the movement in the market had me overweight in the market and not enough exposure to fixed income?  So, that rebalancing on a regular basis certainly helps that.  But you have to have a plan and want to stick to it.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  Art Hogan, words of wisdom as always, of National Securities.  Good to see you again.  Thanks, Art.</p><p>HOGAN:  Good to see you.  Thanks.</p><p>HERERA:  Across the Atlantic, a critical Brexit vote will take place tomorrow.  The country is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29th.  But as of now, there is no deal outlining exactly how that will happen.</p><p>And as Willem Marx explains, the political fighting has become a parliamentary game of Brexit chutes and ladders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLEM MARX, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Several months ago, British Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated an agreement for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  In January, a majority in the British parliament voted against it.  Since then, May and members of her cabinet have shuttled between Brussels and Westminster, trying to make tweaks to the deal so the House of Commons can finally approve it.</p><p>March 29 is the current deadline for Brexit.  That`s less than three weeks away.  So, how can May get from here to there?  Well, by March 12th she must offer parliament another up or down vote on her divorce agreement with or without revisions?  If lawmakers approve it, she could still try to make Brexit happen by March 29th.</p><p>But it`s possible she might need more time to rush through all the necessary legislation in which case she could ask for a brief extension to the deadline with an uncertain end date.  If her deal loses that first vote, May`s promised a separate second vote on March 13th.  That could allow parliament to decide whether it wants the U.K. to exit the E.U. with a deal, just not May`s deal, or with no deal.</p><p>Now, if no deal wins the majority, then without any comprehensive arrangements over trade, customs or citizens` rights, Britain would still leave the E.U. on March 29th.  But if enough lawmakers dislike that option, May`s guaranteed a third vote on March 14th to consider a possible extension.  If that idea wins parliamentary support, the U.K. would ask Europe for more time to consider its options.</p><p>Theresa May wants to limit any extension to three months but it`s not clear whether the E.U. will suggest more time than that, demand less time than that, or offer no time at all.  If that third vote fails on March 14th, the U.K. could be back to square one.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Willem Marx in London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>We begin with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  We mentioned this earlier, they were upgraded to buy from neutral at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Merrill Lynch.  That analyst cites stability in its supply chain and the likely boost from the rollout of the 5G networks later this year.  Price target now: $210.  That stock rose about 3 1/2 percent to boost the Dow today to 178.90.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Nomura.  The analyst cited its new focus on messaging and faster than expected transition to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stories.  Price target now $215 and that stock rose about 1 1/2 percent to $172.07.</p><p>HERERA:  Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) was downgraded to reduce from buy at Nomura.  The analyst says Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) is under investing in research and development and that Oracle`s pace of buy backs can`t last forever.  The price target is $42.  The stock fell a fraction to $52.66.</p><p>FireEye was upgraded to overweight from neutral at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).  The analyst cites the potential for billings to accelerate through the year.  The price target is $20.  The stock rose more than 5 percent to $16.97.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, the budget battle taking shape in Washington.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Retail sales rebounded in January.  Only a month after their biggest decline in ten years, Commerce Department reported this morning that sales were up 0.2 percent.  That was better than expected thanks to strong demand for building materials.  But December`s number was actually revised even lower to a decline of 1.6 percent compared to the originally reported decline of 1.2 percent.</p><p>HERERA:  Business inventories rose in December as sales dropped.  Economists say that could potentially lead to a pileup of unsold goods.  Inventories are closely watched because they are a key component of gross domestic product.  This release of this report was delayed because of the partial government shutdown.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The White House said its $4.7 trillion budget proposal to Capitol Hill today laying out its priorities for the next fiscal year.</p><p>And as Ylan Mui reports now, it is expected to spark a lot of debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump`s budget calls for a record $2.7 trillion in cuts to federal spending over the next decade.  Most of that amount, $1.9 trillion, comes from changes to mandatory spending programs.  Among them, new restrictions on Medicare`s prescription drug benefits and work requirements to qualify for Medicaid and food stamps.</p><p>But there are also new costs like making all of the current tax cuts permanent and a big increase in defense spending to $750 billion for next fiscal year alone.</p><p>RUSSELL VOUGHT, ACTING WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR:  This budget is yet another physician responsible spending plan from President Trump.  The president has continually called for fiscal restraint and will persist in his efforts to end the wasteful spending.</p><p>MUI:  The president`s budget also relies on optimistic economic forecast, 3 percent growth over the next 10 years.  That is way above the projections of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office which expects growth to come in under 2 percent.</p><p>Even so, the White House anticipates the deficit will still hit a trillion dollars this year and the budget won`t balance until 2034.  On Capitol Hill, Democrats say Trump`s budget is dead on arrival, especially since it includes $8.6 billion for the border wall.</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  I think this is actually a recipe for the decline of America.  It`s very disappointing, and unfortunately, it`s the same type of budget that Republicans have been proposing for several years now, one that decimates important investments in human resources in the country and basically says the federal government has no role in making sure that we have an opportunity-based society.</p><p>MUI:  Congress ultimately has the power of the purse, but the president has the power of the veto.  These are just the opening salvos in what promises to be a bitter battle over the budget.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Nvidia goes shopping for more chips and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Nvidia is buying fellow chip maker Mellanox for just about $7 billion in what is Nvidia`s largest acquisition ever.  The combination of the two chip makers is designed to reduce Nvidia`s dependence on the video game industry and increase its presence in the data center market.  Shares of both companies were up 7 percent.  Nvidia closed at $161.14 and Mellanox at $117.89.</p><p>Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX) is dropping its $18 billion hostile bid to take over Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) which would have created the world`s largest gold producer.  Instead, the two have entered into a joint venture for their operations in Nevada.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says Newmont gets about a third of its revenue from Nevada while Barrick generates more than 40 percent from its operations in that state.  Barrick shares rose 2 percent to $13.18, but Newmont fell a fraction to $33.45.</p><p>Deutsche Bank has reportedly agreed to hold talks with rival Commerce Bank to explore strategic options, including a possible merger between Germany`s two largest banks.  Multiple reports suggest the talks were agreed to after the German government increase pressure to address Deutsche`s sagging performance.  Deutsche Bank rose 5-1/2 percent to $9.12.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Helen of Troy (NASDAQ:HELE) is reportedly putting its beauty unit up for sale.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says the division which makes products like Pert shampoo and Revlon (NYSE:REV) hair dryers is expected to bring in about $300 million if sold.  Shares rose more than 1 percent today to $111.97.</p><p>Tesla is now planning to raise prices on its high end vehicles by about 3 percent but the electric automaker will keep the most basic version of its Model 3 at $35,000.  The company also said it`s going to keep more of its retail sales open -- locations open than it had originally planned.  Shares were up more than 2 percent today to $290.92.</p><p>And Transocean (NYSE:RIG) has signed two new contracts for offshore oil rigs with Brazil`s Petrobras.  The two deals combined are worth nearly a quarter of a billion dollars.  And that is more than was expected.  That`s why the stock was up about 6-1/2 percent today to $8.63.</p><p>America`s growing influence in the energy market was on display at one of the world`s biggest oil and energy conferences.</p><p>Brian Sullivan traveled to Texas where the talk at CERAWeek focused on the shale oil boom, geo politics and the future of OPEC.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  More than 5,000 people from over 70 countries drilling into Houston, attended by the CEOs of nearly every major oil and gas company, heads of state and two members of the Trump cabinet.  Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.  CNBC spoke with Secretary Perry and we asked him how energy and national security come together right now.</p><p>RICK PERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE:  So the United States with the shale boom, with this revolution that`s occurred in this country, and I might add with the development and the growth that we`re seeing in our renewables in the nuclear side of things, all of this basically says to the United States, you do not have to worry about being held hostage by any country in the world with any type of fuel.  You can do it yourself right here.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  American energy independence has been talked about by every president dating back to Richard Nixon.  And while it is unlikely that all imports of crude oil will be replaced by U.S. production, Perry, a Texas native, believes that the energy boom will continue to reshape global markets, particularly with liquefied natural gas, a huge and growing market and a commodity that China desperately needs.</p><p>In fact, gas is so vital to Asia, it`s playing a big role in the trade talks.  We asked Secretary Perry how important.</p><p>PERRY:  It`s part of the mix.  May not be the driver, but it`s always hanging out there as part of the matrix, if you will.  So very important, and America now has the ability to use that in a very positive way when it comes to trade negotiations.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  In fact, as we produce more oil and gas, we will need to sell more of both around the world.  The International Energy Agency says that not only will crude exports keep growing, but we will soon pass Russia and even close in on Saudi Arabia on shipping oil around the world.</p><p>Energy expert Dan Yergin, a founder of this conference, says the United States is now the force to be reckoned with in oil and energy.</p><p>DAN YERGIN, IHS (NYSE:IHS) MARKIT VICE CHAIRMAN:  The U.S. has a big impact.  You see the kind of growth at the end of this year the U.S. will be producing around 13 million barrels a day, 2 1/2 times what it produced in 2008.  What a big change, and I think the other producers around the world are really having to react to the amount of U.S. oil coming to the market.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  Even just ten years ago, the women and men here would have barely talked about sending our oil and gas outside the country.  All the conversation would have been about imports not exports.  But America`s shale oil boom and energy renaissance has changed all of that.  Just as it is changing energy policy both here and abroad.  And made Texas and in many ways this conference the center of the energy world.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Brian Sullivan, Houston, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, building a brand.  Wait until you see what some companies are doing to get noticed.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The South by Southwest Conference actually started 32 years ago as a music festival, but today it`s much more than that.  Among other things, it has become a place where companies go to draw attention to their brand, and this year the marketing is very high tech and extreme.</p><p>Julia Boorstin takes us to Austin, Texas, tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  South by Southwest draws innovative tech companies from around the world.  The demos, conversations and technologies here set the stage for trends to watch.  Robots, electric scooters crowding the streets, virtual reality to enter new immersive worlds and augmented reality to make trying on earrings and glasses virtually possible.</p><p>And what would a tech conference be without drones?  One company is here showcasing its personal drone aircraft set to take flight later this year.</p><p>MATT CHASEN, LIFT AIRCRAFT FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  This is not the future of personal aviation.  It`s the present of personal aviation.  We`re starting now.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  This conference in Austin is also a key battleground for media companies to reach the consumers who are here and encourage them to spread the word to their social media following.  The most dramatic experiential marketing in Austin, HBO`s creation of the world of Westeros, drawing some 3,000 visitors and hoping to reach millions of fans.</p><p>HBO investing millions of dollars to bring fans into this world of \"Game of Thrones\", shipping in not just the iron throne but also costumes from Ireland, to outfit the 80 actors who have a script over 100 pages long.  The goal: to make the experience as authentic and immersive as possible.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  HBO spent six months working on this experience, including bringing in a dialect coach and creating original score for a choir.  With this experience kicking off a nationwide partnership with the Red Cross.</p><p>STEVE CARDWEL, HBO DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM MARKETING:  The Red Cross saw over 40 percent uplift in new donors.  And that`s really the goal because it becomes a lifetime value proposition for these people.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) promoting its upcoming show \"Good Omens.\"  The story of the demon and an angel with this garden of earthly delights, Vice creating a roller rink to promote it shows, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) creating a 1930-style speakeasy to promote its upcoming film the \"The Highwaymen\".</p><p>But it`s not just Hollywood here.  High profile names from Washington making the trip to Austin to talk to this crowd about the future of regulation.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  We want to keep that marketplace competitive.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Senator Elizabeth Warren doubled down to break up big tech companies, while senator Amy Klobuchar advocated for taxing big tech companies` use of data.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Austin, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street.  The Dow gained 200 points.  The Nasdaq was up 149, its best day in six weeks, and the S&amp;P 500 added 40.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, are you planning to take a drone down the West Side Highway now that the future is here?</p><p>HERERA:  I think it could be.  I really do.  I won`t be in it but that`s OK.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Me either.</p><p>HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>We`d like to remind you, this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.

That is because of the plane crash over the weekend that involved Boeing`s 737 Max 8.  The FAA says the plane is still airworthy.  Investigators are on the scene looking to see if there`s a problem with the aircraft that many consider to be an important part of Boeing`s future.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  One day after the crash of an Ethiopian airline 737 Max 8, investigators have recovered the black boxes that could explain what went wrong.  Shortly after takeoff, the pilot said there was a problem and struggled to control the plane before it crashed.  Eerily similar to what happened before a Lion Air 737 Max 8 crashed in the Java Sea last October.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB BOARD MEMBER:  It certainly is too early to rush to judgment.  The accidents may be similar.  There`s two different accidents in two different countries, but until we get a little more facts, we can`t compare them.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Boeing (NYSE:BA) says the Max 8 is safe, despite concerns the plane`s design could create certain situations where faulty data might force the Max 8`s automatic anti-stall technology to kick in.  When that happens, it pushes the plane`s nose lower.  Some pilots have complained they didn`t know about that technology or how to deal with it.</p><p>Late last year, the FAA ordered Boeing (NYSE:BA) to tell airlines more explicitly exactly how crews should respond in those situations.  Both the FAA and the NTSB are probing the crash in Ethiopia.  It may be too early to know what caused the accident, but China, Indonesia, as well as some airlines are worried enough to ground their 737 Max 8s, raising concerns about Boeing`s most popular plane.</p><p>With monthly production steadily rising, the 737 generates billions in cash for Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>SHEILA KAHYAOGLU, JEFFERIES:  Given the magnitude of how big the 737 is for growth drivers, that`s what`s driving the fear factor.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEBEAU:  Here in the United States, American and Southwest are the two airlines that fly the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 max 8.  While there were plenty of people on social media saying I`m not sure I want to get on this plane, both Southwest and American say the plane is solid and they stand by it and will continue flying it.</p><p>Guys, back to you.</p><p>HERERA:  Phil, tell us more about the FAA`s directive late this afternoon and the agency`s decision not to ground the plane.</p><p>LEBEAU:  Well, essentially what they`re saying, I`m looking at it right here, they just issued it.  It basically is them, the FAA, saying, look, we haven`t seen enough here that tells us this plane is unsafe and it should be grounded immediately.  In addition, as part of this airworthiness continuation from the FAA, they are saying that Boeing (NYSE:BA) will be making some design changes to the 737 Max 8 by no later than next month.</p><p>So, it`s partly them saying to the world, it`s safe.  It`s also partly the FAA saying, Boeing (NYSE:BA) understands some of the changes that need to be made to this plane and they will be making those changes, at least by next month.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  By the way, we should point out 350 of these Max 8s are in service around the world.  There are about 54 airlines so, you know, there are other airlines that are going to have to make a decision, not just American and Southwest on this, right?</p><p>LEBEAU:  Correct.  Correct.  And as the FAA goes, they pretty much set the table in terms of how the rest of the world views whether or not to use a particular aircraft.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Phil LeBeau in Chicago, as always, thanks, Phil.</p><p>LEBEAU:  You bet.</p><p>HERERA:  The bull market turned ten over the weekend and inevitably investors want to know if it can continue.  Well, the chairman of the Federal Reserve was asked that very question during an interview last night on \"60 Minutes.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN:  I would just say there`s no reason why it can`t continue.</p><p>INTERVIEWER:  For years?</p><p>POWELL:  Eventually, expansions come to an end.  The business cycle has not been repealed, but I would say there`s no reason why this economy cannot continue to expand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But just last week, the man who is credited for calling the 2008 financial crisis said he feels long-term investors should get used to lower real returns.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEREMY GRANTHAM, GRANTHAM, MAYO, &amp; VAN OTTERLOO CO-FOUNDER:  Over a long horizon, like 20 years, U.S. market will be delivering 2 or 3 percent real, and for the last 100 years, we`re used to it delivering perhaps 6 percent real.  This is very painful -- it`s not the end of the world, but it`s going to break a lot of hearts when we`re right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, what should investors make of those comments from two very influential figures?</p><p>Joining us from Boston tonight, Art Hogan, who`s chief market strategist at National Securities.</p><p>Welcome back, Arthur.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Just last week, there were those who were saying we should get used to lower interest rates down the road with the Fed on hold at least for now.  So, lower rates, lower returns.  Do you agree?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, you know, I think you have to put things in context and talk about what time frame both of these speakers were talking about.  Jay Powell was asked a question about them both continuing and he said, yes, he might have said for a couple of years.  I think he`s talking short term.</p><p>Jimmy Grantham has been talking about this for a long time.  And he`s certainly talking about what are real returns going to be like for the next 10 or 20 years.  I think looking at this right now and saying the last ten years we had 17 1/2 percent average annual returns, we`re not going to see that for the next 10 years.  We were coming out of a big hole with the S&amp;P 500 off 55 percent at its low point.</p><p>So, yes, obviously we bounced back significantly, but I think if you look at the natural history of the market, for us to expect normal returns over the next 10 years I think probably makes sense.  Normal returns would be anywhere between 6 and 8 percent, which should be -- which is probably going to outpace fixed income.  So, in my mind, the time horizon has to be set such as we look at this at a normal fashion.  What does it mean to you and I, the investor?  Would we make any changes to our investment plans because Jeremy Grantham thinks the total returns might be less than average?</p><p>HERERA:  Right.  You`ve always advocated, and I assume you still do, a balanced portfolio, take a look at it every once in a while, rebalance if you have to when we get those inflection points.</p><p>HOGAN:  Sue, that`s the most important, to have a plan, right?  And then to stick to that plan and try to tune out some of the noise.  And part of sticking to that plan is knowing exactly you`re your risk tolerance is, setting that up so that you feel comfortable at night.  You`re able to sleep with the portfolio that you have and then setting a calendar item such that you know that you have to look at this.</p><p>You know, has the movement in the market had me overweight in the market and not enough exposure to fixed income?  So, that rebalancing on a regular basis certainly helps that.  But you have to have a plan and want to stick to it.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Indeed.  Art Hogan, words of wisdom as always, of National Securities.  Good to see you again.  Thanks, Art.</p><p>HOGAN:  Good to see you.  Thanks.</p><p>HERERA:  Across the Atlantic, a critical Brexit vote will take place tomorrow.  The country is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29th.  But as of now, there is no deal outlining exactly how that will happen.</p><p>And as Willem Marx explains, the political fighting has become a parliamentary game of Brexit chutes and ladders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLEM MARX, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Several months ago, British Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated an agreement for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  In January, a majority in the British parliament voted against it.  Since then, May and members of her cabinet have shuttled between Brussels and Westminster, trying to make tweaks to the deal so the House of Commons can finally approve it.</p><p>March 29 is the current deadline for Brexit.  That`s less than three weeks away.  So, how can May get from here to there?  Well, by March 12th she must offer parliament another up or down vote on her divorce agreement with or without revisions?  If lawmakers approve it, she could still try to make Brexit happen by March 29th.</p><p>But it`s possible she might need more time to rush through all the necessary legislation in which case she could ask for a brief extension to the deadline with an uncertain end date.  If her deal loses that first vote, May`s promised a separate second vote on March 13th.  That could allow parliament to decide whether it wants the U.K. to exit the E.U. with a deal, just not May`s deal, or with no deal.</p><p>Now, if no deal wins the majority, then without any comprehensive arrangements over trade, customs or citizens` rights, Britain would still leave the E.U. on March 29th.  But if enough lawmakers dislike that option, May`s guaranteed a third vote on March 14th to consider a possible extension.  If that idea wins parliamentary support, the U.K. would ask Europe for more time to consider its options.</p><p>Theresa May wants to limit any extension to three months but it`s not clear whether the E.U. will suggest more time than that, demand less time than that, or offer no time at all.  If that third vote fails on March 14th, the U.K. could be back to square one.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Willem Marx in London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>We begin with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  We mentioned this earlier, they were upgraded to buy from neutral at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Merrill Lynch.  That analyst cites stability in its supply chain and the likely boost from the rollout of the 5G networks later this year.  Price target now: $210.  That stock rose about 3 1/2 percent to boost the Dow today to 178.90.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was upgraded to buy from neutral at Nomura.  The analyst cited its new focus on messaging and faster than expected transition to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stories.  Price target now $215 and that stock rose about 1 1/2 percent to $172.07.</p><p>HERERA:  Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) was downgraded to reduce from buy at Nomura.  The analyst says Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) is under investing in research and development and that Oracle`s pace of buy backs can`t last forever.  The price target is $42.  The stock fell a fraction to $52.66.</p><p>FireEye was upgraded to overweight from neutral at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).  The analyst cites the potential for billings to accelerate through the year.  The price target is $20.  The stock rose more than 5 percent to $16.97.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And still ahead, the budget battle taking shape in Washington.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Retail sales rebounded in January.  Only a month after their biggest decline in ten years, Commerce Department reported this morning that sales were up 0.2 percent.  That was better than expected thanks to strong demand for building materials.  But December`s number was actually revised even lower to a decline of 1.6 percent compared to the originally reported decline of 1.2 percent.</p><p>HERERA:  Business inventories rose in December as sales dropped.  Economists say that could potentially lead to a pileup of unsold goods.  Inventories are closely watched because they are a key component of gross domestic product.  This release of this report was delayed because of the partial government shutdown.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The White House said its $4.7 trillion budget proposal to Capitol Hill today laying out its priorities for the next fiscal year.</p><p>And as Ylan Mui reports now, it is expected to spark a lot of debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump`s budget calls for a record $2.7 trillion in cuts to federal spending over the next decade.  Most of that amount, $1.9 trillion, comes from changes to mandatory spending programs.  Among them, new restrictions on Medicare`s prescription drug benefits and work requirements to qualify for Medicaid and food stamps.</p><p>But there are also new costs like making all of the current tax cuts permanent and a big increase in defense spending to $750 billion for next fiscal year alone.</p><p>RUSSELL VOUGHT, ACTING WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR:  This budget is yet another physician responsible spending plan from President Trump.  The president has continually called for fiscal restraint and will persist in his efforts to end the wasteful spending.</p><p>MUI:  The president`s budget also relies on optimistic economic forecast, 3 percent growth over the next 10 years.  That is way above the projections of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office which expects growth to come in under 2 percent.</p><p>Even so, the White House anticipates the deficit will still hit a trillion dollars this year and the budget won`t balance until 2034.  On Capitol Hill, Democrats say Trump`s budget is dead on arrival, especially since it includes $8.6 billion for the border wall.</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  I think this is actually a recipe for the decline of America.  It`s very disappointing, and unfortunately, it`s the same type of budget that Republicans have been proposing for several years now, one that decimates important investments in human resources in the country and basically says the federal government has no role in making sure that we have an opportunity-based society.</p><p>MUI:  Congress ultimately has the power of the purse, but the president has the power of the veto.  These are just the opening salvos in what promises to be a bitter battle over the budget.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Nvidia goes shopping for more chips and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Nvidia is buying fellow chip maker Mellanox for just about $7 billion in what is Nvidia`s largest acquisition ever.  The combination of the two chip makers is designed to reduce Nvidia`s dependence on the video game industry and increase its presence in the data center market.  Shares of both companies were up 7 percent.  Nvidia closed at $161.14 and Mellanox at $117.89.</p><p>Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX) is dropping its $18 billion hostile bid to take over Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) which would have created the world`s largest gold producer.  Instead, the two have entered into a joint venture for their operations in Nevada.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says Newmont gets about a third of its revenue from Nevada while Barrick generates more than 40 percent from its operations in that state.  Barrick shares rose 2 percent to $13.18, but Newmont fell a fraction to $33.45.</p><p>Deutsche Bank has reportedly agreed to hold talks with rival Commerce Bank to explore strategic options, including a possible merger between Germany`s two largest banks.  Multiple reports suggest the talks were agreed to after the German government increase pressure to address Deutsche`s sagging performance.  Deutsche Bank rose 5-1/2 percent to $9.12.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Helen of Troy (NASDAQ:HELE) is reportedly putting its beauty unit up for sale.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says the division which makes products like Pert shampoo and Revlon (NYSE:REV) hair dryers is expected to bring in about $300 million if sold.  Shares rose more than 1 percent today to $111.97.</p><p>Tesla is now planning to raise prices on its high end vehicles by about 3 percent but the electric automaker will keep the most basic version of its Model 3 at $35,000.  The company also said it`s going to keep more of its retail sales open -- locations open than it had originally planned.  Shares were up more than 2 percent today to $290.92.</p><p>And Transocean (NYSE:RIG) has signed two new contracts for offshore oil rigs with Brazil`s Petrobras.  The two deals combined are worth nearly a quarter of a billion dollars.  And that is more than was expected.  That`s why the stock was up about 6-1/2 percent today to $8.63.</p><p>America`s growing influence in the energy market was on display at one of the world`s biggest oil and energy conferences.</p><p>Brian Sullivan traveled to Texas where the talk at CERAWeek focused on the shale oil boom, geo politics and the future of OPEC.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  More than 5,000 people from over 70 countries drilling into Houston, attended by the CEOs of nearly every major oil and gas company, heads of state and two members of the Trump cabinet.  Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.  CNBC spoke with Secretary Perry and we asked him how energy and national security come together right now.</p><p>RICK PERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE:  So the United States with the shale boom, with this revolution that`s occurred in this country, and I might add with the development and the growth that we`re seeing in our renewables in the nuclear side of things, all of this basically says to the United States, you do not have to worry about being held hostage by any country in the world with any type of fuel.  You can do it yourself right here.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  American energy independence has been talked about by every president dating back to Richard Nixon.  And while it is unlikely that all imports of crude oil will be replaced by U.S. production, Perry, a Texas native, believes that the energy boom will continue to reshape global markets, particularly with liquefied natural gas, a huge and growing market and a commodity that China desperately needs.</p><p>In fact, gas is so vital to Asia, it`s playing a big role in the trade talks.  We asked Secretary Perry how important.</p><p>PERRY:  It`s part of the mix.  May not be the driver, but it`s always hanging out there as part of the matrix, if you will.  So very important, and America now has the ability to use that in a very positive way when it comes to trade negotiations.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  In fact, as we produce more oil and gas, we will need to sell more of both around the world.  The International Energy Agency says that not only will crude exports keep growing, but we will soon pass Russia and even close in on Saudi Arabia on shipping oil around the world.</p><p>Energy expert Dan Yergin, a founder of this conference, says the United States is now the force to be reckoned with in oil and energy.</p><p>DAN YERGIN, IHS (NYSE:IHS) MARKIT VICE CHAIRMAN:  The U.S. has a big impact.  You see the kind of growth at the end of this year the U.S. will be producing around 13 million barrels a day, 2 1/2 times what it produced in 2008.  What a big change, and I think the other producers around the world are really having to react to the amount of U.S. oil coming to the market.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  Even just ten years ago, the women and men here would have barely talked about sending our oil and gas outside the country.  All the conversation would have been about imports not exports.  But America`s shale oil boom and energy renaissance has changed all of that.  Just as it is changing energy policy both here and abroad.  And made Texas and in many ways this conference the center of the energy world.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Brian Sullivan, Houston, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, building a brand.  Wait until you see what some companies are doing to get noticed.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The South by Southwest Conference actually started 32 years ago as a music festival, but today it`s much more than that.  Among other things, it has become a place where companies go to draw attention to their brand, and this year the marketing is very high tech and extreme.</p><p>Julia Boorstin takes us to Austin, Texas, tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  South by Southwest draws innovative tech companies from around the world.  The demos, conversations and technologies here set the stage for trends to watch.  Robots, electric scooters crowding the streets, virtual reality to enter new immersive worlds and augmented reality to make trying on earrings and glasses virtually possible.</p><p>And what would a tech conference be without drones?  One company is here showcasing its personal drone aircraft set to take flight later this year.</p><p>MATT CHASEN, LIFT AIRCRAFT FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  This is not the future of personal aviation.  It`s the present of personal aviation.  We`re starting now.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  This conference in Austin is also a key battleground for media companies to reach the consumers who are here and encourage them to spread the word to their social media following.  The most dramatic experiential marketing in Austin, HBO`s creation of the world of Westeros, drawing some 3,000 visitors and hoping to reach millions of fans.</p><p>HBO investing millions of dollars to bring fans into this world of \"Game of Thrones\", shipping in not just the iron throne but also costumes from Ireland, to outfit the 80 actors who have a script over 100 pages long.  The goal: to make the experience as authentic and immersive as possible.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  HBO spent six months working on this experience, including bringing in a dialect coach and creating original score for a choir.  With this experience kicking off a nationwide partnership with the Red Cross.</p><p>STEVE CARDWEL, HBO DIRECTOR OF PROGRAM MARKETING:  The Red Cross saw over 40 percent uplift in new donors.  And that`s really the goal because it becomes a lifetime value proposition for these people.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) promoting its upcoming show \"Good Omens.\"  The story of the demon and an angel with this garden of earthly delights, Vice creating a roller rink to promote it shows, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) creating a 1930-style speakeasy to promote its upcoming film the \"The Highwaymen\".</p><p>But it`s not just Hollywood here.  High profile names from Washington making the trip to Austin to talk to this crowd about the future of regulation.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  We want to keep that marketplace competitive.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Senator Elizabeth Warren doubled down to break up big tech companies, while senator Amy Klobuchar advocated for taxing big tech companies` use of data.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Austin, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Before we go, here`s a look at the final numbers on Wall Street.  The Dow gained 200 points.  The Nasdaq was up 149, its best day in six weeks, and the S&amp;P 500 added 40.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, are you planning to take a drone down the West Side Highway now that the future is here?</p><p>HERERA:  I think it could be.  I really do.  I won`t be in it but that`s OK.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Me either.</p><p>HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>We`d like to remind you, this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.

The stock closes above $600 for the first time, as the company promises investors their first dividend in over a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Erika Miller in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)`s new dividend may be getting a lot of attention, but I`ll tell you why dividends overall may fall out of favor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And the housing market is shaping up for its best spring selling season in years. But will it be good enough to show a market on the mend?</p><p>It`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March 19th.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT with Susie Gharib and Tom Hudson.</p><p>Made possibly by --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL AD)</p><p>GHARIB: Good evening, everyone.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed above $600 a share for the first time ever, surging almost 3 percent. Investors gobbled up the stock, after the company announced it will pay a quarterly dividend and launch a stock buyback.</p><p>So, Tom, first, it was the new iPad. Now, this dividend.</p><p>HUDSON: Boy, what a couple of days here and a big weekend for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholder now. But today, the investors have been calling for a dividend from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for a long, long time.</p><p>So, here`s what shareholders can now expect. They`ll get a quarterly dividend check of $2.65 a share beginning on July 1st. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also announced it will buy back $10 billion worth of its own stock beginning in September 2013.</p><p>Now, the move will use just some of the company`s $100 billion cash war chest.</p><p>GHARIB: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the latest company increasing buybacks and dividend payouts. Share repurchase agreements are at the highest levels since before the financial crisis. And dividend payments now stand at record levels.</p><p>But which is better for shareholders: dividends or stock buybacks?</p><p>Erika Miller reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MILLER: Buybacks have been mounting a comeback. And investors love them, because they usually boost a company`s stock price short term. But there are numerous studies questioning whether buybacks are good for shareholders in the long run.</p><p>(voice-over): UBS wealth management studied buybacks and found they are often poorly timed.</p><p>JEREMY ZIRIN, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MGMT: What we found from historical research is that share buybacks tend to be very cyclical, which actually means that firms tend to purchase their shares more when the economy is doing well and they have strong cash flow and don`t have a good alternative use for that cash that often coincides for when the stock price is actually quite high.</p><p>MILLER: Instead, he says firms would be better off buying their stock when the business isn`t doing as well and the shares are lagging.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is hardly a picture of a struggling stock, up almost 50 percent just this year.</p><p>There`s another big drawback to buybacks -- they`re not guarantees. A company can follow through with its purchase plan or cancel it at any time.</p><p>Dividends, on the other hand are cold, hard cash. And cutting the payout is seen as a very negative sign.</p><p>HOWARD SILVERBLATT, SR. INDEX ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR`S: Dividends have more stability. It`s more stability in that once you start paying, each quarter, you`re going to have to do it. From a personal point of view, it helps my cash flow. I can plan better.</p><p>MILLER: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)`s dividend is its first in more than a decade. It will cost the company almost $10 billion a year.</p><p>But, in general, dividends may become less appealing next year, when low tax rates on them are set to expire. The federal tax rate on most dividends is currently 15 percent. But that rate could triple for people in the top tax bracket. For that reason, S&amp;P predicts buybacks may have the edge over dividends next year.</p><p>SILVERBLATT: Corporations are going to look and say, \"What is best for my holders? Before I gave you a dollar and you were able to keep 85 cents of it. Now if I give you a dollar, it`s going to be 55, 56 cents before city and state taxes.\"</p><p>So, we think it definitely will have an impact.</p><p>MILLER (on camera): If it looks like the higher dividend tax will become law, watch for a surge in dividend payouts in December. S&amp;P predicts many companies will make an extra dividend payout this year and one fewer one next.</p><p>Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Tonight`s \"Word on the Street\": Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>Joining us now, Lindsey Bell. She`s an investment analyst at TheStreet.com (NASDAQ:TSCM).</p><p>Lindsey, nice to you have on the program.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, THESTREET.COM: Thank you for having me.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. So, many investors were counting on a bigger dividend. They`ve been calling for dividend all this time. And then they were disappointed.</p><p>Compared to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)`s technology peer companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), they pay a bigger dividend.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>BELL: You know, I think this dividend came in at the low end of what many investors were expecting. But the share repurchase was where the extra bonus came in. Most investors I talked to were looking for $4.5 billion to $5 billion in share repurchases. We`ve got $10 billion.</p><p>And yes, it might be a little bit less than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), but it`s still a lot better -- the dividend I mean -- is a lot better than what other big tech companies do offer.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, I think everybody is looking at all that cash that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has. So even after they pay out the dividend and they do the stock buyback, there`s plenty of cash left over.</p><p>Does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) need all that cash?</p><p>BELL: You make a very, very good point. And yes, with the $10 billion annual dividend and the $10 billion in share repurchases, all in, that`s about $45 billion, the company is going to spend over three years. They have $34 billion of cash in the U.S. The remaining of that $100 billion is offshore and not readily available to shareholders, so they can`t really use if for this type of purpose.</p><p>But that being said, free cash flow is expected to be about $45 billion for this year alone. So there`s definitely plenty of cash that`s going to be left on the table. But you know what, that gives them opportunities to spend on R&amp;D, to do cut backs, to pay for store expansion plans, and even do potential acquisitions.</p><p>So, while the end, the best part too is that they can increase the dividend down the road. It leaves dry powder.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, no matter what the criticism is, still many analysts today are already forecasting for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to hit $700. Some were even saying $750.</p><p>So what`s your view on the stock? Is this time to buy are or time to take your profits?</p><p>BELL: You know, it is scary when you look at the stock chart. I mean, it`s practically going straight up. And the analysts like you said can`t even keep up with it. They are increasing their price target every day.</p><p>But I do think there`s still room for this one to grow. Over the longer term, this company is going to grow 25 percent.</p><p>And let`s not forget this is about a product cycle. We saw over the weekend the iPad launch was very, very successful. We have a new iPhone 5 coming out in the second half of the year. We have an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iTV coming out in the fourth quarter, a MacBook refresh.</p><p>And the best part is China. This company has a big opportunity in China, especially when it comes to the iPhone.</p><p>So, I think this is a stock you could buy.</p><p>GHARIB: Another thing that there`s been a lot of chatter about is an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock split, especially now that it`s at $600 a share. What are you hearing about that? Could that be the next move?</p><p>BELL: You know, management made it clear today on the conference call that that is not the direction that they want to go in right now. They don`t see it as making, as being, unlocking shareholder value in the best way possible.</p><p>And I kind of agree with them -- yes, it would be nice to take that $600 stock and make it a $300 stock. But at the same time that makes valuation of this stock a lot more rich, and more difficult to justify buying.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. We`re going have to leave it there, Lindsey.</p><p>Do you have any disclosures to make? Do you own Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)?</p><p>BELL: I do not.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Thanks for joining us tonight. Nice having you.</p><p>BELL: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: We`ve been speaking with Lindsey Bell with TheStreet.com (NASDAQ:TSCM). And you can read Lindsey`s article at TheStreet.com (NASDAQ:TSCM), and there`s also a link to it on our Web site as well.</p><p>HUDSON: One of the wireless companies selling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)`s products runs the risk of bankruptcy. That was the assessment today of Sprint by investment firm Sanford Bernstein. Analyst Craig Moffett says the nation`s third largest wireless carrier is spending heavily to upgrade its wireless network.</p><p>He thinks the upgrade cost will weigh heavily on the company, along with signs the yet-to-be- unveiled iPhone 5 may not work as well with Sprint`s wireless network, compared to Verizon (NYSE:VZ)`s and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)`s, raising what he calls technology sprint is only beginning to build will weigh heavily on the company, raising what he calls a legitimate risk of bankruptcy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRAIG MOFFETT, SR. ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN: The proximity of the iPhone 5, now that we`ve seen the iPad. It confirms that the iPad does have LTE functionality. If there was any doubt that the iPhone was going to have LTE functionality that`s essentially gone now and, unfortunately, that just disadvantages the Sprint that`s already in a very precarious position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUDSON: Now, shares of Sprint ended the session down 4.5 percent. Insurance on Sprint bonds is pricing in a 50-50 probability of bankruptcy in the next five years. Now, the analyst Moffett doesn`t see an imminent risk of bankruptcy, but he cautions the carrier`s IOU pressures really start to mount in 2015.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOFFETT: As tempting as it would be to say that Sprint may have found a bottom, this is a very, very risky stock and probably not an appropriate investment for anyone other than specialized types of investors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUDSON: For its part, Sprint declined to comment on the contents of Moffett`s report today.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on the program -- it looks like investors are more bullish on housing than the home builders themselves.</p><p>Looking ahead to the market, that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dividend news that we told you about juiced up the markets today. The major stock averages rose as investors were inspired by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)`s actions. The Dow added 6.5 points, the NASDAQ up 23, the S&amp;P tacked on five points.</p><p>HUDSON: Gold prices climbed just a fraction today, and remain below $1,700 an ounce. As the U.S. economy seems to be some gaining strength, gold has suffered a little bit.</p><p>James Steel is with us, an analyst with HSBC Securities here in Miami.</p><p>James, welcome. Nice to see you.</p><p>JAMES STEEL, CHIEF COMMODITIES ANALYST, HSBC SECURITIES: Good evening.</p><p>HUDSON: So after several years of double digit increases in the price of gold per ounce, is this rush over?</p><p>STEEL: I don`t think so. Structurally, the long-term bull market that remains intact and we have no evidence it`s been reversed. The rally may have been blunted a little bit towards the end of last area when we got a lot of liquidation selling related to the stock market and more recently, when Bernanke has distanced himself a little bit from a third round of Q.E.2.</p><p>HUDSON: The chairman of the Federal Reserve here in the U.S.</p><p>STEEL: That`s correct, yes. And the (INAUDIBLE) two-year have gone, the bond yields have risen a little bit.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes. We`ve seen yields rise considerably just in the past week or so. But your forecast for gold prices over the next three years is to tap this year.</p><p>We got a chart here showing your forecast this year, an average price of $1,850. We`re below $1,700 tonight. You think $1,800 an ounce next year, $1,750. Still kind of some easing pressure in gold prices.</p><p>Is -- are we going to see the high this year?</p><p>STEEL: Well, we`re bullish on the market going forward, from these price levels for all three years out. But it looks as if the second half I think will be particularly robust. Because that`s when we`re looking for the U.S. dollar to pull back a little bit. There`s an inverse correlation between the dollar and gold.</p><p>We also think there will be some increased official sector of purchases, they`ve been very good buyers last area and the year before.</p><p>HUDSON: The central bank will be in there buying gold, you think?</p><p>STEEL: We believe that will be -- I believe that will be the case, yes.</p><p>HUDSON: Let`s talk about silver prices, because it kind of straddles between precious and industrial usage. Silver prices have been trending lower over the past 12 months, stuck in the low 30s here. Will it be able to break out?</p><p>STEEL: I think it`s going to be difficult. As we approach $40, I think there will be some muscle memory from when we got up to $50 in May and we came back so quickly.</p><p>Also, I think it`s hard to -- given that it`s got greater supply, particularly from the mines, than gold or platinum or palladium has, I think it`s difficult to justify it above that $40 level. So, we`re more comfortable a little bit to the upside from where it is now.</p><p>HUDSON: OK. A little less bullish on silver.</p><p>You mentioned platinum and palladium. Palladium is your choice for the best price appreciation this year of precious metals, best known for its use in catalytic converts. Why palladium this year?</p><p>STEEL: Well, both platinum and palladium are going to benefit from the recovery in the auto industry. Even though China has slowed down a little bit, the United States has moved far ahead. And we`ve got the greatest marginal growth of any large industry. And that is going to absorb a significant amount of platinum and palladium.</p><p>Also, we have supply tightness from South Africa and from Russia for both platinum and palladium. But palladium we think has got -- is more difficult from a stock perception. So, it might go a little higher.</p><p>HUDSON: So, $700 or so for palladium. How high this year?</p><p>STEEL: We`re looking for the market to get up to $775 is our average.</p><p>HUDSON: OK, about a 10 percent rally from these levels.</p><p>STEEL: Again for more in the second half of the year.</p><p>HUDSON: Has the diversification into precious metals, is that play over? In other words, have people diversified their assets partially into precious metals enough that you are not seeing those buyers in the market?</p><p>STEEL: We don`t think, it`s a crowded trade. I think gold and precious metals are one of those things that`s talked about more than there`s a lot of activity. A lot of people give the impression of having a significant amount of bullion but when you drill down, I don`t think many investors have really been greatly exposed to the market.</p><p>HUDSON: OK. Are you long in any of these precious metals or short?</p><p>STEEL: No, I`m not allowed to be.</p><p>HUDSON: All right. James Steel here along with us. He covers the commodity and precious metals for HSBC Securities.</p><p>GHARIB: This is a key week for readings on the housing market and it started on a flat note. Homebuilders are about as optimistic as they were last month. Now, throughout this week, we`ll see the latest on housing starts, sales and homebuilder earnings.</p><p>Darren Gersh looks at what may be shaping up as a the strongest year for housing since the bubble burst.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This year the stock market seems to be more bullish on home builders than the builders themselves. The National Association of Home Builders` reading of builder sentiment didn`t budge this month, staying stuck a long way from what economist David Crowe calls a mild comfort level.</p><p>That`s also what Crowe is expecting to learn from readings later this week on home sales and housing starts.</p><p>DAVID CROWE, CHIEF ECON., NAT`L. ASSN. OF HOME BUILDERS: I don`t think we are going to see any barn burners. This is not a recovery that`s going to just leap forward at a moment. It`s going to continue to be a slow process.</p><p>GERSH: 2011 was the worst year on record for new home sales. But this year, investors seem confident the worst is over. As a group, stocks of home builders are up 26 percent year to date, double the gain for the broader market.</p><p>Pointing to an improving labor market, low mortgage rates and plenty of pent-up demand, investors think survivors of the brutal housing bust are well-positioned for the future.</p><p>But builders still have to compete with foreclosures and falling prices in many markets.</p><p>CROWE: We`ve yet to see any significant surge in either starts or sales on the new side. So, I think those stock price movements are anticipatory of an improving market.</p><p>GERSH: Housing analyst Alex Barron expects KB Home (NYSE:KBH) will show very strong revenue growth when it reports at the end of the week. Same with Lennar (NYSE:LEN) next week.</p><p>But Barron is looking for KB Home (NYSE:KBH) to report a loss due to hefty interest costs, and Lennar (NYSE:LEN) to exceed expectations. And he predicts investors will increasingly focus on that kind of relative performance in the coming year.</p><p>ALEX BARRON, PRES. &amp; FOUNDER, HOUSING RESEARCH CTR: The companies that are losing money, I think investors are going to think twice about owning those.</p><p>GERSH (on camera): Which companies do well may also depend on how much business they do in the 100 markets where the National Association of Home Builders says the economic foundation is strongest and prices are rising.</p><p>Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: The world`s largest delivery company is getting even bigger. UPS is buying Dutch shipping firm TNT Express (NYSE:EXPR) for almost $7 billion. UPS is confident the all-cash bid can overcome any European Union regulatory hurdles. It has even agreed to a reverse break-up fee, in other words, where UPS would pay TNT roughly $260 million if the deal is blocked.</p><p>UPS is counting on the deal to boost international sales by 50 percent in the next five years.</p><p>And, Tom, investors really like the news, UPS shares were among the best movers on Wall Street, rising $2.70. That works out to 3 percent, to $81 a share. Not bad.</p><p>HUDSON: Not bad at all. Nice vote of confidence for a buyer making that investment in international shipping. In fact, it helped lead the Dow transports gain here today, Susie.</p><p>Let`s go ahead and take a look what else is moving with tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HUDSON: Of course, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) joining the ranks of dividend- paying stocks in the months ahead, really helped the major stock indices continue to climb to post-recession highs today. The S&amp;P 500 saw buying throughout the session, even though it cooled somewhat from its session high that came in the early afternoon hours.</p><p>It has been an historic rally for the S&amp;P 500 index, shooting up to its highest level tonight since May 2008, now just 10 percent below its record high hit back in the fall of 2007.</p><p>And thanks to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it was the tech sector behind today`s gains, followed by the financial and energy sectors. But none of the top three were up more than 1 percent. So, some muted gains overall.</p><p>Now, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the tech sector, companies suspected of supplying parts to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)`s newest iPad weren`t far behind. By the way, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has now sold 3 million of its newest iPad since its launch back on Friday. And a trio of semiconductor makers expected to supply some of those parts -- Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) -- all rose at least 2 percent today.</p><p>Now, one tech to watch tomorrow will be software maker Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). Shares were under pressure after the closing bell tonight. That pressure came after Adobe reported earnings on target with estimates, 57 cents per share. But revenues came in shy of expectations.</p><p>Now, critics have worried about the company`s shift to charging subscription fees away from a more traditional software licensing business model.</p><p>And that shift began this quarter. It amounts it first back in November, and after taking an initial hit to its share price, the stock has been able to rally. It was up 2 percent during the regular session just today. However, it dropped almost 5 percent after hours below $33 per share after reporting disappointing revenue.</p><p>The first quarter is expected to be disappointing for steel makers. Several of them already have issued profit warnings -- thanks to lower demand and finished prices falling faster than raw material prices.</p><p>But we have seen some optimism come back to steel stocks this month, including today. U.S. Steel`s 6 percent rally was the best among the S&amp;P 500 stocks. Despite today`s rally, U.S. Steel shares are still down 40 percent over the past year.</p><p>Now, we also saw some optimism, or after the close optimism from fashion designer Michael Kors. The company just came public late last year. Shares were down 2 percent during the regular session, but were 4 percent stronger after the bell. That came after the company raised its quarterly earnings guidance even though it cautioned its revenue may actually be disappointing.</p><p>Now, it blames that on problems with a new distribution center delaying deliveries. The company also is taking advantage of its share price rally more than doubling since its initial offering. It`s looking to sell more stock according to the \"Wall Street Journal\" tonight.</p><p>Meantime, retailer Kohl`s fell 3 percent on the session on heavy volume. In its annual report released today, it says it will be less aggressive passing along higher commodity costs to shoppers, hurting its profit margins.</p><p>Now, while the stock indices are running higher, so are bond interest rates continuing to move higher, meaning bond prices have been moving lower. Bond interest rates and prices, of course, move in opposite directions. The yield on the 10-year treasury note jumped to almost 2.4 percent. This is the highest yield, lowest price of the year.</p><p>Now, interest rates have pushed significantly higher in just the past week, moving from 2 percent to tonight`s settlement at almost 2.4 percent. The sell-off in bonds began after the Federal Reserve was slightly more optimistic on the economy during last week`s meeting.</p><p>And that is tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HUDSON: We should learn tomorrow if a trade fight brewing between the U.S. and China will move forward. This fight is over solar panels and whether Chinese manufacturers have used subsidies from their government to drop the cost of the panels and then selling those panels in America at prices below their cost. More than 150 U.S. solar companies, including seven manufacturers, call the practice illegal, saying it has hurt the solar industry in the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM BRIGHTBILL, ATTORNEY, WILEY REIN LLP: Demand is growing in the United States for solar. It`s doubled each of the last two years. This is an industry that should be growing and adding thousands of jobs and dozens of companies. Instead, China, with its government-sponsored industry and subsidies has taken that growth and is looking to dominate the world market through the expansion of its solar industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUDSON: Solar panel prices fell 50 percent last year, hurting profits and the stock prices of those manufacturers. Critics point to the below cost Chinese-made panels for a dozen U.S. makers laying off workers, going out of business or declaring bankruptcy.</p><p>If regulators agree with the complaint, Chinese-made solar panels may be slapped with tariffs. Now, just today, the Commerce Department slapped tariffs on Chinese-made steel wheels. U.S. makers successfully argued they were unfairly subsidized by the Chinese government and sold below market value.</p><p>GHARIB: Let`s take a look now what we`re watching for you for tomorrow.</p><p>The chairman returns as professor for one day. Former Princeton professor, now Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, kicks off a series of lectures to college students about the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is on Capitol Hill to talk international finance with Congress.</p><p>The web has changed the way we think about business and how we get things done. Tonight`s commentator says its time to apply that same re- thinking to corporate America.</p><p>Here`s Billy Parish, co-author of \"Making Good.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILLY PARISH, CO-AUTHOR, \"MAKING GOOD\": Every day, my generation is told our prospects are bleak. These are tough economic times, but the world I have had a glimpse of is filled with meaningful jobs because there is so much work to do.</p><p>Today, we need to rethink, redesign and rebuild industry in a way that does good. Every single industry will be retooled for the 21st century. This is where the jobs are.</p><p>For my new book \"Making Good,\" we interviewed hundreds of people working in diverse industries. Re-imagining information technology, energy, education, the arts, health care, food, manufacturing and waste management is a multi-generational project that will employ tens of millions of people. This is a great rebuilding we must all embrace, a great rebuilding we can all be a part of.</p><p>The most profound changes in our country have always come from the people, not from Congress, Wall Street, K Street or even Pennsylvania Avenue. We can`t afford to wait for the change to come to us. We must proactively be a part of it. Then, we will all be making good.</p><p>I`m Billy Parish.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HUDSON: Finally, building a better burger. A new pecking order in burger land. Listen to this, Wendy`s has now dethroned the king, Burger King, as the country`s second largest hamburger chain measured by sales volume.</p><p>Wendy`s had sales of $8.5 billion last year. B.K.`s sales were $8.4 billion. McDonald`s, though, still the king, still rules when it comes to burgers, over $34 billion in sales.</p><p>But for fast food overall, McDonald`s, yes, is number one, followed by Subway and then Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) where sales neared $10 billion last year.</p><p>Susie, I`m going to put you down for one double cheeseburger. How about that for dinner?</p><p>GHARIB: I have a real weakness for the French fries. I don`t usually go for fast food, but those French fries.</p><p>HUDSON: I`ll take the burger, you get the fries. Here we go.</p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT this Monday, March 19th. I`m Tom Hudson. Good night. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>Have a great evening, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you, Tom. Nice to have you back.</p><p>I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks for watching, everyone.

The stock closes above $600 for the first time, as the  company promises investors their first dividend in over a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Erika Miller  in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new dividend may be getting a lot of attention,  but I'll tell you why dividends overall may fall out of favor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  And the housing market is  shaping up for its best spring selling season in years.  But will it be  good enough to show a market on the mend? </p><p>  It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March 19th.</p><p>  ANNOUNCER:  This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT with Susie Gharib and Tom  Hudson.</p><p>  Made possibly by --  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL AD)</p><p>  GHARIB:  Good evening, everyone.</p><p>  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed above $600 a share for the first time  ever, surging almost 3 percent.  Investors gobbled up the stock, after the  company announced it will pay a quarterly dividend and launch a stock  buyback.</p><p>  So, Tom, first, it was the new iPad.  Now, this dividend.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Boy, what a couple of days here and a big weekend for Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholder now.  But today, the investors have been calling  for a dividend from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for a long, long time.</p><p>  So, here's what shareholders can now expect.  They'll get a quarterly  dividend check of $2.65 a share beginning on July 1st.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  also announced it will buy back $10 billion worth of its own stock  beginning in September 2013.</p><p>  Now, the move will use just some of the company's $100 billion cash  war chest.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the latest company increasing buybacks  and dividend payouts.  Share repurchase agreements are at the highest  levels since before the financial crisis.  And dividend payments now stand  at record levels.</p><p>  But which is better for shareholders: dividends or stock buybacks?</p><p>  Erika Miller reports.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MILLER:  Buybacks have been mounting a comeback.  And investors love  them, because they usually boost a company's stock price short term.  But  there are numerous studies questioning whether buybacks are good for  shareholders in the long run.</p><p>  (voice-over):  UBS wealth management studied buybacks and found they  are often poorly timed.</p><p>  JEREMY ZIRIN, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MGMT:  What we found  from historical research is that share buybacks tend to be very cyclical,  which actually means that firms tend to purchase their shares more when the  economy is doing well and they have strong cash flow and don't have a good  alternative use for that cash that often coincides for when the stock price  is actually quite high.</p><p>  MILLER:  Instead, he says firms would be better off buying their stock  when the business isn't doing as well and the shares are lagging.</p><p>  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is hardly a picture of a struggling stock, up  almost 50 percent just this year.</p><p>  There's another big drawback to buybacks -- they're not guarantees.  A  company can follow through with its purchase plan or cancel it at any time.</p><p>  Dividends, on the other hand are cold, hard cash.  And cutting the  payout is seen as a very negative sign.</p><p>  HOWARD SILVERBLATT, SR. INDEX ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S:  Dividends  have more stability.  It's more stability in that once you start paying,  each quarter, you're going to have to do it.  From a personal point of  view, it helps my cash flow.  I can plan better.</p><p>  MILLER:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s dividend is its first in more than a  decade.  It will cost the company almost $10 billion a year.</p><p>  But, in general, dividends may become less appealing next year, when  low tax rates on them are set to expire.  The federal tax rate on most  dividends is currently 15 percent.  But that rate could triple for people  in the top tax bracket.  For that reason, S&amp;P predicts buybacks may have  the edge over dividends next year.</p><p>  SILVERBLATT:  Corporations are going to look and say, \"What is best  for my holders?  Before I gave you a dollar and you were able to keep 85  cents of it.  Now if I give you a dollar, it's going to be 55, 56 cents  before city and state taxes.\"</p><p>  So, we think it definitely will have an impact.</p><p>  MILLER (on camera):  If it looks like the higher dividend tax will  become law, watch for a surge in dividend payouts in December.  S&amp;P  predicts many companies will make an extra dividend payout this year and  one fewer one next.</p><p>  Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GHARIB:  Tonight's \"Word on the Street\": Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>  Joining us now, Lindsey Bell.  She's an investment analyst at  TheStreet.com (NASDAQ:TSCM).</p><p>  Lindsey, nice to you have on the program.</p><p>  LINDSEY BELL, THESTREET.COM:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>  GHARIB:  All right.  So, many investors were counting on a bigger  dividend.  They've been calling for dividend all this time.  And then they  were disappointed.</p><p>  Compared to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s technology peer companies like  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), they pay a bigger  dividend.</p><p>  What do you think?</p><p>  BELL:  You know, I think this dividend came in at the low end of what  many investors were expecting.  But the share repurchase was where the  extra bonus came in.  Most investors I talked to were looking for $4.5  billion to $5 billion in share repurchases.  We've got $10 billion.</p><p>  And yes, it might be a little bit less than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), but it's still a lot better -- the dividend I mean  -- is a lot better than what other big tech companies do offer.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Well, I think everybody is looking at all that cash that  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has.  So even after they pay out the dividend and they  do the stock buyback, there's plenty of cash left over.</p><p>  Does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) need all that cash?</p><p>  BELL:  You make a very, very good point.  And yes, with the $10  billion annual dividend and the $10 billion in share repurchases, all in,  that's about $45 billion, the company is going to spend over three years.   They have $34 billion of cash in the U.S.  The remaining of that $100  billion is offshore and not readily available to shareholders, so they  can't really use if for this type of purpose.</p><p>  But that being said, free cash flow is expected to be about $45  billion for this year alone.  So there's definitely plenty of cash that's  going to be left on the table.  But you know what, that gives them  opportunities to spend on R&amp;D, to do cut backs, to pay for store expansion  plans, and even do potential acquisitions.</p><p>  So, while the end, the best part too is that they can increase the  dividend down the road.  It leaves dry powder.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Well, no matter what the criticism is, still many analysts  today are already forecasting for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to hit $700.   Some were even saying $750. </p><p>  So what's your view on the stock?  Is this time to buy are or time to  take your profits?</p><p>  BELL:  You know, it is scary when you look at the stock chart.  I  mean, it's practically going straight up.  And the analysts like you said  can't even keep up with it.  They are increasing their price target every  day.</p><p>  But I do think there's still room for this one to grow.  Over the  longer term, this company is going to grow 25 percent. </p><p>  And let's not forget this is about a product cycle.  We saw over the  weekend the iPad launch was very, very successful.  We have a new iPhone 5  coming out in the second half of the year.  We have an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  iTV coming out in the fourth quarter, a MacBook refresh.</p><p>  And the best part is China.  This company has a big opportunity in  China, especially when it comes to the iPhone.</p><p>  So, I think this is a stock you could buy.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Another thing that there's been a lot of chatter about is an  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock split, especially now that it's at $600 a share.   What are you hearing about that?  Could that be the next move?</p><p>  BELL:  You know, management made it clear today on the conference call  that that is not the direction that they want to go in right now.  They  don't see it as making, as being, unlocking shareholder value in the best  way possible.</p><p>  And I kind of agree with them -- yes, it would be nice to take that  $600 stock and make it a $300 stock.  But at the same time that makes  valuation of this stock a lot more rich, and more difficult to justify  buying.</p><p>  GHARIB:  All right.  We're going have to leave it there, Lindsey.  </p><p>  Do you have any disclosures to make?  Do you own Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)?</p><p>  BELL:  I do not.</p><p>  GHARIB:  All right.  Thanks for joining us tonight.  Nice having you.</p><p>  BELL:  Thank you.</p><p>  GHARIB:  We've been speaking with Lindsey Bell with TheStreet.com  (NASDAQ:TSCM).  And you can read Lindsey's article at TheStreet.com  (NASDAQ:TSCM), and there's also a link to it on our Web site as well.</p><p>  HUDSON:  One of the wireless companies selling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s  products runs the risk of bankruptcy.  That was the assessment today of  Sprint by investment firm Sanford Bernstein.  Analyst Craig Moffett says  the nation's third largest wireless carrier is spending heavily to upgrade  its wireless network.</p><p>  He thinks the upgrade cost will weigh heavily on the company, along  with signs the yet-to-be- unveiled iPhone 5 may not work as well with  Sprint's wireless network, compared to Verizon (NYSE:VZ)'s and AT&amp;T  (NYSE:T)'s, raising what he calls  technology sprint is only beginning to  build will weigh heavily on the company, raising what he calls a legitimate  risk of bankruptcy.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  CRAIG MOFFETT, SR. ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN:  The proximity of  the iPhone 5, now that we've seen the iPad.  It confirms that the iPad does  have LTE functionality.  If there was any doubt that the iPhone was going  to have LTE functionality that's essentially gone now and, unfortunately,  that just disadvantages the Sprint that's already in a very precarious  position.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HUDSON:  Now, shares of Sprint ended the session down 4.5 percent.   Insurance on Sprint bonds is pricing in a 50-50 probability of bankruptcy  in the next five years.  Now, the analyst Moffett doesn't see an imminent  risk of bankruptcy, but he cautions the carrier's IOU pressures really  start to mount in 2015.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  MOFFETT:  As tempting as it would be to say that Sprint may have found  a bottom, this is a very, very risky stock and probably not an appropriate  investment for anyone other than specialized types of investors.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HUDSON:  For its part, Sprint declined to comment on the contents of  Moffett's report today.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Still ahead on the program -- it looks like investors are  more bullish on housing than the home builders themselves.</p><p>  Looking ahead to the market, that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dividend news  that we told you about juiced up the markets today.  The major stock  averages rose as investors were inspired by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s actions.   The Dow added 6.5 points, the NASDAQ up 23, the S&amp;P tacked on five points.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Gold prices climbed just a fraction today, and remain below  $1,700 an ounce.  As the U.S. economy seems to be some gaining strength,  gold has suffered a little bit.</p><p>  James Steel is with us, an analyst with HSBC Securities here in Miami.</p><p>  James, welcome.  Nice to see you.</p><p>  JAMES STEEL, CHIEF COMMODITIES ANALYST, HSBC SECURITIES:  Good  evening.</p><p>  HUDSON:  So after several years of double digit increases in the price  of gold per ounce, is this rush over?</p><p>  STEEL:  I don't think so.  Structurally, the long-term bull market  that remains intact and we have no evidence it's been reversed.  The rally  may have been blunted a little bit towards the end of last area when we got  a lot of liquidation selling related to the stock market and more recently,  when Bernanke has distanced himself a little bit from a third round of  Q.E.2.</p><p>  HUDSON:  The chairman of the Federal Reserve here in the U.S.</p><p>  STEEL:  That's correct, yes.  And the (INAUDIBLE) two-year have gone,  the bond yields have risen a little bit.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Yes.  We've seen yields rise considerably just in the past  week or so.  But your forecast for gold prices over the next three years is  to tap this year.</p><p>  We got a chart here showing your forecast this year, an average price  of $1,850.  We're below $1,700 tonight.  You think $1,800 an ounce next  year, $1,750.  Still kind of some easing pressure in gold prices.</p><p>  Is -- are we going to see the high this year?</p><p>  STEEL:  Well, we're bullish on the market going forward, from these  price levels for all three years out.  But it looks as if the second half I  think will be particularly robust.  Because that's when we're looking for  the U.S. dollar to pull back a little bit.  There's an inverse correlation  between the dollar and gold.</p><p>  We also think there will be some increased official sector of  purchases, they've been very good buyers last area and the year before. </p><p>  HUDSON:  The central bank will be in there buying gold, you think?</p><p>  STEEL:  We believe that will be -- I believe that will be the case,  yes.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Let's talk about silver prices, because it kind of straddles  between precious and industrial usage.  Silver prices have been trending  lower over the past 12 months, stuck in the low 30s here.  Will it be able  to break out?</p><p>  STEEL:  I think it's going to be difficult.  As we approach $40, I  think there will be some muscle memory from when we got up to $50 in May  and we came back so quickly.</p><p>  Also, I think it's hard to -- given that it's got greater supply,  particularly from the mines, than gold or platinum or palladium has, I  think it's difficult to justify it above that $40 level.  So, we're more  comfortable a little bit to the upside from where it is now.</p><p>  HUDSON:  OK.  A little less bullish on silver.</p><p>  You mentioned platinum and palladium.  Palladium is your choice for  the best price appreciation this year of precious metals, best known for  its use in catalytic converts.  Why palladium this year?</p><p>  STEEL:  Well, both platinum and palladium are going to benefit from  the recovery in the auto industry.  Even though China has slowed down a  little bit, the United States has moved far ahead.  And we've got the  greatest marginal growth of any large industry.  And that is going to  absorb a significant amount of platinum and palladium.</p><p>  Also, we have supply tightness from South Africa and from Russia for  both platinum and palladium.  But palladium we think has got -- is more  difficult from a stock perception.  So, it might go a little higher.</p><p>  HUDSON:  So, $700 or so for palladium.  How high this year?</p><p>  STEEL:  We're looking for the market to get up to $775 is our average.</p><p>  HUDSON:  OK, about a 10 percent rally from these levels.</p><p>  STEEL:  Again for more in the second half of the year.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Has the diversification into precious metals, is that play  over?  In other words, have people diversified their assets partially into  precious metals enough that you are not seeing those buyers in the market?</p><p>  STEEL:  We don't think, it's a crowded trade.  I think gold and  precious metals are one of those things that's talked about more than  there's a lot of activity.  A lot of people give the impression of having a  significant amount of bullion but when you drill down, I don't think many  investors have really been greatly exposed to the market.</p><p>  HUDSON:  OK.  Are you long in any of these precious metals or short?</p><p>  STEEL:  No, I'm not allowed to be.</p><p>  HUDSON:  All right.  James Steel here along with us.  He covers the  commodity and precious metals for HSBC Securities.</p><p>  GHARIB:  This is a key week for readings on the housing market and it  started on a flat note.  Homebuilders are about as optimistic as they were  last month.  Now, throughout this week, we'll see the latest on housing  starts, sales and homebuilder earnings.</p><p>  Darren Gersh looks at what may be shaping up as a the strongest year  for housing since the bubble burst.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   This year the stock market seems to be more bullish on home builders than  the builders themselves.  The National Association of Home Builders'  reading of builder sentiment didn't budge this month, staying stuck a long  way from what economist David Crowe calls a mild comfort level.</p><p>  That's also what Crowe is expecting to learn from readings later this  week on home sales and housing starts.</p><p>  DAVID CROWE, CHIEF ECON., NAT'L. ASSN. OF HOME BUILDERS:  I don't  think we are going to see any barn burners.  This is not a recovery that's  going to just leap forward at a moment.  It's going to continue to be a  slow process.</p><p>  GERSH:  2011 was the worst year on record for new home sales.  But  this year, investors seem confident the worst is over.  As a group, stocks  of home builders are up 26 percent year to date, double the gain for the  broader market.</p><p>  Pointing to an improving labor market, low mortgage rates and plenty  of pent-up demand, investors think survivors of the brutal housing bust are  well-positioned for the future.</p><p>  But builders still have to compete with foreclosures and falling  prices in many markets.</p><p>  CROWE:  We've yet to see any significant surge in either starts or  sales on the new side.  So, I think those stock price movements are  anticipatory of an improving market.</p><p>  GERSH:  Housing analyst Alex Barron expects KB Home (NYSE:KBH) will  show very strong revenue growth when it reports at the end of the week.   Same with Lennar (NYSE:LEN) next week.</p><p>  But Barron is looking for KB Home (NYSE:KBH) to report a loss due to  hefty interest costs, and Lennar (NYSE:LEN) to exceed expectations.  And he  predicts investors will increasingly focus on that kind of relative  performance in the coming year.</p><p>  ALEX BARRON, PRES. &amp; FOUNDER, HOUSING RESEARCH CTR:  The companies  that are losing money, I think investors are going to think twice about  owning those. </p><p>  GERSH (on camera):  Which companies do well may also depend on how  much business they do in the 100 markets where the National Association of  Home Builders says the economic foundation is strongest and prices are  rising.</p><p>  Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  GHARIB:  The world's largest delivery company is getting even bigger.   UPS is buying Dutch shipping firm TNT Express (NYSE:EXPR) for almost $7  billion.  UPS is confident the all-cash bid can overcome any European Union  regulatory hurdles.  It has even agreed to a reverse break-up fee, in other  words, where UPS would pay TNT roughly $260 million if the deal is blocked.</p><p>  UPS is counting on the deal to boost international sales by 50 percent  in the next five years.</p><p>  And, Tom, investors really like the news, UPS shares were among the  best movers on Wall Street, rising $2.70.  That works out to 3 percent, to  $81 a share.  Not bad.</p><p>  HUDSON:  Not bad at all.  Nice vote of confidence for a buyer making  that investment in international shipping.  In fact, it helped lead the Dow  transports gain here today, Susie.</p><p>  Let's go ahead and take a look what else is moving with tonight's  \"Market Focus\".</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  HUDSON:  Of course, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) joining the ranks of dividend- paying stocks in the months ahead, really helped the major stock indices  continue to climb to post-recession highs today.  The S&amp;P 500 saw buying  throughout the session, even though it cooled somewhat from its session  high that came in the early afternoon hours.</p><p>  It has been an historic rally for the S&amp;P 500 index, shooting up to  its highest level tonight since May 2008, now just 10 percent below its  record high hit back in the fall of 2007.</p><p>  And thanks to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it was the tech sector behind  today's gains, followed by the financial and energy sectors.  But none of  the top three were up more than 1 percent.  So, some muted gains overall.</p><p>  Now, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the tech sector, companies  suspected of supplying parts to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s newest iPad weren't  far behind.  By the way, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has now sold 3 million of its  newest iPad since its launch back on Friday.  And a trio of semiconductor  makers expected to supply some of those parts -- Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM),  Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) -- all rose at  least 2 percent today.</p><p>  Now, one tech to watch tomorrow will be software maker Adobe Systems  (NASDAQ:ADBE).  Shares were under pressure after the closing bell tonight.   That pressure came after Adobe reported earnings on target with estimates,  57 cents per share.  But revenues came in shy of expectations.</p><p>  Now, critics have worried about the company's shift to charging  subscription fees away from a more traditional software licensing business  model.</p><p>  And that shift began this quarter.  It amounts it first back in  November, and after taking an initial hit to its share price, the stock has  been able to rally.  It was up 2 percent during the regular session just  today.  However, it dropped almost 5 percent after hours below $33 per  share after reporting disappointing revenue.</p><p>  The first quarter is expected to be disappointing for steel makers.   Several of them already have issued profit warnings -- thanks to lower  demand and finished prices falling faster than raw material prices.</p><p>  But we have seen some optimism come back to steel stocks this month,  including today.  U.S. Steel's 6 percent rally was the best among the S&amp;P  500 stocks.  Despite today's rally, U.S. Steel shares are still down 40  percent over the past year.</p><p>  Now, we also saw some optimism, or after the close optimism from  fashion designer Michael Kors.  The company just came public late last  year.  Shares were down 2 percent during the regular session, but were 4  percent stronger after the bell.  That came after the company raised its  quarterly earnings guidance even though it cautioned its revenue may  actually be disappointing.</p><p>  Now, it blames that on problems with a new distribution center  delaying deliveries.  The company also is taking advantage of its share  price rally more than doubling since its initial offering.  It's looking to  sell more stock according to the \"Wall Street Journal\" tonight.</p><p>  Meantime, retailer Kohl's fell 3 percent on the session on heavy  volume.  In its annual report released today, it says it will be less  aggressive passing along higher commodity costs to shoppers, hurting its  profit margins.</p><p>  Now, while the stock indices are running higher, so are bond interest  rates continuing to move higher, meaning bond prices have been moving  lower.  Bond interest rates and prices, of course, move in opposite  directions.  The yield on the 10-year treasury note jumped to almost 2.4  percent.  This is the highest yield, lowest price of the year.</p><p>  Now, interest rates have pushed significantly higher in just the past  week, moving from 2 percent to tonight's settlement at almost 2.4 percent.   The sell-off in bonds began after the Federal Reserve was slightly more  optimistic on the economy during last week's meeting.</p><p>  And that is tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  HUDSON:  We should learn tomorrow if a trade fight brewing between the  U.S. and China will move forward.  This fight is over solar panels and  whether Chinese manufacturers have used subsidies from their government to  drop the cost of the panels and then selling those panels in America at  prices below their cost.  More than 150 U.S. solar companies, including  seven manufacturers, call the practice illegal, saying it has hurt the  solar industry in the U.S.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  TIM BRIGHTBILL, ATTORNEY, WILEY REIN LLP:  Demand is growing in the  United States for solar.  It's doubled each of the last two years.  This is  an industry that should be growing and adding thousands of jobs and dozens  of companies.  Instead, China, with its government-sponsored industry and  subsidies has taken that growth and is looking to dominate the world market  through the expansion of its solar industry.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HUDSON:  Solar panel prices fell 50 percent last year, hurting profits  and the stock prices of those manufacturers.  Critics point to the below  cost Chinese-made panels for a dozen U.S. makers laying off workers, going  out of business or declaring bankruptcy.</p><p>  If regulators agree with the complaint, Chinese-made solar panels may  be slapped with tariffs.  Now, just today, the Commerce Department slapped  tariffs on Chinese-made steel wheels.  U.S. makers successfully argued they  were unfairly subsidized by the Chinese government and sold below market  value.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Let's take a look now what we're watching for you for  tomorrow.</p><p>  The chairman returns as professor for one day.  Former Princeton  professor, now Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, kicks off a series  of lectures to college students about the Federal Reserve.</p><p>  Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is on Capitol Hill to  talk international finance with Congress.</p><p>  The web has changed the way we think about business and how we get  things done.  Tonight's commentator says its time to apply that same re- thinking to corporate America.</p><p>  Here's Billy Parish, co-author of \"Making Good.\"</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  BILLY PARISH, CO-AUTHOR, \"MAKING GOOD\":  Every day, my generation is  told our prospects are bleak.  These are tough economic times, but the  world I have had a glimpse of is filled with meaningful jobs because there  is so much work to do.</p><p>  Today, we need to rethink, redesign and rebuild industry in a way that  does good.  Every single industry will be retooled for the 21st century.   This is where the jobs are.</p><p>  For my new book \"Making Good,\" we interviewed hundreds of people  working in diverse industries.  Re-imagining information technology,  energy, education, the arts, health care, food, manufacturing and waste  management is a multi-generational project that will employ tens of  millions of people.  This is a great rebuilding we must all embrace, a  great rebuilding we can all be a part of.</p><p>  The most profound changes in our country have always come from the  people, not from Congress, Wall Street, K Street or even Pennsylvania  Avenue.  We can't afford to wait for the change to come to us.  We must  proactively be a part of it.  Then, we will all be making good.</p><p>  I'm Billy Parish.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HUDSON:  Finally, building a better burger.  A new pecking order in  burger land.  Listen to this, Wendy's has now dethroned the king, Burger  King, as the country's second largest hamburger chain measured by sales  volume.</p><p>  Wendy's had sales of $8.5 billion last year.  B.K.'s sales were $8.4  billion.  McDonald's, though, still the king, still rules when it comes to  burgers, over $34 billion in sales.</p><p>  But for fast food overall, McDonald's, yes, is number one, followed by  Subway and then Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) where sales neared $10 billion last  year.</p><p>  Susie, I'm going to put you down for one double cheeseburger.  How  about that for dinner?</p><p>  GHARIB:  I have a real weakness for the French fries.  I don't usually  go for fast food, but those French fries. </p><p>  HUDSON:  I'll take the burger, you get the fries.  Here we go.</p><p>  That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT this Monday, March 19th.  I'm Tom  Hudson.  Good night.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>  Have a great evening, Susie.</p><p>  GHARIB:  Same to you, Tom.  Nice to have you back.</p><p>  I'm Susie Gharib.

The stock closes above $600 for the first time, as the company promises investors their first dividend in over a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINES REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I'm Erika Miller in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new dividend may be getting a lot of attention, but I'll tell you why dividends overall may fall out of favor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HUDSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And the housing market is shaping up for its best spring selling season in years. But will it be good enough to show a market on the mend?</p><p>It's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March 19th.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT with Susie Gharib and Tom Hudson.</p><p>Made possibly by --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL AD)</p><p>GHARIB: Good evening, everyone.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed above $600 a share for the first time ever, surging almost 3 percent. Investors gobbled up the stock, after the company announced it will pay a quarterly dividend and launch a stock buyback.</p><p>So, Tom, first, it was the new iPad. Now, this dividend.</p><p>HUDSON: Boy, what a couple of days here and a big weekend for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholder now. But today, the investors have been calling for a dividend from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for a long, long time.</p><p>So, here's what shareholders can now expect. They'll get a quarterly dividend check of $2.65 a share beginning on July 1st. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also announced it will buy back $10 billion worth of its own stock beginning in September 2013.</p><p>Now, the move will use just some of the company's $100 billion cash war chest.</p><p>GHARIB: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the latest company increasing buybacks and dividend payouts. Share repurchase agreements are at the highest levels since before the financial crisis. And dividend payments now stand at record levels.</p><p>But which is better for shareholders: dividends or stock buybacks?</p><p>Erika Miller reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MILLER: Buybacks have been mounting a comeback. And investors love them, because they usually boost a company's stock price short term. But there are numerous studies questioning whether buybacks are good for shareholders in the long run.</p><p>(voice-over): UBS wealth management studied buybacks and found they are often poorly timed.</p><p>JEREMY ZIRIN, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, UBS WEALTH MGMT: What we found from historical research is that share buybacks tend to be very cyclical, which actually means that firms tend to purchase their shares more when the economy is doing well and they have strong cash flow and don't have a good alternative use for that cash that often coincides for when the stock price is actually quite high.</p><p>MILLER: Instead, he says firms would be better off buying their stock when the business isn't doing as well and the shares are lagging.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is hardly a picture of a struggling stock, up almost 50 percent just this year.</p><p>There's another big drawback to buybacks -- they're not guarantees. A company can follow through with its purchase plan or cancel it at any time.</p><p>Dividends, on the other hand are cold, hard cash. And cutting the payout is seen as a very negative sign.</p><p>HOWARD SILVERBLATT, SR. INDEX ANALYST, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: Dividends have more stability. It's more stability in that once you start paying, each quarter, you're going to have to do it. From a personal point of view, it helps my cash flow. I can plan better.</p><p>MILLER: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s dividend is its first in more than a decade. It will cost the company almost $10 billion a year.</p><p>But, in general, dividends may become less appealing next year, when low tax rates on them are set to expire. The federal tax rate on most dividends is currently 15 percent. But that rate could triple for people in the top tax bracket. For that reason, S&amp;P predicts buybacks may have the edge over dividends next year.</p><p>SILVERBLATT: Corporations are going to look and say, \"What is best for my holders? Before I gave you a dollar and you were able to keep 85 cents of it. Now if I give you a dollar, it's going to be 55, 56 cents before city and state taxes.\"</p><p>So, we think it definitely will have an impact.</p><p>MILLER (on camera): If it looks like the higher dividend tax will become law, watch for a surge in dividend payouts in December. S&amp;P predicts many companies will make an extra dividend payout this year and one fewer one next.</p><p>Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Tonight's \"Word on the Street\": Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>Joining us now, Lindsey Bell. She's an investment analyst at TheStreet.com (NASDAQ:TSCM).</p><p>Lindsey, nice to you have on the program.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, THESTREET.COM: Thank you for having me.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. So, many investors were counting on a bigger dividend. They've been calling for dividend all this time. And then they were disappointed.</p><p>Compared to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s technology peer companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), they pay a bigger dividend.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>BELL: You know, I think this dividend came in at the low end of what many investors were expecting. But the share repurchase was where the extra bonus came in. Most investors I talked to were looking for $4.5 billion to $5 billion in share repurchases. We've got $10 billion.</p><p>And yes, it might be a little bit less than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), but it's still a lot better -- the dividend I mean -- is a lot better than what other big tech companies do offer.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, I think everybody is looking at all that cash that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has. So even after they pay out the dividend and they do the stock buyback, there's plenty of cash left over.</p><p>Does Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) need all that cash?</p><p>BELL: You make a very, very good point. And yes, with the $10 billion annual dividend and the $10 billion in share repurchases, all in, that's about $45 billion, the company is going to spend over three years. They have $34 billion of cash in the U.S. The remaining of that $100 billion is offshore and not readily available to shareholders, so they can't really use if for this type of purpose.</p><p>But that being said, free cash flow is expected to be about $45 billion for this year alone. So there's definitely plenty of cash that's going to be left on the table. But you know what, that gives them opportunities to spend on R&amp;D, to do cut backs, to pay for store expansion plans, and even do potential acquisitions.</p><p>So, while the end, the best part too is that they can increase the dividend down the road. It leaves dry powder.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, no matter what the criticism is, still many analysts today are already forecasting for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock to hit $700. Some were even saying $750.</p><p>So what's your view on the stock? Is this time to buy are or time to take your profits?</p><p>BELL: You know, it is scary when you look at the stock chart. I mean, it's practically going straight up. And the analysts like you said can't even keep up with it. They are increasing their price target every day.</p><p>But I do think there's still room for this one to grow. Over the longer term, this company is going to grow 25 percent.</p><p>And let's not forget this is about a product cycle. We saw over the weekend the iPad launch was very, very successful. We have a new iPhone 5 coming out in the second half of the year. We have an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iTV coming out in the fourth quarter, a MacBook refresh.</p><p>And the best part is China. This company has a big opportunity in China, especially when it comes to the iPhone.</p><p>So, I think this is a stock you could buy.</p><p>GHARIB: Another thing that there's been a lot of chatter about is an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock split, especially now that it's at $600 a share. What are you hearing about that? Could that be the next move?</p><p>BELL: You know, management made it clear today on the conference call that that is not the direction that they want to go in right now. They don't see it as making, as being, unlocking shareholder value in the best way possible.</p><p>And I kind of agree with them -- yes, it would be nice to take that $600 stock and make it a $300 stock. But at the same time that makes valuation of this stock a lot more rich, and more difficult to justify buying.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. We're going have to leave it there, Lindsey.</p><p>Do you have any disclosures to make? Do you own Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)?</p><p>BELL: I do not.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Thanks for joining us tonight. Nice having you.</p><p>BELL: Thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: We've been speaking with Lindsey Bell with TheStreet.com (NASDAQ:TSCM). And you can read Lindsey's article at TheStreet.com (NASDAQ:TSCM), and there's also a link to it on our Web site as well.</p><p>HUDSON: One of the wireless companies selling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s products runs the risk of bankruptcy. That was the assessment today of Sprint by investment firm Sanford Bernstein. Analyst Craig Moffett says the nation's third largest wireless carrier is spending heavily to upgrade its wireless network.</p><p>He thinks the upgrade cost will weigh heavily on the company, along with signs the yet-to-be- unveiled iPhone 5 may not work as well with Sprint's wireless network, compared to Verizon (NYSE:VZ)'s and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T)'s, raising what he calls technology sprint is only beginning to build will weigh heavily on the company, raising what he calls a legitimate risk of bankruptcy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRAIG MOFFETT, SR. ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN: The proximity of the iPhone 5, now that we've seen the iPad. It confirms that the iPad does have LTE functionality. If there was any doubt that the iPhone was going to have LTE functionality that's essentially gone now and, unfortunately, that just disadvantages the Sprint that's already in a very precarious position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUDSON: Now, shares of Sprint ended the session down 4.5 percent. Insurance on Sprint bonds is pricing in a 50-50 probability of bankruptcy in the next five years. Now, the analyst Moffett doesn't see an imminent risk of bankruptcy, but he cautions the carrier's IOU pressures really start to mount in 2015.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOFFETT: As tempting as it would be to say that Sprint may have found a bottom, this is a very, very risky stock and probably not an appropriate investment for anyone other than specialized types of investors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUDSON: For its part, Sprint declined to comment on the contents of Moffett's report today.</p><p>GHARIB: Still ahead on the program -- it looks like investors are more bullish on housing than the home builders themselves.</p><p>Looking ahead to the market, that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dividend news that we told you about juiced up the markets today. The major stock averages rose as investors were inspired by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s actions. The Dow added 6.5 points, the NASDAQ up 23, the S&amp;P tacked on five points.</p><p>HUDSON: Gold prices climbed just a fraction today, and remain below $1,700 an ounce. As the U.S. economy seems to be some gaining strength, gold has suffered a little bit.</p><p>James Steel is with us, an analyst with HSBC Securities here in Miami.</p><p>James, welcome. Nice to see you.</p><p>JAMES STEEL, CHIEF COMMODITIES ANALYST, HSBC SECURITIES: Good evening.</p><p>HUDSON: So after several years of double digit increases in the price of gold per ounce, is this rush over?</p><p>STEEL: I don't think so. Structurally, the long-term bull market that remains intact and we have no evidence it's been reversed. The rally may have been blunted a little bit towards the end of last area when we got a lot of liquidation selling related to the stock market and more recently, when Bernanke has distanced himself a little bit from a third round of Q.E.2.</p><p>HUDSON: The chairman of the Federal Reserve here in the U.S.</p><p>STEEL: That's correct, yes. And the (INAUDIBLE) two-year have gone, the bond yields have risen a little bit.</p><p>HUDSON: Yes. We've seen yields rise considerably just in the past week or so. But your forecast for gold prices over the next three years is to tap this year.</p><p>We got a chart here showing your forecast this year, an average price of $1,850. We're below $1,700 tonight. You think $1,800 an ounce next year, $1,750. Still kind of some easing pressure in gold prices.</p><p>Is -- are we going to see the high this year?</p><p>STEEL: Well, we're bullish on the market going forward, from these price levels for all three years out. But it looks as if the second half I think will be particularly robust. Because that's when we're looking for the U.S. dollar to pull back a little bit. There's an inverse correlation between the dollar and gold.</p><p>We also think there will be some increased official sector of purchases, they've been very good buyers last area and the year before.</p><p>HUDSON: The central bank will be in there buying gold, you think?</p><p>STEEL: We believe that will be -- I believe that will be the case, yes.</p><p>HUDSON: Let's talk about silver prices, because it kind of straddles between precious and industrial usage. Silver prices have been trending lower over the past 12 months, stuck in the low 30s here. Will it be able to break out?</p><p>STEEL: I think it's going to be difficult. As we approach $40, I think there will be some muscle memory from when we got up to $50 in May and we came back so quickly.</p><p>Also, I think it's hard to -- given that it's got greater supply, particularly from the mines, than gold or platinum or palladium has, I think it's difficult to justify it above that $40 level. So, we're more comfortable a little bit to the upside from where it is now.</p><p>HUDSON: OK. A little less bullish on silver.</p><p>You mentioned platinum and palladium. Palladium is your choice for the best price appreciation this year of precious metals, best known for its use in catalytic converts. Why palladium this year?</p><p>STEEL: Well, both platinum and palladium are going to benefit from the recovery in the auto industry. Even though China has slowed down a little bit, the United States has moved far ahead. And we've got the greatest marginal growth of any large industry. And that is going to absorb a significant amount of platinum and palladium.</p><p>Also, we have supply tightness from South Africa and from Russia for both platinum and palladium. But palladium we think has got -- is more difficult from a stock perception. So, it might go a little higher.</p><p>HUDSON: So, $700 or so for palladium. How high this year?</p><p>STEEL: We're looking for the market to get up to $775 is our average.</p><p>HUDSON: OK, about a 10 percent rally from these levels.</p><p>STEEL: Again for more in the second half of the year.</p><p>HUDSON: Has the diversification into precious metals, is that play over? In other words, have people diversified their assets partially into precious metals enough that you are not seeing those buyers in the market?</p><p>STEEL: We don't think, it's a crowded trade. I think gold and precious metals are one of those things that's talked about more than there's a lot of activity. A lot of people give the impression of having a significant amount of bullion but when you drill down, I don't think many investors have really been greatly exposed to the market.</p><p>HUDSON: OK. Are you long in any of these precious metals or short?</p><p>STEEL: No, I'm not allowed to be.</p><p>HUDSON: All right. James Steel here along with us. He covers the commodity and precious metals for HSBC Securities.</p><p>GHARIB: This is a key week for readings on the housing market and it started on a flat note. Homebuilders are about as optimistic as they were last month. Now, throughout this week, we'll see the latest on housing starts, sales and homebuilder earnings.</p><p>Darren Gersh looks at what may be shaping up as a the strongest year for housing since the bubble burst.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This year the stock market seems to be more bullish on home builders than the builders themselves. The National Association of Home Builders' reading of builder sentiment didn't budge this month, staying stuck a long way from what economist David Crowe calls a mild comfort level.</p><p>That's also what Crowe is expecting to learn from readings later this week on home sales and housing starts.</p><p>DAVID CROWE, CHIEF ECON., NAT'L. ASSN. OF HOME BUILDERS: I don't think we are going to see any barn burners. This is not a recovery that's going to just leap forward at a moment. It's going to continue to be a slow process.</p><p>GERSH: 2011 was the worst year on record for new home sales. But this year, investors seem confident the worst is over. As a group, stocks of home builders are up 26 percent year to date, double the gain for the broader market.</p><p>Pointing to an improving labor market, low mortgage rates and plenty of pent-up demand, investors think survivors of the brutal housing bust are well-positioned for the future.</p><p>But builders still have to compete with foreclosures and falling prices in many markets.</p><p>CROWE: We've yet to see any significant surge in either starts or sales on the new side. So, I think those stock price movements are anticipatory of an improving market.</p><p>GERSH: Housing analyst Alex Barron expects KB Home (NYSE:KBH) will show very strong revenue growth when it reports at the end of the week. Same with Lennar (NYSE:LEN) next week.</p><p>But Barron is looking for KB Home (NYSE:KBH) to report a loss due to hefty interest costs, and Lennar (NYSE:LEN) to exceed expectations. And he predicts investors will increasingly focus on that kind of relative performance in the coming year.</p><p>ALEX BARRON, PRES. &amp; FOUNDER, HOUSING RESEARCH CTR: The companies that are losing money, I think investors are going to think twice about owning those.</p><p>GERSH (on camera): Which companies do well may also depend on how much business they do in the 100 markets where the National Association of Home Builders says the economic foundation is strongest and prices are rising.</p><p>Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GHARIB: The world's largest delivery company is getting even bigger. UPS is buying Dutch shipping firm TNT Express (NYSE:EXPR) for almost $7 billion. UPS is confident the all-cash bid can overcome any European Union regulatory hurdles. It has even agreed to a reverse break-up fee, in other words, where UPS would pay TNT roughly $260 million if the deal is blocked.</p><p>UPS is counting on the deal to boost international sales by 50 percent in the next five years.</p><p>And, Tom, investors really like the news, UPS shares were among the best movers on Wall Street, rising $2.70. That works out to 3 percent, to $81 a share. Not bad.</p><p>HUDSON: Not bad at all. Nice vote of confidence for a buyer making that investment in international shipping. In fact, it helped lead the Dow transports gain here today, Susie.</p><p>Let's go ahead and take a look what else is moving with tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HUDSON: Of course, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) joining the ranks of dividend- paying stocks in the months ahead, really helped the major stock indices continue to climb to post-recession highs today. The S&amp;P 500 saw buying throughout the session, even though it cooled somewhat from its session high that came in the early afternoon hours.</p><p>It has been an historic rally for the S&amp;P 500 index, shooting up to its highest level tonight since May 2008, now just 10 percent below its record high hit back in the fall of 2007.</p><p>And thanks to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it was the tech sector behind today's gains, followed by the financial and energy sectors. But none of the top three were up more than 1 percent. So, some muted gains overall.</p><p>Now, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the tech sector, companies suspected of supplying parts to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s newest iPad weren't far behind. By the way, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has now sold 3 million of its newest iPad since its launch back on Friday. And a trio of semiconductor makers expected to supply some of those parts -- Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) -- all rose at least 2 percent today.</p><p>Now, one tech to watch tomorrow will be software maker Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). Shares were under pressure after the closing bell tonight. That pressure came after Adobe reported earnings on target with estimates, 57 cents per share. But revenues came in shy of expectations.</p><p>Now, critics have worried about the company's shift to charging subscription fees away from a more traditional software licensing business model.</p><p>And that shift began this quarter. It amounts it first back in November, and after taking an initial hit to its share price, the stock has been able to rally. It was up 2 percent during the regular session just today. However, it dropped almost 5 percent after hours below $33 per share after reporting disappointing revenue.</p><p>The first quarter is expected to be disappointing for steel makers. Several of them already have issued profit warnings -- thanks to lower demand and finished prices falling faster than raw material prices.</p><p>But we have seen some optimism come back to steel stocks this month, including today. U.S. Steel's 6 percent rally was the best among the S&amp;P 500 stocks. Despite today's rally, U.S. Steel shares are still down 40 percent over the past year.</p><p>Now, we also saw some optimism, or after the close optimism from fashion designer Michael Kors. The company just came public late last year. Shares were down 2 percent during the regular session, but were 4 percent stronger after the bell. That came after the company raised its quarterly earnings guidance even though it cautioned its revenue may actually be disappointing.</p><p>Now, it blames that on problems with a new distribution center delaying deliveries. The company also is taking advantage of its share price rally more than doubling since its initial offering. It's looking to sell more stock according to the \"Wall Street Journal\" tonight.</p><p>Meantime, retailer Kohl's fell 3 percent on the session on heavy volume. In its annual report released today, it says it will be less aggressive passing along higher commodity costs to shoppers, hurting its profit margins.</p><p>Now, while the stock indices are running higher, so are bond interest rates continuing to move higher, meaning bond prices have been moving lower. Bond interest rates and prices, of course, move in opposite directions. The yield on the 10-year treasury note jumped to almost 2.4 percent. This is the highest yield, lowest price of the year.</p><p>Now, interest rates have pushed significantly higher in just the past week, moving from 2 percent to tonight's settlement at almost 2.4 percent. The sell-off in bonds began after the Federal Reserve was slightly more optimistic on the economy during last week's meeting.</p><p>And that is tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HUDSON: We should learn tomorrow if a trade fight brewing between the U.S. and China will move forward. This fight is over solar panels and whether Chinese manufacturers have used subsidies from their government to drop the cost of the panels and then selling those panels in America at prices below their cost. More than 150 U.S. solar companies, including seven manufacturers, call the practice illegal, saying it has hurt the solar industry in the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM BRIGHTBILL, ATTORNEY, WILEY REIN LLP: Demand is growing in the United States for solar. It's doubled each of the last two years. This is an industry that should be growing and adding thousands of jobs and dozens of companies. Instead, China, with its government-sponsored industry and subsidies has taken that growth and is looking to dominate the world market through the expansion of its solar industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUDSON: Solar panel prices fell 50 percent last year, hurting profits and the stock prices of those manufacturers. Critics point to the below cost Chinese-made panels for a dozen U.S. makers laying off workers, going out of business or declaring bankruptcy.</p><p>If regulators agree with the complaint, Chinese-made solar panels may be slapped with tariffs. Now, just today, the Commerce Department slapped tariffs on Chinese-made steel wheels. U.S. makers successfully argued they were unfairly subsidized by the Chinese government and sold below market value.</p><p>GHARIB: Let's take a look now what we're watching for you for tomorrow.</p><p>The chairman returns as professor for one day. Former Princeton professor, now Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, kicks off a series of lectures to college students about the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is on Capitol Hill to talk international finance with Congress.</p><p>The web has changed the way we think about business and how we get things done. Tonight's commentator says its time to apply that same re- thinking to corporate America.</p><p>Here's Billy Parish, co-author of \"Making Good.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILLY PARISH, CO-AUTHOR, \"MAKING GOOD\": Every day, my generation is told our prospects are bleak. These are tough economic times, but the world I have had a glimpse of is filled with meaningful jobs because there is so much work to do.</p><p>Today, we need to rethink, redesign and rebuild industry in a way that does good. Every single industry will be retooled for the 21st century. This is where the jobs are.</p><p>For my new book \"Making Good,\" we interviewed hundreds of people working in diverse industries.

We can't afford to wait for the change to come to us. We must proactively be a part of it. Then, we will all be making good.</p><p>I'm Billy Parish.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HUDSON: Finally, building a better burger. A new pecking order in burger land. Listen to this, Wendy's has now dethroned the king, Burger King, as the country's second largest hamburger chain measured by sales volume.</p><p>Wendy's had sales of $8.5 billion last year. B.K.'s sales were $8.4 billion. McDonald's, though, still the king, still rules when it comes to burgers, over $34 billion in sales.</p><p>But for fast food overall, McDonald's, yes, is number one, followed by Subway and then Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) where sales neared $10 billion last year.</p><p>Susie, I'm going to put you down for one double cheeseburger. How about that for dinner?</p><p>GHARIB: I have a real weakness for the French fries. I don't usually go for fast food, but those French fries.</p><p>HUDSON: I'll take the burger, you get the fries. Here we go.</p><p>That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT this Monday, March 19th. I'm Tom Hudson. Good night. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>Have a great evening, Susie.</p><p>GHARIB: Same to you, Tom.

Official estimates are out.  The Republican-backed bill would lower the  federal deficit but boost the ranks of the uninsured and the cost of  premium.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Steering a new course.  Intel  makes a multi-billion dollar purchase to become a major player in the self- driving car industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  Gas glut.  Gasoline hasn't been in such plentiful supply in the  U.S. in nearly 30 years, and that could be good news for drivers.</p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March  13th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Well, the numbers are in, the House health care bill, a key part of the new  administration's agenda, has been analyzed.  And here is what the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says: the bill would reduce the  federal deficit more than $330 billion over ten years, 14 million more  Americans would be uninsured under the new bill than under Obamacare by the  year 2018, 24 million by the year 2026.  Premiums would increase for  individual insurance holders by 15 to 20 percent.</p><p>John Harwood is in Washington tonight for more -- with more for us.</p><p>John, those are the rough numbers but what else did the CBO report say?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, they say that  insurance premiums will go up in the next two years, go down after that,  but only for some people.  Younger people's premiums go down because  they'll be able to buy smaller policies.  Older people's premiums will go  up and the CBO also projected that deductibles on average will rise under  this plan, not fall, which is what President Trump said he would -- they  would do.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Within just the past few minutes, Secretary Price and OMB  Director Mulvaney have been out and been very critical of this OMB -- of  this CBO report.  What was the reaction?</p><p>HARWOOD:  Well, they're saying that the coverage can't fall that much.   They disagree strenuously.  CBO did not consider all of the relevant  factors.  But keep in mind, Tyler, Tom Price himself as the House budget  chair appointed the current director of the Congressional Budget Office.   That serves to undercut the idea that the CBO was biased against the Trump  administration.  These numbers going to be very damaging to the Republican  effort to pass an Obamacare repeal and replacement.</p><p>HERERA:  I think I know what happens next, but you handicap it for me.</p><p>HARWOOD:  Well, I think Republicans -- first of all, this bill, Sue, who  was in trouble to begin with, because there are many conservatives who  think it is Obamacare light, that it creates a new entitlement and then  those on the left and more moderate Republicans think it takes away  coverage from too many people.  They've got to figure out what which way  they want to move which group they want to try to placate, it's not going  to be very easy to decide pick one direction and try to figure out a path  to a majority in the House and Senate from there.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  John Harwood in Washington -- John, thank you.</p><p>HARWOOD:  You bet.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, that CBO report on health care was just one big event that  investors will watch this week and they'll get a chance to react come  tomorrow, and it comes as a new dynamic enters the market.  Today, the Dow  Jones Industrial Average lost 21 points to finish at 20,881.  The NASDAQ  however was up by 14, and the S&amp;P 500 rose fractionally.</p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look at the big events ahead and the changing tone on  the trading floor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The uptrend and stocks  is still intact, but the market is split between winners and losers as  opposed to February, when there were almost all winners.  So, tech and bank  stocks to continue to do well, those are the largest sectors in the S&amp;P.   So, that's a big reason the overall market is still up this month.</p><p>Now, a little bit more worrisome has been the trend in small-cap stock they  got off to a strong start for the year but they've stayed it a bit.  Yet,  small-cap Russell is about five percent off its historic high of just a few  weeks ago.  That's a modest decline but much more than the 2 percent  decline for the S&amp;P or the one percent decline for the NASDAQ, which holds  many of the big tech stocks.</p><p>Now, this waffling is unlikely to continue.  There's plenty of market  moving events later this week, including the Fed's decision on interest  rates that will be Wednesday.  There's also the Dutch election on Wednesday  as well.  There's the release of the president's budget on Thursday and  more decisions on raising weights from the central banks in England and  Japan the same day.</p><p>There's one other small wild card for stocks.  President Trump meets with  German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday in Washington.  Now, Trump's  chief trade advisor has called Germany a currency manipulator for keeping  the euro low, even though it's the central bank, the European central bank  that sets monetary policy.</p><p>Immigration, NATO and Russia will all be on the agenda. I would love to be  a fly on the wall for that one.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the NYSE.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  So, Bob laid out some of the things that are ahead for stocks.   Here to discuss how this week's events could shape the markets is Michael  Farr.  He is the president of money management firm Farr, Miller and  Washington.</p><p>Good to see you, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL FARR, PRESIDENT, FARR, MILLER AND WASHINGTON:  Thank you, Sue.   Nice to be here.</p><p>HERERA:  Let me start first of all with this report that we got about the  health care initiatives that the Trump administration is putting forward.   Obviously, there is going to be much debate but you point out in your notes  that the market seems to be pricing in almost perfection that the entire  Trump agenda will go through.</p><p>So, given what we've just heard, what do you think the market reaction will  be?</p><p>FARR:  You know, Sue, this has kind of been my worry since November right  after the election.  Markets started to move a lot higher based on a lot of  optimism and hope for this agenda, which -- and a lot of it is very  stimulative but Washington doesn't work that way.  Washington's kind of  slow and messy.  The CBO has to step in and score a bill which we've seen  just happen.</p><p>Republicans have to get a bill through here, any kind of a bill to get it  to kind of a House/Senate conference where the next step of sausage making  gets made.  But this looks like something that could get well into 2017 or  even 2018, and this is kind of what's going to happen with a political  agenda working its way through Washington.  We're going to see this again  with the tax cuts.  We're going to see this again with other immigration  things.</p><p>So, we just hope that the markets can be patient while Congress does what  it does.</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, is it your surmise then based on that that the up, up and  away rise in stock prices that we've seen for the last three months is  going to level off a bit, maybe correct a little bit, and that now is not a  particularly optimal time to be putting fresh money in big ways into the  equity markets?</p><p>FARR:  You know, I wrote in my market commentary that we could be on the  beginning of a next 3,000-point move, whether it's to the upside or the  downside, I just can't possibly tell you.</p><p>We haven't had a correction in a long time.  We've made a bunch of all time  highs.  It would -- market, you know, experienced people say market could  correct and the market should give some back.  </p><p>Why?  What's going to be the -- what's going to be the cause, what will be  the spark?  We really don't know.  We might not even know it when we see  it.  But it should give some back.</p><p>HERERA:  Michael, Bob Pisani and his piece laid out some of the other  events globally, elections in various other countries in Europe, how much  influence do you think that will have on the market versus the domestic  agenda?</p><p>FARR:  I think that it could have a big influence depending on what  happens.  This is this Dutch candidate and we're going to find out about  Wednesday is a nationalist candidate.  There -- they want to close the  Netherlands' borders.  They are anti-Islam.  They want to close mosques.   They want to leave the euro and the E.U.  That, it would open the door I  think then to what happens in France and will Marine Le Pen be elected.</p><p>And if these sort of series of events occur, then you see a breakup I think  of the E.U. and that does affect what happens here.</p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>FARR:  And a trend towards nationalism and protectionism that begins to  take place on a global basis.  Markets aren't expecting that.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Michael, thank you very much.</p><p>FARR:  Thanks so much.</p><p>HERERA:  Michael Farr with Farr, Miller, and Washington.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And as central bank policymakers prepare to meet tomorrow and  Wednesday in Washington, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta will soon have  a new president.  </p><p>University of Southern California economics professor Raphael Bostic was  approved by the Atlanta Fed's board and by the Fed's board of governors in  Washington.  When he takes over in June, he will be the first black  regional bank president in the central bank's under 100 history.  </p><p>Professor Bostic has done work on home ownership and housing finance.  He  succeeds Dennis Lockhart who retired at the end of last month.</p><p>HERERA:  Stocks have been also eyeing the oil market and today, prices  extended their losing streak to a sixth straight session.  Domestic crude  settled just above $48 a barrel as growth in the U.S. production threatens  to offset the cuts from OPEC.</p><p>Now, it's not just excess oil that has investors concerned, but also a  gasoline glut.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis reports tonight from a gasoline storage facility in  Sewaren, New Jersey.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  crude oil and  gasoline storage like the tanks that you see behind me are at record levels  according to the Energy Information Administration.  This could be good  news for consumers.</p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, AGAIN CAPITAL FOUNDING PARTNER:  It's why consumers in the  U.S. have been able to enjoy relatively low gasoline prices for the better  part of two years now.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  But oil companies are nervous.  They've seen this pattern  before.  Too much supply, not enough demand to meet it.  In fact, February  of last year when prices were near $26, it was the same kind of situation.   Analysts say it's possible again but this time could be different.</p><p>ANDY LIPOW, LIPOW OIL ASSOCIATES PRES.:  Given the extraordinarily high and  record inventories on the East Coast, we've actually seen two things  happen.  In December, the U.S. exported record amounts of gasoline and, on  the other hand, last week, we saw gasoline imports into the U.S.  We see  lowest level since November of.</p><p>And the combination of the two is going to help us reduce all that winter  grade gasoline inventory that's been laying around.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  This all could have an impact on stocks as well.</p><p>Lower oil prices could pressure big oil and the stock market.  Chevron and  Exxon are Dow components.  </p><p>But there are other segments of the sector that could get hit.</p><p>LIPOW:  Given that they're a very high gasoline inventories we're seeing  gasoline prices of course come under pressure, which is good news for the  consumer but it's bad news for refining margins and as a result, those  independent refiners are seeing their stock prices come under pressure.</p><p>DEANGELIS:  Majority of people did not see this falling prices coming.  So,  what happens next could surprise everyone again.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis in Sewaren, New Jersey.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  A surprise acquisition by Intel, the world's largest computer  chip maker, will pay $15 billion to acquire Mobileye, a firm focused on  developing technology for self-driving cars.  Mobileye soared 28 percent  today.  The Dow component Intel dropped 2 percent.</p><p>Jon Fortt has more on the deal that puts Intel right in the middle of one  of tech's hottest segments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Fifteen billion dollars  is a lot even for a company the size of Intel.  There's only one time it's  paid more for a company and that was Altera just two years ago.  The second  big purchase is the latest sign of a strategy shift under Intel CEO Brian  Krzanich.  He took the job nearly four years ago after the company had  missed the smartphone revolution.  He also faced the middle age PC market  and few clear paths to growth.</p><p>His answer: pull back from the traditional PC market and invest instead in  cutting-edge areas like virtual reality, drone sensors and cars.  And  that's where Mobileye comes in.</p><p>BRIAN KRZANICH, INTEL CEO:  There in more than just cars.  They'll be in  high-end devices like the spotting cameras on helicopters.  They'll be in  high-end drones.  They'll be in high-end robotics as well.  </p><p>And so, it's really about computer vision and how computer vision is going  to change the world.  It's -- in order to have true artificial intelligence  of a mobile device, you have to have computer vision.  That system has to  be able to see the world in order to be able to interpret the world and  navigate or work within the world.</p><p>FORTT:  Intel is not the only company betting big on the car and computer  vision.  Five months ago, fellow chip giant Qualcomm said it will pay about  $40 billion dollars for NXP semiconductors, which specializes in automotive  and wireless technologies.</p><p>Of course, Facebook bought virtual reality company Oculus years ago.  </p><p>And don't forget Snap.  It just went public earlier this month calling  itself a camera company.  That's a nod to its own version of computer  vision.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt in New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, why the plug has been pulled on a billion dollar deal.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  A veteran of the Food and Drug Administration has been tapped by  President Trump to lead that agency.  If approved, Scott Gottlieb would be  charged with cutting red tape and examining the drug approval process.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell looks at who he is and his potential impact.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The pharmaceutical  industry's response to President Donald Trump's nominee for FDA  commissioner, thank, God, it's Gottlieb.  The news that Dr. Scott Gottlieb  is Trump's pick to regulate the country's food and medicines came after  months of speculation and rumored names included candidates with no formal  medical training. </p><p>So, the choice of Gottlieb, an M.D., is leading to something of a sigh of  relief for the industry.  </p><p>BRIAN SKORNEY, ROBERT W. BAIRD BIOTECH ANALYST:  Some of the names that  have been floated out there in the rumor mill are very extreme on the  deregulation side.  He's a very well-rounded individual.</p><p>TIRRELL:  Gottlieb, a fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, and a  venture capitalist served in the FDA under President George W. Bush.  If  confirmed, he'd take the helm of the drug regulator at a time of intense  scrutiny of the industry's prices.  </p><p>The FDA isn't authorized to address pricing directly but Gottlieb has a  long track record of advocating for increased competition to help lower  prices, particularly in areas like complex generics such as the EpiPen, a  device and a drug in one.</p><p>SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER-DESIGNATE:  Complex drugs have become very  hard to go into the market.  It's not just with the EpiPen, but also things  like metered-dose inhalers or liposomal agents or topical agents.  Anytime  it's hard for the agency to demonstrate sameness between one drug in  another, the agency has a very hard time.  We were literally talking about  this very issue years ago in ours at FDA.</p><p>TIRRELL:  Many industry watchers expect Gottlieb to focus on flexibility  within the agency, to speed drugs, both generics and new medicines, to  market.  </p><p>But it's Gottlieb's familiarity with the drug industry that's drawing  criticism.  The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen says, quote,  \"Gottlieb is entangled in an unprecedented web of big pharma ties,\" citing  more than $400,000 Gottlieb was paid in fees from drug and medical device  companies between 2013 and 2015.  Gottlieb declined to comment.</p><p>And some see his involvement with the industry as an attribute. </p><p>SKORNEY:  It's very hard to find qualified people who don't have some  conflict because, frankly, if you're going to get things done, you have to  have perspective on every angle, and you have to be willing to work with  industry, you have to be willing to work with physicians, insurers.  You  know, you have to keep all stakeholders interests on the table.</p><p>TIRRELL:  And, in an unfamiliar display of bipartisan support, Andy Slavitt  who ran Medicare and Medicaid for President Obama said of Gottlieb on  Twitter, quote, \"A very good choice.\" </p><p>Gottlieb still needs to be confirmed by the Senate.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Citrix Systems may be exploring a sale and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>A report from Bloomberg says the $13 billion business software company is  working with Goldman Sachs to find a potential buyer, and that sent shares  of Citrix up more than 6 percent to $84.93.</p><p>Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals fell after hours following a CNBC report  that activist investor Bill Ackman sold his entire position in the  embattled drugmaker.  Ackman is said to have sold more than $27 million  shares at $11 each.  He is also expected to step down from Valeant's board  of directors. Valeant shares initially fell about 10 percent in extended- hours trading and that was on top of a one percent drop during the regular  day session where they closed at $12.11.</p><p>MATHISEN:  According to a regulatory filing out Friday, billionaire  investor Carl Icahn up to his stake in the truck maker Navistar to more  than 17 percent.  Icahn had owned about a $16 percent stake in the company.   Navistar up more than 1 percent in price action today.  It finished at  $26.46.</p><p>The Chinese biotech company Hutchison China MediTech better known as Chi- Med said strong commercial sales help drive its latest quarterly numbers.   The cancer drug maker said revenue up 21 percent, while profit also rose.   Chi-Med shares jumped nearly 13 percent to $15.97.</p><p>HERERA:  A billion dollar cross-border deal falls apart.  China's richest  man who is also the head of Wanda Group, will no longer buy Dick Clark  Productions, the company behind the Golden Globes and the American Music  Awards.  The agreement would have marked the Chinese company's first move  in Hollywood, but as Eunice Yoon explains, that deal is now dead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  China's Wanda isn't  commenting on the decision but Dick Clark productions representatives say  that Wanda couldn't meet its contractual obligation.  Since Wanda  traditionally hasn't had trouble raising financing in this country, people  are reading this to mean that Wanda couldn't make a payment because it  doesn't have the same level of government support as it did before to get  its money out of the country.</p><p>Beijing has had an overarching national policy to encourage companies like  Wanda to go overseas, spread their wings and become global champions.   However, that strategy has been running into conflict with another  important priority of Beijing, that is to stabilize the currency and clamp  down on capital outflows.</p><p>Over the past couple of days, we've heard some sharp criticism from high- level government officials, the commerce minister called some of the  investments blind and irrational and also the Chinese central bank governor  said that investments in certain industries weren't aligned with industrial  policies, such as sports and entertainment.</p><p>Now, Wanda wants to become a major powerhouse in the entertainment  industry.  It's already a known quantity in Hollywood after buying over AMC  on cinema chain, as well as the film producing company Legendary  Entertainment.  And now, with this investment in takeover of Dick Clark  Productions, the company had hoped to make a foray into the American TV  market.  However, those plans, as well as its global ambitions, are now on  hold.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, we will take you on a trip over Austin, Texas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Julia Boorstin  in Austin, Texas, going up in this helicopter to tell you why Lockheed  Martin is bringing South by Southwest entrepreneurs a thousand feet in the  air.  That's coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  Want to know what's trending in technology, media and investing,  look no further than the South by Southwest conference in Austin it started  out as a music festival.  But now, it's a place where gadgets are put on  display, among other things, and as Julia Boorstin reports, this year,  companies are going big.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  South by Southwest  gathers nearly 100,000 attendees, hundreds of companies, and dozens of big  brands trying to get the attention of the early adopters who are here.  And  it's become a key battleground for media giants new and old to market their  originals and sell their subscriptions directly to consumers.</p><p>Amazon created this Resistance Radio headquarters to promote its original  series \"Man in the High Castle\", hosting a number of events such as a film  festival oasis hosted by Amazon video Direct.  Netflix is premiering five  of its shows and offering an interactive experience around 13 reasons why,  these lockers spread around often.</p><p>Meanwhile, HBO's featuring the throne from \"Game of Thrones\", plus an  escape room experience around three of its hit shows.  </p><p>And Turner is here promoting a range of its new content.  Cartoon Network  president Christina Miller telling us reaching this audience directly is  more important than ever.</p><p>CHRISTINA MILLER, CARTOON NETWORK PRESIDENT:  The control is in the  consumers' hands at this point, and we deal with the earliest audience in  plurals or generation Z, as a lot of people are calling them.  They're the  most mobile audience they've grown up with a ton of choice and they want  control in that choice.</p><p>So, I think user experience is that kind of third leg on the stool with  brands and distribution.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  And it's not just media brands that are trying to stand out here  at South by Southwest.  Lockheed Martin's venture capital arm is fielding  entrepreneur pitches up here in a helicopter a thousand feet above, often  looking to make strategic investments in startups that will benefit the  aerospace and defense company.</p><p>And there's a range of tech startups here.  Following Snap's surprise  description is a camera company, Pinterest considered next in line for an  IPO, is here promoting how it's putting cameras front and center for the  first time, with a Pinterest lens which does visual search.  </p><p>And some venture capitalists we talked to here tell us that after Snap's  huge IPO, they're pushing companies to strike while the iron is hot.</p><p>JOSH ELMAN, GREYLOCK PARTNERS:  The market seems like it's at all-time  highs.  People are actually bullish on the jobs reports and everything  else.  So, I'm actually -- we're encouraging every company that feels like  it's ready to be a public company not to wait.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  There hasn't been one real breakout app like there was when  Twitter and Snapchat were in the spotlight.  But there has been a lot of  buzz about virtual and augmented reality with many insiders saying this  could be the year that those technologies go mainstream.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Austin, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  That was pretty cool.</p><p>That does it for us tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.  I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p>We want to remind you, this is the time of year your public television  stations seeks your support.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And we're grateful for it.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.

Official estimates are out. The Republican-backed bill would lower the federal deficit but boost the ranks of the uninsured and the cost of premium.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Steering a new course. Intel makes a multi-billion dollar purchase to become a major player in the self- driving car industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: Gas glut. Gasoline hasn`t been in such plentiful supply in the U.S. in nearly 30 years, and that could be good news for drivers.</p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March 13th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Well, the numbers are in, the House health care bill, a key part of the new administration`s agenda, has been analyzed. And here is what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says: the bill would reduce the federal deficit more than $330 billion over ten years, 14 million more Americans would be uninsured under the new bill than under Obamacare by the year 2018, 24 million by the year 2026. Premiums would increase for individual insurance holders by 15 to 20 percent.</p><p>John Harwood is in Washington tonight for more -- with more for us.</p><p>John, those are the rough numbers but what else did the CBO report say?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, they say that insurance premiums will go up in the next two years, go down after that, but only for some people. Younger people`s premiums go down because they`ll be able to buy smaller policies. Older people`s premiums will go up and the CBO also projected that deductibles on average will rise under this plan, not fall, which is what President Trump said he would -- they would do.</p><p>MATHISEN: Within just the past few minutes, Secretary Price and OMB Director Mulvaney have been out and been very critical of this OMB -- of this CBO report. What was the reaction?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, they`re saying that the coverage can`t fall that much. They disagree strenuously. CBO did not consider all of the relevant factors. But keep in mind, Tyler, <person><nameText>Tom Price </nameText></person>himself as the House budget chair appointed the current director of the Congressional Budget Office. That serves to undercut the idea that the CBO was biased against the Trump administration. These numbers going to be very damaging to the Republican effort to pass an Obamacare repeal and replacement.</p><p>HERERA: I think I know what happens next, but you handicap it for me.</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, I think Republicans -- first of all, this bill, Sue, who was in trouble to begin with, because there are many conservatives who think it is Obamacare light, that it creates a new entitlement and then those on the left and more moderate Republicans think it takes away coverage from too many people. They`ve got to figure out what which way they want to move which group they want to try to placate, it`s not going to be very easy to decide pick one direction and try to figure out a path to a majority in the House and Senate from there.</p><p>HERERA: All right. John Harwood in Washington -- John, thank you.</p><p>HARWOOD: You bet.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, that CBO report on health care was just one big event that investors will watch this week and they`ll get a chance to react come tomorrow, and it comes as a new dynamic enters the market. Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 21 points to finish at 20,881. The NASDAQ however was up by 14, and the S&amp;P 500 rose fractionally.</p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look at the big events ahead and the changing tone on the trading floor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The uptrend and stocks is still intact, but the market is split between winners and losers as opposed to February, when there were almost all winners. So, tech and bank stocks to continue to do well, those are the largest sectors in the S&amp;P. So, that`s a big reason the overall market is still up this month.</p><p>Now, a little bit more worrisome has been the trend in small-cap stock they got off to a strong start for the year but they`ve stayed it a bit. Yet, small-cap Russell is about five percent off its historic high of just a few weeks ago. That`s a modest decline but much more than the 2 percent decline for the S&amp;P or the one percent decline for the NASDAQ, which holds many of the big tech stocks.</p><p>Now, this waffling is unlikely to continue. There`s plenty of market moving events later this week, including the Fed`s decision on interest rates that will be Wednesday. There`s also the Dutch election on Wednesday as well. There`s the release of the president`s budget on Thursday and more decisions on raising weights from the central banks in England and Japan the same day.</p><p>There`s one other small wild card for stocks. President Trump meets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday in Washington. Now, Trump`s chief trade advisor has called Germany a currency manipulator for keeping the euro low, even though it`s the central bank, the European central bank that sets monetary policy.</p><p>Immigration, NATO and Russia will all be on the agenda. I would love to be a fly on the wall for that one.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the NYSE.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: So, Bob laid out some of the things that are ahead for stocks. Here to discuss how this week`s events could shape the markets is Michael Farr. He is the president of money management firm Farr, Miller and Washington.</p><p>Good to see you, Michael.</p><p>MICHAEL FARR, PRESIDENT, FARR, MILLER AND WASHINGTON: Thank you, Sue. Nice to be here.</p><p>HERERA: Let me start first of all with this report that we got about the health care initiatives that the Trump administration is putting forward. Obviously, there is going to be much debate but you point out in your notes that the market seems to be pricing in almost perfection that the entire Trump agenda will go through.</p><p>So, given what we`ve just heard, what do you think the market reaction will be?</p><p>FARR: You know, Sue, this has kind of been my worry since November right after the election. Markets started to move a lot higher based on a lot of optimism and hope for this agenda, which -- and a lot of it is very stimulative but Washington doesn`t work that way. Washington`s kind of slow and messy. The CBO has to step in and score a bill which we`ve seen just happen.</p><p>Republicans have to get a bill through here, any kind of a bill to get it to kind of a House/Senate conference where the next step of sausage making gets made. But this looks like something that could get well into 2017 or even 2018, and this is kind of what`s going to happen with a political agenda working its way through Washington. We`re going to see this again with the tax cuts. We`re going to see this again with other immigration things.</p><p>So, we just hope that the markets can be patient while Congress does what it does.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, is it your surmise then based on that that the up, up and away rise in stock prices that we`ve seen for the last three months is going to level off a bit, maybe correct a little bit, and that now is not a particularly optimal time to be putting fresh money in big ways into the equity markets?</p><p>FARR: You know, I wrote in my market commentary that we could be on the beginning of a next 3,000-point move, whether it`s to the upside or the downside, I just can`t possibly tell you.</p><p>We haven`t had a correction in a long time. We`ve made a bunch of all time highs. It would -- market, you know, experienced people say market could correct and the market should give some back.</p><p>Why? What`s going to be the -- what`s going to be the cause, what will be the spark? We really don`t know. We might not even know it when we see it. But it should give some back.</p><p>HERERA: Michael, Bob Pisani and his piece laid out some of the other events globally, elections in various other countries in Europe, how much influence do you think that will have on the market versus the domestic agenda?</p><p>FARR: I think that it could have a big influence depending on what happens. This is this Dutch candidate and we`re going to find out about Wednesday is a nationalist candidate. There -- they want to close the Netherlands` borders. They are anti-Islam. They want to close mosques. They want to leave the euro and the E.U. That, it would open the door I think then to what happens in France and will Marine Le Pen be elected.</p><p>And if these sort of series of events occur, then you see a breakup I think of the E.U. and that does affect what happens here.</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>FARR: And a trend towards nationalism and protectionism that begins to take place on a global basis. Markets aren`t expecting that.</p><p>HERERA: All right. On that note, Michael, thank you very much.</p><p>FARR: Thanks so much.</p><p>HERERA: Michael Farr with Farr, Miller, and Washington.</p><p>MATHISEN: And as central bank policymakers prepare to meet tomorrow and Wednesday in Washington, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta will soon have a new president.</p><p>University of Southern California economics professor Raphael Bostic was approved by the Atlanta Fed`s board and by the Fed`s board of governors in Washington. When he takes over in June, he will be the first black regional bank president in the central bank`s under 100 history.</p><p>Professor Bostic has done work on home ownership and housing finance. He succeeds Dennis Lockhart who retired at the end of last month.</p><p>HERERA: Stocks have been also eyeing the oil market and today, prices extended their losing streak to a sixth straight session. Domestic crude settled just above $48 a barrel as growth in the U.S. production threatens to offset the cuts from OPEC.</p><p>Now, it`s not just excess oil that has investors concerned, but also a gasoline glut.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis reports tonight from a gasoline storage facility in Sewaren, New Jersey.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: crude oil and gasoline storage like the tanks that you see behind me are at record levels according to the Energy Information Administration. This could be good news for consumers.</p><p>JOHN KILDUFF, AGAIN CAPITAL FOUNDING PARTNER: It`s why consumers in the U.S. have been able to enjoy relatively low gasoline prices for the better part of two years now.</p><p>DEANGELIS: But oil companies are nervous. They`ve seen this pattern before. Too much supply, not enough demand to meet it. In fact, February of last year when prices were near $26, it was the same kind of situation. Analysts say it`s possible again but this time could be different.</p><p>ANDY LIPOW, LIPOW OIL ASSOCIATES PRES.: Given the extraordinarily high and record inventories on the East Coast, we`ve actually seen two things happen. In December, the U.S. exported record amounts of gasoline and, on the other hand, last week, we saw gasoline imports into the U.S. We see lowest level since November of.</p><p>And the combination of the two is going to help us reduce all that winter grade gasoline inventory that`s been laying around.</p><p>DEANGELIS: This all could have an impact on stocks as well.</p><p>Lower oil prices could pressure big oil and the stock market. Chevron and Exxon are Dow components.</p><p>But there are other segments of the sector that could get hit.</p><p>LIPOW: Given that they`re a very high gasoline inventories we`re seeing gasoline prices of course come under pressure, which is good news for the consumer but it`s bad news for refining margins and as a result, those independent refiners are seeing their stock prices come under pressure.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Majority of people did not see this falling prices coming. So, what happens next could surprise everyone again.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jackie DeAngelis in Sewaren, New Jersey.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: A surprise acquisition by Intel, the world`s largest computer chip maker, will pay $15 billion to acquire Mobileye, a firm focused on developing technology for self-driving cars. Mobileye soared 28 percent today. The Dow component Intel dropped 2 percent.</p><p>Jon Fortt has more on the deal that puts Intel right in the middle of one of tech`s hottest segments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Fifteen billion dollars is a lot even for a company the size of Intel. There`s only one time it`s paid more for a company and that was Altera just two years ago. The second big purchase is the latest sign of a strategy shift under Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. He took the job nearly four years ago after the company had missed the smartphone revolution. He also faced the middle age PC market and few clear paths to growth.</p><p>His answer: pull back from the traditional PC market and invest instead in cutting-edge areas like virtual reality, drone sensors and cars. And that`s where Mobileye comes in.</p><p>BRIAN KRZANICH, INTEL CEO: There in more than just cars. They`ll be in high-end devices like the spotting cameras on helicopters. They`ll be in high-end drones. They`ll be in high-end robotics as well.</p><p>And so, it`s really about computer vision and how computer vision is going to change the world. It`s -- in order to have true artificial intelligence of a mobile device, you have to have computer vision. That system has to be able to see the world in order to be able to interpret the world and navigate or work within the world.</p><p>FORTT: Intel is not the only company betting big on the car and computer vision. Five months ago, fellow chip giant Qualcomm said it will pay about $40 billion dollars for NXP semiconductors, which specializes in automotive and wireless technologies.</p><p>Of course, Facebook bought virtual reality company Oculus years ago.</p><p>And don`t forget Snap. It just went public earlier this month calling itself a camera company. That`s a nod to its own version of computer vision.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jon Fortt in New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, why the plug has been pulled on a billion dollar deal.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: A veteran of the Food and Drug Administration has been tapped by President Trump to lead that agency. If approved, Scott Gottlieb would be charged with cutting red tape and examining the drug approval process.</p><p>Meg Tirrell looks at who he is and his potential impact.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The pharmaceutical industry`s response to President Donald Trump`s nominee for FDA commissioner, thank, God, it`s Gottlieb. The news that Dr. Scott Gottlieb is Trump`s pick to regulate the country`s food and medicines came after months of speculation and rumored names included candidates with no formal medical training.</p><p>So, the choice of Gottlieb, an M.D., is leading to something of a sigh of relief for the industry.</p><p>BRIAN SKORNEY, ROBERT W. BAIRD BIOTECH ANALYST: Some of the names that have been floated out there in the rumor mill are very extreme on the deregulation side. He`s a very well-rounded individual.</p><p>TIRRELL: Gottlieb, a fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, and a venture capitalist served in the FDA under President George W. Bush. If confirmed, he`d take the helm of the drug regulator at a time of intense scrutiny of the industry`s prices.</p><p>The FDA isn`t authorized to address pricing directly but Gottlieb has a long track record of advocating for increased competition to help lower prices, particularly in areas like complex generics such as the EpiPen, a device and a drug in one.</p><p>SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER-DESIGNATE: Complex drugs have become very hard to go into the market. It`s not just with the EpiPen, but also things like metered-dose inhalers or liposomal agents or topical agents. Anytime it`s hard for the agency to demonstrate sameness between one drug in another, the agency has a very hard time. We were literally talking about this very issue years ago in ours at FDA.</p><p>TIRRELL: Many industry watchers expect Gottlieb to focus on flexibility within the agency, to speed drugs, both generics and new medicines, to market.</p><p>But it`s Gottlieb`s familiarity with the drug industry that`s drawing criticism. The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen says, quote, \"Gottlieb is entangled in an unprecedented web of big pharma ties,\" citing more than $400,000 Gottlieb was paid in fees from drug and medical device companies between 2013 and 2015. Gottlieb declined to comment.</p><p>And some see his involvement with the industry as an attribute.</p><p>SKORNEY: It`s very hard to find qualified people who don`t have some conflict because, frankly, if you`re going to get things done, you have to have perspective on every angle, and you have to be willing to work with industry, you have to be willing to work with physicians, insurers. You know, you have to keep all stakeholders interests on the table.</p><p>TIRRELL: And, in an unfamiliar display of bipartisan support, Andy Slavitt who ran Medicare and Medicaid for President Obama said of Gottlieb on Twitter, quote, \"A very good choice.\"</p><p>Gottlieb still needs to be confirmed by the Senate.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Citrix Systems may be exploring a sale and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>A report from Bloomberg says the $13 billion business software company is working with Goldman Sachs to find a potential buyer, and that sent shares of Citrix up more than 6 percent to $84.93.</p><p>Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals fell after hours following a CNBC report that activist investor Bill Ackman sold his entire position in the embattled drugmaker. Ackman is said to have sold more than $27 million shares at $11 each. He is also expected to step down from Valeant`s board of directors. Valeant shares initially fell about 10 percent in extended- hours trading and that was on top of a one percent drop during the regular day session where they closed at $12.11.</p><p>MATHISEN: According to a regulatory filing out Friday, billionaire investor Carl Icahn up to his stake in the truck maker Navistar to more than 17 percent. Icahn had owned about a $16 percent stake in the company. Navistar up more than 1 percent in price action today. It finished at $26.46.</p><p>The Chinese biotech company Hutchison China MediTech better known as Chi- Med said strong commercial sales help drive its latest quarterly numbers. The cancer drug maker said revenue up 21 percent, while profit also rose. Chi-Med shares jumped nearly 13 percent to $15.97.</p><p>HERERA: A billion dollar cross-border deal falls apart. China`s richest man who is also the head of Wanda Group, will no longer buy Dick Clark Productions, the company behind the Golden Globes and the American Music Awards. The agreement would have marked the Chinese company`s first move in Hollywood, but as Eunice Yoon explains, that deal is now dead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: China`s Wanda isn`t commenting on the decision but Dick Clark productions representatives say that Wanda couldn`t meet its contractual obligation. Since Wanda traditionally hasn`t had trouble raising financing in this country, people are reading this to mean that Wanda couldn`t make a payment because it doesn`t have the same level of government support as it did before to get its money out of the country.</p><p>Beijing has had an overarching national policy to encourage companies like Wanda to go overseas, spread their wings and become global champions. However, that strategy has been running into conflict with another important priority of Beijing, that is to stabilize the currency and clamp down on capital outflows.</p><p>Over the past couple of days, we`ve heard some sharp criticism from high- level government officials, the commerce minister called some of the investments blind and irrational and also the Chinese central bank governor said that investments in certain industries weren`t aligned with industrial policies, such as sports and entertainment.</p><p>Now, Wanda wants to become a major powerhouse in the entertainment industry. It`s already a known quantity in Hollywood after buying over AMC on cinema chain, as well as the film producing company Legendary Entertainment. And now, with this investment in takeover of Dick Clark Productions, the company had hoped to make a foray into the American TV market. However, those plans, as well as its global ambitions, are now on hold.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, we will take you on a trip over Austin, Texas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Julia Boorstin in Austin, Texas, going up in this helicopter to tell you why Lockheed Martin is bringing South by Southwest entrepreneurs a thousand feet in the air. That`s coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: Want to know what`s trending in technology, media and investing, look no further than the South by Southwest conference in Austin it started out as a music festival. But now, it`s a place where gadgets are put on display, among other things, and as Julia Boorstin reports, this year, companies are going big.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: South by Southwest gathers nearly 100,000 attendees, hundreds of companies, and dozens of big brands trying to get the attention of the early adopters who are here. And it`s become a key battleground for media giants new and old to market their originals and sell their subscriptions directly to consumers.</p><p>Amazon created this Resistance Radio headquarters to promote its original series \"Man in the High Castle\", hosting a number of events such as a film festival oasis hosted by Amazon video Direct. Netflix is premiering five of its shows and offering an interactive experience around 13 reasons why, these lockers spread around often.</p><p>Meanwhile, HBO`s featuring the throne from \"Game of Thrones\", plus an escape room experience around three of its hit shows.</p><p>And Turner is here promoting a range of its new content. Cartoon Network president Christina Miller telling us reaching this audience directly is more important than ever.</p><p>CHRISTINA MILLER, CARTOON NETWORK PRESIDENT: The control is in the consumers` hands at this point, and we deal with the earliest audience in plurals or generation Z, as a lot of people are calling them. They`re the most mobile audience they`ve grown up with a ton of choice and they want control in that choice.</p><p>So, I think user experience is that kind of third leg on the stool with brands and distribution.</p><p>BOORSTIN: And it`s not just media brands that are trying to stand out here at South by Southwest. Lockheed Martin`s venture capital arm is fielding entrepreneur pitches up here in a helicopter a thousand feet above, often looking to make strategic investments in startups that will benefit the aerospace and defense company.</p><p>And there`s a range of tech startups here. Following Snap`s surprise description is a camera company, Pinterest considered next in line for an IPO, is here promoting how it`s putting cameras front and center for the first time, with a Pinterest lens which does visual search.</p><p>And some venture capitalists we talked to here tell us that after Snap`s huge IPO, they`re pushing companies to strike while the iron is hot.</p><p>JOSH ELMAN, GREYLOCK PARTNERS: The market seems like it`s at all-time highs. People are actually bullish on the jobs reports and everything else. So, I`m actually -- we`re encouraging every company that feels like it`s ready to be a public company not to wait.</p><p>BOORSTIN: There hasn`t been one real breakout app like there was when Twitter and Snapchat were in the spotlight. But there has been a lot of buzz about virtual and augmented reality with many insiders saying this could be the year that those technologies go mainstream.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Austin, Texas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: That was pretty cool.</p><p>That does it for us tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. I`m Sue Herera.</p><p>We want to remind you, this is the time of year your public television stations seeks your support.</p><p>MATHISEN: And we`re grateful for it. I`m Tyler Mathisen.

Official estimates are out.  The Republican-backed bill would lower the  federal deficit but boost the ranks of the uninsured and the cost of  premium.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Steering a new course.  Intel  makes a multi-billion dollar purchase to become a major player in the self- driving car industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MATHISEN:  Gas glut.  Gasoline hasn't been in such plentiful supply in the  U.S. in nearly 30 years, and that could be good news for drivers.</p><p> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, March  13th.  </p><p> HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p> Well, the numbers are in, the House health care bill, a key part of the new  administration's agenda, has been analyzed.  And here is what the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says: the bill would reduce the  federal deficit more than $330 billion over ten years, 14 million more  Americans would be uninsured under the new bill than under Obamacare by the  year 2018, 24 million by the year 2026.  Premiums would increase for  individual insurance holders by 15 to 20 percent.</p><p> John Harwood is in Washington tonight for more -- with more for us.</p><p> John, those are the rough numbers but what else did the CBO report say?</p><p> JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, they say that  insurance premiums will go up in the next two years, go down after that,  but only for some people.  Younger people's premiums go down because  they'll be able to buy smaller policies.  Older people's premiums will go  up and the CBO also projected that deductibles on average will rise under  this plan, not fall, which is what President Trump said he would -- they  would do.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Within just the past few minutes, Secretary Price and OMB  Director Mulvaney have been out and been very critical of this OMB -- of  this CBO report.  What was the reaction?</p><p> HARWOOD:  Well, they're saying that the coverage can't fall that much.   They disagree strenuously.  CBO did not consider all of the relevant  factors.  But keep in mind, Tyler, Tom Price himself as the House budget  chair appointed the current director of the Congressional Budget Office.   That serves to undercut the idea that the CBO was biased against the Trump  administration.  These numbers going to be very damaging to the Republican  effort to pass an Obamacare repeal and replacement.</p><p> HERERA:  I think I know what happens next, but you handicap it for me.</p><p> HARWOOD:  Well, I think Republicans -- first of all, this bill, Sue, who  was in trouble to begin with, because there are many conservatives who  think it is Obamacare light, that it creates a new entitlement and then  those on the left and more moderate Republicans think it takes away  coverage from too many people.  They've got to figure out what which way  they want to move which group they want to try to placate, it's not going  to be very easy to decide pick one direction and try to figure out a path  to a majority in the House and Senate from there.</p><p> HERERA:  All right.  John Harwood in Washington -- John, thank you.</p><p> HARWOOD:  You bet.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, that CBO report on health care was just one big event that  investors will watch this week and they'll get a chance to react come  tomorrow, and it comes as a new dynamic enters the market.  Today, the Dow  Jones Industrial Average lost 21 points to finish at 20,881.  The NASDAQ  however was up by 14, and the S&amp;P 500 rose fractionally.</p><p> Bob Pisani takes a look at the big events ahead and the changing tone on  the trading floor.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The uptrend and stocks  is still intact, but the market is split between winners and losers as  opposed to February, when there were almost all winners.  So, tech and bank  stocks to continue to do well, those are the largest sectors in the S&amp;P.   So, that's a big reason the overall market is still up this month.</p><p> Now, a little bit more worrisome has been the trend in small-cap stock they  got off to a strong start for the year but they've stayed it a bit.  Yet,  small-cap Russell is about five percent off its historic high of just a few  weeks ago.  That's a modest decline but much more than the 2 percent  decline for the S&amp;P or the one percent decline for the NASDAQ, which holds  many of the big tech stocks.</p><p> Now, this waffling is unlikely to continue.  There's plenty of market  moving events later this week, including the Fed's decision on interest  rates that will be Wednesday.  There's also the Dutch election on Wednesday  as well.  There's the release of the president's budget on Thursday and  more decisions on raising weights from the central banks in England and  Japan the same day.</p><p> There's one other small wild card for stocks.  President Trump meets with  German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday in Washington.  Now, Trump's  chief trade advisor has called Germany a currency manipulator for keeping  the euro low, even though it's the central bank, the European central bank  that sets monetary policy.</p><p> Immigration, NATO and Russia will all be on the agenda. I would love to be  a fly on the wall for that one.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the NYSE.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  So, Bob laid out some of the things that are ahead for stocks.   Here to discuss how this week's events could shape the markets is Michael  Farr.  He is the president of money management firm Farr, Miller and  Washington.</p><p> Good to see you, Michael.</p><p> MICHAEL FARR, PRESIDENT, FARR, MILLER AND WASHINGTON:  Thank you, Sue.   Nice to be here.</p><p> HERERA:  Let me start first of all with this report that we got about the  health care initiatives that the Trump administration is putting forward.   Obviously, there is going to be much debate but you point out in your notes  that the market seems to be pricing in almost perfection that the entire  Trump agenda will go through.</p><p> So, given what we've just heard, what do you think the market reaction will  be?</p><p> FARR:  You know, Sue, this has kind of been my worry since November right  after the election.  Markets started to move a lot higher based on a lot of  optimism and hope for this agenda, which -- and a lot of it is very  stimulative but Washington doesn't work that way.  Washington's kind of  slow and messy.  The CBO has to step in and score a bill which we've seen  just happen.</p><p> Republicans have to get a bill through here, any kind of a bill to get it  to kind of a House/Senate conference where the next step of sausage making  gets made.  But this looks like something that could get well into 2017 or  even 2018, and this is kind of what's going to happen with a political  agenda working its way through Washington.  We're going to see this again  with the tax cuts.  We're going to see this again with other immigration  things.</p><p> So, we just hope that the markets can be patient while Congress does what  it does.</p><p> MATHISEN:  So, is it your surmise then based on that that the up, up and  away rise in stock prices that we've seen for the last three months is  going to level off a bit, maybe correct a little bit, and that now is not a  particularly optimal time to be putting fresh money in big ways into the  equity markets?</p><p> FARR:  You know, I wrote in my market commentary that we could be on the  beginning of a next 3,000-point move, whether it's to the upside or the  downside, I just can't possibly tell you.</p><p> We haven't had a correction in a long time.  We've made a bunch of all time  highs.  It would -- market, you know, experienced people say market could  correct and the market should give some back.  </p><p> Why?  What's going to be the -- what's going to be the cause, what will be  the spark?  We really don't know.  We might not even know it when we see  it.  But it should give some back.</p><p> HERERA:  Michael, Bob Pisani and his piece laid out some of the other  events globally, elections in various other countries in Europe, how much  influence do you think that will have on the market versus the domestic  agenda?</p><p> FARR:  I think that it could have a big influence depending on what  happens.  This is this Dutch candidate and we're going to find out about  Wednesday is a nationalist candidate.  There -- they want to close the  Netherlands' borders.  They are anti-Islam.  They want to close mosques.   They want to leave the euro and the E.U.  That, it would open the door I  think then to what happens in France and will Marine Le Pen be elected.</p><p> And if these sort of series of events occur, then you see a breakup I think  of the E.U. and that does affect what happens here.</p><p> HERERA:  OK.</p><p> FARR:  And a trend towards nationalism and protectionism that begins to  take place on a global basis.  Markets aren't expecting that.</p><p> HERERA:  All right.  On that note, Michael, thank you very much.</p><p> FARR:  Thanks so much.</p><p> HERERA:  Michael Farr with Farr, Miller, and Washington.</p><p> MATHISEN:  And as central bank policymakers prepare to meet tomorrow and  Wednesday in Washington, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta will soon have  a new president.  </p><p> University of Southern California economics professor Raphael Bostic was  approved by the Atlanta Fed's board and by the Fed's board of governors in  Washington.  When he takes over in June, he will be the first black  regional bank president in the central bank's under 100 history.  </p><p> Professor Bostic has done work on home ownership and housing finance.  He  succeeds Dennis Lockhart who retired at the end of last month.</p><p> HERERA:  Stocks have been also eyeing the oil market and today, prices  extended their losing streak to a sixth straight session.  Domestic crude  settled just above $48 a barrel as growth in the U.S. production threatens  to offset the cuts from OPEC.</p><p> Now, it's not just excess oil that has investors concerned, but also a  gasoline glut.</p><p> Jackie DeAngelis reports tonight from a gasoline storage facility in  Sewaren, New Jersey.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  crude oil and  gasoline storage like the tanks that you see behind me are at record levels  according to the Energy Information Administration.  This could be good  news for consumers.</p><p> JOHN KILDUFF, AGAIN CAPITAL FOUNDING PARTNER:  It's why consumers in the  U.S. have been able to enjoy relatively low gasoline prices for the better  part of two years now.</p><p> DEANGELIS:  But oil companies are nervous.  They've seen this pattern  before.  Too much supply, not enough demand to meet it.  In fact, February  of last year when prices were near $26, it was the same kind of situation.   Analysts say it's possible again but this time could be different.</p><p> ANDY LIPOW, LIPOW OIL ASSOCIATES PRES.:  Given the extraordinarily high and  record inventories on the East Coast, we've actually seen two things  happen.  In December, the U.S. exported record amounts of gasoline and, on  the other hand, last week, we saw gasoline imports into the U.S.  We see  lowest level since November of.</p><p> And the combination of the two is going to help us reduce all that winter  grade gasoline inventory that's been laying around.</p><p> DEANGELIS:  This all could have an impact on stocks as well.</p><p> Lower oil prices could pressure big oil and the stock market.  Chevron and  Exxon are Dow components.  </p><p> But there are other segments of the sector that could get hit.</p><p> LIPOW:  Given that they're a very high gasoline inventories we're seeing  gasoline prices of course come under pressure, which is good news for the  consumer but it's bad news for refining margins and as a result, those  independent refiners are seeing their stock prices come under pressure.</p><p> DEANGELIS:  Majority of people did not see this falling prices coming.  So,  what happens next could surprise everyone again.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jackie DeAngelis in Sewaren, New Jersey.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  A surprise acquisition by Intel, the world's largest computer  chip maker, will pay $15 billion to acquire Mobileye, a firm focused on  developing technology for self-driving cars.  Mobileye soared 28 percent  today.  The Dow component Intel dropped 2 percent.</p><p> Jon Fortt has more on the deal that puts Intel right in the middle of one  of tech's hottest segments.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Fifteen billion dollars  is a lot even for a company the size of Intel.  There's only one time it's  paid more for a company and that was Altera just two years ago.  The second  big purchase is the latest sign of a strategy shift under Intel CEO Brian  Krzanich.  He took the job nearly four years ago after the company had  missed the smartphone revolution.  He also faced the middle age PC market  and few clear paths to growth.</p><p> His answer: pull back from the traditional PC market and invest instead in  cutting-edge areas like virtual reality, drone sensors and cars.  And  that's where Mobileye comes in.</p><p> BRIAN KRZANICH, INTEL CEO:  There in more than just cars.  They'll be in  high-end devices like the spotting cameras on helicopters.  They'll be in  high-end drones.  They'll be in high-end robotics as well.  </p><p> And so, it's really about computer vision and how computer vision is going  to change the world.  It's -- in order to have true artificial intelligence  of a mobile device, you have to have computer vision.  That system has to  be able to see the world in order to be able to interpret the world and  navigate or work within the world.</p><p> FORTT:  Intel is not the only company betting big on the car and computer  vision.  Five months ago, fellow chip giant Qualcomm said it will pay about  $40 billion dollars for NXP semiconductors, which specializes in automotive  and wireless technologies.</p><p> Of course, Facebook bought virtual reality company Oculus years ago.  </p><p> And don't forget Snap.  It just went public earlier this month calling  itself a camera company.  That's a nod to its own version of computer  vision.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt in New York.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA: Still ahead, why the plug has been pulled on a billion dollar deal.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  A veteran of the Food and Drug Administration has been tapped by  President Trump to lead that agency.  If approved, Scott Gottlieb would be  charged with cutting red tape and examining the drug approval process.  </p><p> Meg Tirrell looks at who he is and his potential impact.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The pharmaceutical  industry's response to President Donald Trump's nominee for FDA  commissioner, thank, God, it's Gottlieb.  The news that Dr. Scott Gottlieb  is Trump's pick to regulate the country's food and medicines came after  months of speculation and rumored names included candidates with no formal  medical training. </p><p> So, the choice of Gottlieb, an M.D., is leading to something of a sigh of  relief for the industry.  </p><p> BRIAN SKORNEY, ROBERT W. BAIRD BIOTECH ANALYST:  Some of the names that  have been floated out there in the rumor mill are very extreme on the  deregulation side.  He's a very well-rounded individual.</p><p> TIRRELL:  Gottlieb, a fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, and a  venture capitalist served in the FDA under President George W. Bush.  If  confirmed, he'd take the helm of the drug regulator at a time of intense  scrutiny of the industry's prices.  </p><p> The FDA isn't authorized to address pricing directly but Gottlieb has a  long track record of advocating for increased competition to help lower  prices, particularly in areas like complex generics such as the EpiPen, a  device and a drug in one.</p><p> SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FDA COMMISSIONER-DESIGNATE:  Complex drugs have become very  hard to go into the market.  It's not just with the EpiPen, but also things  like metered-dose inhalers or liposomal agents or topical agents.  Anytime  it's hard for the agency to demonstrate sameness between one drug in  another, the agency has a very hard time.  We were literally talking about  this very issue years ago in ours at FDA.</p><p> TIRRELL:  Many industry watchers expect Gottlieb to focus on flexibility  within the agency, to speed drugs, both generics and new medicines, to  market.  </p><p> But it's Gottlieb's familiarity with the drug industry that's drawing  criticism.  The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen says, quote,  \"Gottlieb is entangled in an unprecedented web of big pharma ties,\" citing  more than $400,000 Gottlieb was paid in fees from drug and medical device  companies between 2013 and 2015.  Gottlieb declined to comment.</p><p> And some see his involvement with the industry as an attribute. </p><p> SKORNEY:  It's very hard to find qualified people who don't have some  conflict because, frankly, if you're going to get things done, you have to  have perspective on every angle, and you have to be willing to work with  industry, you have to be willing to work with physicians, insurers.  You  know, you have to keep all stakeholders interests on the table.</p><p> TIRRELL:  And, in an unfamiliar display of bipartisan support, Andy Slavitt  who ran Medicare and Medicaid for President Obama said of Gottlieb on  Twitter, quote, \"A very good choice.\" </p><p>Gottlieb still needs to be confirmed by the Senate.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Citrix Systems may be exploring a sale and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> A report from Bloomberg says the $13 billion business software company is  working with Goldman Sachs to find a potential buyer, and that sent shares  of Citrix up more than 6 percent to $84.93.</p><p> Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals fell after hours following a CNBC report  that activist investor Bill Ackman sold his entire position in the  embattled drugmaker.  Ackman is said to have sold more than $27 million  shares at $11 each.  He is also expected to step down from Valeant's board  of directors. Valeant shares initially fell about 10 percent in extended- hours trading and that was on top of a one percent drop during the regular  day session where they closed at $12.11.</p><p> MATHISEN:  According to a regulatory filing out Friday, billionaire  investor Carl Icahn up to his stake in the truck maker Navistar to more  than 17 percent.  Icahn had owned about a $16 percent stake in the company.   Navistar up more than 1 percent in price action today.  It finished at  $26.46.</p><p> The Chinese biotech company Hutchison China MediTech better known as Chi- Med said strong commercial sales help drive its latest quarterly numbers.   The cancer drug maker said revenue up 21 percent, while profit also rose.   Chi-Med shares jumped nearly 13 percent to $15.97.</p><p> HERERA:  A billion dollar cross-border deal falls apart.  China's richest  man who is also the head of Wanda Group, will no longer buy Dick Clark  Productions, the company behind the Golden Globes and the American Music  Awards.  The agreement would have marked the Chinese company's first move  in Hollywood, but as Eunice Yoon explains, that deal is now dead.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  China's Wanda isn't  commenting on the decision but Dick Clark productions representatives say  that Wanda couldn't meet its contractual obligation.  Since Wanda  traditionally hasn't had trouble raising financing in this country, people  are reading this to mean that Wanda couldn't make a payment because it  doesn't have the same level of government support as it did before to get  its money out of the country.</p><p> Beijing has had an overarching national policy to encourage companies like  Wanda to go overseas, spread their wings and become global champions.   However, that strategy has been running into conflict with another  important priority of Beijing, that is to stabilize the currency and clamp  down on capital outflows.</p><p> Over the past couple of days, we've heard some sharp criticism from high- level government officials, the commerce minister called some of the  investments blind and irrational and also the Chinese central bank governor  said that investments in certain industries weren't aligned with industrial  policies, such as sports and entertainment.</p><p> Now, Wanda wants to become a major powerhouse in the entertainment  industry.  It's already a known quantity in Hollywood after buying over AMC  on cinema chain, as well as the film producing company Legendary  Entertainment.  And now, with this investment in takeover of Dick Clark  Productions, the company had hoped to make a foray into the American TV  market.  However, those plans, as well as its global ambitions, are now on  hold.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Coming up, we will take you on a trip over Austin, Texas.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Julia Boorstin  in Austin, Texas, going up in this helicopter to tell you why Lockheed  Martin is bringing South by Southwest entrepreneurs a thousand feet in the  air.  That's coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  Want to know what's trending in technology, media and investing,  look no further than the South by Southwest conference in Austin it started  out as a music festival.  But now, it's a place where gadgets are put on  display, among other things, and as Julia Boorstin reports, this year,  companies are going big.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  South by Southwest  gathers nearly 100,000 attendees, hundreds of companies, and dozens of big  brands trying to get the attention of the early adopters who are here.  And  it's become a key battleground for media giants new and old to market their  originals and sell their subscriptions directly to consumers.</p><p> Amazon created this Resistance Radio headquarters to promote its original  series \"Man in the High Castle\", hosting a number of events such as a film  festival oasis hosted by Amazon video Direct.  Netflix is premiering five  of its shows and offering an interactive experience around 13 reasons why,  these lockers spread around often.</p><p> Meanwhile, HBO's featuring the throne from \"Game of Thrones\", plus an  escape room experience around three of its hit shows.  </p><p> And Turner is here promoting a range of its new content.  Cartoon Network  president Christina Miller telling us reaching this audience directly is  more important than ever.</p><p> CHRISTINA MILLER, CARTOON NETWORK PRESIDENT:  The control is in the  consumers' hands at this point, and we deal with the earliest audience in  plurals or generation Z, as a lot of people are calling them.  They're the  most mobile audience they've grown up with a ton of choice and they want  control in that choice.</p><p> So, I think user experience is that kind of third leg on the stool with  brands and distribution.</p><p> BOORSTIN:  And it's not just media brands that are trying to stand out here  at South by Southwest.  Lockheed Martin's venture capital arm is fielding  entrepreneur pitches up here in a helicopter a thousand feet above, often  looking to make strategic investments in startups that will benefit the  aerospace and defense company.</p><p> And there's a range of tech startups here.  Following Snap's surprise  description is a camera company, Pinterest considered next in line for an  IPO, is here promoting how it's putting cameras front and center for the  first time, with a Pinterest lens which does visual search.  </p><p> And some venture capitalists we talked to here tell us that after Snap's  huge IPO, they're pushing companies to strike while the iron is hot.</p><p> JOSH ELMAN, GREYLOCK PARTNERS:  The market seems like it's at all-time  highs.  People are actually bullish on the jobs reports and everything  else.  So, I'm actually -- we're encouraging every company that feels like  it's ready to be a public company not to wait.</p><p> BOORSTIN:  There hasn't been one real breakout app like there was when  Twitter and Snapchat were in the spotlight.  But there has been a lot of  buzz about virtual and augmented reality with many insiders saying this  could be the year that those technologies go mainstream.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Austin, Texas.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  That was pretty cool.</p><p> That does it for us tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.  I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p> We want to remind you, this is the time of year your public television  stations seeks your support.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And we're grateful for it.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks again  for your support and we will see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The major indexes all rose as investors focused on upbeat economic data and looked past some of the trade concerns that kept them on edge the past few weeks.

Late yesterday, the company said Nike`s brand president resigned. The resignation came on the same day that the CEO told employees about complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior. Today, a second veteran is reportedly leaving in the wake of internal complaints. Nike (NYSE:NKE) was the worst performing stock on the Dow today.</p><p>To the economy now, where consumer sentiment hit its highest level in 14 years. The University of Michigan survey said most respondents were upbeat about the economy and their personal finances following the tax cuts. Economists say the advance in confidence could contribute to solid consumer spending.</p><p>The number of job openings hit a record in January, of more than 6 million. According to the Labor Department, the number of people hired rose and fewer people quit their jobs. The report suggests that employers are having a hard time finding workers that they need. The unemployment rate sits at a 17-year low.</p><p>Home builders broke ground on fewer homes than expected last month. And that is not good news for housing market facing a critical shortage of homes for sale.</p><p>Diana Olick takes a look at what`s keeping builders from building.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Nearly everything that goes into building a home is getting more expensive -- land, labor, and now materials, thanks to new tariffs on lumber, steel, and aluminum. The price of framing lumber is up over 40 percent since the start of 2017 and hit a record high last week. Builders have been up against a shortage of labor and buildable lots. Now tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as economic policy all making it even harder to build homes buyers can afford.</p><p>GARY BOWMAN, TW PERRY CEO: It`s not just lumber. It`s lumber. It`s steel. It`s impact fees, it`s permitting delays. It`s, you know, rising interest rates.</p><p>You know, there`s a concern that a lot of these cumulative impact of these increases will curtail demand at some point. That`s I think the bigger concern.</p><p>OLICK: Higher costs mean builders can`t make enough money building entry- level homes, the homes that are most in need. Demand is also growing as millennials reach their home buying years. Add it up and it just equals higher prices for buyers and more risk for builders and distributor.</p><p>BOWMAN: We can digest through moth moderate price increases. But when they are spiky, you know, we make commitments to our customers. They make commitments to their homeowners, customers, and when our costs go up and don`t have a chance to, you know, pass those through, then it damages our profit margins and our businesses.</p><p>OLICK: Single family starts are up, but just 3 percent higher than a year. To put it all in context, at the peak of the housing boom we were building nine homes for every 1,000 people aged 18 to 65. At the bottom in `09, that fell to just over two per 1,000. Now, we are barely back to four. A normal level is about seven.</p><p>And those numbers don`t even take into account all that pent-up demand from the recession or the millions of homes bought by investors during the foreclosure crisis and turned into rentals. In other words, builders aren`t even close to keeping up.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Silver Spring, Maryland.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: One of the country`s biggest mortgage lenders is reportedly the subject of a widening Department of justice investigation. According to the \"Wall Street Journal,\" the FBI has interviewed employees at Wells Fargo`s wealth management business that extends the sales practice probe beyond the firm`s retail banking unit.</p><p>Well, it was ten years ago, Bear Stearns was bailed out. The once storied Wall Street firm was forced into a shotgun marriage with J.P. Morgan and nearly $30 billion in assistance to save it from bankruptcy. In the months prior, the bank had written down bad loans, cut jobs, and looked for investors.</p><p>And as someone who was covering that story, the run on the bank and its ultimate sale was a remarkable turn of events.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: A stunning day on the stock market. Stocks under severe pressure earlier this morning after Bear Stearns gets a bail out.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It lost its ability to finance itself. And when you are an investment bank and you are levered significantly, you need to be able to finance yourself. These things can happen like that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The speed at which the firm collapsed, the fire sale price shocked Wall Street.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Attempts to help Bear Stearns has damaged the stock and, in fact, has damaged confidence overall, particularly in financials.</p><p>This is part of the great frustration. You do nothing, the stock goes down, you try to help it, the stock goes down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: J.P. Morgan Chase is buying Bear Stearns at a rock bottom price, $2 a share.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People at Bear Stearns I have spoken with are stunned by what happened here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One individual told me 17 years I have been saving for my kids` college education, now I have got to start all over again.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Investment banking will never be the same.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: And Steve was right. A lot never was the same.</p><p>Many financial historians marked that day as the starting point of the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression.</p><p>It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.</p><p>Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) saw its price target raised to 350 a share over at RBC Capital Market. That firm sees Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) growing in Japan, which can be difficult for western companies to do. The analyst is also upbeat on the company`s original content. Nonetheless, shares fell fractionally to $318.45.</p><p>Dominion was downgraded to neutral at J.P. Morgan. The analyst cites uncertainty around Dominion`s funding strategy following a tax ruling by energy regulators. Price target was cut to $74. Shares of Dominion fell today to $70.61.</p><p>Wayfair saw its rating cut to underperform to neutral over at D.A. Davidson. That firm cites increased competition in the online retail home furnishings market. The price target remains at $65. Nonetheless, shares of Wayfair fell nearly 6 percent to $78.95.</p><p>Still ahead, rolling out the welcome mat.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Puerto Rico is trying to become the destination for Blockchain and cryptocurrency developers. Will it succeed as the island recovers from one of the worst hurricanes on record? That story when NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT returns.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: A city in Upstate New York is the first to ban new bitcoin mining. Late last night, Plattsburg City Council approved an 18-month moratorium on new cryptocurrency mining operations. The mining process involves the heavy use of computer servers, and they use a lot of electricity, which in turn is raising rates for city residents. Miners have flocked to Plattsburg because for its proximity to hydroelectric dam and cheap energy prices.</p><p>Meantime, Puerto Rico wants to attract the Blockchain industry to help that island help fund its economic revival. Blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Seema Mody is in San Juan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MODY: Puerto Rico was already struggling through a decade-long recession which pushed the U.S. territory into the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history when one of the most destructive hurricanes in history made landfall in September. It`s now been six months after hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico is desperate to bring business back to the island. And the government positioning itself as a hub for the rapidly growing Blockchain industry which has yet to claim a city as its headquarters.</p><p>This past week, thousands of crypto and Blockchain developers descended upon the island to attend three separate industry conferences in the capital of San Juan. Puerto Rico`s government even hosted a three day event in conjunction with Blockchain industries, where the secretary of the Department of Economic Development announced a new advisory council initiative to help develop and attract Blockchain business to the island?</p><p>SEC. MANUEL LABOY, PR, DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: We are welcoming, you know, with open arms, Blockchain technology for Puerto Rico because we know there is a huge potential for the island.</p><p>MODY: Tax incentives make Puerto Rico an appealing destination, specifically Act 22, which says if you become a resident of Puerto Rico, you essentially pay no taxes on long term capital gains. It`s at the main reason cryptocurrency investors and Blockchain entrepreneurs have moved down to the island.</p><p>JEFF THOMPSON, RED CAT CEO: This is one of the best places to put a start- up company. The tax incentives are incredible for a start-up. The talent down here is incredible.</p><p>MODY: Thompson decided to make the move to the island in September of 2016 where his drone storage and analytics company utilizes the tax incentive for his business and himself personally.</p><p>But challenges do exist. While over 90 percent of the island`s power has been restored, many citizens tell us they still deal with power outages on a weekly basis. A few entrepreneurs also told us that while the government is receptive to Blockchain, the local banks haven`t been as supportive, which makes lending and access to credit a challenge.</p><p>But some experts say if Puerto Rico can improve its talent pool, the island will have a better shot at competing with likes of Switzerland, South Korea and Japan, which are also competing to be the headquarters for the Blockchain industry.</p><p>Seema Mody, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) loses its shine and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The high end jeweler reported disappointing same store sales, citing soft demand in overseas markets. The company is also forecasting full year profits largely below expectations as it invests heavily in its turn around plan. Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) shares fell 5 percent to end the session at $97.51.</p><p>A private equity firm has offered Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) more than $2 billion to acquire its diabetes unit. J&amp;J has been considering options for that business which has suffered from falling sales. The company has until mid-June to make a decision. J&amp;J shares rose fractionally to $133.68.</p><p>The former chairman of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is reportedly trying to take that company private. Multiple reports say Paul Jacobs, who currently holds a board seat told the board of his plan and approached companies to become investors. The deal is considered a long shot, though, for Jacobs who once ran that company. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was recently the target of a hostile takeover by Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM). The shares rose 1 percent to $60.62.</p><p>Investors had their first chance to react to overstock`s quarterly results, which the company described as, quote, terrible. The company reported a loss and a drop in sales. It also warned that the previously disclosed SEC probe tied to its upcoming crypto coin offering could hurt its performance. The shares were off 5 percent to $45.70.</p><p>Our market monitor tonight is looking to the global economy for his returns and he`s recommending three ETFs. This is his first time on the program.</p><p>So, we welcome Scott Kubie. He is the chief investment officer at the Carson Group.</p><p>Welcome, Scott. Nice to have you here.</p><p>SCOTT KUBIE, CARSON GROUP CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER: Thanks, Sue. Glad to be here.</p><p>HERERA: So, you see the global growth picture as perhaps more compelling or equally as compelling as the U.S.?</p><p>KUBIE: Yes, I think we`ve seen an upswing globally, not just in the U.S. but Europe, which had great growth last year. We also saw Brazil come out of recession, strong emerging market growth out of China, solid growth in India. And Japan put out pretty good numbers for Japan as well. So, it`s been a real surge. And we think that`s going to adjust the opportunity and set the investment landscape quite a bit.</p><p>HERERA: All right. So, let`s start with your first pick. They`re all three are ETFs.</p><p>The Power Shares International Buyback Achievers -- why do you like that?</p><p>KUBIE: You know, this is probably the most interesting, one of the three and that it focuses on international markets directly. International markets are cheaper than U.S. So, we like that right off the bat, but we also realize that international stocks aren`t quite as shareholder-friendly as they are in the U.S. So, we want to focus on those that are.</p><p>And one of the ways so they can more friendly is buying back their shares. So, we zero in on those types of countries. Interest rates are lower overseas than they are in the U.S. the cost to buy back shares is actually quite a bit lower.</p><p>And we saw the same strategy work very well in the U.S. a number of years ago. We think it translates well overseas right now.</p><p>HERERA: All right. The next one is the iShares EDGE MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Value Factors ETF. Tell me about that.</p><p>KUBIE: Yes, as the economic recovery starts to broaden, we just see that the number of companies that will benefit from it will widen. This market has really been characterized by a narrow set of growth companies doing extremely well.</p><p>But as growth kicks in we see more companies are going to do well and we want to revalue stocks. We think they will have a solid rebound after years of growth and performance. One of the biggest changes in values is do you want to have a big sector that could have been comes with value.</p><p>So, this ETF is sector neutral and it`s going to have the same amount of technology as the overall index.</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>KUBIE: The same amount in staples. And we like that mixture of emphasizing the cheapest stock but being balanced across every sector that`s out there.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Let`s wrap it up with the Fidelity MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Financials ETF. Why do you like that?</p><p>KUBIE: Yes, I think financials have really suffered through the recovery. They haven`t done as welcoming out of that financial crisis which you referenced earlier over the last ten years. And so, we see some big opportunities in this space. We see some specific benefits from overall global economic growth kicking in.</p><p>One of them is loan growth has been really, really slow during this recovery. And so, we see an opportunity for that to kick up. And also see the fact that long term interest rates should rise. And so, we should see banks being able to earn more on the loans that we`re making. We really that financials and those loans will likely be paid off as long as growth continues to stay strong.</p><p>So, this seems to be a sweet spot for financials to take advantage of the global economic growth and really be benefit shareholders.</p><p>HERERA: OK.</p><p>Scott, thank you.</p><p>KUBIE: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Scott Kubie with the Carson Group.</p><p>You can read more about his picks on our Website at NBR.com.</p><p>Well, thank goodness the peak flu season is behind us, but it`s not quite over yet. This one has been especially severe. But there are maybe some positive developments when it comes to creating a universal flu vaccine.</p><p>Meg Tirrell has our latest story on modern medicine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Every year, the flu takes a major toll, causing millions to get sick, hospitalizing hundreds of thousands of people, and leading to tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. alone. This despite the availability of a flu vaccine.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: Of all the vaccines that we have developed over the years, influenza vaccine can use a lot of improvement.</p><p>TIRRELL: Vaccines for other diseases like yellow fever, measles and polio are more than 95 percent effective at preventing infection. The flu vaccine, about 40 percent on average since 2005, but it is effectiveness varies widely season to season, with essential estimates of this year`s flu shot at about 36 percent.</p><p>That`s because the part of the flu virus targeted by the seasonal vaccine changes each year. So, efforts are underway to develop a so call universal flu vaccine, one that would work no matter what strain of flu is circulating and be durable for multiple seasons.</p><p>Dr. Peter Palese`s group at Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine is among those working on such a vaccines, what those in the field refer to as influenza`s Holy Grail.</p><p>DR. PETER PALESE, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: A universal influenza virus vaccine is one which would last lifetime hopefully, but at least we hope it works for 20 years or even longer.</p><p>TIRRELL: Only recently have discoveries about the flu virus and new technologies enable the work on the universal flu vaccine to accelerate.</p><p>FAUCI: We only realized ten or more years ago that there was a part of the virus that doesn`t change from season to season. Once we recognized that, the real problem and the stumbling block is how do you get the body to preferentially make a response against that molecule?</p><p>TIRRELL: Palese`s team funded in part by the National Institute of Health has one approach.</p><p>PALESE: We are building the virus in the laboratory a new one, which isn`t out there and we make from there the vaccine.</p><p>TIRRELL: The new virus is meant to stimulate an immune response that will protect from the flu from season to season. The experimental vaccine is now being tested in the earliest phases of human clinical trials funded by GlaxoSmithKline and the Gates Foundation. Work on the universal flu vaccine is also underway at Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Sanofi Pasteur, as well as that smaller private companies. Initial results from Dr. Palese`s trials are expected within a year. Then more testing will be needed before it can reach the market.</p><p>PALESE: We are talking about years, but we are not talking about decades.</p><p>TIRRELL: Until then, public health officials still recommend a seasonal flu shot. For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, the great space race.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: I`m Morgan Brennan, inside a future spaceship. Meet star liner, this is Boeing`s capsule that could by year`s end be carrying American astronauts into space. We`ve got this story from here at the Kennedy Space center coming up on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA: The race is on to get humans into space from U.S. soil. Something that hasn`t happened since the space shuttle program ended. Both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and SpaceX are leading the charge.</p><p>And Morgan Brennan got a closer look at Boeing`s operations at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN: Meet Starliner, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) spacecraft that`s been years in the making. If all goes according to plan, before the year`s out, it will carry astronauts to space. It would mark a major milestone. The U.S. lost the ability to launch astronauts from U.S. soil when the space shuttle program ended seven years ago.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Liftoff of the Soyuz rocket.</p><p>BRENNAN: Instead, we`ve been relying on the Russians to do it for us. President Trump has talked about going to the moon and Mars.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It marks an important step in returning American astronauts to the moon.</p><p>BRENNAN: But the new space race really starts here, with NASA`s commercial crew program.</p><p>JOHN MULHOLLAND, STARLINER PROGRAM MANAGER: Every other NASA human space flight program has been cost-plus and the responsibility of the contractor was to deliver the transportation platform to NASA for their use.</p><p>On commercial crew, it`s more of a rental car model where we retain the asset and they take it just for their use in that particular mission.</p><p>BRENNAN: John Mulholland would know since Starliner`s program manager used to work on the shuttle. Starliner is one of two spacecraft, the other is SpaceX`s Dragon capsule being produced for manned missions to the International Space Station.</p><p>Boeing (NYSE:BA) is building three, all of which will soon be leaving the factory ahead of major tests. The crew module will be able to fit seven people and reflown up to 10 times. The first manned flight is scheduled for November, from Kennedy Space Center.</p><p>Astronauts are already doing evacuation drills.</p><p>TONY TALIANCICH, ULA DIR. &amp; GM LAUNCH OPERATIONS: Yes, it`s really exciting. We have the emergency escape system installed. We`ve actually checked it out with the astronauts in full space suits, ready to support any operation that`s occurring up on the tower.</p><p>BRENNAN: United Launch Alliance, the rocket company jointly owned by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will handle the launches.</p><p>Here, 17 stories up on the launch pad, this is the white room, quite literally the last stop on earth for astronauts before they enter Boeing`s Starliner and head to space. Boeing`s contract with NASA is a little more than $4 billion, but it`s what comes after that could generate the biggest business.</p><p>TALIANCICH: Commercial aviation is government sponsored foundation and need for strategic need. It`s slowly evolved into a commercial market but only for high wealth individuals. And now, we are at the point of the market where we have a 737 take off and land about every two seconds. And we can see the growth in the commercial space flight market paralleling that.</p><p>BRENNAN: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And to read more about the race to launch the next generation of human space flight, head to our Website, NBR.com.</p><p>Before we go, here`s a look at how the day on Wall Street ended up. The Dow rose 72 points. The Nasdaq was up a fraction. The S&amp;P 500 added four points. But for the week the averages fell 1 percent or more.</p><p>That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight. I`m Sue Herera.

I'm Sue Herera.  My partner, Bill  Griffeth, is off tonight.  </p><p>Stocks closed out the week on a high note.  The major indexes all rose as  investors focused on upbeat economic data and looked past some of the trade  concerns that kept them on edge the past few weeks.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average rose 72 points to 24,946.  The Nasdaq was up just a  fraction.  And S&amp;P 500 added four points.  </p><p>But for the week, the averages fell 1 percent or more.  </p><p>Dominic Chu takes a look at the week that was and the week to come.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Over the course of the  past week, business news headlines ran the gamut, chipping away at a big  takeover deal, more controversy at United Airlines, and no real fun and  games for a big toy retailer.  </p><p>So, it was going to be the biggest tech merger and acquisition deal ever,  Singapore-based Broadcom's takeover of San Diego-based competitor Qualcomm  (NASDAQ:QCOM).

Late yesterday, the company said Nike's brand  president resigned.  The resignation came on the same day that the CEO told  employees about complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior.  Today, a  second veteran is reportedly leaving in the wake of internal complaints.   Nike (NYSE:NKE) was the worst performing stock on the Dow today.  </p><p>To the economy now, where consumer sentiment hit its highest level in 14  years.  The University of Michigan survey said most respondents were upbeat  about the economy and their personal finances following the tax cuts.   Economists say the advance in confidence could contribute to solid consumer  spending.  </p><p>The number of job openings hit a record in January, of more than 6 million.   According to the Labor Department, the number of people hired rose and  fewer people quit their jobs.  The report suggests that employers are  having a hard time finding workers that they need.  The unemployment rate  sits at a 17-year low.  </p><p>Home builders broke ground on fewer homes than expected last month.  And  that is not good news for housing market facing a critical shortage of  homes for sale.  </p><p>Diana Olick takes a look at what's keeping builders from building.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nearly everything that  goes into building a home is getting more expensive -- land, labor, and now  materials, thanks to new tariffs on lumber, steel, and aluminum.  The price  of framing lumber is up over 40 percent since the start of 2017 and hit a  record high last week.  Builders have been up against a shortage of labor  and buildable lots.  Now tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as economic  policy all making it even harder to build homes buyers can afford.  </p><p>GARY BOWMAN, TW PERRY CEO:  It's not just lumber.  It's lumber.  It's  steel.  It's impact fees, it's permitting delays.  It's, you know, rising  interest rates.  </p><p>You know, there's a concern that a lot of these cumulative impact of these  increases will curtail demand at some point.  That's I think the bigger  concern.  </p><p>OLICK:  Higher costs mean builders can't make enough money building entry- level homes, the homes that are most in need.  Demand is also growing as  millennials reach their home buying years.  Add it up and it just equals  higher prices for buyers and more risk for builders and distributor.  </p><p>BOWMAN:  We can digest through moth moderate price increases.  But when  they are spiky, you know, we make commitments to our customers.  They make  commitments to their homeowners, customers, and when our costs go up and  don't have a chance to, you know, pass those through, then it damages our  profit margins and our businesses.  </p><p>OLICK:  Single family starts are up, but just 3 percent higher than a year.   To put it all in context, at the peak of the housing boom we were building  nine homes for every 1,000 people aged 18 to 65.  At the bottom in '09,  that fell to just over two per 1,000.  Now, we are barely back to four.  A  normal level is about seven.  </p><p>And those numbers don't even take into account all that pent-up demand from  the recession or the millions of homes bought by investors during the  foreclosure crisis and turned into rentals.  In other words, builders  aren't even close to keeping up.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Silver Spring, Maryland.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  One of the country's biggest mortgage lenders is reportedly the  subject of a widening Department of justice investigation.  According to  the \"Wall Street Journal,\" the FBI has interviewed employees at Wells  Fargo's wealth management business that extends the sales practice probe  beyond the firm's retail banking unit.  </p><p>Well, it was ten years ago, Bear Stearns was bailed out.  The once storied  Wall Street firm was forced into a shotgun marriage with J.P. Morgan and  nearly $30 billion in assistance to save it from bankruptcy.  In the months  prior, the bank had written down bad loans, cut jobs, and looked for  investors.  </p><p>And as someone who was covering that story, the run on the bank and its  ultimate sale was a remarkable turn of events.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  A stunning day on the stock market.  Stocks under severe pressure  earlier this morning after Bear Stearns gets a bail out.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It lost its ability to finance itself.  And when you  are an investment bank and you are levered significantly, you need to be  able to finance yourself.  These things can happen like that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The speed at which the firm collapsed, the fire sale  price shocked Wall Street.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Attempts to help Bear Stearns has damaged the stock  and, in fact, has damaged confidence overall, particularly in financials.  </p><p>This is part of the great frustration.  You do nothing, the stock goes  down, you try to help it, the stock goes down.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  J.P. Morgan Chase is buying Bear Stearns at a rock  bottom price, $2 a share.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  People at Bear Stearns I have spoken with are stunned  by what happened here.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One individual told me 17 years I have been saving  for my kids' college education, now I have got to start all over again.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Investment banking will never be the same.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  And Steve was right.  A lot never was the same.  </p><p>Many financial historians marked that day as the starting point of the  biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression.  </p><p>It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p>Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) saw its price target raised to 350 a share over at  RBC Capital Market.  That firm sees Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) growing in Japan,  which can be difficult for western companies to do.  The analyst is also  upbeat on the company's original content.  Nonetheless, shares fell  fractionally to $318.45.</p><p>Dominion was downgraded to neutral at J.P. Morgan.  The analyst cites  uncertainty around Dominion's funding strategy following a tax ruling by  energy regulators.  Price target was cut to $74.  Shares of Dominion fell  today to $70.61.  </p><p>Wayfair saw its rating cut to underperform to neutral over at D.A.  Davidson.  That firm cites increased competition in the online retail home  furnishings market.  The price target remains at $65.  Nonetheless, shares  of Wayfair fell nearly 6 percent to $78.95.  </p><p>Still ahead, rolling out the welcome mat.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Puerto Rico is trying  to become the destination for Blockchain and cryptocurrency developers.   Will it succeed as the island recovers from one of the worst hurricanes on  record?  That story when NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT returns.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC) </p><p>HERERA:  A city in Upstate New York is the first to ban new bitcoin mining.   Late last night, Plattsburg City Council approved an 18-month moratorium on  new cryptocurrency mining operations.  The mining process involves the  heavy use of computer servers, and they use a lot of electricity, which in  turn is raising rates for city residents.  Miners have flocked to  Plattsburg because for its proximity to hydroelectric dam and cheap energy  prices.  </p><p>Meantime, Puerto Rico wants to attract the Blockchain industry to help that  island help fund its economic revival.  Blockchain is the technology behind  cryptocurrencies.  </p><p>Seema Mody is in San Juan.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MODY:  Puerto Rico was already struggling through a decade-long recession  which pushed the U.S. territory into the largest municipal bankruptcy in  U.S. history when one of the most destructive hurricanes in history made  landfall in September.  It's now been six months after hurricane Maria and  Puerto Rico is desperate to bring business back to the island.  And the  government positioning itself as a hub for the rapidly growing Blockchain  industry which has yet to claim a city as its headquarters.  </p><p>This past week, thousands of crypto and Blockchain developers descended  upon the island to attend three separate industry conferences in the  capital of San Juan.  Puerto Rico's government even hosted a three day  event in conjunction with Blockchain industries, where the secretary of the  Department of Economic Development announced a new advisory council  initiative to help develop and attract Blockchain business to the island?  </p><p>SEC. MANUEL LABOY, PR, DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:  We are  welcoming, you know, with open arms, Blockchain technology for Puerto Rico  because we know there is a huge potential for the island.  </p><p>MODY:  Tax incentives make Puerto Rico an appealing destination,  specifically Act 22, which says if you become a resident of Puerto Rico,  you essentially pay no taxes on long term capital gains.  It's at the main  reason cryptocurrency investors and Blockchain entrepreneurs have moved  down to the island.  </p><p>JEFF THOMPSON, RED CAT CEO:  This is one of the best places to put a start- up company.  The tax incentives are incredible for a start-up.  The talent  down here is incredible.  </p><p>MODY:  Thompson decided to make the move to the island in September of 2016  where his drone storage and analytics company utilizes the tax incentive  for his business and himself personally.  </p><p>But challenges do exist.  While over 90 percent of the island's power has  been restored, many citizens tell us they still deal with power outages on  a weekly basis.  A few entrepreneurs also told us that while the government  is receptive to Blockchain, the local banks haven't been as supportive,  which makes lending and access to credit a challenge.  </p><p>But some experts say if Puerto Rico can improve its talent pool, the island  will have a better shot at competing with likes of Switzerland, South Korea  and Japan, which are also competing to be the headquarters for the  Blockchain industry.  </p><p>Seema Mody, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) loses its shine and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>The high end jeweler reported disappointing same store sales, citing soft  demand in overseas markets.  The company is also forecasting full year  profits largely below expectations as it invests heavily in its turn around  plan.  Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) shares fell 5 percent to end the session at  $97.51.  </p><p>A private equity firm has offered Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) more than $2  billion to acquire its diabetes unit.  J&amp;J has been considering options for  that business which has suffered from falling sales.  The company has until  mid-June to make a decision.  J&amp;J shares rose fractionally to $133.68.  </p><p>The former chairman of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is reportedly trying to take  that company private.  Multiple reports say Paul Jacobs, who currently  holds a board seat told the board of his plan and approached companies to  become investors.  The deal is considered a long shot, though, for Jacobs  who once ran that company.  Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was recently the target  of a hostile takeover by Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM).  The shares rose 1 percent  to $60.62.  </p><p>Investors had their first chance to react to overstock's quarterly results,  which the company described as, quote, terrible.  The company reported a  loss and a drop in sales.  It also warned that the previously disclosed SEC  probe tied to its upcoming crypto coin offering could hurt its performance.   The shares were off 5 percent to $45.70.  </p><p>Our market monitor tonight is looking to the global economy for his returns  and he's recommending three ETFs.  This is his first time on the program.  </p><p>So, we welcome Scott Kubie.  He is the chief investment officer at the  Carson Group.  </p><p>Welcome, Scott.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>SCOTT KUBIE, CARSON GROUP CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER:  Thanks, Sue.  Glad to  be here.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, you see the global growth picture as perhaps more compelling  or equally as compelling as the U.S.?  </p><p>KUBIE:  Yes, I think we've seen an upswing globally, not just in the U.S.  but Europe, which had great growth last year.  We also saw Brazil come out  of recession, strong emerging market growth out of China, solid growth in  India.  And Japan put out pretty good numbers for Japan as well.  So, it's  been a real surge.  And we think that's going to adjust the opportunity and  set the investment landscape quite a bit.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  So, let's start with your first pick.  They're all  three are ETFs.  </p><p>The Power Shares International Buyback Achievers -- why do you like that?  </p><p>KUBIE:  You know, this is probably the most interesting, one of the three  and that it focuses on international markets directly.  International  markets are cheaper than U.S.  So, we like that right off the bat, but we  also realize that international stocks aren't quite as shareholder-friendly  as they are in the U.S.  So, we want to focus on those that are.  </p><p>And one of the ways so they can more friendly is buying back their shares.   So, we zero in on those types of countries.  Interest rates are lower  overseas than they are in the U.S. the cost to buy back shares is actually  quite a bit lower.  </p><p>And we saw the same strategy work very well in the U.S. a number of years  ago.  We think it translates well overseas right now.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  The next one is the iShares EDGE MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)  Value Factors ETF.  Tell me about that.  </p><p>KUBIE:  Yes, as the economic recovery starts to broaden, we just see that  the number of companies that will benefit from it will widen.  This market  has really been characterized by a narrow set of growth companies doing  extremely well.  </p><p>But as growth kicks in we see more companies are going to do well and we  want to revalue stocks.  We think they will have a solid rebound after  years of growth and performance.  One of the biggest changes in values is  do you want to have a big sector that could have been comes with value.  </p><p>So, this ETF is sector neutral and it's going to have the same amount of  technology as the overall index.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>KUBIE:  The same amount in staples.  And we like that mixture of  emphasizing the cheapest stock but being balanced across every sector  that's out there.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Let's wrap it up with the Fidelity MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)  Financials ETF.  Why do you like that?  </p><p>KUBIE:  Yes, I think financials have really suffered through the recovery.   They haven't done as welcoming out of that financial crisis which you  referenced earlier over the last ten years.  And so, we see some big  opportunities in this space.  We see some specific benefits from overall  global economic growth kicking in.  </p><p>One of them is loan growth has been really, really slow during this  recovery.  And so, we see an opportunity for that to kick up.  And also see  the fact that long term interest rates should rise.  And so, we should see  banks being able to earn more on the loans that we're making.  We really  that financials and those loans will likely be paid off as long as growth  continues to stay strong.  </p><p>So, this seems to be a sweet spot for financials to take advantage of the  global economic growth and really be benefit shareholders.  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.</p><p>Scott, thank you.  </p><p>KUBIE:  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Scott Kubie with the Carson Group.</p><p>You can read more about his picks on our Website at NBR.com.  </p><p>Well, thank goodness the peak flu season is behind us, but it's not quite  over yet.  This one has been especially severe.  But there are maybe some  positive developments when it comes to creating a universal flu vaccine.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell has our latest story on modern medicine.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Every year, the flu  takes a major toll, causing millions to get sick, hospitalizing hundreds of  thousands of people, and leading to tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S.  alone.  This despite the availability of a flu vaccine.  </p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR:  Of all the vaccines that we have  developed over the years, influenza vaccine can use a lot of improvement.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Vaccines for other diseases like yellow fever, measles and polio  are more than 95 percent effective at preventing infection.  The flu  vaccine, about 40 percent on average since 2005, but it is effectiveness  varies widely season to season, with essential estimates of this year's flu  shot at about 36 percent.  </p><p>That's because the part of the flu virus targeted by the seasonal vaccine  changes each year.  So, efforts are underway to develop a so call universal  flu vaccine, one that would work no matter what strain of flu is  circulating and be durable for multiple seasons.  </p><p>Dr. Peter Palese's group at Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine is among  those working on such a vaccines, what those in the field refer to as  influenza's Holy Grail.  </p><p>DR. PETER PALESE, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE:  A universal influenza virus  vaccine is one which would last lifetime hopefully, but at least we hope it  works for 20 years or even longer.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Only recently have discoveries about the flu virus and new  technologies enable the work on the universal flu vaccine to accelerate.  </p><p>FAUCI:  We only realized ten or more years ago that there was a part of the  virus that doesn't change from season to season.  Once we recognized that,  the real problem and the stumbling block is how do you get the body to  preferentially make a response against that molecule?  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Palese's team funded in part by the National Institute of Health  has one approach.  </p><p>PALESE:  We are building the virus in the laboratory a new one, which isn't  out there and we make from there the vaccine.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  The new virus is meant to stimulate an immune response that will  protect from the flu from season to season.  The experimental vaccine is  now being tested in the earliest phases of human clinical trials funded by  GlaxoSmithKline and the Gates Foundation.  Work on the universal flu  vaccine is also underway at Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Sanofi  Pasteur, as well as that smaller private companies.  Initial results from  Dr. Palese's trials are expected within a year.  Then more testing will be  needed before it can reach the market.  </p><p>PALESE:  We are talking about years, but we are not talking about decades.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Until then, public health officials still recommend a seasonal  flu shot.  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, the great space race.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Morgan Brennan,  inside a future spaceship.  Meet star liner, this is Boeing's capsule that  could by year's end be carrying American astronauts into space.  We've got  this story from here at the Kennedy Space center coming up on NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERERA:  The race is on to get humans into space from U.S. soil.  Something  that hasn't happened since the space shuttle program ended.  Both Boeing  (NYSE:BA) and SpaceX are leading the charge.  </p><p>And Morgan Brennan got a closer look at Boeing's operations at the Kennedy  Space Center in Florida.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRENNAN:  Meet Starliner, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) spacecraft that's been years  in the making.  If all goes according to plan, before the year's out, it  will carry astronauts to space.  It would mark a major milestone.  The U.S.  lost the ability to launch astronauts from U.S. soil when the space shuttle  program ended seven years ago.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Liftoff of the Soyuz rocket.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Instead, we've been relying on the Russians to do it for us.   President Trump has talked about going to the moon and Mars.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It marks an important step  in returning American astronauts to the moon.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  But the new space race really starts here, with NASA's commercial  crew program.  </p><p>JOHN MULHOLLAND, STARLINER PROGRAM MANAGER:  Every other NASA human space  flight program has been cost-plus and the responsibility of the contractor  was to deliver the transportation platform to NASA for their use.  </p><p>On commercial crew, it's more of a rental car model where we retain the  asset and they take it just for their use in that particular mission.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  John Mulholland would know since Starliner's program manager used  to work on the shuttle.  Starliner is one of two spacecraft, the other is  SpaceX's Dragon capsule being produced for manned missions to the  International Space Station.  </p><p>Boeing (NYSE:BA) is building three, all of which will soon be leaving the  factory ahead of major tests.  The crew module will be able to fit seven  people and reflown up to 10 times.  The first manned flight is scheduled  for November, from Kennedy Space Center.  </p><p>Astronauts are already doing evacuation drills.  </p><p>TONY TALIANCICH, ULA DIR. &amp; GM LAUNCH OPERATIONS:  Yes, it's really  exciting.  We have the emergency escape system installed.  We've actually  checked it out with the astronauts in full space suits, ready to support  any operation that's occurring up on the tower.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  United Launch Alliance, the rocket company jointly owned by  Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will handle the launches.  </p><p>Here, 17 stories up on the launch pad, this is the white room, quite  literally the last stop on earth for astronauts before they enter Boeing's  Starliner and head to space.  Boeing's contract with NASA is a little more  than $4 billion, but it's what comes after that could generate the biggest  business.  </p><p>TALIANCICH:  Commercial aviation is government sponsored foundation and  need for strategic need.  It's slowly evolved into a commercial market but  only for high wealth individuals.  And now, we are at the point of the  market where we have a 737 take off and land about every two seconds.  And  we can see the growth in the commercial space flight market paralleling  that.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan at the Kennedy  Space Center in Florida.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And to read more about the race to launch the next generation of  human space flight, head to our Website, NBR.com.  </p><p>Before we go, here's a look at how the day on Wall Street ended up.  The  Dow rose 72 points.  The Nasdaq was up a fraction.  The S&amp;P 500 added four  points.  But for the week the averages fell 1 percent or more.  </p><p>That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  We  want to remind you, this is the time of year your public television station  seeks your support.  Thank you.  Have a great weekend.  See you Monday.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

But there  aren't enough houses on the market to meet demand.  So why aren't builders  building?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Modern medicine.

Why our market monitor says now is the time to look overseas  for returns.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, March  16th.  </p><p> Good evening, everyone, welcome.  I'm Sue Herera.  My partner, Bill  Griffeth, is off tonight.  </p><p> Stocks closed out the week on a high note.  The major indexes all rose as  investors focused on upbeat economic data and looked past some of the trade  concerns that kept them on edge the past few weeks.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average rose 72 points to 24,946.  The Nasdaq was up just a  fraction.  And S&amp;P 500 added four points.  </p><p> But for the week, the averages fell 1 percent or more.  </p><p> Dominic Chu takes a look at the week that was and the week to come.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Over the course of the  past week, business news headlines ran the gamut, chipping away at a big  takeover deal, more controversy at United Airlines, and no real fun and  games for a big toy retailer.  </p><p> So, it was going to be the biggest tech merger and acquisition deal ever,  Singapore-based Broadcom's takeover of San Diego-based competitor Qualcomm  (NASDAQ:QCOM).  But it's not meant to be after President Trump stepped in  and blocked the deal citing national security concerns.  </p><p> United Airlines is under fire again, this time following the death of a dog  on one of its flights after a flight attendant ordered a passenger to put  her pet carrier in an overhead bin.  Comes a year after one of his  passengers was forcibly dragged off of a flight.

Late yesterday, the company said Nike's brand  president resigned.  The resignation came on the same day that the CEO told  employees about complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior.  Today, a  second veteran is reportedly leaving in the wake of internal complaints.   Nike (NYSE:NKE) was the worst performing stock on the Dow today.  </p><p> To the economy now, where consumer sentiment hit its highest level in 14  years.  The University of Michigan survey said most respondents were upbeat  about the economy and their personal finances following the tax cuts.   Economists say the advance in confidence could contribute to solid consumer  spending.  </p><p> The number of job openings hit a record in January, of more than 6 million.   According to the Labor Department, the number of people hired rose and  fewer people quit their jobs.  The report suggests that employers are  having a hard time finding workers that they need.  The unemployment rate  sits at a 17-year low.  </p><p> Home builders broke ground on fewer homes than expected last month.  And  that is not good news for housing market facing a critical shortage of  homes for sale.  </p><p> Diana Olick takes a look at what's keeping builders from building.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nearly everything that  goes into building a home is getting more expensive -- land, labor, and now  materials, thanks to new tariffs on lumber, steel, and aluminum.  The price  of framing lumber is up over 40 percent since the start of 2017 and hit a  record high last week.  Builders have been up against a shortage of labor  and buildable lots.  Now tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as economic  policy all making it even harder to build homes buyers can afford.  </p><p> GARY BOWMAN, TW PERRY CEO:  It's not just lumber.  It's lumber.  It's  steel.  It's impact fees, it's permitting delays.  It's, you know, rising  interest rates.  </p><p> You know, there's a concern that a lot of these cumulative impact of these  increases will curtail demand at some point.  That's I think the bigger  concern.  </p><p> OLICK:  Higher costs mean builders can't make enough money building entry- level homes, the homes that are most in need.  Demand is also growing as  millennials reach their home buying years.  Add it up and it just equals  higher prices for buyers and more risk for builders and distributor.  </p><p> BOWMAN:  We can digest through moth moderate price increases.  But when  they are spiky, you know, we make commitments to our customers.  They make  commitments to their homeowners, customers, and when our costs go up and  don't have a chance to, you know, pass those through, then it damages our  profit margins and our businesses.  </p><p> OLICK:  Single family starts are up, but just 3 percent higher than a year.   To put it all in context, at the peak of the housing boom we were building  nine homes for every 1,000 people aged 18 to 65.  At the bottom in '09,  that fell to just over two per 1,000.  Now, we are barely back to four.  A  normal level is about seven.  </p><p> And those numbers don't even take into account all that pent-up demand from  the recession or the millions of homes bought by investors during the  foreclosure crisis and turned into rentals.  In other words, builders  aren't even close to keeping up.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Silver Spring, Maryland.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  One of the country's biggest mortgage lenders is reportedly the  subject of a widening Department of justice investigation.  According to  the \"Wall Street Journal,\" the FBI has interviewed employees at Wells  Fargo's wealth management business that extends the sales practice probe  beyond the firm's retail banking unit.  </p><p> Well, it was ten years ago, Bear Stearns was bailed out.  The once storied  Wall Street firm was forced into a shotgun marriage with J.P. Morgan and  nearly $30 billion in assistance to save it from bankruptcy.  In the months  prior, the bank had written down bad loans, cut jobs, and looked for  investors.  </p><p> And as someone who was covering that story, the run on the bank and its  ultimate sale was a remarkable turn of events.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  A stunning day on the stock market.  Stocks under severe pressure  earlier this morning after Bear Stearns gets a bail out.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It lost its ability to finance itself.  And when you  are an investment bank and you are levered significantly, you need to be  able to finance yourself.  These things can happen like that.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The speed at which the firm collapsed, the fire sale  price shocked Wall Street.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Attempts to help Bear Stearns has damaged the stock  and, in fact, has damaged confidence overall, particularly in financials.  </p><p> This is part of the great frustration.  You do nothing, the stock goes  down, you try to help it, the stock goes down.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  J.P. Morgan Chase is buying Bear Stearns at a rock  bottom price, $2 a share.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  People at Bear Stearns I have spoken with are stunned  by what happened here.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  One individual told me 17 years I have been saving  for my kids' college education, now I have got to start all over again.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Investment banking will never be the same.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HERERA:  And Steve was right.  A lot never was the same.  </p><p> Many financial historians marked that day as the starting point of the  biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression.  </p><p> It is time to take a look at some of today's upgrades and downgrades.  </p><p>Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) saw its price target raised to 350 a share over at  RBC Capital Market.  That firm sees Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) growing in Japan,  which can be difficult for western companies to do.  The analyst is also  upbeat on the company's original content.  Nonetheless, shares fell  fractionally to $318.45.</p><p>Dominion was downgraded to neutral at J.P. Morgan.  The analyst cites  uncertainty around Dominion's funding strategy following a tax ruling by  energy regulators.  Price target was cut to $74.  Shares of Dominion fell  today to $70.61.  </p><p>Wayfair saw its rating cut to underperform to neutral over at D.A.  Davidson.  That firm cites increased competition in the online retail home  furnishings market.  The price target remains at $65.  Nonetheless, shares  of Wayfair fell nearly 6 percent to $78.95.  </p><p> Still ahead, rolling out the welcome mat.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Puerto Rico is trying  to become the destination for Blockchain and cryptocurrency developers.   Will it succeed as the island recovers from one of the worst hurricanes on  record?  That story when NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT returns.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC) </p><p> HERERA:  A city in Upstate New York is the first to ban new bitcoin mining.   Late last night, Plattsburg City Council approved an 18-month moratorium on  new cryptocurrency mining operations.  The mining process involves the  heavy use of computer servers, and they use a lot of electricity, which in  turn is raising rates for city residents.  Miners have flocked to  Plattsburg because for its proximity to hydroelectric dam and cheap energy  prices.  </p><p> Meantime, Puerto Rico wants to attract the Blockchain industry to help that  island help fund its economic revival.  Blockchain is the technology behind  cryptocurrencies.  </p><p> Seema Mody is in San Juan.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MODY:  Puerto Rico was already struggling through a decade-long recession  which pushed the U.S. territory into the largest municipal bankruptcy in  U.S. history when one of the most destructive hurricanes in history made  landfall in September.  It's now been six months after hurricane Maria and  Puerto Rico is desperate to bring business back to the island.  And the  government positioning itself as a hub for the rapidly growing Blockchain  industry which has yet to claim a city as its headquarters.  </p><p> This past week, thousands of crypto and Blockchain developers descended  upon the island to attend three separate industry conferences in the  capital of San Juan.  Puerto Rico's government even hosted a three day  event in conjunction with Blockchain industries, where the secretary of the  Department of Economic Development announced a new advisory council  initiative to help develop and attract Blockchain business to the island?  </p><p> SEC. MANUEL LABOY, PR, DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:  We are  welcoming, you know, with open arms, Blockchain technology for Puerto Rico  because we know there is a huge potential for the island.  </p><p> MODY:  Tax incentives make Puerto Rico an appealing destination,  specifically Act 22, which says if you become a resident of Puerto Rico,  you essentially pay no taxes on long term capital gains.  It's at the main  reason cryptocurrency investors and Blockchain entrepreneurs have moved  down to the island.  </p><p> JEFF THOMPSON, RED CAT CEO:  This is one of the best places to put a start- up company.  The tax incentives are incredible for a start-up.  The talent  down here is incredible.  </p><p> MODY:  Thompson decided to make the move to the island in September of 2016  where his drone storage and analytics company utilizes the tax incentive  for his business and himself personally.  </p><p> But challenges do exist.  While over 90 percent of the island's power has  been restored, many citizens tell us they still deal with power outages on  a weekly basis.  A few entrepreneurs also told us that while the government  is receptive to Blockchain, the local banks haven't been as supportive,  which makes lending and access to credit a challenge.  </p><p> But some experts say if Puerto Rico can improve its talent pool, the island  will have a better shot at competing with likes of Switzerland, South Korea  and Japan, which are also competing to be the headquarters for the  Blockchain industry.  </p><p> Seema Mody, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) loses its shine and that's where we begin  tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p> The high end jeweler reported disappointing same store sales, citing soft  demand in overseas markets.  The company is also forecasting full year  profits largely below expectations as it invests heavily in its turn around  plan.  Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) shares fell 5 percent to end the session at  $97.51.  </p><p> A private equity firm has offered Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) more than $2  billion to acquire its diabetes unit.  J&amp;J has been considering options for  that business which has suffered from falling sales.  The company has until  mid-June to make a decision.  J&amp;J shares rose fractionally to $133.68.  </p><p> The former chairman of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is reportedly trying to take  that company private.  Multiple reports say Paul Jacobs, who currently  holds a board seat told the board of his plan and approached companies to  become investors.  The deal is considered a long shot, though, for Jacobs  who once ran that company.  Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was recently the target  of a hostile takeover by Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM).  The shares rose 1 percent  to $60.62.  </p><p> Investors had their first chance to react to overstock's quarterly results,  which the company described as, quote, terrible.  The company reported a  loss and a drop in sales.  It also warned that the previously disclosed SEC  probe tied to its upcoming crypto coin offering could hurt its performance.   The shares were off 5 percent to $45.70.  </p><p> Our market monitor tonight is looking to the global economy for his returns  and he's recommending three ETFs.  This is his first time on the program.  </p><p> So, we welcome Scott Kubie.  He is the chief investment officer at the  Carson Group.  </p><p> Welcome, Scott.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p> SCOTT KUBIE, CARSON GROUP CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER:  Thanks, Sue.  Glad to  be here.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, you see the global growth picture as perhaps more compelling  or equally as compelling as the U.S.?  </p><p> KUBIE:  Yes, I think we've seen an upswing globally, not just in the U.S.  but Europe, which had great growth last year.  We also saw Brazil come out  of recession, strong emerging market growth out of China, solid growth in  India.  And Japan put out pretty good numbers for Japan as well.  So, it's  been a real surge.  And we think that's going to adjust the opportunity and  set the investment landscape quite a bit.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  So, let's start with your first pick.  They're all  three are ETFs.  </p><p> The Power Shares International Buyback Achievers -- why do you like that?  </p><p> KUBIE:  You know, this is probably the most interesting, one of the three  and that it focuses on international markets directly.  International  markets are cheaper than U.S.  So, we like that right off the bat, but we  also realize that international stocks aren't quite as shareholder-friendly  as they are in the U.S.  So, we want to focus on those that are.  </p><p> And one of the ways so they can more friendly is buying back their shares.   So, we zero in on those types of countries.  Interest rates are lower  overseas than they are in the U.S. the cost to buy back shares is actually  quite a bit lower.  </p><p> And we saw the same strategy work very well in the U.S. a number of years  ago.  We think it translates well overseas right now.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  The next one is the iShares EDGE MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)  Value Factors ETF.  Tell me about that.  </p><p> KUBIE:  Yes, as the economic recovery starts to broaden, we just see that  the number of companies that will benefit from it will widen.  This market  has really been characterized by a narrow set of growth companies doing  extremely well.  </p><p> But as growth kicks in we see more companies are going to do well and we  want to revalue stocks.  We think they will have a solid rebound after  years of growth and performance.  One of the biggest changes in values is  do you want to have a big sector that could have been comes with value.  </p><p> So, this ETF is sector neutral and it's going to have the same amount of  technology as the overall index.  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.</p><p> KUBIE:  The same amount in staples.  And we like that mixture of  emphasizing the cheapest stock but being balanced across every sector  that's out there.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  Let's wrap it up with the Fidelity MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)  Financials ETF.  Why do you like that?  </p><p> KUBIE:  Yes, I think financials have really suffered through the recovery.   They haven't done as welcoming out of that financial crisis which you  referenced earlier over the last ten years.  And so, we see some big  opportunities in this space.  We see some specific benefits from overall  global economic growth kicking in.  </p><p> One of them is loan growth has been really, really slow during this  recovery.  And so, we see an opportunity for that to kick up.  And also see  the fact that long term interest rates should rise.  And so, we should see  banks being able to earn more on the loans that we're making.  We really  that financials and those loans will likely be paid off as long as growth  continues to stay strong.  </p><p> So, this seems to be a sweet spot for financials to take advantage of the  global economic growth and really be benefit shareholders.  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.</p><p> Scott, thank you.  </p><p> KUBIE:  Thank you.</p><p> HERERA:  Scott Kubie with the Carson Group.</p><p> You can read more about his picks on our Website at NBR.com.  </p><p> Well, thank goodness the peak flu season is behind us, but it's not quite  over yet.  This one has been especially severe.  But there are maybe some  positive developments when it comes to creating a universal flu vaccine.  </p><p> Meg Tirrell has our latest story on modern medicine.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Every year, the flu  takes a major toll, causing millions to get sick, hospitalizing hundreds of  thousands of people, and leading to tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S.  alone.  This despite the availability of a flu vaccine.  </p><p> DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR:  Of all the vaccines that we have  developed over the years, influenza vaccine can use a lot of improvement.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Vaccines for other diseases like yellow fever, measles and polio  are more than 95 percent effective at preventing infection.  The flu  vaccine, about 40 percent on average since 2005, but it is effectiveness  varies widely season to season, with essential estimates of this year's flu  shot at about 36 percent.  </p><p> That's because the part of the flu virus targeted by the seasonal vaccine  changes each year.  So, efforts are underway to develop a so call universal  flu vaccine, one that would work no matter what strain of flu is  circulating and be durable for multiple seasons.  </p><p>Dr. Peter Palese's group at Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine is among  those working on such a vaccines, what those in the field refer to as  influenza's Holy Grail.  </p><p> DR. PETER PALESE, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE:  A universal influenza virus  vaccine is one which would last lifetime hopefully, but at least we hope it  works for 20 years or even longer.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Only recently have discoveries about the flu virus and new  technologies enable the work on the universal flu vaccine to accelerate.  </p><p> FAUCI:  We only realized ten or more years ago that there was a part of the  virus that doesn't change from season to season.  Once we recognized that,  the real problem and the stumbling block is how do you get the body to  preferentially make a response against that molecule?  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Palese's team funded in part by the National Institute of Health  has one approach.  </p><p> PALESE:  We are building the virus in the laboratory a new one, which isn't  out there and we make from there the vaccine.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  The new virus is meant to stimulate an immune response that will  protect from the flu from season to season.  The experimental vaccine is  now being tested in the earliest phases of human clinical trials funded by  GlaxoSmithKline and the Gates Foundation.  Work on the universal flu  vaccine is also underway at Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Sanofi  Pasteur, as well as that smaller private companies.  Initial results from  Dr. Palese's trials are expected within a year.  Then more testing will be  needed before it can reach the market.  </p><p> PALESE:  We are talking about years, but we are not talking about decades.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Until then, public health officials still recommend a seasonal  flu shot.  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, the great space race.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  I'm Morgan Brennan,  inside a future spaceship.

Something  that hasn't happened since the space shuttle program ended.  Both Boeing  (NYSE:BA) and SpaceX are leading the charge.  </p><p> And Morgan Brennan got a closer look at Boeing's operations at the Kennedy  Space Center in Florida.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BRENNAN:  Meet Starliner, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) spacecraft that's been years  in the making.  If all goes according to plan, before the year's out, it  will carry astronauts to space.  It would mark a major milestone.  The U.S.  lost the ability to launch astronauts from U.S. soil when the space shuttle  program ended seven years ago.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Liftoff of the Soyuz rocket.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Instead, we've been relying on the Russians to do it for us.   President Trump has talked about going to the moon and Mars.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It marks an important step  in returning American astronauts to the moon.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  But the new space race really starts here, with NASA's commercial  crew program.  </p><p> JOHN MULHOLLAND, STARLINER PROGRAM MANAGER:  Every other NASA human space  flight program has been cost-plus and the responsibility of the contractor  was to deliver the transportation platform to NASA for their use.  </p><p> On commercial crew, it's more of a rental car model where we retain the  asset and they take it just for their use in that particular mission.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  John Mulholland would know since Starliner's program manager used  to work on the shuttle.  Starliner is one of two spacecraft, the other is  SpaceX's Dragon capsule being produced for manned missions to the  International Space Station.  </p><p> Boeing (NYSE:BA) is building three, all of which will soon be leaving the  factory ahead of major tests.  The crew module will be able to fit seven  people and reflown up to 10 times.  The first manned flight is scheduled  for November, from Kennedy Space Center.  </p><p> Astronauts are already doing evacuation drills.  </p><p> TONY TALIANCICH, ULA DIR. &amp; GM LAUNCH OPERATIONS:  Yes, it's really  exciting.  We have the emergency escape system installed.  We've actually  checked it out with the astronauts in full space suits, ready to support  any operation that's occurring up on the tower.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  United Launch Alliance, the rocket company jointly owned by  Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will handle the launches.  </p><p> Here, 17 stories up on the launch pad, this is the white room, quite  literally the last stop on earth for astronauts before they enter Boeing's  Starliner and head to space.  Boeing's contract with NASA is a little more  than $4 billion, but it's what comes after that could generate the biggest  business.  </p><p> TALIANCICH:  Commercial aviation is government sponsored foundation and  need for strategic need.  It's slowly evolved into a commercial market but  only for high wealth individuals.  And now, we are at the point of the  market where we have a 737 take off and land about every two seconds.  And  we can see the growth in the commercial space flight market paralleling  that.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan at the Kennedy  Space Center in Florida.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And to read more about the race to launch the next generation of  human space flight, head to our Website, NBR.com.  </p><p> Before we go, here's a look at how the day on Wall Street ended up.  The  Dow rose 72 points.  The Nasdaq was up a fraction.  The S&amp;P 500 added four  points.  But for the week the averages fell 1 percent or more.  </p><p> That will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  We  want to remind you, this is the time of year your public television station  seeks your support.  Thank you.  Have a great weekend.  See you Monday.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.
