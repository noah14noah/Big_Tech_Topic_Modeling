A Warren administration would \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">suck for us</url>,\u201d he said in leaked audio of a July meeting, referring to Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal to break up big tech companies. \u201cIf she gets elected president,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck,\u2019\u201d she <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">tweeted</url>, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">\u201cZuckerberg Hates Warren\u2019s Plan to Break Up Facebook. She Doesn\u2019t Care.\u201d</url></p><p>The debate: Does Facebook need to be broken up?</p><p>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW</p><p>Last April, Mr. Zuckerberg, donning his best \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">I\u2019m sorry suit</url>,\u201d testified before Congress and apologized for \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">a big mistake</url>.\u201d The big mistake was in fact several big mistakes, including       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">exposing</url>up to 87 million users\u2019 data to Trump campaign consultants (a privacy breach for which Facebook would be fined       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">$5 billion</url>); concealing an organized Russian effort to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">interfere in the 2016 election</url>; and continually failing to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">regulate genocidal hate speech</url>. </p><p>To Ms. Warren, the litany of errors proves that tech giants hold \u201ctoo much power over our economy, our society and our democracy\u201d and need to be broken up. In March, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">she proposed a plan</url> that would reverse Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. Ms. Warren suggests that users wouldn\u2019t much notice these changes. But for the company, Mr. Zuckerberg says, the threat of such a policy is \u201cexistential.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">[The big debates, distilled. This guide will put in context what people are saying about the pressing issues of the week. Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable.]</url></p><p>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING</p><p>Facebook is too powerful</p><p>The anti-monopolist spirit that animates Ms. Warren\u2019s policy has found an unlikely vessel in Chris Hughes, who created Facebook with Mr. Zuckerberg when the two were roommates at Harvard. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">a nearly 6,000-word Op-Ed for The Times</url>, Mr. Hughes argues that Mr. Zuckerberg, whom he considers a \u201cgood, kind person,\u201d simply has more influence over how businesses and people relate than any individual should. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Here</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">are five takeaways from his piece.</url>) \u201cMark\u2019s power,\u201d he says, \u201cis unprecedented and un-American,\u201d and must be curtailed. He writes:</p><p>Facebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category. </p><p>Mr. Hughes contends that Facebook\u2019s dominance prohibits would-be entrepreneurs from creating alternative social networks, suffocating innovation and restricting consumer choice. The damage extends to industries beyond tech, including journalism, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">whose business model was broken</url> by Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s capture of digital advertising revenue. In warning about the dangers of Facebook\u2019s monopolistic ambitions, Mr. Hughes cites Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor and the author of \u201cThe Curse of Bigness,\u201d       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">who told Wired\u2019s editor, Nicholas Thompson</url>:</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg wrote an email when he was acquiring Instagram that was disclosed in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">New York Post</url>, and it suggests he was buying Instagram because he saw it as a competitive threat. Now, it is a felony under U.S. law to buy companies that you believe are competitive threats to you. \u2026 The American way is that we believe in competition and that companies should fight it out, not buy each other when there\u2019s serious competition.</p><p>But the most pernicious aspect of Facebook\u2019s hegemony, Mr. Hughes says, is Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cunilateral control over speech.\u201d He points as an example to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s 2017 decision to stop Facebook Messenger from being used in Myanmar to spread calls for the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. At the same time, United Nations investigators and human rights groups said that the company didn\u2019t do nearly enough and, in its negligence, actively facilitated what has since been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">deemed a genocide</url>. </p><p>\u201cMark knows that this is too much power,\u201d Mr. Hughes writes.</p><p>Breaking up Facebook isn\u2019t a silver bullet</p><p>Breaking up Facebook isn\u2019t enough, as even Mr. Hughes admits, since it won\u2019t address some of society\u2019s greatest grievances with the platform, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">argues Evelyn Douek</url> in Slate. On the issue of election security, she writes: </p><p>If we\u2019re worried about Russia or other foreign powers using Facebook and other social media platforms to influence elections \u2014 as Sen. Elizabeth Warren mentions when making her case for breakup \u2014 then we also need to acknowledge that these influence campaigns are often <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">sophisticated, cross-platform operations</url> that require well-resourced, expert and coordinated responses. No one has made a good case for how breakup and competition would aid these efforts.</p><p>Ms. Douek also agrees with Mr. Hughes that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s control over speech is deeply troubling. But she fails to see how increased competition would have helped in Myanmar, where the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">military purposefully spread</url> violent propaganda. Authoritarianism and ethnic hatred are not problems the market can solve, nor are \u201cthe most intractable issues about how to moderate speech on any individual platform.\u201d</p><p>User privacy, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Shira Ovide argues</url> in Bloomberg, is another issue that breaking apart the Facebook platform from Instagram and WhatsApp wouldn\u2019t fix. She writes: </p><p>Does a core Facebook with perhaps 1 billion users have less ability to harvest information such as people\u2019s web-surfing habits and physical locations as they roam around with smartphones? No, it doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Both Ms. Douek and Ms. Ovide are open to breaking up Facebook to keep markets competitive, but they see trustbusting as somewhat beside the point of regulation and democratic oversight. They share this perspective with the tech journalist Kara Swisher, who has called in The Times for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">a national privacy</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">law</url> as well as increased funding for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector.</p><p>Dipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, goes one step further, claiming that Facebook should be treated as a public utility, like water and electric companies. He <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">writes</url> in the Harvard Business Review, \u201cFacebook and firms like it have become natural monopolies that necessitate a novel, stringent set of regulations to obstruct their capitalistic overreaches and protect the public against ingrained economic exploitation.\u201d</p><p>Facebook is being vilified</p><p>Reports of Facebook\u2019s monopoly are exaggerated, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">writes Bloomberg\u2019s</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">editorial board</url>. Dominance in a market, it says, should not be mistaken for a lack of competition:</p><p>As successful as Facebook is, there\u2019s little stopping other companies from doing things better. In fact, they already are: Nearly all of Facebook\u2019s constituent services \u2014 messaging, video sharing and so forth \u2014 face competition from apps around the world.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Sheryl Sandberg, has argued</url> that the company faces a great deal of competition from Chinese tech companies, which would benefit from a policy like Ms. Warren\u2019s. \u201cYou could break us up, you could break other tech companies up, but you actually don\u2019t address the underlying issues people are concerned about,\u201d she said in May.</p><p>What\u2019s more, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">writes CNBC\u2019s Matt Rosoff</url>, calls to break up Facebook or regulate it like a public utility ignore the fact that it isn\u2019t strictly necessary to modern life as water and electricity are:</p><p>Hughes and others have cited historical precedents such as the government\u2019s breakup of Standard Oil and AT&amp;amp;T as a justification for stricter antitrust regulation against tech giants. But these companies not only had clear monopolies with pricing power that hurt consumers, they also offered products that were vital to the economy. \u2026 Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are only three of many ways people can communicate digitally, and while many people spend hours every week using them, they are replaceable and inessential.</p><p>In the end, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">writes Jim Geraghty</url> for National Review, the fault is not in our tech overlords, but in ourselves:</p><p>The best way to get Facebook to be more responsive to user concerns about privacy is for users to be loud about their concerns or to turn away from the product, not to make the product less attractive by forcing the company to sell off its other most popular apps.</p><p>WHAT TO WATCH</p><p>Even if elected, Ms. Warren wouldn\u2019t be able to break up Facebook by herself. As Margaret Harding McGill and Steven Overly report for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">Politico</url>, \u201cthe antitrust review process is meant to be a regulatory and legal one.\u201d</p><p>In some ways, however, that path is already being paved. Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments were leaked less than a month after attorneys general of eight states \u2014 four Democrats and four Republicans \u2014 and the District of Columbia announced that they would follow the Federal Trade Commission in opening an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable\">antitrust investigation</url> into the company. </p><p>Do you have a point of view we missed?

I'm Willow Bay.</p><p>VARNEY: And I'm Stuart Varney.  Welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>Our top story tonight: just what a struggling tech investor likes to see, a Nasdaq winning streak.  The Nasdaq gained ground for the fourth-straight session today.  In fact, it's ended higher every day since Yahoo! wowed Wall Street last Tuesday night with a blowout profit report.  And investors are hoping more blowout profit reports to come this week will help the index extend a much-needed comeback. It's now at its best level in more than three months.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Technology stocks clocked a fourth-straight session of gains with investors pinning their hopes on a second week of stellar corporate earnings and a less aggressive Federal Reserve.</p><p>MICHAEL CARTY, NEW MILLENNIUM ADVISORS: We seem to be off to a roaring start.  These are stocks that basically have been beaten down and now they're starting to turn around.  We realize that the economy is not going to die.  The Fed seems to have become less aggressive and hopefully won't be aggressive in the late August meeting.  And now it seems that earnings are coming out very, very strongly.</p><p>LISOVICZ: On the strength of earnings expectations and actual results, the Nasdaq closed at 4,274, up 28 points.  The composite index was lifted by JDS Uniphase.  Shares of the fiber optic company rose after its competitor Corning, which trades on the NYSE, posted quarterly results that substantially beat \"Street\" estimates.</p><p>And shares of Qualcomm jumped on news that the European and Japanese patent offices had upheld three of Qualcomm's patents, making the company's technology more competitive overseas.</p><p>Investors also bought up semiconductor and biotech issues.</p><p>FRED SEARS, INVESTOR CAPITAL FUNDS: Well, I'm very happy to see that the estimates for the S&amp;P are going up.  I think that's mostly a result of what's happening in the technology today.  And I think that by far the best place to be invested is the semis right now, because the earnings are -- are going to blow through expectations.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Over on the big board, attention focused on a flurry of merger announcements in the paper, consumer foods, and financial industries.  But caution over tomorrow's Consumer Price Index, a key inflation indicator, kept the Dow virtually unchanged.  The blue chip index closed at 10,804, down eight points.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ: The majority of companies has yet to report second- quarter results, but analysts say profits are looking so strong that investors are expecting the momentum to carry over into the third quarter.  If so, Wall Street could enjoy an Indian summer rally -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: And wouldn't that be nice?</p><p>LISOVICZ: That's optimistic.</p><p>VARNEY: Got it.  Thanks, Susan.</p><p>Taking a closer look at some of the biggest stock movers today: First off is BroadCom.  That stock soared nearly 11 1/2, closing just under 261 1/2.  That's a new 52-week high there.</p><p>Sycamore Networks soared almost 12 after jumping more than 10 points Friday.  And Lycos gained more than eight.  BroadVision and Brocade Communications both higher as well.</p><p>Check some of today's biggest losers -- they are there.  Commerce One sank more than 5 1/2.  Aetna down four and change.  ING would not comment on reports that it was the leading bidder for Aetna's financial services unit.</p><p>Financial stocks also took it on the chin today after recent gains: Morgan Stanley, for example -- Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, that is, down four, and Merrill Lynch lost 3 1/2.  Charles Schwab, by the way, down more than three points.</p><p>BAY: Two megadeals announced today that would bring together some of the best-known brands at the supermarket.  Up first, a bid to create one of the world's largest food companies.  General Mills said it will pay nearly $5 1/2 billion in stock for Diageo's Pillsbury unit, plus debt.  But investors seemed less than enthused.  Shares of General Mills fell nearly 2 3/4 today.  In New York trading, Diageo shares gained more than a half.</p><p>Fred Katayama has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: Oh, I've always wanted to do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Pillsbury Doughboy agreed to walk down the aisle with Betty Crocker, but shareholders on Betty's side of the aisle are not giggling.  Her parent, General Mills, will pay $5.4 billion in stock and take on more than 5 billion in debt to buy Pillsbury from Britain's Diageo. Together General Mills and Pillsbury will boast sales of nearly $13 billion, making it the U.S.'s third-largest food company and a powerhouse in snacks and quick-prep foods.</p><p>STEVE SANGER, GENERAL MILLS: When you add together our product line and Pillsbury product line, you will have -- about 80 percent of those products will either be ready to eat or quick preparation. That's preparation of 15 minutes or less.  And that is exactly what consumers today are looking for.</p><p>KATAYAMA: But shareholders didn't buy into the deal, sending the stock down nearly 8 percent.</p><p>(on camera): But General Mills says this deal will not add to earning per share for another four years, a point analysts say could be a sore point for shareholders.</p><p>(voice-over): This deal latest is the latest in a consolidation wave sweeping the food industry.  Just last month, Unilever said it's buying Best Foods and Philip Morris announced it's acquiring Nabisco Holdings.</p><p>Analysts say the list of potential acquisition targets include Quaker Oats, Ralston-Purina, Keebler, and Hain Celestial.  And despite its new heft, General Mills.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CS FIRST BOSTON: This all was possible, the most obvious one because of a couple of joint ventures, is Nestle.  But there is a standstill agreement with Nestle that prevents them from going hostile.  Obviously, all agreements can be renegotiated.</p><p>KATAYAMA: General Mills plans to sell Pillsbury cake mix and frosting business to appease any antitrust concerns by regulators. But General Mills must also get the blessing of its shareholders.</p><p>Fred Katayama, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Today's other big deal will make a paper giant a tissue giant.  Georgia Pacific said it's going to buy Fort James -- that's the maker of Quilted Northern -- for nearly $8 billion in stock and cash.  That's a 51 percent premium over Friday's closing price.</p><p>The deal will make Georgia Pacific the world's largest manufacturer of tissue.  It's all part of the company's new strategy, as the chief executive told CNNfn earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>A.D. \"PETE\" CORRELL, CEO, GEORGIA-PACIFIC: It adds value to out shareholders.  It's accretive.  It's a good deal.  It grows us in a product that we wanted to grow in.  And it continues the transformation of Georgia-Pacific from a commodity-based company to a custom -- company that sells brands directly to consumers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: And those brands that it's picking up are from Fort James: Brawny, Mardi Gras, Quilted Northern, and Dixie.  But investors didn't pick up the stock.  Georgia Pacific stock fell more than 2 1/4 points.  Today it also beat second-quarter profit estimates by four cents a share.  But Fort James stock jumped almost 8 1/2.  Today's deal is just the latest in the consolidating paper industry, including International Paper's planned merger with Champion International.</p><p>BAY: The deal-making didn't end there.  Also today, AES, one of the world's leading independent power producers, announced plans to buy Ipalco Enterprises for more than $2 billion in stock.  This is AES' eighth acquisition this year.</p><p>AES gained more than 3 1/2 today and Ipalco, based in Indiana, was up one.</p><p>And, back on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers is buying the private client business of rival SG Cowen.  Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but under the agreement 130 SG Cowen brokers with 60,000 clients will come into Lehman's fold.</p><p>Shares of Lehman today gave back some of their recent gains, losing more than 4 1/2 to close at 111 1/4.</p><p>And a deal today for General Electric: It is buying railroad equipment maker Harmon Industries.  The price tag: $342 million in stock.</p><p>GE was up 1 1/2 and Harmon soared nearly 16 1/2, or 124 percent, to close above 29 1/2.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, there's a rally, Willow. Just ahead on MONEYLINE, cracking down on one of the most controversial investment trends and on its head cheerleader.  The man who practically invented day trading faces the wrath of regulators: Harvey Houtkin on the hot seat.</p><p>Plus, the Senate confronts another explosive tax debate: Should you pay higher taxes just for saying \"I Do\"?</p><p>And later, are you getting more than just a earful when you use your cell phone?  An intriguing decision by the cell-phone industry to tell all.</p><p>Stay with us please.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Regulators today brought the hammer down on a man who helped usher in this era of day trading.  The NASD today slapped Harvey Houtkin and his firm, All-Tech Direct, with a complaint, charging a range of misconduct.</p><p>Greg Clarkin reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He's been called the father of day-trading, but now regulators are going after Harvey Houtkin.  Houtkin is CEO of day trading from All-Tech Direct. Regulators charged he and other All-Tech executives with a variety of offenses, including failing to supervise employees, who arranged more than $130 million in loans among All-Techs day traders in a single year, loans to help those clients meet margin calls.</p><p>Regulators also took exception with what they call misleading, exaggerated, and unsupported statements in some All-Tech advertising, adds touting the success of day trading with All-Tech's system.  And the National Association of Securities Dealer charged All-Tech allowed one employee who had been barred from the securities business to take part in securities-related activity.</p><p>JOHN COFFEE, PROF., COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL: I believe not only the NASD, but the SEC and state regulars, are concerned that this is an industry that's gotten in over its head and has sucked in a large number of basically middle-income investors with the promise that this was a low-risk way of making a great deal of money.</p><p>CLARKIN: A separate NASD complaint was filed against Stock USA, another trading firm.  Both are part of a combined effort by regulators to keep up with the popularity of day trading.</p><p>BRIAN LANE, GIBSON, DUNN &amp; CRUTCHER: If I was a day-trading agency, or firm, I would look at this complaint and I would look very carefully at what my marketing practices were in attracting customers to my account.  I think this is a shot across the bow.</p><p>CLARKIN: The complaints come just days after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new rule for brokerage firms promoting day trading.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: And those firms are now required to provide customers with a statement spelling out risks of day trading.  And as for All- Tech, all it would say about the NASD's complaint, was that it was confident it would be vindicated -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Do you think day traders are back?  I'm watching the market action on daily bases.  Are they back?</p><p>CLARKIN: It does appear that way, Stuart.  There's a lot of folks they believe, in the last few sessions, they been emboldened by the run of the Nasdaq and they're getting back into the market in a big way.</p><p>VARNEY: Interesting, Greg Clarkin, thanks very much.  OK -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, checking tonight's MONEYLINE \"Movers,\" Anesta surged 10 1/2, setting a new 52-week high.  Fellow drug-maker Cephalon is buying it in a $444 million stock deal.  VerticalNet jumped nearly 11.  The manager of B2B sites was upgraded to Goldman Sachs recommend list.  Online employment agency, Career Builder gained almost 3 3/4 or 89 percent.  Both Knight Ridder and Tribune are buying it together for eight dollars a share.</p><p>And Genentech lost eight on news that second-quarter sales of its breast cancer treatment drug, Herceptin, were lower than anticipated. But the biotech firm did meet Wall Street's profit forecasts today, earning 29 cents a share.</p><p>VARNEY: A slew of companies reported earnings today, and they include Bank of America.  The nation's No. 1 bank said its profits rose seven percent to just over two billion dollars in the second quarter.  That was in line with Wall Street estimates of $1.23 per share.  And fiber-optics maker, Corning, surpassed Wall Street expectations.  It earned 94 cents a share.  The company's quarterly profits jumped 80 percent from a year ago, driven by strong sales of fiber-optic cable.  Corning also said it expects to earn up to $3.25 a share for the year.  That's more than what Wall Street had been expecting.  The stock today surged at 12 1/4 points.</p><p>BAY: And a blow-out profit report from Go2Net in tonight's \"Tech Watch.\" After the closing bell, the company reported third-quarter profits of 22 cents a share, its sixth consecutive quarter of increasing operating profits.  Go2Net beat Wall Street estimates by seven cents a share.  Revenue jumped more than 300 percent to $23 million.  Go2Net runs a network of Internet sites, including Meta- Crawler.  In light after-hours trading, its stock jumped seven dollars after gaining more than four dollars during the regular session.</p><p>But year-to-date, Go2Net shares are still off more than 33 percent.  Joining us now from Seattle, Washington, the company's chairman and CEO, Russell Horowitz.</p><p>Russell, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>RUSSELL HOROWITZ, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, GO2NET: Thanks, thanks for having me.</p><p>BAY: What part of your business allowed to you beat estimates by seven cents a share?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Well, our business is strong across the board.  But the two areas that are showing the greatest strength is our licensing business -- where we license our applications and technologies to partners -- and also our transactions platform.  We have one of the leading payment processing platforms in the industry.  And we saw volume on our platform increase fairly significantly: $310 million dollar in the quarter, which is up more than 50 percent since the seasonly high December quarter of $190 million.</p><p>And we also saw an increase in the number of merchants that use our platform of 12,000 in the quarter to 82,000, which makes our payment processing platform the most widely used in the Internet industry.</p><p>BAY: Last time you joined us, you had just completed a licensing deal with Hasbro.  Are you looking to add more of those licensing agreements, which are really contributing to your bottom line?</p><p>HOROWITZ: That's right.  That's, you know, that's part of our licensing stream.  And if you look at Go2Net core competency and our focus going forward, it's really looking at licensing our applications and technologies to all broadband device.  It's TVs, PCs and wireless. We've got the relationship with Paul Allen, broadband distribution assets, charter communications, the fourth largest cable company, RCN. And that gives us 10 million homes, representing 30 million users.</p><p>And we'll be one of the first to market with interactive television.  We've got the existing PC services.  And we're also looking at wireless.  We think one of the keys going forward is cross- platform distribution.  When you look at analyst forecast of more than two billion devices being connected to the Internet in 2004 -- which is ten times what it is now -- our belief is more than a third of those will be broadband enabled, and that we will be able to be a leader in licensing our applications and technologies to the service providers for those broadband services.</p><p>BAY: Now, Russ, we keep hearing about the promise of broadband, but I get the sense that customers are getting a little frustrated that it's taking longer than they had anticipated.  Is that something that concerns you?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Not really.  People realize how exciting broadband is and they realize how much growth it will unlock.  And if you look at competing technology platforms in terms of broadband -- whether it's the cable market, DSL, satellite, or wireless -- for us, the main thing is that having competition among different platforms for broadband accelerates the ultimate adoption.  And since we provide our applications and technologies on top of that broadband pipe, the key is, as they compete -- and, as over the next 18 to 24 months, broadband connectivity for every device connected to the Internet comes together, then we're in a position to be in the highest-gross segment with a highly profitable and scalable business model.</p><p>BAY: Russell Horowitz, we'll let that be the last word.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>HOROWITZ: Thanks a lot -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Thanks, Willow.</p><p>Coming up on MONEYLINE, the Senate fight over a hot tax issue for the Republicans: the so-called marriage penalty.  We'll have that story just ahead after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: A tax-cut showdown taking place tonight in Washington. The Senate is expected to vote \"yea\" on phasing out the marriage penalty, and the White House is not expected to go along.</p><p>Bob Beard is on Capitol Hill, where the voting is underway -- Bob.</p><p>BOB BEARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, hi, Stuart.</p><p>This is taking some time.  What's happening now is the Senate is voting on 40 -- count them -- 40 separate amendments to a marriage penalty bill.  This is going to take some time.  We're expecting a final vote late tonight or tomorrow, whatever.  It's going to pass. Bottom line, congressional Republicans and some Democrats want a 10- year $250 billion divorce from a tax code quirk.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BEARD (voice-over): For millions of married couples, to love and honor means paying more to the IRS than single filers making the same income.  The Senate bill calls for raising the standard deduction for married couples to $8,800, double that of individual taxpayers. Another proposed change: to trim the marginal rate.</p><p>Currently, two single people making $26,000 a year each are in the 15-percent tax bracket, but a married couple making the same amount filing jointly is taxed at a higher rate, some of their income at the 28-percent rate.  The bill would put the married couple back in the 15-percent bracket -- all part of a GOP plan to resurrect piece by piece a massive tax cut bill vetoed by the president last year.</p><p>DAVID MITCHELL, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: There is no bushes to hide behind when you do individual pieces of legislation and I think whether or not Republicans were clever, or just lucky, they have stumbled across a better strategy this time around.</p><p>BEARD: President Clinton says he'll sign marriage tax relief if Congress agrees to his government-funded prescription drug plan for Medicare recipients.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BEARD: So far, the GOP leadership is saying no deal, so a presidential veto now is likely.  Republicans want to send this tax cut separately from a phase out in inheritance taxes -- that was passed last week -- to President Clinton's desk right during the GOP Convention in Philadelphia.  And there is a lot more money now in this tax-cut debate.  The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office is out with new budget estimates, $2.17 trillion now for 10 years, that's double the previous estimates.</p><p>Back to Willow in Los Angeles.</p><p>BAY: Bob Beard from Capitol Hill, thank you.</p><p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators pick up the pace during today's round of peace talks at Camp David.</p><p>Jim Moret joins us now from Washington with more on that, in the MONEYLINE \"News Digest\" -- Jim.</p><p>JIM MORET, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Willow.</p><p>White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Israeli and Palestinian leaders have intensified the pace of their negotiations, with a Wednesday deadline looming, that's when President Clinton is set to leave for the G-8 economic summit in Japan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE LOCKHART, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think that the parties understand the schedule here and they understand that they're working toward that.  So as I said earlier today, I think the pace and the intensity have both quickened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MORET: In the presidential race, a new CNNGallup Poll shows Democrat Al Gore gaining support: 46 percent of the respondents said they would back Gore, that compares with 48 percent for Republican George W. Bush.  Two weeks ago, the same poll gave Gore 41 percent and Bush 50 percent.</p><p>Also today, a former doctor accused of killing three patients at a veterans' hospital seven years ago has pleaded innocent. Prosecutors accused Michael Swango of administering lethal injections to those patients and then posting \"do not resuscitate\" on their charts.</p><p>In India, a passenger plane crashed during a landing attempt, killing 51 passengers and four people on the ground.  That plane was delivered in June of 1980 and was slated to be grounded at the end of this year.</p><p>And today is the fourth anniversary of another crash: TWA Flight 800. Relatives of the victims held a private ceremony on Long Island near where the plane went down.  All 230 people aboard were killed. Those are tonight's top stories outside the world of business. I'll have more coming up on \"THE WORLD TODAY\" along with Joie Chen, that's at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 Pacific -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Jim, thanks.</p><p>MONEYLINE will be back right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Still to come in the second half hour of MONEYLINE, earnings season picks up the pace tomorrow, including some big tech names like Apple, Intel and Microsoft.  We'll have a preview.</p><p>BAY: Also, first it's music, now it's movies.  Duplication downloading heads to Hollywood.</p><p>Those stories and more when MONEYLINE continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: The MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR continues.  Here again, Willow Bay in Los Angeles and Stuart Varney in New York.</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's headlines, Wall Street gears up for a flood of corporate profit reports.  We'll look at whether the best is yet to come for second-quarter earnings.  And as the tobacco industry reels from a $145 billion damage award, we'll check out whether the industry's financial viability went up in smoke.</p><p>Plus, an issue close to the heart and head of millions of people: You may soon be able to learn how much radiation your cell phone gives off.</p><p>BAY: But first, more on tonight's top story.  Tech stocks drive the Nasdaq to its fourth-straight winning session.  The index is now up 35 percent from its low, hit in May.  Today, the Nasdaq gained more than 28 to 4,274, with strong gains in the fiber-optics, chip and biotech sectors.</p><p>But it was a turbulent day for blue chips with the Dow closing off slightly, down eight to 10,804.</p><p>For the first time in a long time investors had some deals to chew over.  The biggest: paper giant Georgia-Pacific in a deal with rival Fort James.  Georgia-Pacific stock off more than 2 1/4 while Fort James jumped nearly 8 1/2.</p><p>In the food business, General Mills bought the Pillsbury unit of Britain's Diageo.  General Mills slipped nearly 2 3/4 and Diageo shares in New York gained more than half a point.</p><p>VARNEY: Aside from the merger activity, the markets this week may well by dominated by a flood of earnings reports.  Corporate profits have been growing at a very steady clip, thank you, but market watchers say some of the strongest results are still to come down the pike.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK HILL, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, FIRST CALL: The technology and the energy area will be two areas that will beat the estimates by more than they normally do.  And the reason I say that is that these are two areas where the analyst estimates have been going up during quarter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: The oil companies won't be here until next week, but some major tech earnings are on the docket for tomorrow, headlined by Intel, Microsoft and Apple.  Also on Tuesday's agenda: General Motors, Johnson &amp; Johnson, these accompanied by Wall Street broker Merrill Lynch, Time Warner, the parent of CNN, plus Dow components, Pfizer, Honeywell and Philip Morris.</p><p>BAY: The Philip Morris results will have special currency in light of last week's blockbuster ruling by a Florida jury.  The jurors held the cigarette industry liable for nearly $145 billion in punitive damages, but big tobacco remains confident it will overturn the verdict on appeal.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The jurors who returned the biggest punitive damages award in history are defending their verdict to assess cigarette companies nearly $145 billion.</p><p>LEIGHTON FINEGAN, JURY FOREMAN: I want people to get the money for the pain and suffering, the medical bills, the cost, the devastation to their families: not to reward them, not to make them rich, but to make the companies accountable.</p><p>JOHN MESTRE, JUROR: We started out -- everyone had a figure in mind and we took the average of it.  And then we said, well, the best way to apportion it would be by market share.</p><p>FRANK: Judge Robert Kaye, back in court today, did not rule on possible reduction or rejection of the punitive damages.  But he met with lawyers from both sides to schedule appeals.</p><p>DAN WEBB, PHILIP MORRIS ATTORNEY: We're extremely confident the case will be reversed on appeal, and we just take it one step at a time.</p><p>FRANK: Still hanging, the invitation to settle issued moments after Friday's verdict by Stanley Rosenblatt, the victorious plaintiffs' attorney, to Geoffrey Bible, the chairman of Philip Morris.</p><p>STANLEY ROSENBLATT, PLAINTIFFS' ATTORNEY: Mr. Bible, with all your shareholding meetings and all your stock and your $25 million bonuses, yes, and all your tough talk, Mr. Bible, call me next week. Yes.  You want to call me.  I'll take a payout, Mr. Bible.</p><p>FRANK: But settlement, at least now, is not part of Philip Morris game plan.  Asked Monday whether Bible has responded, a top Philip Morris lawyer told CNN Financial News: \"The answer is no. Don't hold your breath.\"</p><p>The tobacco industry has hung tough before, then settled.</p><p>(on camera): In the only other class-action case to go to trial, Rosenblatt in 1998 extracted a settlement of nearly $350 million on behalf of 60,000 flight attendants who claimed injury from secondhand smoke aboard airplanes.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Friday's ruling put a crimp on tobacco shares today as investors worried about the financial viability of the cigarette industry.</p><p>In today's activity, Philip Morris slipped more than a point. R.J. Reynolds down more than a half.  British American Tobacco, which owns Brown &amp; Williamson, down just a fraction.  Loews, the parent of Lorillard, sank three.  And the Vector Group, which owns Liggett, down just 1/8.</p><p>Allan Chernoff has more on tobacco's financial future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tobacco companies and the financial analysts who track them spend the day trying to reassure investors, arguing there's no chance the companies will have to pay anything close to the $145 billion award.</p><p>But many investors don't want to stick around to find out.  They bailed out of tobacco stocks and bonds.  The industry's loss in Florida is another hole in its legal dam.  Analysts say such losses highlight future financial risk.</p><p>MARY ARONSON, ARONSON WASHINGTON RESEARCH: Additional cases are filed, lawyers and clients come out of the woodwork.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Already there are more than 500 pending lawsuits against the tobacco industry, including the U.S. Department of Justice, suing to recover money spent by federal health care programs to treat smokers; class-actions in Louisiana, Arizona, Illinois; and insurance companies suing for the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.  It's making state and municipal finance officials worry about their take of the $245 billion tobacco settlement with the states.</p><p>MONEYLINE has learned several states and counties are preparing to cash in on the settlement in coming months by floating bonds that will be paid off with proceeds from the tobacco settlement.</p><p>Louisiana, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Orange and Sacramento counties have been talking with investment bankers about the idea.</p><p>New York's Westchester County did it in December, raising $110 million.</p><p>ALAN SCHEINKMAN, WESTCHESTER COUNTY ATTORNEY: Although Philip Morris is a major presence here and they're a corporate citizen here, we had some concerns relative to their future fiscal health.</p><p>CHERNOFF: To be sure, legal battles are not about to send tobacco companies tumbling into bankruptcy.</p><p>NICOLE DELZ LYNCH, STANDARD &amp; POOR'S: Our assumption is that bankruptcy is pretty remote and far removed from this process given the array of appeals that these companies have as their options.</p><p>CHERNOFF: In fact, tobacco firms are likely to report double- digit earnings gains this week, thanks in part to hikes in cigarette prices.</p><p>Philip Morris has huge tobacco profits overseas and a highly successful food business in Kraft, which is about to add Nabisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: R.J. Reynolds is most vulnerable among the major tobacco firms.  It is heavily dependent on the domestic market.  It is no longer a diversified company, and it has been losing market share. Already, the company has a junk bond credit rating -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: You know, when you think of $145 billion damage award, I would have thought those stocks would have come down more than they did.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Well, clearly, Wall Street doesn't think the cigarette, tobacco companies are going to have to pay that full amount.  Also this had been factored into the stocks.  There was an anticipation that clearly the jury was going to come out way against the tobacco companies.</p><p>And consider what happened to Loews today, that stock off three points.  I looked at the big owners there, and Larry and Preston Tisch, the Tisch family, they do hold quite a few shares.  Together those brothers hold 30 million shares.  There were out $90 million.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, that's financial hurt.</p><p>CHERNOFF: No question.</p><p>VARNEY: Allan Chernoff, thank you -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, coming up, relief may be in site for those worried about cell-phone radiation.  Soon the industry may tell you exactly what's being released when you press the send button. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's MONEYLINE \"Focus,\" a look at cell phones and radiation.  Though the mobile phone industry still says phones are safe, it's bowing to growing public pressure and will start releasing information on the amount of radiation specific models direct into a cell-phone users brain.</p><p>Steve Young has this special report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For years, the cell phone industry said, all the public needs to know is that mobile phones sold in U.S. meet government standard, so they're safe.  But now the American cell phone industry, under pressure from the public and countries with a different view, is doing an about-face. MONEYLINE has learned that the U.S. mobile phone industry will start publishing information on the amount of microwave energies specific models release into human tissue.</p><p>Manufacturers will start providing the information to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association on a voluntary basis August 1st.  Those that do will be able to say the phone is CTI- certified.  Consumers can expect to see the radiation numbers on product literature with new phones in three to six months.</p><p>LOUIS SLESLIN, \"MICROWAVE NEWS\": A couple of months ago, a blue ribbon panel set up by the British government said outright this information should be on the box.  So, there's growing pressure worldwide to make this information available to consumers.</p><p>YOUNG: Analysts say the industry is doing the smart thing -- if belatedly -- because, despite a number of studies, it's unclear whether cell phones are safe or could contribute to brain cancer or other health problems.</p><p>CHRIS LARSEN, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: Why not come out front and say, we don't know whether it's bad or not, but here's the information?  We'll be as up front as possible; because, apparently, not being up front has hurt the tobacco companies.</p><p>JAY MAYESH, KAYE, SCHOLER: The old days of stonewalling the science and not sharing the results of science -- which may be ambiguous -- with the public are over.  You're better off sharing it up front.</p><p>YOUNG: But there are still some problems for those consumers who want to choose a phone based on the lowest radiation numbers.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: Manufacturers do their own testing and they still haven't agreed on a common procedure.  And the Wireless Trade Association, which could take a leadership role, has no plans to present all the information in one place to make it easier for consumers to comparison shop -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: So, Steve, let me get this straight.  Consumers are just going to get a number without a scientific context, or even an industry-wide context to put it in?</p><p>YOUNG: That's right, but we can say that all the phones that are approved range in fashion that the highest radiation is four times as much as the lowest radiation in that whole body of approved phones.</p><p>BAY: Steve Young, thanks -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, thanks, Willow.</p><p>Next on MONEYLINE, a company that embodied the market promise -- and eventually peril -- of Wall Street's Internet frenzy: theglobe.com.  Can the stock pull itself out of the abyss?  We'll ask the new chief executive, Chuck Beck, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Topping tonight's MONEYLINE movers, Mercator Software plunged nearly 36 1/2 points.  That's 58 percent.  Several brokerages downgraded the software maker after it warned late Friday that it would miss second- quarter estimates by four cents a share.  Qualcomm gained 6 3/4 on news that three of its CDMA technology patents were upheld in Japan and Europe, surviving challenges from Nokia, NTT and other companies.</p><p>Handspring jumped more than four.  Piper Jaffrey initiated coverage of the palm competitor with a strong buy rating and a $90 price target.  And American Home Products said today it will use the gene databases of Incyte Genomics and Celera Genomics in its research. A dollar amount was not disclosed, but investors were betting on the biotechs today.  Celera Genomics gained more than 6 1/2.  Incyte jumped more than 5 1/4.  AHP gained nearly two points on the day.</p><p>BAY: One company, though, which won't be trading anytime soon, Workscape.  It withdrew its estimated $115 million initial public offering today.  Workscape, which makes Web-based human resources software, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public in March.</p><p>And there's been an executive shake-up at one company, which has had nothing but trouble since its market debut just over a year ago. The CFO and CEO of drkoop.com, the embattled Internet health care company, have resigned voluntarily.  But they will both continue to serve in a consulting capacity.  And in an SEC filing, drkoop.com said its second-quarter loss could be more than double what analysts had expected.  Shares of the company fell more than 1/2 point today.  The stock has collapsed since drkoop.com made its debut.</p><p>VARNEY: Another Net firm making management news today, at theglobe.com, which named Chuck Peck as CEO after a long search.  He's a veteran of Simon &amp; Schuster, among other companies.  Peck was described today by the company's chairman as an energetic leader. He'll need all the energy he can get to help theglobe.com regain its market glory.  The stock rocketed more than 600 percent on its debut day.  That was back in the fall of 1998, shattering all the IPO records at that time.  These days, theglobe.com is featured in articles like this one in the \"Wall Street Journal,\" as a prime example of a bubble that \"broke records, rules and bank accounts\" -- end quote.</p><p>One look at the stock shows why: it is down a staggering 96 percent from its first-day high.</p><p>Chuck Peck joins us now with more on how he plans to regain Wall Street's confidence -- Chuck, welcome to the program.</p><p>CHARLES PECK, INCOMING CEO, THEGLOBE.COM: Thank you very much.</p><p>VARNEY: We frequently hear the expressed views on this program that a dot.com company that is losing money cannot survive as an independent company.  Can theglobe.com survive as an independent company, do you think?</p><p>PECK: Absolutely.  We've seen in the first quarter of last year -- if you compare it over the first quarter of the year before -- 119 percent growth in sales while the scalability is demonstrated by only 20 percent increase in GNA and product cost.  So\u2026</p><p>VARNEY: You've not been hired then to sell theglobe.com?</p><p>PECK: No, absolutely not.</p><p>VARNEY: You're not up for sale?</p><p>PECK: No.</p><p>VARNEY: You holding talks with anybody for a sale?</p><p>PECK: No.</p><p>VARNEY: What's your strategy then for moving towards profitability?</p><p>PECK: We're going to accelerate the move towards profitability that we're on right now, continuing to increase our advertising -- the number of advertisers that we've grown dramatically.  We're going to continue to outsource for other providers, building their Web site communities, such as sportsline.com, and Deja, and, you know, other people like that.  We'll also extend the games business that we're No. 1 in the country in.</p><p>VARNEY: All right.  Well, when is a profit in sight? I know you cannot give me exact date, but are we talking several quarters or several years?</p><p>PECK: Well, I think we're a little ways out, but we could be seeing profitability next year.</p><p>VARNEY: Previously, you were at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.</p><p>PECK: Correct.</p><p>VARNEY: Sir, that is a long, long way from dot.com land.</p><p>PECK: It sure is.  It is.  And yet, the AICPA itself is coming out with a portal that they intend to take public.  So, we have been working in the dot.com environment and thinking about it for a long time.</p><p>VARNEY: Forgive me for saying it, but, sir, you are well past your 20s.  And we associate dot.com land with youngsters like Stephan Paternot and Todd Krizelman, the founders of theglobe.com.  What can you bring to the table?</p><p>PECK: Oh, I think it's traditional business acumen in terms of marketing and sales that is really going to grow the revenue out of -- into profitability.  I think the expenses have been contained effectively by our CFO and the management staff that we have on board.</p><p>VARNEY: What did your son say when you told him that you were going to be CEO of theglobe.com?</p><p>PECK: Actually, he was quite excited about it, and knew Steph and Todd quite well.</p><p>VARNEY: Forgive me one last question: When you signed on, you going to be paid in cash or stock?</p><p>PECK: No, it's a combination of cash and incentives.</p><p>VARNEY: We are glad to hear it.  Chuck Peck, new CEO of theglobe.com.  We thank you very much for being with us, sir.</p><p>PECK: Thank you.  I appreciate it.</p><p>VARNEY: Good luck.  OK -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, still to come on MONEYLINE, first it was music, now Hollywood is fighting over its flicks: a new high-tech battle over swapping movies on the Internet, when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: He has already shattered all the records for spending in a Senate race, and now Jon Corzine may be able to spend a lot more in his quest for a New Jersey Senate seat.  The former top executive at Goldman Sachs has filed to sell more than 411,000 Goldman shares, and that's nearly 10 percent of his total holdings, currently worth about $42 million.  A campaign spokesman says that the motivation behind Corzine's move is to -- quote -- \"diversify his financial risk.\" Corzine spent more than $36 million during the primary, winning the Democratic nomination.  Goldman Sachs stock closed off more than 3 points today at 101 1/8.</p><p>BAY: The battle over downloadable music took a back seat to a different Web war today.  Fearful of another Napster, Hollywood is trying to stop distribution of a software program that helps turn DVD movies into files that can be swapped.  The dispute moved to U.S. District Court in Manhattan today.</p><p>Bruce Francis has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Meet Hollywood's newest bogey man.  Sixteen-year-old Jon Johamsen wrote software that cracks the code that encrypts DVDs.  The Norwegian teen says he did it so that he could watch movies on his Linux-based PC.</p><p>JON JOHAMSEN, SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: We wanted to add DVD support, playback support to unsupported operating systems.  At that time, only Microsoft Windows could play DVDs.</p><p>FRANCIS: But when Internet hacker journal \"2600\" posted the software, Hollywood studios, including the entertainment division of Time Warner, the parent of CNN, sued the publisher.  The goal: to avoid another Napster, which allows users to swap free music.</p><p>LEON GOLD, PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY: That's exactly one of the main things that we're worried about, because there are already up on the Internet file-swapping operations asking for people to swap movies, and that has already started and that will grow pretty quickly.</p><p>PROTESTERS (shouting): Save free speech!</p><p>FRANCIS: But the man behind \"2600\" says he has a right to publish the code.</p><p>EMMANUEL GOLDSTEIN, EDITOR, \"2600\" MAGAZINE: The right to publish is what we exist for.  So when someone comes up to you and says, you don't have the right to publish this, you don't have the right to talk about this, you don't have the right to figure this out, that's something that all publishers feel very deeply.</p><p>FRANCIS: While the case invites comparison to the suit against Napster, it's far more difficult to get a DVD movie ready to swap.  To Napsterize a movie you first have to obtain a copy of Jon Johamsen's DECSS software.  You'll also need other programs, including Leech FTP 207 and MIRC 3.71.</p><p>Then, to get the file ready to swap, you have to convert it to another format called DIVX.  You do that by stripping out the video signal, then the audio signal, and then resynchronize the sound and image.  Point, click, and grab the popcorn, it's not.</p><p>(on camera): The first witness in the case, a Carnegie-Mellon University professor who, at the request of the film studios, tried to copy a movie from DVD and get it ready to swap over the Internet.  It took him and his assistant some 20 hours.</p><p>At U.S. District Court, Bruce Francis, CNN Financial News, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: And up next, \"Ahead of the Curve,\" some of what you need to know tonight before those markets open up again tomorrow.</p><p>You're watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Checking some of what could make news on Wall Street tomorrow, as we mentioned, second quarter earnings season heats up in earnest with Dow components Honeywell and Philip Morris expected to report a 12-percent profit jump over last year.  General Motors is forecasted to post earnings of $2.80 a share.  Tech heavyweights Microsoft and Intel are also on tap to report tomorrow.  Investors expect Intel profits to nearly double.  Also watch for results from Apple Computer.</p><p>On the economic front, the consumer price index for June is due out.  Economists are forecasting a rise of .4 percent and expect the core rate, which excludes food and energy, to edge up .2 percent.</p><p>To stay a step ahead of the markets, tune into \"AHEAD OF THE CURVE\" every day at 5:00 a.m. Eastern on CNN.</p><p>VARNEY: And finally tonight, economic advice from the \"Seven Million Dollar Man,\" at least that's what the publishing world is calling Jack Welch, the chief executive superstar of General Electric, who last week landed a record $7.1 million to chronicle his life and career.</p><p>This weekend, he gave \"New York Times\" columnist Maureen Dowd a sneak preview of some topics he might cover, even weighing in on the controversial debate over whether there is a new economy.  Welch's answer? \"There's no new economy.  It's the same old economy with new technology.\" Not such a surprise considering that Welch has taken the oldest company on the Dow and souped up its business with Internet ventures.</p><p>Now, tomorrow on MONEYLINE, another legendary executive with a similar take on the new economy: an in-depth \"Headliner\" profile of Andy Grove, that on Intel's 32nd birthday.</p><p>BAY: That is MONEYLINE for this Monday.

I'm Willow Bay in Los Angeles.</p><p>VARNEY: Hello Willow, and hello everyone.  I'm Stuart Varney in New York.</p><p>Our top story tonight: the Cisco skid on Wall Street.  The Nasdaq took a wild ride after the networking giant, Cisco Systems, shocked investors last night with a rare profit letdown.  Cisco's stock tumbled, wiping out more than $30 billion worth of market value.  The Nasdaq plunged well over a hundred points at its low; it recovered most of those losses, then dipped again ending down 56 points at 2,607.</p><p>The Dow took its own ride, pushing back above 11,000 once again, only to end down 11 points at 10,946.  The S&amp;P fell 11 points, to close just under 1,341.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, as you noted, the Nasdaq had cut some of its losses by day's end and so did Cisco.  But it wasn't enough to prevent the stock from closing at an 18-month low, on volume that was one of the biggest ever for any U.S. stock, more than 280 million shares traded. Cisco shares are now trading at levels not seen since the summer of '99.</p><p>As Allan Chernoff reports, Cisco created a storm that battered tech stocks across the spectrum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Cisco cyclone caught nearly all tech stocks and shredded their prices.  The storm so powerful because few technology companies are as highly regarded and influential as Cisco Systems.  So, when Cisco catches a cold it's contagious.</p><p>MICHAEL PALAZZI, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: Cisco has a lot of businesses that touch a lot of different sectors in the technology area.  And the feeling is now that at Cisco, has had bad performance in the past quarter and it doesn't look good in the next couple of quarters, what does that tell you about the sector?</p><p>CHERNOFF: Cisco fell to 31 1/16.  Network Appliance dropped to a new 52-week low as other competitors sank in sympathy.</p><p>The data networking gear that Cisco builds is packed with components.  Cisco warned its inventories are heavy, bad news for suppliers like Vitesse Semiconductor, which gets about 10 percent business from Cisco.  Applied Micro Circuits dependent on Cisco for 15 percent of sales; and PMC-Sierra, relying on Cisco for 30 percent of sales by some industry estimates.</p><p>JIM WAGGONER, SANDS BROTHERS &amp; COMPANY: A lot of the companies that've been standing by, gearing up production, maintaining production to supply Cisco, will have to slow down.</p><p>CHERNOFF: A slow down looms for companies making components for high speed networking data connections, like Brocade, QLogic, and Emulex.  And for makers of programmable logic devices, like Lattice, Altera, Actel, and Xilinx.</p><p>Cisco's declining growth rate carries psychological weight as well.  It raises concerns that the best days of the technology boom may be past, a prospect some traders fear Wall Street may not have fully discounted.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: An illustration of Cisco's fall from grace today. Yesterday, Cisco was the second most important stock on the Nasdaq, accounting for 6.6 percent of the price-weighted index.  Today, Cisco has fallen to number 3, behind Microsoft and Intel.  Cisco's stock accounts for 5.9 percent of the composite right now -- Willow</p><p>BAY: Allan, and boy, what a storm it caused.  Allan Chernoff, thanks.</p><p>We'll have more on the tech outlook later in the broadcast, with Brian Finnerty, head of Nasdaq stock trading at CE Unterberg Towbin. VARNEY: An Indiana man accused of firing a handgun outside the White House is in stable condition tonight, more about that now from Wolf Blitzer, in Washington.  Wolf?</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks, Stuart.  Federal prosecutors say they'll decide by tomorrow how to charge Robert Pickett.  He's the Indiana tax accountant who allegedly opened fire outside the White House today.  Just before noon, reports of a man with a pistol near the south lawn sent Secret Service agents racing to cover the grounds. Fot the details on what happened, our John King is standing by now at the White House -- John.</p><p>JOHN KING, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, that scene you saw inside the White House compound -- agents rushing around the compound to make sure there was no intruder on the grounds, triggered by a very simple but startling alert they heard over the radio system.  Shots fired outside the White House gate; that was at 11:22 a.m. this morning.</p><p>You see here the scene outside, uniformed Secret Service officers -- it was they who responded to the scene and after ten minutes of urging the man to drop his handgun and surrender, one uniformed Secrets Service officer shot him in the knee.  There you see the shooting site outside the south perimeter of the White House.  The compound some distance away, but, of course, extraordinary steps taken inside the compound as well, just to guarantee the president security.</p><p>President Bush was in the building at the time -- he was in the White House residence exercising.  Vice President Cheney was in his office in the West Wing.  Both were immediately told that there was indeed a security incident near the campus, but the White House says, both just kept about their business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: During this time, the president was in the residence, was never in any danger; the vice president was working in his West Wing office, also was never in any danger at any point.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Now, the man in custody tonight -- the investigation just beginning, we're told by sources Secret Service officials did have a brief conversation with Mr. Pickett during the ambulance ride to a hospital here in Washington.  They of course want to interview him again as they try to figure out why he was just outside the White House brandishing a handgun, but they say, at no point, did he try to get on to the White House grounds and during that police scene around him, that he was suicidal, mentioning that he wanted to kill himself -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: John King at the White House, thank you very much.</p><p>Pickett was rushed to George Washington University Hospital, where doctors are operating on his knee.  He's also undergoing psychiatric evaluation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. YOLANDA HAYWOOD, GW UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: It is part of a standard evaluation under these circumstances.</p><p>QUESTION: What circumstances?</p><p>HAYWOOD: The circumstances of someone who sustained a gunshot wound outside the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: Doctors say Pickett was unusually calm for someone with such a severe wound, and I'll have much more on this story and the rest of the day's news on \"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS,\" that's 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 on the west coast -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Wolf, thanks.  We'll see you then.</p><p>The incident at the White House happened shortly after President Bush hosted another event, pushing his $1.6 trillion tax cutting plan. Mr.  Bush surrounded himself on the south lawn with families that he met on the campaign trail, \"real live Americans, \" as he put it, who would benefit from his version of tax relief.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When we have surpluses, we must remember who pay the bills in America.  And it's these folks who pay the bills in the country.  And they deserve relief, and so I call upon Congress.  When they think about tax relief, to think about the members of our tax family who represent all people of our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAY: Many Democrats insist that average Americans won't be the big winners under the Bush plan, but wealthy Americans will be.  The tax fight will begin in earnest tomorrow when the president is expected to send his proposal to Congress.</p><p>VARNEY: A key player who'll help Mr. Bush lead that fight: Paul O'Neill.  Next up on MONEYLINE, a candid, one-on-one talk with the new treasury secretary: just how bad is the economy?  His outlook on that and much more.</p><p>Plus, DaimlerChrysler confirms what everyone feared: that the year 2000 was one big washout in terms of profits.  And, will Murdoch get his hands on a media industry jewel?  The latest on the story you heard here first last night: the race to grab Direct TV.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: President Bush all week has been selling Main Street on his tax cutting plan.  And today, his treasury secretary Paul O'Neill took on Wall Street, making the rounds in Manhattan.  The former head of Alcoa toured J.P. Morgan after having breakfast with top Wall Street executives, investment bankers and fund managers.</p><p>Earlier, I sat down with the treasury secretary and began by asking him if the Bush administration was 100 percent behind making the proposed tax cut retroactive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL O'NEILL, TREASURY SECRETARY: Absolutely.  The president has said that we should have changes in the marginal rate structure for every tax paid in America, and the other day when he articulated exactly what he wanted to be in that package, he said he thought it made sense to make it retroactive to the first of January, 2001, so you bet, we are going to do everything we can, we are going to mount every argument that we know how to mount, to cause this policy to be implemented, hopefully very quickly.</p><p>VARNEY: Are we in recession now, as some economists say?</p><p>O'NEILL: No</p><p>VARNEY: We're not?  Zero growth like Mr. Greenspan says?</p><p>O'NEILL: Well, I take my economic advice in a certain way from Mr.  Greenspan, and if he says the growth rate is about zero, I don't think there is a basis for saying it is worse than that at the moment; I don't see any data that convinces me it is worse than zero or maybe even .5 percent real growth in the economy right now.</p><p>VARNEY: Is the economy getting worse?  Are we sliding still?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think the evidence is really very conflicting at the moment.  We are not operating at the level we have been for the last four or five years, but it doesn't seem to be eroding further and there are even some signs -- conflicting signs, I would say -- a narrow range but not an acceptable rate of real growth.</p><p>VARNEY: In Mexico, in Asia, and in Russia, when those economies were in collapse or near collapsing, America responded with what amounted to a large bailout and that became essentially the policy of America to deal with this kind of situation for many, many years.  Is that policy going to change?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think it is important that we not accept the idea that we are the world's fireman.  Now, I think it is not particularly brilliant for either the U.S. or the international financial institutions to bail out people who dug their own ditch.  I do think it makes sense to help people who are victims of circumstances beyond their control, but I would rather not be a party to a process that is focused on heroic firefighting efforts as contrasted from a long- headed collection of information and data and policy initiative that avoids the need to be heroic firefighters.</p><p>VARNEY: So you see, stepping in before the collapse really starts.</p><p>O'NEILL: Absolutely. VARNEY: Take some action, either advisory or financial, in advance of the catastrophe happening; that's your policy?</p><p>O'NEILL: I think that is a fair characterization, but it also seems to me we need to be careful about not becoming the world's meddlers -- that is to say interfering in the issues of sovereign states, but to the degree that sovereign states expect us and the international institutions to be there in the event that they are a victim of circumstance beyond their control, then they need to be working on these underlying problems, because I really don't think it makes sense for we or the rest of the world with financial means, to save people from themselves when they have effectively deliberately caused their financial system to fall in to a state of disarray.</p><p>VARNEY: With Japan, what will you offer, advice, expertise, maybe threats, maybe jaw-boning, how would you characterize the economic relationship you want to establish with Japan?</p><p>O'NEILL: Over time, I think we need to develop a process that helps Japan to realize the full economic potential they have for the benefit of their people.  First of all, I think it is really important if you were to put yourself in the position of the people of the leadership in Japan or any other country you want to name, and then say to yourself, if you were in that position, how would you like it to have Americans, or anyone else for that matter, giving you unsolicited advice about how to run your society.</p><p>You would probably say thank you very much, why don't you go home, and stop bothering us.  So if you look at it from their point of view, I think they don't need gratuitous advice from us, but they need -- they may need ideas and help from us, and I think we need to be saying to them, we assume that you would like for your society to advance at a faster rate than what you have been doing and we may have some ideas, but what we would like to know is how can we be helpful to you in moving up to that higher rate of real growth, rather than giving them lectures about how we would do it.</p><p>VARNEY: You are not from Wall Street.  You don't really have a trader's background\u2026</p><p>O'NEILL: Yes, that's true.</p><p>VARNEY: ...but you need the support of Wall Street.  Do you think it is a disadvantage, coming in as the new treasury secretary as an outsider to the markets and Wall Street?</p><p>O'NEILL: I tell you, in some ways, I am really amused by the drum beat of, well, you are not from Wall Street and you don't know anything about what Wall Street does.  This morning, I had breakfast here in New York with, what some would say is probably, 25 of the brightest lights on Wall Street, many of whom I know and have worked with for more than 30 years.</p><p>And I think they would tell you I am from Wall Street, in spite of the media drum beat, I am not from Wall Street, most of my friends from Wall Street would say, of course you are from Wall Street. VARNEY: Priority number one, when you return to Washington and you sit at your desk in the Treasury Building; priority number one is a tax cut?</p><p>O'NEILL: Right.</p><p>VARNEY: Mr. Secretary, thank you very much, indeed, for joining us on MONEYLINE.  Thank you very much.</p><p>O'NEILL: My pleasure.  Thank you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: It may be a good thing Mr. O'neill was in New York today.  About 1,000 people were evacuated from the Treasury Department this afternoon, after fumes made some workers ill.  The fumes were said to have smelled like diesel fuel and firefighters believe there was the possibility of combustion.  No word yet on the source of those fumes.</p><p>Up ahead, some of the day's other stories today making headlines, including more tough news from DaimlerChrysler, and the details on one of the largest IPO's in U.S. history.  Willow and I will be back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's MONEYLINE profile, Michael Smith, chairman and CEO of Hughes Electronics, reportedly on the verge of a multi billion dollar deal.  The former Vietnam vet was part of the GM team that acquired Hughes Electronics in 1995.  Two years later, he was named to the top post, replacing Michael Armstrong, who left for AT&amp;T.</p><p>His brother?  None other than John Smith, chairman of Hughes' parent, GM.  Smith has always tried to keep a low profile, saying:</p><p>\"I've always distinguished between rain makers and doers.  A lot of people make headlines, but they don't really achieve anything.\"</p><p>Now, Wall Street is waiting for him to turn today's headlines into a real deal.  More on this story on MONEYLINE, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Now for an update on that story we brought you about first last night, reports that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is working on buying Hughes Electronics to form a $70 billion satellite network. The companies are not offering any comment today, but Wall Street seemed to want a better deal for Hughes shareholders; the stock slipped almost 3, but News Corp was up more than 1.</p><p>Now, Murdoch's company was also out with profits today, breezing past market forecasts, earning $270 million, leading the way, a strong showing at Fox Entertainment, which benefited from the film release of \"Cast Away\" and DVD sales of last summer's \"X-men.\" Fox stock, which is controlled by News Corp, edged up fractionally today, it was also out with better-than-expected earnings.</p><p>VARNEY: DaimlerChrysler surprised investors today, by releasing results early, but the weak numbers were not a surprise.  The auto maker's preliminary results show full-year net profit sank 44 percent -- it still made $3.3 billion, profits were down 44 percent; with sales climbing 8 percent for the year.</p><p>DaimlerChrysler didn't break out fourth quarter results, but the numbers suggest the company lost about $260 million for the quarter, that would be the first loss for the combined company. DaimlerChrysler gained today, but it's down 24 percent over the past 52-weeks.  Just last month, it's Chrysler units said it would cut 26,000 jobs; that's 20 percent of its work force.</p><p>BAY: In tonight's tech watch, Lucent Technologies latest Initial Public Offering.  It plans to spin off its Agere unit, which makes optical components and chips for communication networks.  In a securities and exchange filing, the company said it plans to sell 370 million shares at $15 to $20 apiece.  The IPO is being underwritten by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and could raise as much as $7.4 billion, making it the second largest IPO in U.S. history, right behind AT&amp;T's Wireless spin-off last year.</p><p>Lucent shares, which have plunged over the past year, continued their slide today, falling 85 cents on the day, to close just over $17.  Lucent's other spin-off, Avaya, hasn't fared much better -- it fell more than a $1 today to close at: $16.46.  It makes communication systems and software.</p><p>VARNEY: All right Willow, here's what we have for you coming up: The Fed chief gets a major signal on the pace of the economy.  Will the strength of productivity stay the Fed's hand on cutting interest rates?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: We've been hearing a drum beat of bad news about the economy.  Well, today we finally got some good news.  Productivity, one of the linchpins of the economy's record expansion, rose more than expected last quarter.  But will this good news throw the Fed off its aggressive rate-cutting campaign?</p><p>Lisa Leiter reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISA LEITER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): U.S. workers continued to pick up their productivity in the final months of 2000, but at a slower pace than in the previous quarter.  Output rose at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter, down from three. For the entire year it was up 4.3 percent, the fastest pace since 1983. CARL TANNENBAUM, LASALLE NATIONAL BANK: The fact that we were able to get a 2.5 percent improvement during a quarter where growth was slow indicates that the productivity improvement that we've seen recently is not a passing fad, but something that is long-lasting.</p><p>LEITER: Productivity measures what workers produce per hour, and it typically cools when the economy does, but businesses have responded quickly to a swift drop in consumer demand.</p><p>VINCE BOBERSKI, DAIN RAUSCHER: Firms have been much faster than they have been in the past, at cutting back on hours and employees.</p><p>LEITER: But since unemployment is still relatively low, companies must offer higher salaries to hold onto quality workers. Labor costs rose more than expected last quarter, by an annual rate of 4.1 percent, the biggest jump in a year and a half.  While labor costs for all of 2000 barely budged, some economists worry that rising wages could spark inflation, as companies try to pass along extra costs to consumers.  But others say businesses do not have much pricing power, and that those costs will instead cut into profits.</p><p>JOHN LIPSKY, JP MORGAN: Now we're going to see rising unit labor costs squeeze on profit margins.  And let's see what happens to corporate investment.  This is going to be a critical issue.</p><p>LEITER: Some Fed watchers say the productivity report should not derail the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting campaign.  Even Alan Greenspan said a few weeks ago, productivity gains seem to be more than just temporary.</p><p>Lisa Leiter, CNN Financial News, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Those stronger than expected productivity numbers boosted the bond market early on, as did the slide in tech stocks.  But a big sale of 10-year notes sparked oversupply concerns, dragging on treasuries by day's end.  The ten-year note inched up a tick, the yield at 5.19 percent.  The 30-year, though, fell more than half a point.  The yield there at 5.53.</p><p>VARNEY: Up next, we head out to the New York Stock Exchange, and we'll check in with Terry Keenan, who talked to one of Wall Street's most influential market predictors -- Terry.</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Stuart, I spoke with Abby Joseph Cohen earlier today, and I'll tell you why she thinks the S&amp;P 500 will rally 23 percent by years end.  MONEYLINE will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: The MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR continues.  Here again, Willow Bay in Los Angeles and Stuart Varney in New York.</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines, an alleged gunman shot outside the White House remains in a Washington hospital, undergoing knee surgery and psychological evaluations.</p><p>And the Nasdaq gets hammered by an earnings shocker from Cisco that sends tech stocks into a tailspin.</p><p>Plus, one day before President Bush sends his tax cut plan to Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill tells MONEYLINE the president is not only determined to make that cut happen, but also to make it retroactive.</p><p>VARNEY: But first, more on our top story of the night: The Nasdaq takes a heavy hit from a new economy titan.  Cisco Systems, which last night delivered its first earnings disappointment in more than six years.</p><p>Investor reaction was fast and furious, sucking the wind out of all tech stocks, just about.  The Nasdaq dropped heavily, plunging as much as 110 points, before the index battled back, recouping much of its loss to finish 56 points lower, at 2,607.  The volume strong at more than 2 billion shares.</p><p>Blue chips started out on an up-trend, but lost momentum after midday, slipping then recovering to close off nearly 11 points at 10,946.  More than a billion shares changed hands on the Big Board today.  Now check some of the top movers: Cisco, down almost 5, JDS Uniphase off more than 3 1/2, and Juniper Networks down nearly 8.</p><p>Applied Micro Circuits slumped 5, but Microsoft gained more than 2 points.</p><p>Now on the Big Board, Merck gave back about 2 1/2, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was down 4 3/4, and EMC slipped $4.61.</p><p>Even Corning was down: It lost 3 1/4.  But IBM bucked that trend; it gained $2.85.</p><p>But it was that Cisco surprise that cast a long shadow across Wall Street today.  Terry Keenan took a look behind the numbers at the humbling of a tech titan -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, Stuart.</p><p>Well, if ever there was a market darling and bellwether over the last couple of years, it was Cisco.  A lot of investors didn't really even know what the company did.  But they did know one thing: It went up, consistently, for the first 10 years of its life as a public company -- until last March when the stock peaked at $82 a share.</p><p>Since then, $345 billion in market value has been wiped out, and today, with many analysts cutting their growth forecasts on Cisco to the 20 to 30 percent growth range, another 34 billion in market value was wiped out.</p><p>John Roek (ph), the technical analyst at Arnholder-Schroeder (ph) thinks there could be more downside risk.  Although he sees a lot of support at the $30 a share range, he knows that there was a lot of technical support for Cisco at $60 a share.  Remember when we used to talk about that.</p><p>The next stop lower, according to Roek, could be $20 a share.</p><p>It's an incredible fall from grace for a company that last spring was the most valuable stock on Earth, worth more than $1/2 trillion. Today, GE has reclaimed its position at the top of the most-valuable list, followed far behind by Microsoft, which has moved back up to No. 2.  Exxon-Mobil, Pfizer and Citigroup rounding out the top five.</p><p>Wal-Mart and Intel are ahead of Cisco in terms of market value. It is now in the No. 8 position followed by BP Amoco and Merck.</p><p>Now this afternoon I spoke with Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, and despite the Cisco carnage, she says she's sticking by her very bullish targets on the market, predicting a 23 percent rise in the S&amp;P 500 by the end of the year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABBY JOSEPH COHEN, GOLDMAN SACHS: The best opportunities we think can be found in a whole variety of sectors, including some of those that are economically sensitive.  Our analysts advised our clients to get out of retailing stocks nine months ago.  We're suggesting they get back in.  We also are feeling much more comfortable about technology.</p><p>In March of 2000, we were suggesting a notable underweight.  And over the past couple of months, we've moved back to an overweighted position in technology, and that's within the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEENAN: OK, well, Cohen says she likes the high-quality tech names, especially the semiconductor stocks that are usually among the first to rally in an economic upturn.</p><p>So the message from Goldman Sachs: Stay invested, go with economically sensitive stocks, not the defensive ones -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Terry, I don't want to be picky, but that's an awfully precise forecast, isn't it?  The S&amp;P will go up 23 percent this year.</p><p>KEENAN: Yes, she has a target, I believe it's 1,650 on the S&amp;P 500, so you do the math and you come to that number.  It's very aggressive.  And of course, we should note that Ms. Cohen also had a 12,500 forecast on the Dow for the end of last year and certainly missed the mark by a long shot.</p><p>VARNEY: Just like our own Myron Kandel.  OK, Terry Keenan\u2026</p><p>KEENAN: The 12,000 camp, yes\u2026</p><p>VARNEY: \u2026 thank you very much.  Terry Keenan, thanks a lot.</p><p>Let's get more market news now.  Here's Willow.</p><p>BAY: All right, thanks, Stuart.</p><p>The recent action in the Nasdaq has chipped away at what had been respectable gains this year.  At its high, the Nasdaq was up nearly 16 percent year-to-date.  But by now, those gains have been trimmed to about 5 1/2 percent.  This after a 39 percent drop in 2000.</p><p>For more on whether the index can regain its momentum, we're joined by Brian Finnerty, head of Nasdaq stock trading at CE Unterberg Towbin.</p><p>Brian, good to see you.</p><p>BRIAN FINNERTY, CE UNTERBERG TOWBIN: Hi, Willow, good to see you.</p><p>BAY: So from where you it, how bad is the Cisco news, and does it spell more trouble for techs?</p><p>FINNERTY: The news was bad, Willow, and today I've got to tell you, even though John Chambers, the CEO at Cisco, had been warning us even as recently as last week, he said the last couple of months were very challenging. I guess the Street didn't get it.  I guess we dummies sat there and still felt Cisco was going to beat the numbers like they always do.</p><p>Well, they didn't, and they disappointed pretty badly.  And I think what happened was a reaction that was quick and swift, but it sort of stopped.  And it feels like it bottomed out, and the bounce- back later in the day was very encouraging to perennial bulls, such as myself.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I really feel -- I felt good about it, like maybe the stock has sold out and maybe the group of tech stocks are sold out by the way things acted.</p><p>WILLOW: Right, but Brian, we just heard Terry report that some people think, when you look at the technicals, that the next level of support for Cisco is at 20.  Does that worry you?</p><p>FINNERTY: Well, it does, but all these technical levels, as Terry said earlier, also have all been broken.  We broke 60 on Cisco. We broke 50, you know.  And so all these technical levels are broken. A lot of big tech names have all broken their 200-day moving averages on the downside -- the averages have.</p><p>We're in sort of an area where we've made a nice comeback, we've given back some of the gains.  But you know, I think, Willow, we're going to make higher lows and then higher highs again on the way up.</p><p>BAY: A month ago you said you thought the progress would be in the upward direction, but that it would certainly be jagged.  You still think now that that's going to be the case?</p><p>FINNERTY: I do feel that way, and I feel we probably got a little bit ahead of ourselves in January, when we were up 12 percent for the month.  That was a nice gain really based on nothing, just a hope that the Fed would bail us out.  So we pulled back a little bit.</p><p>But you know, the negative news on Cisco, the bulls, such as myself, can view it as this sort of increases the odds that the Fed might give us another rate cut prior to the next meeting on March the 20th.  Because Cisco's a proxy for the whole tech sector, and things were ugly.  So -- and they may have to move faster than, you know, people have thought.</p><p>BAY: What does that mean, Brian, then for investors?  Should they wade into the tech sector?  If so, you know, where would you suggest they put some money?</p><p>FINNERTY: You know, I do agree with Abby Joseph Cohen on what she said about semiconductor stocks.  They are very economically sensitive, and rate cuts like that will boost stocks like that right away.  The telecom stocks will need a little bit more, but I think we're going to get them in terms of rate cuts, because they rely heavily on -- more heavily on debt than do the semiconductor stocks.</p><p>BAY: So give me some -- if you would, give me some semi names that you like?</p><p>FINNERTY: Well, I could stick with the basics.  You could take Intel.  You would take an equipment maker like Applied Materials. Those are stocks, the safe plays that are probably sold out right now. Maybe a Texas Instruments.</p><p>If you want to get a little more bang for your buck, so to speak, but you have to have a strong stomach, you can go with the AMCCs -- Applied Micro Circuits, PMC-Sierra and those kinds of stocks.</p><p>BAY: Brian, thank you for giving us a little bang for our buck. As always, we appreciate it.</p><p>FINNERTY: My pleasure, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Coming up next on MONEYLINE, a trade ruling orders the United States to open its borders to Mexican truckers, but will President Bush put out the welcome mat?</p><p>And an aggressive plan from Kmart to take on Wal-Mart.  Is a food fight on the horizon?</p><p>Stuart and I'll be back in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: President Bush is facing his first difficult trade issue as president.  A panel has ruled the U.S. must open its border to Mexican trucks, or face penalties.  Mr. Bush must now figure out how to comply with the ruling, calm angry union workers, and ensure safety on U.S. roads.  Fred Katayama has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mexican trucks have been banned from the U.S. highway, despite the letter of the law as laid down by the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Today, President Bush suggested, the U.S. should remedy the situation, despite union concerns about the safety of Mexican trucks on U.S. roads.</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president believes we can have both.  We can have safe standards for trucks that enter this country, and free trade with Mexico.</p><p>KATAYAMA: For five years, President Clinton had opted to block free entry to Mexican trucks, and pay compensation instead, after facing pressure from the Teamsters Union.  Mexico challenged the ban in 1998, and yesterday, an arbitration panel ruled that the U.S. ban violates NAFTA.  The Teamsters blasted the ruling, saying Mexican trucks will imperil public safety.</p><p>JAMES P. HOFFA, TEAMSTERS PRESIDENT: Only 1 percent of the trucks are checked at the border.  Let's keep the border closed and let's protect the American driving public.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The transportation department notes 35 percent of Mexican trucks entering the United States were placed out of service for safety violations.  And the consumer watchdog group, Public Citizen, contends the United States lacks inspectors to check every Mexican truck.  But backers of the ruling say safety is not an issue, since the decision allows the U.S. to require Mexican companies meet U.S. Safety and Labor standards.</p><p>FRANK VARGO, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS: The United States has been acting in a protectionist manner.  And Mexico, if we do not implement the decision, Mexico is perfectly free to put on retaliatory tariffs against U.S. goods and shut U.S. goods out of the Mexican market.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The Teamsters also say their members' jobs are at stake, since they say, Mexican drivers earn $7 a day while U.S. union drivers earn $19 an hour.  All this comes just nine days before Mr. Bush meets Mexican President Vicente Fox.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATAYAMA: The Teamsters say they'll hold a protest rally that same day in Texas, and several Congressmen are requesting a hearing to examine any damages posed by the ruling.  I'm Fred Katayama reporting live from Capitol Hill.  Back to you, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Fred.  In other corporate news tonight, a strong warning from the FDA to Pfizer and Pharmacia, who co-market the popular arthritis drug \"Celebrex.\" For the fourth time in about a year, the FDA has accused the drug companies of \"false and misleading\" marketing.  Celebrex is currently in a sales battle with Merck's Vioxx for dominance in the arthritis market.</p><p>Verizon Communications is cutting about 10,000 positions this year, but widespread layoffs are not planned.  The local phone company will cut about 6,000 jobs through attrition; and cut the other 4,000 by slashing overtime and the use of contractors.</p><p>A stellar year for Anheuser-Busch.  The world's largest brewer shipped a record 105 million barrels of beer and posted its ninth consecutive year of double digit growth.  Today, the company reported fourth quarter earnings of $209 million, or 23 cents a share. Anheuser-Busch brews Budweiser, Michelob, and also operates theme parks.  Over the past 52 weeks, shares have climbed 27 percent.  Today it gained 1 1/2 to close above $42 a share -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: A big deal for Kmart today.  It's chosen Dallas-based Fleming as its sole grocery supplier.  Worth $45 billion over 10 years, the deal promises to boost Kmart food sales to the level of its arch-rival, discount dynamo, Wal-Mart.</p><p>In an interesting twist, as part of the deal, investor Ron Burkle (ph), notorious for grocery acquisitions, will buy 8.7 percent of Fleming.  Expect to hear more from Mr. Burkle.  He recently took a stake in Kmart itself, prompting talk of an eventual takeover.  For now, though, mum's still the word.  Checking the stocks today: Fleming surged at $7.62, Kmart inched up just a fraction.</p><p>BAY: Checking some more of today's movers: Microstrategy, the maverick software maker, lost nearly 3 1/2, despite posting a narrower-than-expected loss.  It said 2001 sales will fall significantly short of forecasts.  CEO Michael Saylor also disclosed he will sell 14 percent of his shares over the next two years, in part, to fund his online university.</p><p>Online portal CNet fell 6 percent.  Revenues fell short of estimates and it slashed 2001 projections.  CNet's results included a nearly $400 million charge due to its stake in NBC Internet.  But Pacificare surged on news of a surprise to the upside.  The California-based HMO posted profits 32 cents above estimates.  Other strong health care earnings: diabetes management firm, Minimed gained more than 3, after outpacing Wall Street by a penny.</p><p>And in tonight's sector focus: California power suppliers back in the headlines, again.  Today, Calpine Energy agreed to supply power to California over the next 10 years, for a fixed price of $4.6 billion. California Governor Gray Davis dubbed the deal a \"critical first step\" to a power solution.  He hopes to broker deals with other major suppliers imminently.  The stocks enjoyed another day of gains. Calpine climbed nearly 2 1/2.  AES, Reliant, Williams, and Dynegy all added more than one.</p><p>VARNEY: Coming up, is it pay back time for day trading guru? The rise and fall of Tokyo Joe in his own words, next on MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Focus,\" a player who rode Wall Street's Bull Run to the top. Day trading sensation Tokyo Joe.  The onetime Manhattan burrito baron has been accused of bilking the Internet followers who flocked to his site in the late 1990s.  But as Steve Young reports, he may have just netted himself a deal, with regulators hot on his trail.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a settlement with a former New York City burrito vendor, Yun Soo Oh Park, called Tokyo Joe on the Web.</p><p>The commission says he was dishing up bull.  Turning his Web site into a cash cow by using the Internet the pump and dump stocks.  He gained worldwide attention.  Shown here on Italian TV, he is accused of the SEC of both scalping and touting.  Telling his Web visitors to buy stocks he already owned, then profiting by selling as they bid up the price.  And saying stocks were a buy, without disclosing he was paid to make those recommendations.</p><p>A source with knowledge of the case tells MONEYLINE, the SEC staff is recommending the commission approve a settlement, requiring Tokyo Joe to cough up $750,000 in trading profit.  It is a unique fraud case, because Tokyo Joe, who had no securities industry experience, charged people up to $300 to be among the first to get his stock recommendations.</p><p>JAY STRUM, KAYE, SCHOLER: Here is a man who is presuming to give investment advice, and therefore, label him an investment adviser, but who is not complying with the law that's applicable to investment advisers.  You want to do, you have to comply.  He didn't comply, they chased him, and now, the public is aware of it.</p><p>YOUNG: Tokyo Joe wouldn't go on camera, but told MONEYLINE:</p><p>\"I came in like a cowboy in the wild, wild west.  There weren't any rules.  The rules were changing in the new economy.  I've learned my lesson.\"</p><p>Tokyo Joe, he calls himself Joe Park, says 2 years ago, he put a disclosure on his Web site that he trades in the stocks he recommends.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: His lawyer denies Tokyo Joe acted as an investment adviser as defined by the law, and claims that in any case Tokyo Joe's Web droppings were constitutionally protected free speech.  Tokyo Joe will get to keep what even the SEC is referring to not as investment adviser, but subscription fees.  That is something north of a million bucks -- Willow</p><p>BAY: And Steve, besides the subscription fees, he keeps to keep more money?</p><p>YOUNG: Yes.  Lots of trades some time after 1998 -- we don't have the final tally, but it could be quite substantial.</p><p>BAY: Steve Young reporting.  Thanks Steve.</p><p>VARNEY: Coming up, the freedom of the press and the training of journalists.  We'll hear from Myron Kandel on Al Gore's visit to Columbia Journalism School.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Dana Giachetto, who has been found guilty of fraud -- he was the money manager to Stars if you may remember -- just been sentenced to 57 months in jail.</p><p>Now, earlier this week, former vice president Al Gore went to work as a lecturer in journalism at Columbia Journalism School.  The press was not allowed in and the students were not allowed to report what he said.  Columbia happens to be the alma mater of our own Myron Kandel, and he takes issue with at least some of these restrictions. What's the problem?</p><p>MYRON KANDEL, CNNFN FINANCIAL EDITOR: Well, Stuart, let me say on the market, I'm happy to be with Abby Cohen.  Get that out of the way.  And also, that I have been teaching at Columbia Journalism. Putting that aside, I think Columbia was right in not inviting the press into this class.  This is a class, not a public appearance by the vice president.  And even all the students in the school -- there was not enough room for them.  They will space them in to other classes.</p><p>I've used this forum as an effort to get media access to lots of places, including annual meetings, and we've succeeded by and large. This case, I think Columbia was right in not inviting the press, but I think they were wrong in discouraging the students from writing about it or talking to the media.  I think these are all aspiring journalists.  They should be encouraged.  You know what?  Gore shouldn't have said anything that he didn't want in print.</p><p>VARNEY: Nobody would go and be a lecturer and let their hair down or say what they think, if they will be quoted all over the place; You wouldn't get them to come to the university in the first place.</p><p>KANDEL: I think you would.  I've lectured for many weeks, and there's nothing I've said I would have minded if it appeared in the press.  They wouldn't have been interested, but that's another matter.</p><p>VARNEY: That's another story.  Myron Kandel.</p><p>Up next, \"Ahead of the Curve\" -- some of what you need to know tonight before those markets open tomorrow.  Willow and I will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Taking a look at some of what could move the markets tomorrow: after days of lobbying for support, President Bush will send his $1.6 trillion tax-cut proposal to Congress.  Tomorrow also marks the beginning of Congressional hearings on the controversial last- minute pardon of Marc Rich.  Plus, expect earnings from Worldcom, Royal Dutch Petroleum, and American International.</p><p>And join us tomorrow night when Roger McNamee of Integrated Capital Partners is our guest.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAN HOPKINS, CNN ANCHOR: You're looking at live pictures from the New York Stock Exchange.  We're less than 60 seconds away from the closing bell.  Good afternoon.  I'm Jan Hopkins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's find out how the markets are doing in this last minute of trading.</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The Dow industrials set to close lower, tripped up by \"Big Blue.\" I'll have details.</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The Nasdaq composite suffers a turnaround, big caps pulling the index lower.</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And OPEC increases oil production, but the price of oil soars in New York trading.  I will tell you why.</p><p>HOPKINS: Do makers of violent media target kids under 17 and do retailers do little to restrict access?  We'll hear from both sides.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is like now and forever they're going to be there -- here, now, forever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOPKINS: The curtain has fallen on Broadway's longest and most profitable musical.  You can have a piece of \"Cats.\" We'll find out from the only original member of the cast about how.</p><p>It's Monday, September 11th.  Live from the New York Stock Exchange, this is STREET SWEEP.</p><p>We are waiting for a news conference from the players at Indiana University about the firing of basketball coach Bob Knight.  We will bring that to you live as it happens.  But first, let's look to see what happened on Wall Street.  Technology stocks pushing the Dow Jones industrial down.</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler has been covering the action here on the floor of the Exchange, and we join her now -- Rhonda. SCHAFFLER: That's right, Jan.  The Dow really was bouncing all over the place for much of the day, but starting to trend lower due to losses in two of its main technology components: Hewlett-Packard, which is in talks to buy a technology consultant business from an accounting firm, and IBM as Goldman Sachs lowered earnings estimates on the company by a couple of pennies, citing the weak euro.  So we had a lot of weakness in these tech components.  At the same time, the financials across the board showed strength.</p><p>Talk of another deal: Goldman Sachs involved this time.  It's buying Leeds &amp; Kellogg.  So, that sort of brought up all the merger talk again.  And also the oil stocks performed quite well, as oil prices, which Greg made reference to, continued to climb in New York -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Rhonda Schaffler, here on the floor of the Exchange.</p><p>Jitters over third-quarter earnings sending technology stocks lower.  Allan Chernoff joins us now from the Nasdaq, where that was scene of the downfall for technology -- Allan.</p><p>CHERNOFF: OK, Jan, at the Nasdaq marketsite, we've got some screens to show you exactly what's been happening over the past five trading sessions.  Have a look.  Last Friday, the Nasdaq composite at 4,234, one, two, three, four, five trading days.  We are off 337 points.  My quick calculation, approximately 7 percent or so: 10 percent is what's considered a correction on Wall Street.</p><p>Let's have a look inside of the marketplace and look at some of the five big stocks that moved the market today.  All of these stocks at one point were in positive territory.</p><p>Cisco down more than 2; Intel down a fraction; Oracle down 3 1/8; Sun Microsystems, a big hit, down 5 1/2; JDS-Uniphase, down 4 9/16. Add all those five stocks up together, you've got more than 20 percent of the Nasdaq composite.  That's the story, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thank you.  OPEC ministers saying yes to more oil output yesterday, but the decision, expected to cool off the price hike, seems to have had the opposite effect.  Major airlines forced to add a $20 fuel surcharge on round-trip tickets because of high oil prices.</p><p>Greg Clarkin has been covering the action in the oil market today.  He joins us from our New York studios.</p><p>So, Greg, you would expect more oil output, lower prices.  But in fact, prices went higher.</p><p>CLARKIN: Caught a lot of folks off-guard today, Jan.  OPEC agreeing to increase oil production by 800,000 barrels a day.  But still, in New York trading this morning, there was no selling.  It was just buying.  We saw the price of oil rising sharply, and by the end of the trading session it was up a $1.42 a barrel, trading at over $35, $35.05 to be exact. The bottom line here, traders say, that yes, there were some technical factors involved in the trading today, such as short covering, but still a lot of folks now believe that that 800,000 barrels a day really is not going to make a dent in the world demand for oil.  And a lot folks here in the U.S. are saying that this country now remains poorly positioned for the winter heating season.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER BEUTEL, CAMERON HANOVER: I think we're going to be looking at one of the most volatile winters that we have ever seen.  If the weather becomes bitterly cold at any point, we are going to see prices of heating oil, I would expect, over $2 in some locations.  We will see spot outages.  We'll see terminals in various states just run out of oil for a day or two, if it gets very, very cold.</p><p>You know, I mean, the squirrels are better prepared for the winter this year than we are.  I mean, it's really pathetic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARKIN: And keep in mind, by the time that oil is retrieved and processed, it will be too late to have an impact, at least on the beginning of the winter heating season.</p><p>Jan, back to you.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Greg Clarkin, at our New York bureau.</p><p>Joining us now, our guest host for the hour, Ken Tower of UST Securities.</p><p>So, Ken, these higher oil prices, are they part of the sell-off in technology stocks?</p><p>KEN TOWER, UST SECURITIES: I think so.  In the last week, the degree of increase in oil has taken people by surprise.  Last week, the 10-year Treasury made a new low for the year.  Now, it's popped up a little bit, sort of a countertrend move.  The insurance stocks, the bank stocks are all cooling off while interest rates go up, and the oil, especially oil services, small oil stocks are hot.</p><p>Just a countertrend move, taking a pause from the summer rally.</p><p>HOPKINS: So you would take advantage of some of the sell-off to buy some of these technology stocks a little cheaper?</p><p>TOWER: Technology stocks, bank stocks, insurance stocks, a bunch of insurance stocks popped back and up made new highs today, so you're not getting a whole lot of weakness there.  But still, that's definitely where we'd be going.  Even the oil service and the smaller oils, as I say -- the big oils aren't moving.</p><p>But yes, technology stocks and the others that are selling off here, we're looking to buy them. HOPKINS: I was talking to my fuel oil supplier last week, and he was saying that every day they get a fax saying what the price should be.  Prices are going up 5 cents a gallon a day.  I mean, this is really going to impact people's pocketbooks.</p><p>TOWER: That's right.  The Federal Reserve is not going to have to raise interest rates because all of this money is getting drawn out of the economy to pay for higher oil, especially in the Northeast, and gas prices.  So, that's going to cool the economy off without higher interest rates.  That's where you've seen interest rates going down and making new lows for the year.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Ken Tower.</p><p>The student presser has been expected from Indiana University; it has been canceled, though.  The story is far from over.  So let's check in with Lou Waters for that and the rest of the day's headlines.</p><p>Lou, what happened.</p><p>LOU WATERS, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, Jan.  Thousands of Indiana University students rallied behind the basketball coach, Bob Knight, after the school fires him: 10 students were arrested at a protest yesterday that stretched into the early morning hours.  The stepfather of the freshman who accused Knight of grabbing his arm says his son is receiving threats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK SHAW, KENT HARVEY'S STEPFATHER; I understand these people who are very, very upset.  I know they love the coach.  I know there are a lot of good things about Bob Knight.  So I want them to know that their remarks to me, I'm not going to take personally.</p><p>I would ask, however, that they use some caution with regard to Kent and to his brothers and these boys, because they did nothing wrong.  This is not about them.  It's about the coach.  And I would ask them to use some hesitation in terms of what they have to say.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATERS: Knight says he will tell his side of the story within the next few days.</p><p>The Clinton administration accuses Hollywood of aggressively marketing violent forms of entertainment to children.  A Federal Trade Commission study concludes entertainment companies routinely target youngsters with movies, videogames, and music intended for people age 17 and older.</p><p>President Clinton says such marketing mocks the ratings systems. He says the government may intervene if the industry does not fix the problem on its own.</p><p>Next on STREET SWEEP, the author of the legislation which called for the FTC study, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas.  Also, Paul Keegan, a writer from the videogame industry.</p><p>Two pilots are killed when their planes collide in Florida. Today's collision happened near Fort Pierce.  One of the planes was a single-engine aircraft, the other a twin-engined craft.  After the collision, both planes crashed into an orange grove.</p><p>It's busy day for the Space Shuttle Atlantis.  Two crewmembers, an American and a Russian, have successfully completed a space walk outside the International Space Station.  Later today, the crew plans to enter the station to unload the supplies.</p><p>More news anytime.  I'm Lou Waters.  Now back to Jan Hopkins in New York.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Lou.  Ahead on STREET SWEEP, we will check the after-hours trading with Pat Kiernan at Instinet.  Plus, as Lou was telling you, we will have a debate about kids' access to violent media.  We'll talk to a senator and a man who covers the videogame industry.</p><p>And later, you can get a piece of Broadway history from the \"Cats\" garage sale.  Details from an original \"cat, Marlene Danielle, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: The government turning up the heat on the entertainment industry today: the Federal Trade Commission slamming the industry for routinely and intentionally targeting children in the marketing of movies, music and videogames that are meant for adults.</p><p>An FTC study found that 80 percent of R-rated movies target kids under 17; 70 percent of Mature-rated videogames are aimed at kids under 17.  In addition, 85 percent of kids between 13 and 16 are able to buy music with explicit lyrics -- or violent video games -- while 50 percent were allowed into R-rated movies.</p><p>For more on both sides of the debate, we'll hear from Republican Senator Sam Brownback, and Paul Keegan, a freelance writer who has covered this topic extensively.</p><p>First, Senator Brownback, who believes the industry should regulate itself first and retailers and movie theaters should more strictly enforce age restrictions.  Joining us from Topeka, Kansas, with more is Republican Senator Sam Brownback.</p><p>So the industry hasn't done a very good job of regulating itself up to this point.  Why would you think that, all of a sudden, it would do a better job?</p><p>SEN. SAM BROWNBACK (R), KANSAS: Well, maybe the light finally shining on them -- and the study saying that clearly and conclusively they are marketing inappropriate properties to children might cause them to just do the right thing.  What I hope is we can keep a focus on the industry and hopefully shame them into saying: Look, we shouldn't be putting these products out for kids and then target- marketing them for kids.  We will clean up our act.  Maybe now they will do that.</p><p>HOPKINS: But if the industry doesn't, say in a certain period of time, are you prepared to propose legislation that would actually regulate the situation, like the tobacco industry?</p><p>BROWNBACK: Well, I'm opposed to censorship.  But I must say that this industry, the entertainment industry, is going down the very same track as the tobacco industry.  They have become hooked to sex and violence in their products, like tar and nicotine.  They're now marketing a product to kids, like Joe Camel was.  And they are going to keep getting more and more pressure from the legislative bodies if they keep going down this road.</p><p>Why don't they just stop?  Just do the right thing.  You can make money without target-marketing the kids, and being just addicted to hyper-violence and sexual-vulgar activity.  You can make money another way.  Just don't do it.</p><p>HOPKINS: How do you -- but how do you mean target?  What do they really do in order to target to those kids under 17?</p><p>BROWNBACK: Well, a number of the -- in the FTC study, they were going through marketing plans -- that what they were doing within the industry to market their product within publications, on shows that primarily teenage audience was watching and consuming.  And they were saying in their marketing plans: We are going to market this aggressively to teenagers.</p><p>That was explicitly stated in a number of their marketing plans. And just think about it for a minute.  How many shock rock fans are there over the age of 18?  There's just not many.  And yet the lyrics in there are hyper-violent, suicidal.  It's a really -- ugliness\u2026</p><p>HOPKINS: Let's hear the other part of the debate.  Thanks very much, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas.</p><p>Let's bring in freelance writer Paul Keegan, who has covered the issue essentially.  He comes to us from CNNfn's New York bureau.</p><p>So you've heard the case for maybe shaming the industry into doing more.  Is it a First Amendment case or is the industry really doing something wrong to target these kids under 17?</p><p>PAUL KEEGAN, FREELANCE WRITER: Well, it's clearly a First Amendment case.  As to why -- I think, Senator Brownback said why don't they stop.  There's six-billion reasons why they don't stop in the videogame and computer-game industry.  That six-billion dollars worth of revenue this year, and $7.5 million in Hollywood.  It's a tremendously lucrative enterprise.  And they are going to market to kids, because it is a huge market.</p><p>And the question is: Can the government, and should the government get into the business of regulation, which is a form of censorship?  Even though it is only the advertising and only that level now, it's only a matter of time before that opens the door to the content as well. HOPKINS: But we've already heard from the senator that he hopes the industry regulates itself.  Do you believe that the government should step in?  Is it out of control?</p><p>KEEGAN: I personally don't.  That's my personal opinion. Everyone has to make up their minds on their own.  And this is a very difficult subject, because, on the one hand, videogames in particular are probably the most violent form of mass entertainment ever invented.  They're really quite astonishing.  And kids who play the games are not just watching Arnold Schwarzenegger blow somebody up. They're actually pulling the trigger themselves.</p><p>And they're entering a very graphic, realistic, three-dimensional environment.  So it does raise some very troubling questions.</p><p>HOPKINS: But\u2026</p><p>KEEGAN: In a way, we're very similar to where we were at the advent of television, where the technology was new, people kind of didn't really know much about the effect it had.  But then later, there were a lot of studies -- 40 years now -- showing\u2026</p><p>HOPKINS: Clearly, this is going to something that we are going to continue to debate.  So thanks for joining us, Paul Keegan, freelance writer, and also Senator Brownback.</p><p>Just ahead: What do you do with 18 years of props and costumes? The Broadway musical, \"Cats,\" is finished.  We'll tell you how you can keep its memory alive.  The only original cast member joins us with details.</p><p>Plus\u2026</p><p>LISA LEITER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Lisa Leiter at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the closing bell just rang.  I will have the final numbers for you and what it could mean for stocks tomorrow morning on Wall Street -- when STREET SWEEP continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: Eighteen years and hundreds of millions of dollars later, all that's left from the Broadway musical, \"Cats,\" is the props and the costumes.  Final curtain for the longest-running Broadway show went down last night at the Winter Garden Theater.  Now everything must go in the biggest garage sale Broadway has ever seen.</p><p>Joining us now is the only original cast member from \"Cats,\" Marlene Danielle.</p><p>So you must have some kind of aftershock or something that this week, you are not going to be making yourself up, putting on this wig\u2026</p><p>MARLENE DANIELLE, BROADWAY ACTRESS, \"CATS\": Right.</p><p>HOPKINS: \u2026 and going back to this performance that you've been in\u2026</p><p>DANIELLE: Right.</p><p>HOPKINS: \u2026 every week for 18 years.</p><p>DANIELLE: Right.  I can be human again.</p><p>HOPKINS: So are you looking forward to not doing \"Cats\"?</p><p>DANIELLE: Um, I'm looking forward to the hereafter in a way. And I'm going to miss the show and my family there tremendously, yes.</p><p>HOPKINS: For 18 years, you were employed\u2026</p><p>DANIELLE: Yes.</p><p>HOPKINS: \u2026 every week, Broadway actress, really unheard of.</p><p>DANIELLE: Exactly.</p><p>HOPKINS: But you have a lot of financial wherewithal now.  Did you invest your money well, so that you would have a bright future?</p><p>DANIELLE: Well -- exactly, you know.  And I think this is a good omen: here at the stock exchange the day after the show closes.  Yes, I tried to.  I tried to put that money away and invest it so I would be able to continue to work and feel comfortable.</p><p>HOPKINS: Into what you want to do.</p><p>DANIELLE: Yes.</p><p>HOPKINS: What about the props?  How can people take part in this garage sale?</p><p>DANIELLE: Well, there's two ways. There's going to be a sale at the Winter Garden Theater on Saturday, September 16 from 10:00 to 6:00. It's an auction. All the proceeds go to Broadway Care/Equity Fights AIDS. For those people who cannot be there, but would like to bid and get something, they can go online -- and there's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.amazon.com\">www.amazon.com</url> -- same thing: Broadway Care/Equity Fights AIDS.</p><p>And they can bid on -- starting September 12 through the 29th.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much.  Thanks you for joining us.  And good luck to you in your afterlife.</p><p>DANIELLE: Thank you.  You're welcome.</p><p>HOPKINS: Now for a preview of how the stock market may open tomorrow's session, let's bring in Lisa Leiter.  She's tracking S&amp;P futures action at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -- Lisa.</p><p>LEITER: Hi, Jan.</p><p>Well, S&amp;P futures, the December contract closing two points above fair value, which at this point, would indicate a higher opening tomorrow morning for the Dow on Wall Street if this holds up.  We have got a little post-trading session next to me.  That's what all the noise is.  The Nasdaq 100 futures finishing lower, down 87 points there, the Nasdaq really building on last week's 6-percent drop, really extending those losses, and it wasn't looking good for tech stocks today.</p><p>Jan, back to you.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Lisa.</p><p>Now let's look at some of the big board movers and rejoin Rhonda Schaffler here on the floor of the exchange -- Rhonda.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Hi there, Jan.</p><p>There were a couple of weak technology stocks here during the regular trading session, including IBM.  Big Blue got its earnings estimates cut by a couple of pennies by Goldman Sachs, which also lowered its revenue growth outlook for Big Blue, and it cited the weak Euro.  But the analysts at Goldman keep the recommended rating on the stock, and in fact, it's not projecting out for IBM for 2001.  In other words, the currency problem might be a short-term issue there.</p><p>Hewlett-Packard, the Dow's other big tech component fell sharply today, that on talk it's interested in buying a technology consultant business from PriceWaterhouseCooper, it would make Hewlett-Packard a little bit more like IBM.  And one other stock on the move here, Goldman Sachs, a strong gain for that stock and many other financials, Goldman buying Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, the biggest specialist firm on the trading floor, and that is a way for Goldman, it says, to get closer to some retail customers -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Rhonda.</p><p>Let's go to Nasdaq and bring in Allan Chernoff, he can tell us about movers there -- Allan.</p><p>CHERNOFF: OK, thanks, Jan.</p><p>In spite of that big decline we have on the Nasdaq composite, the B2B stocks -- they had a very nice day, and thank that to Covisint, that is the auto parts exchange that is planned over the Internet, and Commerce One is one of the companies very involved, a B2B company, you see the stock up 3 3/4.  Genzyme took a big hit, that's because the company did a deal to buy GelTex, and GelTex is a company that makes dialysis drugs and also drugs to lower cholesterol, the acquiring company taking a hit, GelTex was actually up 16 percent today.  And finally, JDS Uniphase, you see, trading down 4 percent, a lot of volatility there, it had been in positive territory this morning. There is a lot of debate on Wall Street right now as to whether there is a glut of fiber-optic cable coming down the road, and JDS Uniphase one of the giants in fiber-optics.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Allan.</p><p>And now let's go to Pat Kiernan, he is monitoring after-hours trading at Instinet -- Pat.</p><p>PAT KIERNAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, earnings just after the bell from Solectron, the NYSE ticker symbol SLR, the stock is trading up a dollar and a quarter on this news, 48 3/4, earnings were a penny better than Wall Street expectations.  The -- a company, PRI Automation is held right now, trading has halted, they just came out with an earnings warning, said that Q4 will be below expectations. And on the other side, we had Oakley, the maker of sunglasses coming up after the bell, saying that it expects its third quarter to be above expectations, it's a bit higher here at Instinet.</p><p>Jan, back to you.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Pat.</p><p>Now let's see what's on \"MONEYLINE\" tonight, bring in Stuart Varney -- Stuart.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks very much, Jan.</p><p>Coming up tonight on MONEYLINE: the September slump for tech stocks.  Yes, the Nasdaq once again heads South after last week's disappointing performance.  We're going to talk to top tech money manager Roger McNamee, find out what he is buying now and also what he is selling.  We'll also have all the day's business headlines, including this tremendous rally in the oil markets.  Plus, a new technology hitting the market that gives new meaning to the term \"wireless world.\" They call it BlueTooth, and Web surfers may be in for the ride of their life.  It's all about very easy access anytime, anywhere.  All that is on \"MONEYLINE\" tonight at 6:30 Eastern -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Stuart.</p><p>We'll have more with our guest host, Ken Tower, when we come back.</p><p>And our trivia question for today: How much has the Broadway blockbuster \"Cats\" grossed over the past 18 years?  The answer, when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: The answer to our trivia question: How much has the Broadway blockbuster \"Cats\" grossed over the past 18 years?  Since 1982, box-office gross for \"Cats\" in New York, more than $400 million.</p><p>Joining us now with some final thoughts, our guest host, Ken Tower.  Interesting, 1982, the beginning of the bull market, was the beginning of \"Cats,\" any relationship?</p><p>TOWER: I don't think so, but it's interesting to point out anyway.</p><p>HOPKINS: The market today, more advancers than decliners, even though the market was down.</p><p>TOWER: That's right.  All the news that we're hearing is about the big stocks that went down today, and that is the story, but the underlying tone in the market is very positive.  You've had about five or six days now where you've had in -- you've been in this correction, there's still only about 1 percent of issues traded making new lows, that's a real sign of strength in the markets right now.</p><p>HOPKINS: So which ones would you pick at this point?</p><p>TOWER: I think you're buying the big brokerage stocks, big banks, the money-center banks like Citicorp, that kind of thing, as well as oil services and smaller oil companies.  But financials in general -- and then the biotechs, and the tech stocks, they're short- term plays because they are very volatile and they're not cheap, but they're fun stocks to buy.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Ken Tower.</p><p>That's all for this half hour of STREET SWEEP. \"SHOWBIZ TODAY\" will wrap up last night's Emmy awards, next on CNN.  And on CNNfn, how stock trading in dollars and cents put some extra coin in investors' pockets.</p><p>I am Jan Hopkins.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILLOW BAY, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight on MONEYLINE, a Wednesday wipeout on Wall Street.  Worries over the tech and telecom sectors take a 5 percent chunk out of the Nasdaq.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TERRY KEENAN, CNN ANCHOR: Sparking the turmoil: a sales miss from Nortel Networks that sent the Canadian company and the fiber- optics high-flyers plunging.</p><p>BAY: And another wrong number for AT&amp;T.  The stock sinks on a profit warning as the company announces plans to break up again. We'll talk to AT&amp;T's boss, Michael Armstrong.</p><p>KEENAN: Plus, with the next generation of PlayStation about to hit U.S. shores, we'll check out how one company is looking to score big time.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE.  In Los Angeles, Willow Bay, and from New York, Terry Keenan.</p><p>BAY: Good evening and welcome to MONEYLINE.  I'm Willow Bay.</p><p>KEENAN: And I'm Terry Keenan, sitting in for Stuart Varney.</p><p>We begin tonight on Wall Street and with the Nasdaq's biggest point drop in five months.  A rout in fiber-optics equipment makers dragging down the Nasdaq for the third-straight day.  The index plummeted 190 points or more than 5 1/2 percent, finishing out the day at 3,229.  Volume was very heavy, over 2 billion shares traded.</p><p>The Dow's losses weren't as severe, but it broke a four-day winning streak.  The blue chip index fell more than 66 points to close 10,326.  Volume in the Big Board also heavy, more than 1.3 billion shares.  Nortel pulling down the telecom stocks on the Big Board.  The S&amp;P 500 index lost more than 33, a decline of more than 2 percent.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz joins us now from the New York Stock Exchange with more on today's punishing session -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Terry, the culprit for today's huge slide a stock that had been largely immune from tech weakness.  Nortel's earnings after-the-bell yesterday beat the Street by a penny, but its quarterly revenue growth, up nearly 90 percent, was not good enough.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ (voice-over): The Nasdaq's ninth-worst point loss ever is largely blamed on a stock that doesn't even trade there.  Telecom equipment-maker Nortel has been a darling on the New York Stock Exchange.  But its disappointing revenue report precipitated an almost indiscriminate sell-off in tech stocks.</p><p>Nortel, the most actively traded issue on the Big Board, lost more than 29 percent of its value.  But investors also punished optical networking companies on the Nasdaq, including SDL and JDS Uniphase, which are in the midst of a merger.  But the damage didn't stop there.  Shares of chip manufacturer Applied Micro Circuits plummeted 25 percent.  Sycamore Networks more than 20.</p><p>LARRY WACHTEL, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: These are like the stocks that have been asleep at the switch.  These stocks have made enormous gains.  And people sit around with these enormous gains and say, give me more.  And you know, you can't do that.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Investors also took it out on blue chip techs.  Sun Microsystems shed more than nine points.  Dow Component Hewlett- Packard dropped more than five.  AT&amp;T's warning that its long-distance business was declining even more than expected put pressure on the Dow.  But buying in drug and financial stocks limited the damage.  One lone tech bucking the sell-off, Amazon.com, which was rewarded on word that the Internet company was not losing as much money as had been expected.</p><p>ANGEL MATA, LEGG MASON: I think really what's happened here is that we probably went up a little bit too fast.  There was a lot of money on the sidelines, a lot people feeling out, you know, if we weren't at the bottom, we were near the bottom.  Then we saw explosion on Thursday and all day Friday, and it continued on Monday, and I think what happened was basically we got a little bit of a hangover here.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ: Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert McTeer warned today that investors may also have a headache on Friday when the third-quarter GDP figures are released.  He says those numbers could show a fairly dramatic slowdown, re-enforcing fears of a hard landing -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: Yes, and those comments also a negative factor today. Thank you, Susan.</p><p>And while the Nasdaq's losses were brutal today, the impact north of the border even more severe.  Nortel stock accounts for almost one- third of the Toronto Exchange composite index.  The TSE 300 plunged 840 points, That was a record one-day point drop.  In percentage terms, it was the second-largest loss ever, a decline of more than 8 percent. BAY: Terry, accounting for a third of the Dow's losses today: AT&amp;T.  The stock plunged as the company warned its fourth-quarter profits, and 2001 profits, will fall short of analysts' forecasts because of prices for its long-distance services.  That news as AT&amp;T reported profits for the third quarter today of 38 cents a share, 2 cents better than Wall Street was looking for.</p><p>Investors had even more to digest, though.  AT&amp;T today also finally unveiled a sweeping plan to split up the company.  The breakup is supposed to be a rescue effort for AT&amp;T's slumping stock price, but investors clearly were not sold.  The stock fell 3 1/2 or 13 percent, near a 52-week low.</p><p>Steve Young reports on AT&amp;T's big plans and investors' big worries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): AT&amp;T's breakup plan was completely overshadowed by worries that its business is unraveling.  Yet another earnings warning led SalomonSmith Barney analyst Jack Grubman to downgrade AT&amp;T's to neutral from outperform with a comment, \"We believe the business is melting down.\"</p><p>And another analyst used a word seldom heard on Wall Street. Sell.</p><p>ANNA-MARIE KOVACS, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: Because of the combination of the decline of the business market more rapidly than I had expected as well as the reorganization, I downgraded it to a sell this morning.</p><p>YOUNG: Embattled CEO Michael Armstrong all the while was trying to sell what he said was a change in structure, not strategy.  The board has approved a breakup into four companies.  Armstrong will head the business services company, which will continue to trade under the T symbol.  It will license the AT&amp;T name to the others.</p><p>AT&amp;T Wireless was spun off earlier this year and already trades as a tracking stock.  AT&amp;T Broadband will trade as a tracking stock, too.  Within two years they'll both become real stocks with full ownership rights.</p><p>As for AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance business, it too will be spun-off into a tracking stock and will stay that way with AT&amp;T Business as its parent.  AT&amp;T says the companies will sell each other's services.  The combined dividends will be less than what AT&amp;T currently pays, but Armstrong says it's good deal.</p><p>MICHAEL ARMSTRONG, CEO, AT&amp;T: Well, it's going to make the pie bigger by providing a foundation and a path to let these businesses realize their value in the marketplace.</p><p>YOUNG: At least one competitor welcomes AT&amp;T's decision to wield the carving knife. JO NACCHIO, CEO, QWEST: When a large company changes strategy as dramatically, it's going to force them to take their eye off customers and that's generally good for the rest us.</p><p>YOUNG: Armstrong told analysts he's offended by those who say he's abandoned his strategy.  One money manager said he's offended by how far AT&amp;T's stock has fallen.</p><p>Steve Young, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Well, Steve said Mr. Armstrong is offended at how far AT&amp;T stock has dropped over the past year.  It's lost almost half its value.</p><p>Joining us now to talk more about the breakup plan, the company's chief executive, Michael Armstrong.</p><p>Michael, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Hello, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Why are you so reluctant to call this a change in strategy?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Well, because -- go back with me to 1998 when we set out on this course and we set a strategy in place.  We had basically a company, a long-distance business, a point-to-point domestic long- distance business that in fact was an application, not a business per se.  But we had to transform the AT&amp;T company and invest in growth and invest in assets in which to base that growth.  In fact, if you look at third-quarter results, and take the voice long-distance and set it aside, those growth businesses grew 20 percent in the first three quarters of this year.</p><p>BAY: So then -- but then what's keeping you, what's keeping AT&amp;T from realizing its value?  You know the criticisms: Consumers weren't interested in bundled services.  Wall Street got impatient.  That strategy that you set out with to begin with is flawed.  What's holding you back?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Well, the strategy's not flawed.  The strategy is being realized in the growth of these businesses that we have put together given the 20 percent growth that we've achieved for the first three quarters in them.  And where we've reached is an inflection point where the market value of our company disregards the growth businesses and values us on the long-distance/EPS business.</p><p>And so what we're doing is unlocking that value, providing this foundation in a path to the future growth with these new AT&amp;T companies and permitting investors to invest in the growth businesses if that's what they want to invest in or invest in the dividend business if that's what they want to invest.</p><p>BAY: The market reaction today was less than enthusiastic.  As you know, the stock dropped more than three and some analysts downgraded the company, including one with a sell recommendation. What's the market missing here?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Well, I think, Willow, that the -- first, it was a pretty tough market today.  It was a down market in general.  I was listening to your comments about the Nasdaq, the tech stocks, and the communications stock.</p><p>Second, we did have an adjustment to our outlook.  And that outlook adjustment had nothing to do with the growth businesses that are growing and doing well and everything to do with the long-distance business, which is in decline, and that decline accelerated across the industry, not just to AT&amp;T.  And we were forthright to predict that that decline is going to affect us.  And I think that combination of a tough market and the revised outlook hit us.</p><p>BAY: Briefly, if you can, because I know this is a complicated arrangement expected to take about two years, but at the end of this process, will an investor in AT&amp;T have investments in all four of these distinct companies?</p><p>ARMSTRONG: Yes, they will.  And -- or they can mix and match investment according to their investment interests.  Today, they get an enterprise value which is based on EPS.  If they'd like to invest in -- a company like Wireless is growing 37 percent, they'll have that opportunity.  But yes, we're going to spin these equities to our shareholders.</p><p>BAY: Michael Armstrong, thanks for joining us tonight on what is a very interesting day -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: Well, still to come on MONEYLINE: On the heels of AT&amp;T's makeover plan, another former Wall Street star plans some major surgery.  Can Cendant cures its CUC headache?</p><p>Plus, fiber-optic shares may be taking a beating, but how long will this punishment last?</p><p>And as America's business leaders meet in Boca Raton, what are they saying about the direction of the economy and who will win the White House?  All that and much more ahead when MONEYLINE continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Cendant today announced a bold move to save its floundering stock.  The company said it's spinning off its membership businesses to shareholders.  Cendant acquired those businesses, such as travel and restaurant discount clubs, as part of its painful merger with CUC International.  The merger uncovered an accounting disaster at CUC, prompting the resignation of top executives and hammering Cendant's stock price.  The company is now getting close to settling a multibillion dollar shareholder lawsuit.  Cendant stock today closed at 9 3/4, down 25 cents, it is down 63 percent year-to-date.</p><p>KEENAN: In tonight's \"Tech Watch\": telecoms in trouble.  After flying high most of this year, most fiber-optic equipment makers are now well off their highs.  JDS Uniphase, SDL and Nortel all down 45 percent or more from their peaks.  PMC Sierra and Applied Micro Circuits also well off their best levels.</p><p>But our next guest says that we are heading toward the end of this brutal market sell-off.  Erik Gustafson of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>And, Erik, let me ask you about what's been going on in this market, because we have had Intel, Microsoft, IBM, now Nortel, all warning of sluggish sales, and different portfolio managers that we've had on, including you, time after time say this is the end, and then we get more.  What's not to say that we're in a protracted slowdown in tech spending?</p><p>ERIK GUSTAFSON, STEIN ROE &amp; FARNHAM: Well, Terry, what we've seen in technology is that one by one, they've gone out and taken and shot each major group.  They started with the Internet companies, they went to the semiconductors, they went to the wireless.  Today, they tagged the optical companies, via Nortel's announcement last night. So I think what you're seeing is in part a slowdown out there in certain areas of technology.</p><p>Look, the Fed was very aggressive, in my eyes, really an overhanded aggressiveness in raising rates and we're seeing some slowdown in some sectors of the economy.  We had a Fed governor today, Mr. McTeer, talk about what's a potential weaker GDP number on Friday. So that spending is translating a little bit into technology.  But is the game over?  Absolutely not.  We've been through this before and this shall pass, and technology companies will come back.</p><p>KEENAN: You're fortunate to own a handful of stocks that haven't been shot yet and that's kept your portfolio above water this year, including EMC and GE, both trading, though, at extremely high multiples, GE at 45 times earnings.  Don't those stocks have to come down to more rational market valuations before this is all over?</p><p>GUSTAFSON: Well, Terry, I certainly hope not.  We have been fortunate.  Our portfolios have performed well in a very tough market, even with owning technology companies.  General Electric, I think, is one of the great businesses in the world.  I think their earnings are intact and I think they'll continue to grow at 17, maybe even 18 percent a year going forward.</p><p>EMC is in the storage business, and storage is one of the few remaining soldiers on the battlefield that hasn't been taken apart, and sure, we're weary, we're worried, we watch it every day.  But EMC, run by Mike Ruettgers, has done a great job, so we're sticking there and I think we'll make it through.</p><p>KEENAN: What about some of the consumer non-durables, those things we all buy that don't last for too long?  Some of the stocks in that group, such as Colgate and Estee Lauder, have been on a real tear in the last couple of weeks.  Do you like some of those names?</p><p>GUSTAFSON: Interesting point.  Clearly, as we've seen technology wobble in places, we've seen investors flee those groups and place capital in more stable groups, if you will.  Consumer non-durables, soaps, toothpastes, foods, things like that have been very, very strong performers, as investors have sought defensive areas and have sought shelter.  We haven't been aggressive buyers there -- we own a company called Safeway, a large grocery retailer -- we haven't been so aggressive there because they don't have the earnings growth that we do.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.</p><p>GUSTAFSON: I think as we get through October, we're going to do a lot better here in technology, and that's where I'd be placing capital.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, fortunately, only about five or six days left. Thanks, Erik.</p><p>GUSTAFSON: OK, thanks, Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: Erik Gustafson -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Terry, still to come, U.S. President Bill Clinton takes another try at diplomacy in the Middle East, as the fighting in the streets continues.  The story in the MONEYLINE \"News Digest,\" after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: A stinging reply today from the George W. Bush campaign to an attack by Treasury Secretary Larry Summers on the candidate's Social Security plan.  John Cogan, a Bush economic adviser and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, says the statements by Summers are, in Cogan's words, \"false and inappropriate.\" He was responding to an interview which appeared today in the \"Washington Post.\" Summers said that Bush's comments on Social Security \"reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of the system.\" And he insists that money collected now cannot both pay current benefits and be moved into investment accounts.\" According to Summers, that \"is an arithmetic challenge that cannot be met.\"</p><p>For other news outside the world of business, let's check in with Wolf Blitzer from Washington for the \"MONEYLINE News Digest\" -- Wolf.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Willow.  President Bill Clinton said today he has invited Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to Washington for a new round of talks aimed at halting the violence.  Mr. Clinton said he has proposed meeting separately with the two sides and says he was waiting for their responses.</p><p>The fighting meanwhile continued today even as Mr. Clinton urged Barak and Arafat to abide by their agreement from last week's summit at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt to curb the violence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A big part of what the parties recognized at Sharm el-Sheikh was that it's impossible to maintain this uneasy status quo where we've come so far in the peace process, but the big and most difficult issues remain. We can't expect there to be a reliable peace process unless we can reduce the violence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: The State Department today warned U.S. citizens to defer all travel to Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.  The warning cited a -- quote -- \"heightened threat of terrorist incidents.\"</p><p>With 12 days to go before the U.S. presidential election, the candidates both sought help on the campaign trail today.  Vice President Al Gore had his Democratic running mate, Joe Lieberman, at his side during an education event in Gore's home state of Tennessee, while George W. Bush was in Florida campaigning with Senator John McCain.  Bush's theme today was Social Security reform.</p><p>And those are some of the top stories.  Join us for more on \"THE WORLD TODAY.\" That's at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 p.m. Pacific.</p><p>Back to you, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Wolf, there was a major development today in the USS Cole story.  What can you tell us?</p><p>BLITZER: More information that the attack on the Cole may not necessarily have been isolated, that perhaps other terrorist threats were out there.  Also one mid-level Defense Department intelligence official we now know has resigned.  He says he gave warnings about a possible attack similar to the Cole in the days leading up to that attack, but his superiors apparently ignored those warnings, and as a result, he thought it was a good time to quit -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Wolf, thanks.  We'll see you at 8:00 -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: Well, still ahead on MONEYLINE, with Firestone under attack, is another tire industry giant in trouble over safety?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's profile, the CEO facing the biggest challenge of his career, AT&amp;T's Michael Armstrong.  The 62-year-old Harley Davidson-riding executive spent the first three decades of his career at IBM.  In 1993, he ran DirecTV at Hughes Electronics.  In '97, he was named to the top post at AT&amp;T and was celebrated as a visionary who could transform the long-distance company.  Key to that strategy, Armstrong paid more than $100 billion to buy two cable companies.</p><p>AT&amp;T's total market cap today, $87.8 billion.</p><p>MONEYLINE will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: The tire safety dispute looming larger as another manufacturer comes under scrutiny: 15 deaths have now been linked to light truck tires made by Goodyear.  The problem is allegedly tread separation, similar to the trouble attributed to some Firestone models.  Goodyear has not recalled the tires and many remain on the road, including the popular Wrangler AT and HT.</p><p>Kelli Arena has more from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This Goodyear plant in Gadsden, Alabama was a focal point of an internal investigation into tread separation problems launched in late 1994.  Goodyear was responding to customer damage claims, part of its early warning system.</p><p>J.C. WHITLEY, VICE PRESIDENT, GOODYEAR: We have a warranty system.  That data comes back into a data collection system, and then we have a group called customer engineering that analyzes all of that data.</p><p>ARENA: The company says it's aware of 30 accidents and 15 fatalities involving Load Range E tires: those are tires made for large commercial vehicles.  But it says there is not anything wrong with them.  Lawyers for victims involved in those accidents disagree.</p><p>CHRYSTINE SPAGNOLI, PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY: There are red flags all over the place.  The fact that these accidents have happened that we've tracked, the fact that there are documents that Goodyear doesn't want public, there is a problem.</p><p>ARENA: Goodyear admits it changed the design of those tires in 1996 by adding what's known as a nylon cap.  Court documents suggest complaints fell after the change was made.  But Goodyear did not recall tires with the old design and accidents involving those tires continue.</p><p>SPAGNOLI: What we're seeing is large vans, large sport utility vehicles, and particularly vans that are carrying school kids, vans that are carrying Air Force and military personnel, sport utility vehicles.</p><p>ARENA: Federal safety regulators say they've received 59 complaints about those Goodyear tires.  The models include Wrangler AT and HT, the all season, and Kelly-Springfield's Power King and Trailbuster.</p><p>Safety advocates say Goodyear's problems, much like Firestone's, indicate a much broader safety risk.</p><p>RALPH HOAR, DIRECTOR, SAFETYFORUM.COM: What tire manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers have done is to trade off safety for an improved ride and an improved fuel efficiency.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARENA: In this age of what Goodyear referred to as a heightened awareness of tires, the company says there are people who might benefit from bringing certain information to the public and it insists there is just absolutely nothing wrong with its tires -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thank you very much, Kelli -- Kelli Arena.</p><p>Well, it has been a rough year for Goodyear stock.  In the past 52 weeks, the stock is down 63 percent and it is no longer a Dow component.</p><p>MONEYLINE will return in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues.  In Los Angeles, Willow Bay; and, sitting in for Stuart Varney in New York, Terry Keenan.</p><p>KEENAN: Tonight on MONEYLINE, tech tremors rattle Wall Street, sending the Nasdaq sinking 5 percent.</p><p>Setting off the jitters, Nortel, the Canadian fiber-optics powerhouse takes a huge hit after posting disappointing sales. Another factor in the telecom turmoil: AT&amp;T as it warns of weaker profits and unveils a landmark move to split up the company.</p><p>BAY: But first, more on tonight's top story.  A Wednesday wipeout on Wall Street, with the Nasdaq slumping more than 5 percent after investors sound the alarm over a sales shortfall at Nortel Networks.  Worries over the future of tech profits hit the Nasdaq hard, sending the index down more than 200 points lower, before closing down 190 points at 3,229.</p><p>The Dow also lost ground in a choppy session, breaking a four-day winning streak, ending off more than 66 at 10,326.  In the broader market, the S&amp;P 500 sank more than 33.  As you might expect, the biggest movers were on the fiber-optics side: Nortel dropped nearly 18 1/2 or 29 percent; Corning sank more than 16 1/2; JDS Uniphase lost over 24; and SDL, which is being acquired by JDS, plummeted nearly 82; Ciena gave back 27; Applied Micro Circuits, a chip supplier for Nortel, was off more than 50; PMC-Sierra down 37 3/4; and Cisco Systems off 4 1/4.</p><p>But the main focus of attention was Nortel, one of telecom's highest fliers.  It crashed to earth today after missing revenue forecasts last night, a result that swamped markets on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border.</p><p>Greg Clarkin has been following what went wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): By midday the sell orders for Nortel threatened to overwhelm the Toronto Stock Exchange. The TSE halted trading Nortel just before noon, but the damage was done.</p><p>Nortel was down 25 percent.  It would lose 29 percent in New York trading.  The carnage due to one line in Nortel's earnings release: revenue $7.3 billion below Wall Street's expectations. JOHN ROTH, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, NORTEL: I think the Street, maybe, had dreams of a much bigger fiber-optic market than reality.  You know, we have increased our fiber-optics shipments this quarter by 90 percent on a very, very big number.  We're now shipping product at the rate of about $10 billion annualized.</p><p>CLARKIN: But analysts say they had unofficially been led to believe Nortel would ring up 12, even $13 billion in fiber-optics sales this year, a figure many used to build revenue models for the next several years.</p><p>The revenue shortfall sparked fears the spectacular growth in fiber may have been unsustainable.  Nortel said the drop off was from customers over-ordering in the first half, expecting shortages in the second half.</p><p>Analysts say they should have been warned.</p><p>ARIANE MAHLER, DRESDNER KLEINWORT BENSON: If they had better systems to tell them where growth is coming from, if it's inventory build-up or if it's fundamental demand going up, and then to communicate that to the street instead of telling us that it's just going to be great demand and they're getting the whole market to themselves -- I think they'll find a little bit less damage on days like today.</p><p>CLARKIN: The news from Nortel dragged down anything fiber-optic- related.  The AMEX Networking Index plunged almost 12 percent.</p><p>The selling was called an overreaction by some.</p><p>ALEX HENDERSON, SALOMONSMITH BARNEY: The problems at Nortel have very little to do with the end-market demand for optic systems. In fact, it's strictly an inventory draw down from what I can tell.</p><p>So shooting these other stocks makes little sense in that context.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: But the momentum players did exit fiber stocks today in a big way; and until Nortel proves this revenue drop was a one-time event, no one expects them to return any time soon -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Greg, thanks.</p><p>Today's plunge in Nortel comes after a forgettable fall.  The stock peaked over the summer and is off 45 percent over the past three months.  A similar story for JDS Uniphase, another Canada-based fiber- optics pioneer.  But Ciena had been holding up better, but now it appears to be caught in the downdraft as well -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: And a dramatic day for one of the most storied names in corporate America, AT&amp;T telephone edged ahead of third quarter earnings estimates, but warned that fourth quarter numbers would fall short of forecasts.  And the company released its long-awaited plans to break itself up into four separate units, adding that the combined dividend would be, quote, \"substantially less\" than the current dividend.</p><p>The reaction to the news was fast and furious.  Janney Montgomery Scott issuing a rare sell recommendation on the stock; and SalomonSmith Barney's influential telecom analyst Jack Grubman, among others, downgrading AT&amp;T, grubman saying that, quote, \"business is melting down.\"</p><p>Well, little relief on the bond side, as Moody's said it may cut the debt rating on AT&amp;T -- the stock sliding 3 1/2.  It has lost nearly half of its value, or $70 billion over the last year.</p><p>AT&amp;T's decision today to try to split the company into four parts is not the first time AT&amp;T has tried to reinvent itself.</p><p>Peter Viles has been reviewing the past and checking out whether history is repeating itself -- Pete.</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Terry, you're right, this is AT&amp;T's third breakup in just 16 years, another uncertain chapter for a company that, essentially, gave birth to the telephone and to the communications business as we know it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES (voice-over): 1876, Alexander Graham Bell patents the telephone and sets out to profit from it by forming Bell Telephone, the eventual parent of AT&amp;T.  By 1913 AT&amp;T has built a transcontinental network, but the nation's phone system is in chaos. Thousands of small phone companies and no central connecting network. The Wilson administration effectively lets AT&amp;T run the entire system.</p><p>STEPHANIE MEHTA, \"FORTUNE\" MAGAZINE: AT&amp;T, in 1913, convinced the government that phone service was a natural monopoly and that it should be allowed to operate as a natural monopoly with the government's permission.</p><p>VILES: 1974, the Justice Department opens a heavyweight battle for the ages: Washington against a popular American icon, Ma Bell, the company that brought phone service to tens of millions.</p><p>ELI NOAM, COLUMBIA BUSINESS SCHOOL: It was dependable, it was reliable, it was affordable and it was good; and so why fix it if it ain't broke.</p><p>VILES: 1984, Washington wins.  The Bell system is dead in the first AT&amp;T break up.  AT&amp;T gives up the seven baby Bells, 2/3 of its assets and 2/3 of its employees.  1991, AT&amp;T makes a bold bet on the computer business, paying $7 billion for NCR.</p><p>September, 1995, another restructuring.</p><p>BOB ALLEN, FORMER AT&amp;T CHAIRMAN: Today we are announcing that AT&amp;T is reinventing itself once again.</p><p>VILES: AT&amp;T splits into three companies: a computer company, NCR; an equipment company; and a communications company.</p><p>1996, a bright spot: The equipment company, Lucent Technologies takes off in one of the biggest and hottest IPOs ever.  1998, another new strategy.</p><p>C. Michael Armstrong makes a huge bet on cable, buying TCI and then Media One.</p><p>MEHTA: AT&amp;T had to find a way to get to the home.  They had 60 million long-distance customers, none of whom they could touch directly, and the cable strategy was perceived as a way to get directly into the homes of their customers.</p><p>VILES: The cable strategy also makes cable kingpin John Malone into AT&amp;T's most influential shareholder.  AT&amp;T stock struggles and investors, Malone among them, quickly grow impatient, pushing Armstrong into yet another attempt to reinvented AT&amp;T.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: The executives have changed, but the central challenge at AT&amp;T really hasn't changed in the past 16 years.  At this company's core is a business -- long-distance phone service -- in which prices, margins and profits are on the decline -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, that's for sure; thank you Pete.</p><p>Well, AT&amp;T put a brave face on today's dramatic shift in strategy, but will that fly with long-suffering investors?  Our next guest holds AT&amp;T in his clients' accounts and he has some very strong opinions on how the company has handled the move.</p><p>I'm joined now by Todd Eberhard, he runs his own investment firm.</p><p>Todd, welcome.</p><p>TODD EBERHARD, EBERHARD INVESTMENT ADVISORS: Thank you.</p><p>KEENAN: Let me ask you the question that's on a lot of people's minds: Mike Armstrong has leveraged up this company, he's broken up this company, he's going to try to break it up again -- so far, disastrous results.</p><p>Is his time up at AT&amp;T?</p><p>EBERHARD: Well, let's start taking a step back by saying what I saw today on air on FN, which is Michael Armstrong saying he was appalled that people would question his strategy, that it's not working.</p><p>And I've got to say I'm appalled, and my clients are appalled and I think most of Wall Street is by the fact that this stock came down from a $61, roughly, share-price, down to a $23 and change.  And I think it's time to stop pointing fingers and defending a strategy and start to come up with a new plan.</p><p>KEENAN: Is the problem the push into cable?</p><p>EBERHARD: I think that's part of the problem, but I think it's also a -- it's reinventing yourself every two or three years and not sticking to a plan or moving forward in one direction.</p><p>They're sort of -- it's seen now as AT&amp;T is spreading out into so many different places, doing so many different things, and not doing any of them well.</p><p>KEENAN: Let's move onto the market, because a lot of questions about this 5 1/2 percent sell-off in the Nasdaq.  We had Nortel light on the revenues yesterday, but it's still\u2026</p><p>EBERHARD: Light -- light on the revenues at 90 percent numbers. I don't know where the analysts got these 130 or 150 percent numbers they were expecting.  90 percent revenue growth is incredible, and I would love to be able to talk to my people and say we went up 90 percent.</p><p>I think that Wall Street was just overreacting, as Erik, who was on earlier, said.  It's an overreaction here.  They sold -- throughout the bath water and just sold across the board.  And I think it is an overreaction and we'll see a counterbalance.</p><p>KEENAN: I know you were buying some Nortel today.</p><p>EBERHARD: Right.</p><p>KEENAN: Tomorrow, we get JDS Uniphase numbers.  Do you expect to see continued selling tomorrow?</p><p>EBERHARD: We don't.  I mean, we think that -- and look at JDS-U today.  It got taken down dramatically as well, but in anticipation -- and I think their numbers are going to come in stronger than expected. I think it's got some strength and it could turn that whole market right around very quickly, as we've seen it happen in the past.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  Thanks, Todd, as always.</p><p>EBERHARD: My pleasure.</p><p>KEENAN: Todd Eberhard -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Terry, up next, we go live to Boca Raton, Florida, where some of the nation's top business leaders are meeting.  We'll tell you what they're saying about the state of the economy.</p><p>Plus, Sony's PlayStation 2 hits stores tomorrow.  We'll tell you what that means for one California company, when MONEYLINE returns in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In New York trading today, the euro slid to a fresh record low against the dollar, that on continued speculation central bankers will not step in again to prop up the beleaguered currency.  The euro today finished just under 83 cents and is down 17 1/2 percent this year.</p><p>KEENAN: Well, the euro's decline seemed to grab more attention in the bond pits than today's economic news.  Sales of previously owned homes declined 2.7 percent last month to an annual rate of 5.1 million new units.  That was right in-line with economists' forecasts. But bond investors largely ignoring that report and cashed in on some recent run-ups in Treasuries.</p><p>The 10-year note fell nearly a half point while the 30-year bond lost more than a half point in price, the yield there moving up to 5.74 percent.</p><p>BAY: Executives at some of the nation's top companies today predicted the recent economic slowdown will last well into next year. The Business Council is meeting in Boca Raton, Florida this week and released the results of its survey.</p><p>CNN's David Haffenreffer is standing by live with all the details -- David.</p><p>DAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Willow, sure.  High energy prices, a weak euro and slowing economic growth appear to be the buzz already here in Boca Raton as this year's Business Council meeting gets under way: 100 chairman and CEOs from some of the world's biggest publicly traded companies are gathering here for two days and their outlook for next year is cautious.</p><p>A council survey presented by -- this evening by Citigroup chairman Sandy Weill found an overwhelming majority believe U.S. economic growth next year will be lower than this year.  Two-thirds of the council believes global economic growth will slow next year as well.  And one factor certainly that we've seen eating into corporate bottom lines this season is the weak euro, and about 44 percent of the members expect that currency to weaken even further in the months to come.</p><p>Sandy Weill says the slowdown comes thanks to Federal Reserve rate hikes and soaring oil prices.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDY WEILL, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CITIGROUP: We're all seeing the effect in different places, from higher energy prices and the effect that that's having on some service industries, you know, like airlines.  And you know, a lot of how long that may go on may be dependent on some political things and not just the economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAFFENREFFER: And on the political front, it looks pretty close at this point among the council members: 49 percent believe Al Gore will be the next White House resident and 43 percent believe George Bush will win.  But a clear majority believe that the Republicans will maintain control of Congress.</p><p>On the agenda for tomorrow, a number of panel discussions on the agenda, including one on global population and demographic trends, and also how technology advances will affect our quality of life -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: David, so, that's what they said in the survey and that's what they're doing on the formal agenda.  But did you get any sense of what they're chattering about in their downtime?</p><p>HAFFENREFFER: As part of the press conference earlier today, which was pretty loose, it seemed as though the week euro certainly was a major topic of discussion, and some jokes, of course, on the political front as well, talking about how, no matter who wins perhaps, we will miss Bill Clinton, at least on the economic front once he departs office.</p><p>BAY: David Haffenreffer, thanks.</p><p>Could investors score on the launch of Sony's much-anticipated PlayStation 2?  We'll look at one game maker looking to cash in, when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Wall Street watched for several big names out with their quarterly results today.  DuPont managed to meet lowered third-quarter forecasts, earning 51 cents a share.  But the Dow component cut its full-year estimates, citing higher raw material costs and the weak euro.  Revenues for the quarter were flat from a year ago.</p><p>Consumer products maker Clorox cleaned house with its third- quarter numbers.  It beat Wall Street estimates, earning 42 cents, or $100 million.  And Viacom also reporting better-than-expected results. The media giant, which just recently completed its acquisition of CBS, saw revenue rise 7 percent to $6 billion.</p><p>Checking those stocks, DuPont lost a half, Clorox gained more than two, Viacom down 2 1/4 -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Terry, in what's being called the biggest consumer electronic product launch in history, Sony releases the successor to its top-selling PlayStation videogame console.  PlayStation 2 is officially hitting store shelves tomorrow with a few select outlets selling the console at midnight tonight.</p><p>But before videogame players get their hands on the new unit, investors are already betting on the success of at least one smaller player, videogame-maker Activision.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY (voice-over): The anticipated launch of Sony's PlayStation 2 has given another company, the game-maker Activision, a bit of a lift. Its stock has more than doubled in the past 4 months and some on Wall Street predict the stock has further to go.  The company hit a pitfall this spring with a dramatic earnings warning and weak industry demand. The stock slump was stunning, more than 66 percent.</p><p>But today, Activision is in better shape after a significant reorganization and a new focus on its key brands.</p><p>The company reported $144 million in sales last quarter, capturing 9 percent of the U.S. market, up from 2 1/2 percent in September 1999, making it the second-biggest independent game-maker behind electronic arts.</p><p>Activision employs 120 people to do nothing other than test its games all day.  It's here in the testing center where they fine tune their hit Tony Hawk Pro-Skater.</p><p>(on camera): You fairly recently decided to focus on extreme sports.  Why?  Why not Major League Baseball?</p><p>ROBERT KOTICK, CEO, ACTIVISION: We found the extreme sports business was really sort of, you know, virgin territory from a publishing standpoint.  It touches the court of popular culture to our consumer more than the mainstream sports do.</p><p>BAY (voice-over): And now Activision may really have a \"Need for Speed.\" In addition to Sony, both Microsoft and Nintendo are launching new consoles in 2001.  And Kotick says the game-makers will spend about a billion dollars in advertising.</p><p>(on camera): Sony PlayStation 2 is shipping only about half of what it expected to ship.  Does that hold back your growth?</p><p>KOTICK: It doesn't.</p><p>BAY: Why not?</p><p>KOTICK: Typically what happens is it takes a few years for these new platforms to actually achieve any kind of meaningful installed base.  This year, I would say maybe 3 percent of our revenues will come from PlayStation 2.</p><p>BAY: Why is the buzz about PlayStation 2 then giving your stock such a boost?</p><p>KOTICK: I don't think it's actually given our stock a boost, to be honest with you.  I think our financial results, the way we're maximizing sort of the where we are in the transition has really been what people are responding to.</p><p>I think what people are enthusiastic about prospectively is that they're saying that they're going to sell a hundred million PlayStation 2s.</p><p>BAY: So what would that mean for you if that's true?</p><p>KOTICK: That would mean probably at a minimum we would double our revenues in five years.</p><p>BAY (voice-over): Despite Kotick's forward-thinking and Activision's recent rebound, analysts caution that at their heart videogames are trendy and trend-picking is never easy.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Kotick's also looking for growth beyond traditional game consoles.  He has a wireless deal with Nokia, which he calls \"experimental.\" It will be five years or so before he expects to see any real revenue from that deal.</p><p>Now, analysts expect industry sales to grow around 20 to 25 percent over the next few years as these new game stations roll out. Kotick says he expects Activision's revenues to grow more than 30 percent over the same time period -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: Not bad.  OK, still ahead on MONEYLINE, a merger that could change the way you look at the Dow Jones industrial average. We'll hear from Myron Kandel about that after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: GE's takeover of Honeywell will mean a vacancy on the Dow Jones industrial average, and it may trigger some other changes.</p><p>Myron Kandel joins us with his thoughts on that -- Myron.</p><p>MYRON KANDEL, CNNFN FINANCIAL EDITOR: Well, Terry, the folks at \"The Wall Street Journal\" take changing the Dow industrial average very seriously, so they really keep it close to the vest.  But as a result of the planned takeover of Honeywell, there will be a vacancy. There are a number of companies that have been mentioned as possible replacements, including Cisco Systems, Tyco, Pfizer even AOL-Time Warner once the takeover of our company is completed.</p><p>KEENAN: But you think that this merger of Honeywell and GE might trigger some other changes at the Dow Jones?</p><p>KANDEL: Well, that's right.  The last two times \"The Wall Street Journal\" has changed the Dow they've done four -- they added four companies and they dropped four the last two times.  So this time they may do more than that one -- fill more than that one vacancy.  And I have no idea where they're going to go, but I have some speculation. And one of them is dropping AT&amp;T.</p><p>KEENAN: Especially if it's divided into four companies.</p><p>KANDEL: Exactly.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  We will have to see.  Thanks, Myron.</p><p>Up next, \"Ahead of the Curve\": Willow and I will be back with some of the news that you need to know tonight before tomorrow's markets open.  You're watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Here's a look at a few things that may move the markets tomorrow.  Expect big earnings from big tech names like JDS Uniphase, WorldCom, Inktomi and Nextel Communications.  Also tomorrow, DaimlerChrysler and AIG.  And watch for jobless claims for the week ending October 21st.</p><p>KEENAN: And also a quick programming note, tomorrow night we'll be joined by two of the biggest names in telecoms: John Chambers of Cisco Systems and Jozef Straus of JDS Uniphase.</p><p>BAY: That's MONEYLINE for this Wednesday.  I'm Willow Bay in Los Angeles.</p><p>KEENAN: And I'm Terry Keenan in New York.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly adopted a more aggressive, \"war\"-like style, according to the Wall Street Journal. </p><p>Alphabet was also down 3.5%. It is now down nearly 20% from its peak in July.</p><p>Early in the day, stocks fell on news that Apple's newest line of phones may not be selling as well as Apple or its investors had hoped. </p><p>Apple's stock fell once more after the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple has cut orders for its iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.</p><p>The new iPhones, which Apple unveiled in September, cost more than previous versions. The $749 iPhone XR is the least expensive new iPhone, but it costs $50 more than last year's cheapest model, the iPhone 8. </p><p>The iPhone XS Max can cost up to $1,449. The higher prices -- without many more features -- could be driving customers to keep their current phones longer or buy last year's models.</p><p>Apple declined to comment about the Journal story or broader concerns about iPhone demand. </p><p>Shares of Apple fell 4% and have now plunged about 20% from the all-time high it hit a few months ago, when Apple (AAPL) was worth more than $1 trillion. </p><p>The stock ended a 5-day losing skid on Friday after an analyst at Morgan Stanley suggested that the supplier concerns are overdone.</p><p>Apple, which is a member of the Dow, was hurting the blue chips too. </p><p>Several makers of chips and other components used in iPhones have warned of soft sales and profit in recent weeks, citing sluggish demand for higher-end smartphones.</p><p>To that end, shares of Apple suppliers, such as Qorvo (QRVO), Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and even Apple's key Anrdoid phone rival Samsung were all lower Monday too. Samsung also makes chips for iPhones.</p><p>Investors have other reasons to be concerned about the future of Apple -- as well as other big tech companies for that matter.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the \"Axios on HBO\" show Sunday that he expects Washington to crack down on tech firms in the wake of high-profile privacy scandals, such as the Cambridge Analytica problems that have plagued Facebook (FB). </p><p>\"I am not a big fan of regulation,\" Cook said to Axios on HBO. \"I'm a big believer in the free market.

That's probably a stretch. But Wall Street clearly is getting more worried about the company's reliance on the iPhone to generate sales and profit at a time when demand for the newer phones appears to be subpar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shares of Apple (AAPL) fell 3% Wednesday and that was one of the big reasons why the Dow, which includes Apple, lost more than 200 points. Apple's stock even dipped into bear market territory, meaning it was down 20% from its all-time high.</p><p>It was the fourth straight drop for the Dow, which actually opened the day with a more than 100-point gain after the US government reported that the latest figures for consumer prices were in line with expectations -- a sign that inflation remains mostly in check. </p><p>The other big tech stocks in the Dow -- Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC) and Cisco (CSCO) -- were all lower too. </p><p>The Dow briefly bounced off its lows after UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced that her cabinet had agreed to a Brexit deal. </p><p>But the broader market was also hurt by a slide in bank stocks after Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters, who is expected to take over the House Financial Services Committee in January, said in a House hearing Wednesday that the days of more lax regulations for banks \"will come to an end.\"</p><p>Still, all eyes were mostly on Apple, which fell for a fifth consecutive day. </p><p>The reason for Apple's latest slide? Several companies that produce chips and other components used in iPhones have all issued gloomy forecasts recently, citing sluggish demand for higher-end smartphones.</p><p>Although none of these companies, which include Qorvo (QRVO), Lumentum (LITE), Japan Display and IQE, have named Apple as the source of their woes, they are all Apple suppliers. </p><p>But it may not be time to throw in the towel on Apple just yet, even though some analysts are cutting their price targets and earnings estimates due to concerns about soft sales for the newer iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.</p><p>Apple's stock is still up more than 10% this year, making it one of the better performers in the Dow. The company is still worth nearly $900 billion. It remains the most valuable company in the world.</p><p>Apple also continues to pay a solid dividend that yields 1.5% -- and the company is likely to keep raising its dividend thanks to its cash stockpile of $237.1 billion. </p><p>What's more, Apple's earnings are expected to increase by more than 13% this fiscal year and keep growing at about a 12% clip annually, on average, for the next few years. </p><p>So predictions of an Apple iPocalypse, if you will, may be premature. There are other legitimate worries for Apple though. </p><p>UBS analyst Tim Arcuri cut his price target on Apple Wednesday. He wrote in a report that the stronger dollar could be hurting iPhone sales in China since currency fluctuations make the already expensive iPhones even pricier in China.</p><p>And it does seem like the company needs a new product to get consumers and investors excited again. </p><p>Perhaps Apple needs to take a cue from the movie \"This Is Spinal Tap\" and release a new iPhone that goes to eleven. But would it be the iPhone 11 or iPhone XI?</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

That's right, Tesla profit.  The  stock, soaring, it's up double digits in premarket trading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Searching for a sender, a manhunt, underway for a person, who sent  explosive devices to prominent Democrats and CNN, plus authorities trying  to track down a package sent to Former Vice President Joe Biden.  We have  the latest on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And a look at the economy, in America, from one of the biggest names in  technology, Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, sitting down with Maria  Bartiromo, in an exclusive interview, he weighs in on the political  environment to the health of the economy.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER &amp; EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  I think the  economy is doing great, so again, I was Bill Clinton's second largest  contributor when he ran for office.  You know, I'm neither a Democrat nor a  Republican, I tend to be in the middle, which means very lonely.  There's  (INAUDIBLE) polarized.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  More of Maria's exclusive must-see interview with Larry Ellison,  one of the great innovators from this country.  You have to hear what he  has to say.</p><p> All of that and so much more, coming up this morning, the Federalist  Commentary Writer, Emily Jashinsky, Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner,  Mike Murphy and the Brewer Group CEO, Former NFL Star, Jack Brewer.   Welcome one and all.  Let's get right to it.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because I have a lot much I want to talk about with Murphy, over  here.  To our top story, a potential market rebound this morning, after the  Dow and S&amp;P fell into negative territory for the year, yesterday.</p><p> This is Twitter.  It is set to release its quarterly earnings later this  morning, other tech giants on deck, for today, include Amazon and Google's  parent company, Alphabet.  They report their earnings after the market  closed today.  Mike, what do you make of these earnings, what does the  market need to see to firm up here?</p><p> MURPHY:  Well, clearly, companies are getting cheaper than they were, a  month ago.  We hit new highs last month.  Now, we have this major drawdown  10 percent, in the markets.  Earnings are what I'm looking at.</p><p> You see what Microsoft put out yesterday.  Those numbers were very good, I  won't say outstanding, but enough to not cause a major selloff in the  stock, get sold down to $98.00, right after the earnings were announced.</p><p> But now, if you see this morning, it's firmed up in the low 100s, that's  enough for me to say I want to buy Microsoft on a pullback, and look for  the same from Amazon, same from Google.  If the growth story is still  intact, this is a buying opportunity.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If the growth story is still intact.  So, it was -- what  triggered the selloff to start the month of October.  It was to say -- is  really a replay in some ways of what we saw earlier this year.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was worries about inflation, higher wages and rising interest  rates.  But that hasn't been the story lately, because you saw -- money has  been going into treasuries, money went a little bit of money went into  treasuries yesterday, the 10-year -- the yield was down slightly.</p><p> So what is it, is it worries about global growth and corporate profits?  We  have been talking about the revenue story, and I was looking at the revenue  miss number, so, so far, through the quarter, we have 38 percent of  companies that have missed revenue expectations, which is the biggest  percentage this year.</p><p> MURPHY:  There's been a story going on and a lot of people focusing on peak  earnings, this is good as it gets.  Is it going to get worse from here?   So, a lot of people, I think, taking some money off the table after these  big run-ups we've seen.</p><p> I don't see that.  I see solid earnings and it's really the companies that  have been -- I'm not focusing on a company like Ford that announced  yesterday, I'm focusing on the companies where we've seen the growth.  So  that's the big tech, that's Microsoft, that's Google, that's Amazon, later  today.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, let me mention Microsoft and Tesla, we -- people,  investors love to hate Tesla, so Microsoft, Mike was talking about this,  beat revenue and profit estimates based on its cloud-computing growth and  Tesla defied Wall Street expectations, posting a record profit.</p><p> Just your thoughts on Tesla because they moved up their earnings  announcement, so I personally assume that they were going to report a  quarterly profit, that they had something to crow about and indeed, they  did.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes, interesting because, you know, when the -- when Elon Musk  announced that he was moving the earnings up, a lot of, like, the talk  there, was that he was doing that to attack the Shorts, that a lot of  Shorts had bought weekly puts, made weekly bets against his company for  next week, when he was going to announce.</p><p> In order to do that, you have to pay up a lot for those put options,  because there's an earning's announcement coming in there.  So, by moving  the earnings to this week, a short-seller would immediately lose 70 to 80  percent of the value when the bets he made against Elon Musk's company.</p><p> So, bring it forward and then top it off, you have profitability and great  numbers.  This, to me, Tesla right here, after this huge rally, isn't  something you'd want to jump into.  Yesterday was the time to buy Tesla.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm looking at the results, particularly it is cash, people  concerned about the level of debt, it's free cash flow came in much higher  than expectations.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's about $881 million, its total cash on hand, its $3 billion.   Its accounts payable did also rise, but in terms of -- and I'm going to get  to Jack and Emily, but in terms of its financial position, it looks better  here.</p><p> MURPHY:  Looks better.  And remember, they have a big bond payment that  they have to -- that's coming up.  So, you know, early next year, the cash  position is going to get more and more focused on, so this is a great start  for Elon Musk, but he's going to have to continue this type of movement.</p><p> JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP:  So, in regard to Tesla, because  obviously, we see everything that's going on outside with Elon Musk and  everyone is just going back and forth, for me personally,  I don't think  this is going to last very long, but how -- </p><p> MURPHY:  back and forth.</p><p> BREWER:  I don't think -- I don't think the growth of the company is going  to continue to last as long.  I'm scared about the first quarter of next  year, when those convertible notes come due, I wonder how they are going to  be able to react there and will they be able to continue with the earnings  growth.</p><p> But beyond that, in the broader market, here, as you look, and Dagen, you  mentioned 38 percent of the companies have missed earnings.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Revenue.</p><p> BREWER:  Revenue, excuse me.  I'm seeing a lot of companies that I didn't  expect to hit their earnings growth -- hit their earnings growth.  So, what  does that mean for our economy, is this going to be something as we go into  the first of the year, will we see more and more companies that are  expected not to grow, actually hitting their earnings numbers?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think the economy is doing great right now, it's booming, things  are moving in the right direction, so that's where you want to be -- if you  want to focus on that, that's something to focus on right now, is the  economy.</p><p> But, when you're investing, you're talking about individual stocks,  individual companies within the economy, so I don't want to focus on ones - - not the old-school ones, where they had a good quarter or they're going  to put up two good quarters.  I want to focus on the long-term growth  stories and that's been for the most part, big tech.</p><p> BREWER:  But do you rebalance, right now?  If you're a normal investor, do  you -- what do you do if you're -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because the market just rebalanced.</p><p> MURPHY:  I had a -- I had a few friends reached out to me last night,  saying things like, are we going to be OK?  What should we do here?  That  tells me that the selling's probably getting a little bit overdone.  If you  have a long term plan, leave it alone.  If you are retiring in two years or  three years, and this pullback has you, losing sleep, rebalance right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President keeps talking about the Federal Reserve chief and  the Fed, making a mistake, but every time he does that, I keep thinking  about all those responsible people, those savers, who basically gotten  screwed by the Federal Reserves of cheap and easy money policy over the  last -- more than a decade.</p><p> And so, I think about them.  I'm like, the people are actually -- don't  hate higher rates here, in fact, it makes people feel more confident when  they see particularly longer-term interest rates going up.  I mean, it  sounds, kind of, upside down and backwards.</p><p> But I want to get to politics, speaking of the President, because he was on  the campaign trail last night, in Wisconsin, hitting a number of issues  including the mail bombs targeting high-ranking Democrats and CNN.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The Federal government is  conducting an aggressive investigation, and we will find those responsible,  and we will bring them to justice, hopefully, very quickly.  Any acts or  threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself.</p><p> Early voting is now underway, so get out and vote, the decision in this  election is so clear all over the country.  Republicans are for lower  taxes, less regulations and more economic freedom, and that's a good thing.   That's a good thing.</p><p> The Democrats are for higher taxes, more regulation and more top-down  government control.  We don't have borders, we don't have a country, and we  have the greatest country on earth, OK?</p><p> Republicans know that the rule of law is essential to national sovereignty,  and we know that immigration enforcement is essential to public safety,  National Security and the protection of American jobs, wages and public  benefits.</p><p> The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years, 5-0  years, 50.  Manufacturing confidence has reached an all-time high in the  history of our country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Emily, your take on the President last night and so much  happening whether it's the market selloff to potentially impact the midterm  elections, now less than two weeks away, and now, these pipe bombs sent to  prominent Democrats?</p><p> EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Right.  Two big  stories yesterday, and it's -- I was born and raised in Wisconsin.  And he  was, last night, really deep in the heart of Trump country.  What's  interesting is, this is the state where Ted Cruz won the Republican  primary, where Donald Trump won by less than one percentage point over  Hillary Clinton.</p><p> And yet he's -- when he's in Wisconsin -- when he's in rural Wisconsin,  these are people who were hit hard by trade policies of years past, paper  mills have shattered.  They're in a lot -- there are a lot of problems up  there.</p><p> And so, for him to come to the state, at a time when the Wisconsin Senate  candidate, Leah Vukmir, is not expected to win, she's, you know, down in  the polls.</p><p> You risk -- you risk boosting turnout in Milwaukee and Madison and helping  Tammy Baldwin, but at the same time, when you see all of these people, in a  state like Wisconsin, flock to this New York billionaire, at a rally, it's  a really powerful statement and what he's been able to do in some of these  rural communities.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And these events, though, we don't -- I can't recall a  major market selloff like this, right ahead of midterm elections before,  not in recent history.</p><p> MURPHY:  Midterms maybe, but we did selloff going into the last  presidential election, if you remember.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, we saw -- right, because -- and then again, rally, when  it became clear that President Trump was going to win, so pro-growth  policies, we will discuss as the morning moves on.</p><p> A nationwide manhunt, meantime, underway after explosive devices were sent  to prominent Democrats and CNN, we have the latest on the investigation,  including what was found inside those packages.  </p><p> Plus, competition with China, stay with us for Maria's exclusive interview  with Oracle Founder Larry Ellison.  Hear what he says about protecting  American tech.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  An intense nationwide manhunt, underway, after pipe bombs were  sent to prominent Democrats as well as CNN.  Cheryl Casone has the details.   Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, good morning, Dagen.   While at least eight packages were sent in total, one of them addressed to  former President Barack Obama.  The Secret Service says that the package  with an explosive device was intercepted before it could make it to his  home in Washington, D.C., as well as another that was sent to former  President Bill and Hillary Clinton's New York home.  Former Attorney  General Eric Holder had one addressed to him, and one bearing the name of  John Brennan, the former CIA Director who publicly sparred with the  President, that package meant for Brennan was delivered to CNN, prompting  the network to evacuate their New York offices at Time Warner Center.</p><p> Now, officials say the devices made with PVC pipe were packed with shards  of glass.  The President condemning the attempted attacks.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  Any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our  Democracy itself.  No nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the  threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, coercion, or  control.</p><p> CASONE:  Police also are looking into suspicious packages mailed to  Congresswoman Maxine Waters in Washington and in California, and another  one that was addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden.  Investigators  believe this is related to another, sent to George Soros, a billionaire  liberal donor who lives in New York.  Now, the FBI says this could be the  work of one person or a group because all packages are similar, manila  envelopes, forever stamps, and the return address of Democratic  Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  A lot of intense things happening  yesterday.  Dagen, over to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Indeed, Cheryl, thank you for that update, and we'll bring you  more as it develops as the morning moves on.  But Emily, onto this, because  this is -- the Wall Street Journal has an editorial today called the  politics of pipe bombs, and they say -- one of the -- one of the things  that they note, one that took years literally trying to find out who sent  those anthrax-laced letters that killed several people after back in 2001.   Especially so close to an election, the public should discount unconfirmed  leaks about suspects or motives and the political rhetoric that you're  hearing about these explosive devices.</p><p> JASHINSKY:  Yes, I think that's probably true.  But, I mean, I think in  general, turning down the volume couldn't hurt anyone -- turning down the  volume on the anger and the -- you know, whatever the -- whatever the  polarized rhetoric couldn't hurt any of us.  But I think it's probably wise  at this point, unless, you know, there may be some very clear information  that emerges, that could be the case, there were a lot of package that were  sent.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And because the devices were not detonated, that would  make it -- it makes the job of the FBI much easier to track down.</p><p> JASHINSKY:  And it should be fairly easy.  I mean, these are in Virginia  right now being analyzed.  And so, it should be fairly easy for them to  determine whether they were viable to begin with, whether these were things  that were actually intended to explode or whether these were fakes, that I  mean, they should be able to figure that out soon.</p><p> MURPHY:  Either way from a political standpoint, like, this is a lunatic,  whether whatever political party they are part of, or whatever they were  trying to accomplish, it's a crazy person that we -- no one wants to be  associated with in any way, shape, or form.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And no one wants to wish harm or bring harm to anybody  in this country.  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Nobody asked for that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A rational sane person.  Exactly.  However, I will point out  that Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi did put out a  statement saying Mr. Trump's words bring hollow until he reverses his  statements that condone acts of violence.  And The Journal editorial  writes, \"As if this is a moment to settle political scores.\"  So, some  people can't avoid making them political.</p><p> BREWER:  They can't.  And I, you know, I flew in last night, and was  watching the various networks, and I was just blown away by the fact that  every single person took President Trump's speech and made it as if he was  the one inciting all of the violence, disregard the fact that we've had  Republicans shot on baseball fields in D.C.  I mean, come on, guys, this is  both sides.  People need to take a step back.  But whenever you start to  point the blame at someone else like your mom and dad always told you, you  got to look back at yourself first.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And to quote President Obama after the shooting in Tucson, where  Gabby -- the one in which Gabby Giffords or Congresswoman Gabby Giffords  was injured, he said the lack of civility in politics was not to blame, and  he cautioned against a political impulse to quote, lay the blame for all  that ails the world at the feet of those who happened to think differently  than we do.  So, that bears repeating on this day.  </p><p> Coming up, airline hack, Cathay Pacific reporting more than 9 million  customers may have had their data compromised.  The latest, next.  Plus,  reliability tanking, Tesla reporting better-than-expected -- well, better- than-expected numbers for the quarter.  It actually reported earnings with  a car company among several that has slipped in customer reliability.   We'll bring you that story ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A view from the top, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison sitting  down in an exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo.  Take a listen to what  he says about a range of issues including his company, Amazon, and  competition with China.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ELLISON:  The Oracle database manages most of the world's data.  Today, 10  years ago, nothing has changed, all of the world's important valuable data  is in the Oracle Database, they're not in Amazon's database.  Let me tell  you an interesting fact, Amazon does not use AWS to run their business,  Amazon runs their entire business on top of Oracle, on top of the Oracle  database.  They have been unable to migrate to AWS because it's not good  enough.  We have serious competition going on with China.  I'm on team USA,  I would like us to be successful, I'd like us to develop and protect our  technologies, I think we have to do that.  I think we have to invest on --  invest on our economy and grow our economy so we can compete with the first  serious -- the first serious threat, if you will, our first serious  competitor we've had since the 1930s.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Plus, Maria, also, before she sat down with Larry Ellison, she  first spoke with Oracle Co-CEO Mark Hurd, and asked him about growth.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  People are worried about growth, the market is selling off this  week, it's been a volatile situation, as people question whether or not  these good economic times are sustainable.  You've got the leading  enterprise companies on Oracle software using Oracle applications, you  would know best.  What are you seeing, are you seeing a pullback?</p><p> MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  No, I wouldn't say that.  I think there's always  concerns that the Fed sometimes -- I think I've heard a stat where 36 --  out of 36 quarters in a row, they've overestimated growth.  And sometimes  interest rates moves -- sort of moved ahead of the growth, and in some  ways, as you know, can constrict growth.  And so, I think there's some  concern about what happens to interest rates.  But still today, if you have  good projects people are investing, the economy certainly in this country  is good, growth in this country is solid, particularly in small and medium  business.  We talk a lot about global companies, and companies that reach  outside of the United States, but if you look inside the United States,  companies' primary business is domestic, those companies are doing quite  well.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Be sure to stay with us for Maria's exclusive in-depth interview  with Oracle Founder Larry Ellison at 7:00 and 8:00, so in both of those  hours.

We'll  introduce you to an IPA, with a peanuty twist.</p><p> To our top story this half hour, health care in focus, President Trump will  outline a plan to lower health care costs this afternoon, ahead of the  midterms.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP:  Republicans want to create better health care through more  choice, lower drug prices and you will see, very soon, drug prices will go  plunging downward, you wait, you watch.  It's all in motion.  And we've  created much more competition.  Democrats want socialist health care, where  private plans are outlawed and abolished.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Recent Fox News Poll shows that health care is, indeed, the  number one issue motivating voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.</p><p> Joining me now, Democratic Strategist, Jessica Ehrlich, along with  Republican Strategist and Former Trump Campaign Data and Strategy Director,  Matt Braynard, Jessica, your reaction to the President's plan and that  might impact people who are voting based on health care?</p><p> JESSICA EHRLICH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I would love to see lower  health care costs especially lower pharmaceutical costs, I think, everyone  would like to see that, but the details of this plan have yet to be  revealed.</p><p> And the last two years, given the majority in both the House and the Senate  that the President has enjoyed, nothing has been done so far, which I'm  sure has frustrated Republicans, but it's also frustrated Democrats and  voters, in general.</p><p> So, I'm highly dubious and skeptical that there's anything, you know --  this is the emperor's new clothes, when it comes to an actual plan that's  going to be implemented.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Matt, I will point this out, in terms of bringing down  prescription drug costs, that this year, the FDA has approved a record  number of generic drugs so far this year, and that is another -- delivering  on another promise is getting government out of the way.</p><p> And this has been one of the things that, for years, health care analysts  have been talking about, so there is that, as well, and then, in Obamacare,  the, kind of, standard plan in Obamacare, the premium is actually for next  year, going to be slightly lower than it was last year.</p><p> So, there are some things going on that could influence voters.</p><p> MATT BRAYNARD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Yes.  And I need to correct what my  colleague here just said.  There was tremendous progress made in health  care these last two years, because Trump and the Republicans repealed the  most egregious violation of individual rights in Obamacare was and getting  rid of the individual mandate, that is gone.</p><p> So, that is a substantial advance.  That was a regressive tax on our poor  citizens, and that's no more thanks to this president.  I'm very excited to  see what this plan is going to bring.  We do know that the health care  issue was, what cost the Democrats control of Congress in 2010.  So, going  on the offense on this issue, is only going to yield tremendous dividends  for our side.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jessica, I'll get your reaction to that, because a lot of the --  a lot of the ads -- and Democrats have roughly -- half the ads that  Democrats have been running in the midterm elections are related to health  care and a lot of them focused on Republicans want to repeal the coverage  for pre-existing conditions.</p><p> It's something that hasn't happened, but nevertheless, they've made that a  talking point.</p><p> EHRLICH:  Well, I mean, I think that's part of the frustration on both  sides, right?  So, for a lot of Democrats and even a tremendous number of  moderate Republicans and independent voters, the repeal of the Obamacare in  its full state, the abolition of the pre-existing conditions, as a pre- requisite for your health care.</p><p> These are things that get people out to the polls, that have energized  people that we're seeing in this, I think, what's going to be record  turnouts for midterm elections.  Contrary, yes, you can hold on to, oh,  they took away, you know, they abolished part of this one aspect of  Obamacare.</p><p> But the Republicans came in on this wave, with Trump, saying, they were  going to appeal it completely and they weren't able to do that, they  created a new plan that they could also -- </p><p> BRAYNARD:  With no help from Democrats.</p><p> EHRLICH:  with their own majority.  So, these are the facts.  And you can  spin them any way you want to, but it's a disappointment to a lot of  people, yes, it does get people to the polls and we're going to see that  this time around.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'll say this, it's a disappointment that they've got rid of a  tax on people, I don't know if people see that as a disappoint, but I'll  get your response and I want to move on.</p><p> EHRLICH:  People who wanted Obamacare abolished were disappointed that it  wasn't accomplished.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Go ahead, Matt.</p><p> BRAYNARD:  There was -- there was --Obamacare was not repealed and  replaced, the plan that covers pre-existing conditions because of one  arrogant Republican senator.  We're likely going to be fixing that in this  next Congress.</p><p> And it's very disingenuous to be running ads saying that Republicans, these  horrible Republicans are going to get rid of pre-existing condition  coverage, when you just made the point that we've had control for the last  two years, so why haven't we done it yet?</p><p> These ads are really making the presumption that voters are very stupid and  I don't think they're going to succeed.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Moving onto immigration, there's a caravan of thousands of  migrants heading to the United States from Honduras.  The President,  saying, that he will send as many troops as possible, to block them from  entering our country.</p><p> Matt, how does this going to impact voters, because President Trump has  really tried to make -- use this and make immigration a more important  issue coming up ahead of the midterms?</p><p> BRAYNARD:  Look, if you want to have the potential to break the land speed  record here on earth, ask a Democrat, on camera, what they think about this  problem and they'll disappear before your eyes.  We've already seen some of  their leading candidates like Beto O'Rourke, take a pass on the question.</p><p> Republicans around the country need to get footage of this caravan, in  their television ads, and make it clear that we are the ones that are going  to stop it.  The other party is AWOL because they see this as an  opportunity to bring in more potential voters.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jessica, your response to that, because I hear a lot of the  rhetoric from some Democrats, some people on the left, loud prominent  voices, saying that President Trump is trying to stoke fear among the  voters, and that he's using these people to basically gin up their fears.</p><p> And I pushed back on that.  This is really an issue do you believe in open  borders or not?  So, it's not based on fear, it's based on President Trump  asking people if they believe in the rule of law and our immigration laws  that are on the books.</p><p> BRAYNARD:  It's based on footage.  They can see with their own eyes.</p><p> EHRLICH:  I disagree.  I think it's the opposite, because contrary to  Democrats disappearing on this issue, there was even, you know -- when we  were talking about this last night on air, they were showing clips of  President Obama, being very strong, actually, that we need to have border  security and enforce the laws that are on the books, and that was proven in  his record of deportations.</p><p> The issue that's happened is that there's rhetoric that's been out there  that gins up people.  Immigration is an issue and the fear of immigrants  flooding into the country uncontrolled, or in some way, lose on the  streets, that is an issue with voters, no question.</p><p> And it certainly gets out Trump's voters and it encourages them to vote.   That's why he's been saying at his rallies, talking about border security  in the wall, as well as talking about the Supreme Court nominations.  These  are things that incite his voters.</p><p> However, there's no proof that Democrats want, you know, completely open,  fluid borders that that's happened, that that happened under any of the  administrations --</p><p> BRAYNARD:  Other than how they governed in the last eight years.</p><p> EHRLICH:  What's happened is that we have yet to have anything, again, come  out of the last two years that has changed the issue where we continue to  have.  There is yet to be a piece of legislation from the President's  office or from the House or the Senate that are Republican-controlled, that  have fixed the problem that we currently have.  These people are continuing  to come.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Matt, I will -- I will hit on that.  But I do want to point out  that a lot of prominent Democrats talk repeatedly about abolishing ICE.   That we went from people being upset about the family separations at the  border, to we need to get rid of ICE, which actually stops human and child  trafficking.</p><p> So, again, to say that some Democrats don't believe in that, that's  inaccurate, that some people talk about that repeatedly, who are running  for office, but Matt --</p><p> EHRLICH:  There are people running for office who talk about that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BRAYNARD:  But you referenced Obama.  He is nor running for office.   Where's Schumer on the issue?  Where's Pelosi on the issue?</p><p> EHRLICH:  It's the same between -- there are -- the people -- there are  Democrats and Republicans on both sides, who say things that are of one  extreme or the other.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Matt -- I want to get Matt's -- Jessica -- </p><p> EHRLICH:  That is not referred to all Democrats or all Republicans.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to ask Matt, one final word, with President Trump making  immigration an issue, Matt, does it highlight -- because he's not running  for re-election, it is -- it is Republicans --</p><p> BRAYNARD:  He is running for re-election.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, well, the people are going to the polls, Matt, in less than  two weeks, to vote on people in Congress and in the Senate.  Does it  highlight the fact that the Republicans haven't done that much on  immigration?  They have not fully funded his wall and they have not put  financial restrictions on funding for sanctuary cities.  Does it hurt them  potentially, rather than help Republicans in less than two weeks?</p><p> BRAYNARD:  No, and I want to -- no, not at all.  Because we are in, at  least, in my lifetime, the third re-alignment of the Republican Party, the  Congress that comes back, whether we control both Houses or not, is going  to be the Trump Republican Party.</p><p> Right now, we are dealing with the dead-enders of the Paul Ryan era, who  are basically in the pockets of, you know, China and the Chamber of  Commerce.  And so, they've been an obstruction in many ways, to this  president, but the new Republicans that are coming in, this is the Trump  Republican Party, and that's going to change.  So, I look forward to that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right.  We've got to -- Matt, we've got to go for breaking  news.  Thank you both for having a civil conversation.</p><p> EHRLICH:  Thanks, good morning.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jessica and Matt, good morning to you both.  We'll be right  back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news right now, you are looking live at pictures in New  York City.  That is the New York City Police Department transporting a  suspicious package found in lower Manhattan.  The neighborhood is the  Tribeca Neighborhood, that is north of the World Trade Center, the world  financial center.  This is in the Tribeca Neighborhood.  </p><p> This follows a series of explosive devices that were found across the  country sent to prominent Democrats and CNN, addressed to John Brennan at  CNN.  It's not unclear if this is related but the New York City Police  Department has responded to reports of a suspicious package.  This is in  Tribeca in the vicinity of Greenwich and Franklin streets in Tribeca, lower  Manhattan.  We will bring you more developments as we get it, but this as  New Yorkers are going to work this morning.  </p><p> This package already in transit, this is in -- this is in the transport  vehicle used for explosive devices, so it's being transported to, I  believe, it's in the Bronx where this facility is, where the NYPD takes  these types of packages suspicious.  But, again, this was found down in  Tribeca, near Greenwich and Franklin.  It's worth-noting that this is also  not just a residential neighborhood but also a busy financial area, there's  one Citigroup building that's across the street from where the suspicious  package was said to be found.  We will bring you more as we get it.  New  York City Police Department transporting that suspicious package found in  lower Manhattan.  </p><p> Moving onto this, the Director of the CIA has reportedly heard the audio of  the killing Journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Cheryl Casone has details on this  developing story, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  It is developing as well, Dagen, good morning.  Again, CIA  Director Gina Haspel is Turkey to investigate the murder that took place in  the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.  Turkish officials through multiple leaks  to the media have touted the existence of audiotape of Khashoggi's killing.   While the Washington Post has reported that Haspel has heard it, which a  source describes as compelling.  And Haspel is due back in Washington today  to brief President Trump on what she heard, what she learned.  Meanwhile,  Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, calling the killing \"a  heinous crime\" that cannot be justified.  He made the comments at the  Future Investment Initiative, that has been, of course, overshadowed by the  murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p> Well, another headline we're following for you this morning.  A data breach  at Cathay Pacific, the Asian airline confirming the hack may have  compromised a personal information of nearly 10 million passengers.  That  data would include e-mail addresses, passport numbers and date of births.   Cathay Pacific apologizing, it's contacting passengers who may have been  affected and also says there's no evidence, any personal data may have been  misused.  Taking a look at shares of Cathay Pacific, the stock is actually  down 13 percent so far for the year.</p><p> Well, American car brands slipping in annual reliability rankings published  by consumer reports.  Ford is at number 18, that's down three slots from  last year, followed by General Motors, Buick brand which fell out of the  top 10.  G.M., Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands, also losing ground.  Tesla  fell six places, 27th by the way.  Meanwhile Lexus, Toyota's luxury brand,  regained its title as the most reliable brand.  Shares of Toyota are down  about seven percent so far this year.  </p><p> And then, finally, there was this to leave you with, guys. Mr. Peanut wants  you to have your peanuts and drink them at the same time.  Planters is  teaming up with Chicago's Noon Whistle Brewery to bring you a peanut- flavored beer.  It's called Mr. IPA-nut -- there's the can.  The new brew  is going to have all of the, all of the familiar (INAUDIBLE) you get with  an IPA, but it's also going to have Planters iconic honey roasted peanut  flavor and a little bit of salt as well.  The beer is going to be released  on October 27th, just in time for National Beer Day.  The catch, you have  to head to Illinois if you want a sip, and of course, that day, I already  checked, is a Saturday, Dagen, unfortunately for us onset.  Back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Cool car there.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Twitter earnings out in moments.  We'll break down  the numbers and look at what role social media is playing in the upcoming  midterm elections.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news to bring you.  This is a live look at New York  City Police Department transporting a suspicious package found in lower  Manhattan in the Tribeca neighborhood.  This is in the vicinity of  Greenwich and Franklin street, this follows a series of explosive devices  that were found across the country sent to prominent Democrats and CNN.   It's not unclear if this is related but this package was found near the  Tribeca Grill, that is the restaurant long associated with Robert de Niro,  long owned by Robert de Niro.  So, again, that package, suspicious package  in transit to the explosive disposal unit of the New York City Police  Department.  </p><p> Moving onto tech earnings, they're in focus this morning.  Twitter is set  to report its results momentarily.  The stock moving up, it's up about 3- 1/2 percent at the moment.  Joining me now is Tech Analyst and Big Eyed  Wish Founder Ian Wishingrad.  Ian, good to see you this morning.  What are  you watching for in Twitter's earnings?  </p><p> IAN WISHINGRAD, FOUNDER, BIG EYED WISH:  Good to see you this morning, as  well.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sorry, I didn't mean to skip over good morning.  </p><p> WISHINGRAD:  So, everyone is estimating that they're going to have good  numbers from a business standpoint.  I think there's just going to be a  reality check on what kind of business it really is.  There are certain  businesses that have billions of users like the Facebook and those  Instagram, and those are these incredible unicorns that people really want  to be able to put a ton of add dollars into.  Twitter, I think, unlike  Snapchat, have much smaller user bases, so people are just going to have to  reset their expectations, deal with their relatively modest user base and  how they're able to monetize.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I point at Mike Murphy, because again, but Twitter has tried to  right its business in terms of better targeting ads, but all of these  social media platforms have been dealing with problems with not securing  the user data, but also allegations of going after conservatives -- bias  against conservatives.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I mean, that affects all of them.  I think the big story  with Twitter is we run venture capital funds, so early stage start-ups are  all advertising on Facebook.  We never hear someone come in and say, you  know, we're allocating our ad dollars that you're giving to us Twitter.   So, I think Twitter has to figure out, is it a news source, how does --  what's the best way to monetize its base?  </p><p> WISHINGRAD:  I 100 percent agree with you.  I mean, as an investor, I never  bought the stock, I can't buy the stock, I enjoy it.  The only prominent ad  placement is when you see what's trending and then you try to put your  sponsored show or whatever you're trying to promote in that section.  But,  it really seems to me almost more of a public good or news source than it  is a great place to drive any revenue.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it's almost as if President Trump has kept this company  relevant --</p><p> WISHINGRAD:  The best thing ever --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- and made it an incredible tool for political communication.   Curious to find out how you think that activity on Twitter and other social  media platforms will influence the midterm elections, potentially, or how  they're using ahead of the midterms?  </p><p> WISHINGRAD:  What I think we've all learned now, you have to do a little  more research than just trust necessarily what's trending; they're talk  about deep fakes now, I think.  The future is going to be really hairy and  the more trusted news outlets are going to become more important than ever  to tell you what's real and what's fake, because it's not just going to be  Twitter, comments and things that are trending.  It's literally visuals  that are going to look real that might not be real.  So, veracity is going  to be the biggest theme for the upcoming election, and all of them are  going to be vulnerable forever.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Emily.  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Well, I mean -- obviously, the implications of the election,  what happens in terms of regulation, what are people thinking about, what  are the Democrats are thinking about, what Republicans are thinking about,  what would the difference be if Democrats take control of the house?  </p><p> WISHINGRAD:  That's a good question.  I'm not sure --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You don't have to answer if you don't want to.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> WISHINGRAD:  I don't think that's necessarily a partisan issue.  Neither  side necessarily benefits from incorrect information being spread, so I  think the regulation is inevitable no matter who's in charge.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ian Wishingrad, good to see you.  </p><p> WISHINGRAD:  Thank you very much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Twitter earnings, they are coming up.  Still ahead, rolls on the  run, David Schwimmer responds in the best way to the viral photo of a look- alike rob in a liquor store.  Next hour, and Maria with Larry Ellison,  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning -- </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

That's right, Tesla profit.  The  stock, soaring, it's up double digits in premarket trading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Searching for a sender, a manhunt, underway for a person, who sent  explosive devices to prominent Democrats and CNN, plus authorities trying  to track down a package sent to Former Vice President Joe Biden.  We have  the latest on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a look at the economy, in America, from one of the biggest names in  technology, Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, sitting down with Maria  Bartiromo, in an exclusive interview, he weighs in on the political  environment to the health of the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER &amp; EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  I think the  economy is doing great, so again, I was Bill Clinton's second largest  contributor when he ran for office.  You know, I'm neither a Democrat nor a  Republican, I tend to be in the middle, which means very lonely.  There's  (INAUDIBLE) polarized.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More of Maria's exclusive must-see interview with Larry Ellison,  one of the great innovators from this country.  You have to hear what he  has to say.</p><p>All of that and so much more, coming up this morning, the Federalist  Commentary Writer, Emily Jashinsky, Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner,  Mike Murphy and the Brewer Group CEO, Former NFL Star, Jack Brewer.   Welcome one and all.  Let's get right to it.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because I have a lot much I want to talk about with Murphy, over  here.  To our top story, a potential market rebound this morning, after the  Dow and S&amp;P fell into negative territory for the year, yesterday.</p><p>This is Twitter.  It is set to release its quarterly earnings later this  morning, other tech giants on deck, for today, include Amazon and Google's  parent company, Alphabet.  They report their earnings after the market  closed today.  Mike, what do you make of these earnings, what does the  market need to see to firm up here?</p><p>MURPHY:  Well, clearly, companies are getting cheaper than they were, a  month ago.  We hit new highs last month.  Now, we have this major drawdown  10 percent, in the markets.  Earnings are what I'm looking at.</p><p>You see what Microsoft put out yesterday.  Those numbers were very good, I  won't say outstanding, but enough to not cause a major selloff in the  stock, get sold down to $98.00, right after the earnings were announced.</p><p>But now, if you see this morning, it's firmed up in the low 100s, that's  enough for me to say I want to buy Microsoft on a pullback, and look for  the same from Amazon, same from Google.  If the growth story is still  intact, this is a buying opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If the growth story is still intact.  So, it was -- what  triggered the selloff to start the month of October.  It was to say -- is  really a replay in some ways of what we saw earlier this year.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was worries about inflation, higher wages and rising interest  rates.  But that hasn't been the story lately, because you saw -- money has  been going into treasuries, money went a little bit of money went into  treasuries yesterday, the 10-year -- the yield was down slightly.</p><p>So what is it, is it worries about global growth and corporate profits?  We  have been talking about the revenue story, and I was looking at the revenue  miss number, so, so far, through the quarter, we have 38 percent of  companies that have missed revenue expectations, which is the biggest  percentage this year.</p><p>MURPHY:  There's been a story going on and a lot of people focusing on peak  earnings, this is good as it gets.  Is it going to get worse from here?   So, a lot of people, I think, taking some money off the table after these  big run-ups we've seen.</p><p>I don't see that.  I see solid earnings and it's really the companies that  have been -- I'm not focusing on a company like Ford that announced  yesterday, I'm focusing on the companies where we've seen the growth.  So  that's the big tech, that's Microsoft, that's Google, that's Amazon, later  today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let me mention Microsoft and Tesla, we -- people,  investors love to hate Tesla, so Microsoft, Mike was talking about this,  beat revenue and profit estimates based on its cloud-computing growth and  Tesla defied Wall Street expectations, posting a record profit.</p><p>Just your thoughts on Tesla because they moved up their earnings  announcement, so I personally assume that they were going to report a  quarterly profit, that they had something to crow about and indeed, they  did.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, interesting because, you know, when the -- when Elon Musk  announced that he was moving the earnings up, a lot of, like, the talk  there, was that he was doing that to attack the Shorts, that a lot of  Shorts had bought weekly puts, made weekly bets against his company for  next week, when he was going to announce.</p><p>In order to do that, you have to pay up a lot for those put options,  because there's an earning's announcement coming in there.  So, by moving  the earnings to this week, a short-seller would immediately lose 70 to 80  percent of the value when the bets he made against Elon Musk's company.</p><p>So, bring it forward and then top it off, you have profitability and great  numbers.  This, to me, Tesla right here, after this huge rally, isn't  something you'd want to jump into.  Yesterday was the time to buy Tesla.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm looking at the results, particularly it is cash, people  concerned about the level of debt, it's free cash flow came in much higher  than expectations.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's about $881 million, its total cash on hand, its $3 billion.   Its accounts payable did also rise, but in terms of -- and I'm going to get  to Jack and Emily, but in terms of its financial position, it looks better  here.</p><p>MURPHY:  Looks better.  And remember, they have a big bond payment that  they have to -- that's coming up.  So, you know, early next year, the cash  position is going to get more and more focused on, so this is a great start  for Elon Musk, but he's going to have to continue this type of movement.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP:  So, in regard to Tesla, because  obviously, we see everything that's going on outside with Elon Musk and  everyone is just going back and forth, for me personally,  I don't think  this is going to last very long, but how -- </p><p>MURPHY:  back and forth.</p><p>BREWER:  I don't think -- I don't think the growth of the company is going  to continue to last as long.  I'm scared about the first quarter of next  year, when those convertible notes come due, I wonder how they are going to  be able to react there and will they be able to continue with the earnings  growth.</p><p>But beyond that, in the broader market, here, as you look, and Dagen, you  mentioned 38 percent of the companies have missed earnings.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Revenue.</p><p>BREWER:  Revenue, excuse me.  I'm seeing a lot of companies that I didn't  expect to hit their earnings growth -- hit their earnings growth.  So, what  does that mean for our economy, is this going to be something as we go into  the first of the year, will we see more and more companies that are  expected not to grow, actually hitting their earnings numbers?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think the economy is doing great right now, it's booming, things  are moving in the right direction, so that's where you want to be -- if you  want to focus on that, that's something to focus on right now, is the  economy.</p><p>But, when you're investing, you're talking about individual stocks,  individual companies within the economy, so I don't want to focus on ones - - not the old-school ones, where they had a good quarter or they're going  to put up two good quarters.  I want to focus on the long-term growth  stories and that's been for the most part, big tech.</p><p>BREWER:  But do you rebalance, right now?  If you're a normal investor, do  you -- what do you do if you're -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the market just rebalanced.</p><p>MURPHY:  I had a -- I had a few friends reached out to me last night,  saying things like, are we going to be OK?  What should we do here?  That  tells me that the selling's probably getting a little bit overdone.  If you  have a long term plan, leave it alone.  If you are retiring in two years or  three years, and this pullback has you, losing sleep, rebalance right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President keeps talking about the Federal Reserve chief and  the Fed, making a mistake, but every time he does that, I keep thinking  about all those responsible people, those savers, who basically gotten  screwed by the Federal Reserves of cheap and easy money policy over the  last -- more than a decade.</p><p>And so, I think about them.  I'm like, the people are actually -- don't  hate higher rates here, in fact, it makes people feel more confident when  they see particularly longer-term interest rates going up.  I mean, it  sounds, kind of, upside down and backwards.</p><p>But I want to get to politics, speaking of the President, because he was on  the campaign trail last night, in Wisconsin, hitting a number of issues  including the mail bombs targeting high-ranking Democrats and CNN.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The Federal government is  conducting an aggressive investigation, and we will find those responsible,  and we will bring them to justice, hopefully, very quickly.  Any acts or  threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself.</p><p>Early voting is now underway, so get out and vote, the decision in this  election is so clear all over the country.  Republicans are for lower  taxes, less regulations and more economic freedom, and that's a good thing.   That's a good thing.</p><p>The Democrats are for higher taxes, more regulation and more top-down  government control.  We don't have borders, we don't have a country, and we  have the greatest country on earth, OK?</p><p>Republicans know that the rule of law is essential to national sovereignty,  and we know that immigration enforcement is essential to public safety,  National Security and the protection of American jobs, wages and public  benefits.</p><p>The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years, 5-0  years, 50.  Manufacturing confidence has reached an all-time high in the  history of our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Emily, your take on the President last night and so much  happening whether it's the market selloff to potentially impact the midterm  elections, now less than two weeks away, and now, these pipe bombs sent to  prominent Democrats?</p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Right.  Two big  stories yesterday, and it's -- I was born and raised in Wisconsin.  And he  was, last night, really deep in the heart of Trump country.  What's  interesting is, this is the state where Ted Cruz won the Republican  primary, where Donald Trump won by less than one percentage point over  Hillary Clinton.</p><p>And yet he's -- when he's in Wisconsin -- when he's in rural Wisconsin,  these are people who were hit hard by trade policies of years past, paper  mills have shattered.  They're in a lot -- there are a lot of problems up  there.</p><p>And so, for him to come to the state, at a time when the Wisconsin Senate  candidate, Leah Vukmir, is not expected to win, she's, you know, down in  the polls.</p><p>You risk -- you risk boosting turnout in Milwaukee and Madison and helping  Tammy Baldwin, but at the same time, when you see all of these people, in a  state like Wisconsin, flock to this New York billionaire, at a rally, it's  a really powerful statement and what he's been able to do in some of these  rural communities.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And these events, though, we don't -- I can't recall a  major market selloff like this, right ahead of midterm elections before,  not in recent history.</p><p>MURPHY:  Midterms maybe, but we did selloff going into the last  presidential election, if you remember.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, we saw -- right, because -- and then again, rally, when  it became clear that President Trump was going to win, so pro-growth  policies, we will discuss as the morning moves on.</p><p>A nationwide manhunt, meantime, underway after explosive devices were sent  to prominent Democrats and CNN, we have the latest on the investigation,  including what was found inside those packages.  </p><p>Plus, competition with China, stay with us for Maria's exclusive interview  with Oracle Founder Larry Ellison.  Hear what he says about protecting  American tech.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  An intense nationwide manhunt, underway, after pipe bombs were  sent to prominent Democrats as well as CNN.  Cheryl Casone has the details.   Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, good morning, Dagen.   While at least eight packages were sent in total, one of them addressed to  former President Barack Obama.  The Secret Service says that the package  with an explosive device was intercepted before it could make it to his  home in Washington, D.C., as well as another that was sent to former  President Bill and Hillary Clinton's New York home.  Former Attorney  General Eric Holder had one addressed to him, and one bearing the name of  John Brennan, the former CIA Director who publicly sparred with the  President, that package meant for Brennan was delivered to CNN, prompting  the network to evacuate their New York offices at Time Warner Center.</p><p>Now, officials say the devices made with PVC pipe were packed with shards  of glass.  The President condemning the attempted attacks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our  Democracy itself.  No nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the  threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, coercion, or  control.</p><p>CASONE:  Police also are looking into suspicious packages mailed to  Congresswoman Maxine Waters in Washington and in California, and another  one that was addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden.  Investigators  believe this is related to another, sent to George Soros, a billionaire  liberal donor who lives in New York.  Now, the FBI says this could be the  work of one person or a group because all packages are similar, manila  envelopes, forever stamps, and the return address of Democratic  Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  A lot of intense things happening  yesterday.  Dagen, over to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Indeed, Cheryl, thank you for that update, and we'll bring you  more as it develops as the morning moves on.  But Emily, onto this, because  this is -- the Wall Street Journal has an editorial today called the  politics of pipe bombs, and they say -- one of the -- one of the things  that they note, one that took years literally trying to find out who sent  those anthrax-laced letters that killed several people after back in 2001.   Especially so close to an election, the public should discount unconfirmed  leaks about suspects or motives and the political rhetoric that you're  hearing about these explosive devices.</p><p>JASHINSKY:  Yes, I think that's probably true.  But, I mean, I think in  general, turning down the volume couldn't hurt anyone -- turning down the  volume on the anger and the -- you know, whatever the -- whatever the  polarized rhetoric couldn't hurt any of us.  But I think it's probably wise  at this point, unless, you know, there may be some very clear information  that emerges, that could be the case, there were a lot of package that were  sent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And because the devices were not detonated, that would  make it -- it makes the job of the FBI much easier to track down.</p><p>JASHINSKY:  And it should be fairly easy.  I mean, these are in Virginia  right now being analyzed.  And so, it should be fairly easy for them to  determine whether they were viable to begin with, whether these were things  that were actually intended to explode or whether these were fakes, that I  mean, they should be able to figure that out soon.</p><p>MURPHY:  Either way from a political standpoint, like, this is a lunatic,  whether whatever political party they are part of, or whatever they were  trying to accomplish, it's a crazy person that we -- no one wants to be  associated with in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And no one wants to wish harm or bring harm to anybody  in this country.  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Nobody asked for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A rational sane person.  Exactly.  However, I will point out  that Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi did put out a  statement saying Mr. Trump's words bring hollow until he reverses his  statements that condone acts of violence.  And The Journal editorial  writes, \"As if this is a moment to settle political scores.\"  So, some  people can't avoid making them political.</p><p>BREWER:  They can't.  And I, you know, I flew in last night, and was  watching the various networks, and I was just blown away by the fact that  every single person took President Trump's speech and made it as if he was  the one inciting all of the violence, disregard the fact that we've had  Republicans shot on baseball fields in D.C.  I mean, come on, guys, this is  both sides.  People need to take a step back.  But whenever you start to  point the blame at someone else like your mom and dad always told you, you  got to look back at yourself first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And to quote President Obama after the shooting in Tucson, where  Gabby -- the one in which Gabby Giffords or Congresswoman Gabby Giffords  was injured, he said the lack of civility in politics was not to blame, and  he cautioned against a political impulse to quote, lay the blame for all  that ails the world at the feet of those who happened to think differently  than we do.  So, that bears repeating on this day.  </p><p>Coming up, airline hack, Cathay Pacific reporting more than 9 million  customers may have had their data compromised.  The latest, next.  Plus,  reliability tanking, Tesla reporting better-than-expected -- well, better- than-expected numbers for the quarter.  It actually reported earnings with  a car company among several that has slipped in customer reliability.   We'll bring you that story ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A view from the top, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison sitting  down in an exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo.  Take a listen to what  he says about a range of issues including his company, Amazon, and  competition with China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ELLISON:  The Oracle database manages most of the world's data.  Today, 10  years ago, nothing has changed, all of the world's important valuable data  is in the Oracle Database, they're not in Amazon's database.  Let me tell  you an interesting fact, Amazon does not use AWS to run their business,  Amazon runs their entire business on top of Oracle, on top of the Oracle  database.  They have been unable to migrate to AWS because it's not good  enough.  We have serious competition going on with China.  I'm on team USA,  I would like us to be successful, I'd like us to develop and protect our  technologies, I think we have to do that.  I think we have to invest on --  invest on our economy and grow our economy so we can compete with the first  serious -- the first serious threat, if you will, our first serious  competitor we've had since the 1930s.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Plus, Maria, also, before she sat down with Larry Ellison, she  first spoke with Oracle Co-CEO Mark Hurd, and asked him about growth.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are worried about growth, the market is selling off this  week, it's been a volatile situation, as people question whether or not  these good economic times are sustainable.  You've got the leading  enterprise companies on Oracle software using Oracle applications, you  would know best.  What are you seeing, are you seeing a pullback?</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE:  No, I wouldn't say that.  I think there's always  concerns that the Fed sometimes -- I think I've heard a stat where 36 --  out of 36 quarters in a row, they've overestimated growth.  And sometimes  interest rates moves -- sort of moved ahead of the growth, and in some  ways, as you know, can constrict growth.  And so, I think there's some  concern about what happens to interest rates.  But still today, if you have  good projects people are investing, the economy certainly in this country  is good, growth in this country is solid, particularly in small and medium  business.  We talk a lot about global companies, and companies that reach  outside of the United States, but if you look inside the United States,  companies' primary business is domestic, those companies are doing quite  well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Be sure to stay with us for Maria's exclusive in-depth interview  with Oracle Founder Larry Ellison at 7:00 and 8:00, so in both of those  hours.  This is a man you never hear from, but who did he choose to sit  down with, Maria Bartiromo.

We'll  introduce you to an IPA, with a peanuty twist.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, health care in focus, President Trump will  outline a plan to lower health care costs this afternoon, ahead of the  midterms.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP:  Republicans want to create better health care through more  choice, lower drug prices and you will see, very soon, drug prices will go  plunging downward, you wait, you watch.  It's all in motion.  And we've  created much more competition.  Democrats want socialist health care, where  private plans are outlawed and abolished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Recent Fox News Poll shows that health care is, indeed, the  number one issue motivating voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.</p><p>Joining me now, Democratic Strategist, Jessica Ehrlich, along with  Republican Strategist and Former Trump Campaign Data and Strategy Director,  Matt Braynard, Jessica, your reaction to the President's plan and that  might impact people who are voting based on health care?</p><p>JESSICA EHRLICH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I would love to see lower  health care costs especially lower pharmaceutical costs, I think, everyone  would like to see that, but the details of this plan have yet to be  revealed.</p><p>And the last two years, given the majority in both the House and the Senate  that the President has enjoyed, nothing has been done so far, which I'm  sure has frustrated Republicans, but it's also frustrated Democrats and  voters, in general.</p><p>So, I'm highly dubious and skeptical that there's anything, you know --  this is the emperor's new clothes, when it comes to an actual plan that's  going to be implemented.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Matt, I will point this out, in terms of bringing down  prescription drug costs, that this year, the FDA has approved a record  number of generic drugs so far this year, and that is another -- delivering  on another promise is getting government out of the way.</p><p>And this has been one of the things that, for years, health care analysts  have been talking about, so there is that, as well, and then, in Obamacare,  the, kind of, standard plan in Obamacare, the premium is actually for next  year, going to be slightly lower than it was last year.</p><p>So, there are some things going on that could influence voters.</p><p>MATT BRAYNARD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Yes.  And I need to correct what my  colleague here just said.  There was tremendous progress made in health  care these last two years, because Trump and the Republicans repealed the  most egregious violation of individual rights in Obamacare was and getting  rid of the individual mandate, that is gone.</p><p>So, that is a substantial advance.  That was a regressive tax on our poor  citizens, and that's no more thanks to this president.  I'm very excited to  see what this plan is going to bring.  We do know that the health care  issue was, what cost the Democrats control of Congress in 2010.  So, going  on the offense on this issue, is only going to yield tremendous dividends  for our side.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jessica, I'll get your reaction to that, because a lot of the --  a lot of the ads -- and Democrats have roughly -- half the ads that  Democrats have been running in the midterm elections are related to health  care and a lot of them focused on Republicans want to repeal the coverage  for pre-existing conditions.</p><p>It's something that hasn't happened, but nevertheless, they've made that a  talking point.</p><p>EHRLICH:  Well, I mean, I think that's part of the frustration on both  sides, right?  So, for a lot of Democrats and even a tremendous number of  moderate Republicans and independent voters, the repeal of the Obamacare in  its full state, the abolition of the pre-existing conditions, as a pre- requisite for your health care.</p><p>These are things that get people out to the polls, that have energized  people that we're seeing in this, I think, what's going to be record  turnouts for midterm elections.  Contrary, yes, you can hold on to, oh,  they took away, you know, they abolished part of this one aspect of  Obamacare.</p><p>But the Republicans came in on this wave, with Trump, saying, they were  going to appeal it completely and they weren't able to do that, they  created a new plan that they could also -- </p><p>BRAYNARD:  With no help from Democrats.</p><p>EHRLICH:  with their own majority.  So, these are the facts.  And you can  spin them any way you want to, but it's a disappointment to a lot of  people, yes, it does get people to the polls and we're going to see that  this time around.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll say this, it's a disappointment that they've got rid of a  tax on people, I don't know if people see that as a disappoint, but I'll  get your response and I want to move on.</p><p>EHRLICH:  People who wanted Obamacare abolished were disappointed that it  wasn't accomplished.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go ahead, Matt.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  There was -- there was --Obamacare was not repealed and  replaced, the plan that covers pre-existing conditions because of one  arrogant Republican senator.  We're likely going to be fixing that in this  next Congress.</p><p>And it's very disingenuous to be running ads saying that Republicans, these  horrible Republicans are going to get rid of pre-existing condition  coverage, when you just made the point that we've had control for the last  two years, so why haven't we done it yet?</p><p>These ads are really making the presumption that voters are very stupid and  I don't think they're going to succeed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Moving onto immigration, there's a caravan of thousands of  migrants heading to the United States from Honduras.  The President,  saying, that he will send as many troops as possible, to block them from  entering our country.</p><p>Matt, how does this going to impact voters, because President Trump has  really tried to make -- use this and make immigration a more important  issue coming up ahead of the midterms?</p><p>BRAYNARD:  Look, if you want to have the potential to break the land speed  record here on earth, ask a Democrat, on camera, what they think about this  problem and they'll disappear before your eyes.  We've already seen some of  their leading candidates like Beto O'Rourke, take a pass on the question.</p><p>Republicans around the country need to get footage of this caravan, in  their television ads, and make it clear that we are the ones that are going  to stop it.  The other party is AWOL because they see this as an  opportunity to bring in more potential voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jessica, your response to that, because I hear a lot of the  rhetoric from some Democrats, some people on the left, loud prominent  voices, saying that President Trump is trying to stoke fear among the  voters, and that he's using these people to basically gin up their fears.</p><p>And I pushed back on that.  This is really an issue do you believe in open  borders or not?  So, it's not based on fear, it's based on President Trump  asking people if they believe in the rule of law and our immigration laws  that are on the books.</p><p>BRAYNARD:  It's based on footage.  They can see with their own eyes.</p><p>EHRLICH:  I disagree.  I think it's the opposite, because contrary to  Democrats disappearing on this issue, there was even, you know -- when we  were talking about this last night on air, they were showing clips of  President Obama, being very strong, actually, that we need to have border  security and enforce the laws that are on the books, and that was proven in  his record of deportations.</p><p>The issue that's happened is that there's rhetoric that's been out there  that gins up people.  Immigration is an issue and the fear of immigrants  flooding into the country uncontrolled, or in some way, lose on the  streets, that is an issue with voters, no question.</p><p>And it certainly gets out Trump's voters and it encourages them to vote.   That's why he's been saying at his rallies, talking about border security  in the wall, as well as talking about the Supreme Court nominations.  These  are things that incite his voters.</p><p>However, there's no proof that Democrats want, you know, completely open,  fluid borders that that's happened, that that happened under any of the  administrations --</p><p>BRAYNARD:  Other than how they governed in the last eight years.</p><p>EHRLICH:  What's happened is that we have yet to have anything, again, come  out of the last two years that has changed the issue where we continue to  have.  There is yet to be a piece of legislation from the President's  office or from the House or the Senate that are Republican-controlled, that  have fixed the problem that we currently have.  These people are continuing  to come.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Matt, I will -- I will hit on that.  But I do want to point out  that a lot of prominent Democrats talk repeatedly about abolishing ICE.   That we went from people being upset about the family separations at the  border, to we need to get rid of ICE, which actually stops human and child  trafficking.</p><p>So, again, to say that some Democrats don't believe in that, that's  inaccurate, that some people talk about that repeatedly, who are running  for office, but Matt --</p><p>EHRLICH:  There are people running for office who talk about that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAYNARD:  But you referenced Obama.  He is nor running for office.   Where's Schumer on the issue?  Where's Pelosi on the issue?</p><p>EHRLICH:  It's the same between -- there are -- the people -- there are  Democrats and Republicans on both sides, who say things that are of one  extreme or the other.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Matt -- I want to get Matt's -- Jessica -- </p><p>EHRLICH:  That is not referred to all Democrats or all Republicans.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to ask Matt, one final word, with President Trump making  immigration an issue, Matt, does it highlight -- because he's not running  for re-election, it is -- it is Republicans --</p><p>BRAYNARD:  He is running for re-election.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, well, the people are going to the polls, Matt, in less than  two weeks, to vote on people in Congress and in the Senate.  Does it  highlight the fact that the Republicans haven't done that much on  immigration?  They have not fully funded his wall and they have not put  financial restrictions on funding for sanctuary cities.  Does it hurt them  potentially, rather than help Republicans in less than two weeks?</p><p>BRAYNARD:  No, and I want to -- no, not at all.  Because we are in, at  least, in my lifetime, the third re-alignment of the Republican Party, the  Congress that comes back, whether we control both Houses or not, is going  to be the Trump Republican Party.</p><p>Right now, we are dealing with the dead-enders of the Paul Ryan era, who  are basically in the pockets of, you know, China and the Chamber of  Commerce.  And so, they've been an obstruction in many ways, to this  president, but the new Republicans that are coming in, this is the Trump  Republican Party, and that's going to change.  So, I look forward to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  We've got to -- Matt, we've got to go for breaking  news.  Thank you both for having a civil conversation.</p><p>EHRLICH:  Thanks, good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jessica and Matt, good morning to you both.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news right now, you are looking live at pictures in New  York City.  That is the New York City Police Department transporting a  suspicious package found in lower Manhattan.  The neighborhood is the  Tribeca Neighborhood, that is north of the World Trade Center, the world  financial center.  This is in the Tribeca Neighborhood.  </p><p>This follows a series of explosive devices that were found across the  country sent to prominent Democrats and CNN, addressed to John Brennan at  CNN.  It's not unclear if this is related but the New York City Police  Department has responded to reports of a suspicious package.  This is in  Tribeca in the vicinity of Greenwich and Franklin streets in Tribeca, lower  Manhattan.  We will bring you more developments as we get it, but this as  New Yorkers are going to work this morning.  </p><p>This package already in transit, this is in -- this is in the transport  vehicle used for explosive devices, so it's being transported to, I  believe, it's in the Bronx where this facility is, where the NYPD takes  these types of packages suspicious.  But, again, this was found down in  Tribeca, near Greenwich and Franklin.  It's worth-noting that this is also  not just a residential neighborhood but also a busy financial area, there's  one Citigroup building that's across the street from where the suspicious  package was said to be found.  We will bring you more as we get it.  New  York City Police Department transporting that suspicious package found in  lower Manhattan.  </p><p>Moving onto this, the Director of the CIA has reportedly heard the audio of  the killing Journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Cheryl Casone has details on this  developing story, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  It is developing as well, Dagen, good morning.  Again, CIA  Director Gina Haspel is Turkey to investigate the murder that took place in  the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.  Turkish officials through multiple leaks  to the media have touted the existence of audiotape of Khashoggi's killing.   While the Washington Post has reported that Haspel has heard it, which a  source describes as compelling.  And Haspel is due back in Washington today  to brief President Trump on what she heard, what she learned.  Meanwhile,  Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, calling the killing \"a  heinous crime\" that cannot be justified.  He made the comments at the  Future Investment Initiative, that has been, of course, overshadowed by the  murder of Jamal Khashoggi.  </p><p>Well, another headline we're following for you this morning.  A data breach  at Cathay Pacific, the Asian airline confirming the hack may have  compromised a personal information of nearly 10 million passengers.  That  data would include e-mail addresses, passport numbers and date of births.   Cathay Pacific apologizing, it's contacting passengers who may have been  affected and also says there's no evidence, any personal data may have been  misused.  Taking a look at shares of Cathay Pacific, the stock is actually  down 13 percent so far for the year.</p><p>Well, American car brands slipping in annual reliability rankings published  by consumer reports.  Ford is at number 18, that's down three slots from  last year, followed by General Motors, Buick brand which fell out of the  top 10.  G.M., Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands, also losing ground.  Tesla  fell six places, 27th by the way.  Meanwhile Lexus, Toyota's luxury brand,  regained its title as the most reliable brand.  Shares of Toyota are down  about seven percent so far this year.  </p><p>And then, finally, there was this to leave you with, guys. Mr. Peanut wants  you to have your peanuts and drink them at the same time.  Planters is  teaming up with Chicago's Noon Whistle Brewery to bring you a peanut- flavored beer.  It's called Mr. IPA-nut -- there's the can.  The new brew  is going to have all of the, all of the familiar (INAUDIBLE) you get with  an IPA, but it's also going to have Planters iconic honey roasted peanut  flavor and a little bit of salt as well.  The beer is going to be released  on October 27th, just in time for National Beer Day.  The catch, you have  to head to Illinois if you want a sip, and of course, that day, I already  checked, is a Saturday, Dagen, unfortunately for us onset.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Cool car there.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Twitter earnings out in moments.  We'll break down  the numbers and look at what role social media is playing in the upcoming  midterm elections.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news to bring you.  This is a live look at New York  City Police Department transporting a suspicious package found in lower  Manhattan in the Tribeca neighborhood.  This is in the vicinity of  Greenwich and Franklin street, this follows a series of explosive devices  that were found across the country sent to prominent Democrats and CNN.   It's not unclear if this is related but this package was found near the  Tribeca Grill, that is the restaurant long associated with Robert de Niro,  long owned by Robert de Niro.  So, again, that package, suspicious package  in transit to the explosive disposal unit of the New York City Police  Department.  </p><p>Moving onto tech earnings, they're in focus this morning.  Twitter is set  to report its results momentarily.  The stock moving up, it's up about 3- 1/2 percent at the moment.  Joining me now is Tech Analyst and Big Eyed  Wish Founder Ian Wishingrad.  Ian, good to see you this morning.  What are  you watching for in Twitter's earnings?  </p><p>IAN WISHINGRAD, FOUNDER, BIG EYED WISH:  Good to see you this morning, as  well.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sorry, I didn't mean to skip over good morning.  </p><p>WISHINGRAD:  So, everyone is estimating that they're going to have good  numbers from a business standpoint.  I think there's just going to be a  reality check on what kind of business it really is.  There are certain  businesses that have billions of users like the Facebook and those  Instagram, and those are these incredible unicorns that people really want  to be able to put a ton of add dollars into.  Twitter, I think, unlike  Snapchat, have much smaller user bases, so people are just going to have to  reset their expectations, deal with their relatively modest user base and  how they're able to monetize.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I point at Mike Murphy, because again, but Twitter has tried to  right its business in terms of better targeting ads, but all of these  social media platforms have been dealing with problems with not securing  the user data, but also allegations of going after conservatives -- bias  against conservatives.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I mean, that affects all of them.  I think the big story  with Twitter is we run venture capital funds, so early stage start-ups are  all advertising on Facebook.  We never hear someone come in and say, you  know, we're allocating our ad dollars that you're giving to us Twitter.   So, I think Twitter has to figure out, is it a news source, how does --  what's the best way to monetize its base?  </p><p>WISHINGRAD:  I 100 percent agree with you.  I mean, as an investor, I never  bought the stock, I can't buy the stock, I enjoy it.  The only prominent ad  placement is when you see what's trending and then you try to put your  sponsored show or whatever you're trying to promote in that section.  But,  it really seems to me almost more of a public good or news source than it  is a great place to drive any revenue.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's almost as if President Trump has kept this company  relevant --</p><p>WISHINGRAD:  The best thing ever --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and made it an incredible tool for political communication.   Curious to find out how you think that activity on Twitter and other social  media platforms will influence the midterm elections, potentially, or how  they're using ahead of the midterms?  </p><p>WISHINGRAD:  What I think we've all learned now, you have to do a little  more research than just trust necessarily what's trending; they're talk  about deep fakes now, I think.  The future is going to be really hairy and  the more trusted news outlets are going to become more important than ever  to tell you what's real and what's fake, because it's not just going to be  Twitter, comments and things that are trending.  It's literally visuals  that are going to look real that might not be real.  So, veracity is going  to be the biggest theme for the upcoming election, and all of them are  going to be vulnerable forever.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Emily.  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Well, I mean -- obviously, the implications of the election,  what happens in terms of regulation, what are people thinking about, what  are the Democrats are thinking about, what Republicans are thinking about,  what would the difference be if Democrats take control of the house?  </p><p>WISHINGRAD:  That's a good question.  I'm not sure --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You don't have to answer if you don't want to.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WISHINGRAD:  I don't think that's necessarily a partisan issue.  Neither  side necessarily benefits from incorrect information being spread, so I  think the regulation is inevitable no matter who's in charge.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ian Wishingrad, good to see you.  </p><p>WISHINGRAD:  Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Twitter earnings, they are coming up.  Still ahead, rolls on the  run, David Schwimmer responds in the best way to the viral photo of a look- alike rob in a liquor store.  Next hour, and Maria with Larry Ellison,  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning -- </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

You know, I'm neither a Democrat nor a Republican, I tend to be in the middle, which means very lonely. There's (INAUDIBLE) polarized.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: More of Maria's exclusive must-see interview with Larry Ellison, one of the great innovators from this country. You have to hear what he has to say.</p><p>All of that and so much more, coming up this morning, the Federalist Commentary Writer, Emily Jashinsky, Rosecliff CEO and Managing Partner, Mike Murphy and the Brewer Group CEO, Former NFL Star, Jack Brewer. Welcome one and all. Let's get right to it.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF: Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because I have a lot much I want to talk about with Murphy, over here. To our top story, a potential market rebound this morning, after the Dow and S&amp;P fell into negative territory for the year, yesterday.</p><p>This is Twitter. It is set to release its quarterly earnings later this morning, other tech giants on deck, for today, include Amazon and Google's parent company, Alphabet. They report their earnings after the market closed today. Mike, what do you make of these earnings, what does the market need to see to firm up here?</p><p>MURPHY: Well, clearly, companies are getting cheaper than they were, a month ago. We hit new highs last month. Now, we have this major drawdown 10 percent, in the markets. Earnings are what I'm looking at.</p><p>You see what Microsoft put out yesterday. Those numbers were very good, I won't say outstanding, but enough to not cause a major selloff in the stock, get sold down to $98.00, right after the earnings were announced.</p><p>But now, if you see this morning, it's firmed up in the low 100s, that's enough for me to say I want to buy Microsoft on a pullback, and look for the same from Amazon, same from Google. If the growth story is still intact, this is a buying opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If the growth story is still intact. So, it was -- what triggered the selloff to start the month of October. It was to say -- is really a replay in some ways of what we saw earlier this year.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was worries about inflation, higher wages and rising interest rates. But that hasn't been the story lately, because you saw -- money has been going into treasuries, money went a little bit of money went into treasuries yesterday, the 10-year -- the yield was down slightly.</p><p>So what is it, is it worries about global growth and corporate profits? We have been talking about the revenue story, and I was looking at the revenue miss number, so, so far, through the quarter, we have 38 percent of companies that have missed revenue expectations, which is the biggest percentage this year.</p><p>MURPHY: There's been a story going on and a lot of people focusing on peak earnings, this is good as it gets. Is it going to get worse from here? So, a lot of people, I think, taking some money off the table after these big run-ups we've seen.</p><p>I don't see that. I see solid earnings and it's really the companies that have been -- I'm not focusing on a company like Ford that announced yesterday, I'm focusing on the companies where we've seen the growth. So that's the big tech, that's Microsoft, that's Google, that's Amazon, later today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, let me mention Microsoft and Tesla, we -- people, investors love to hate Tesla, so Microsoft, Mike was talking about this, beat revenue and profit estimates based on its cloud-computing growth and Tesla defied Wall Street expectations, posting a record profit.</p><p>Just your thoughts on Tesla because they moved up their earnings announcement, so I personally assume that they were going to report a quarterly profit, that they had something to crow about and indeed, they did.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes, interesting because, you know, when the -- when Elon Musk announced that he was moving the earnings up, a lot of, like, the talk there, was that he was doing that to attack the Shorts, that a lot of Shorts had bought weekly puts, made weekly bets against his company for next week, when he was going to announce.</p><p>In order to do that, you have to pay up a lot for those put options, because there's an earning's announcement coming in there. So, by moving the earnings to this week, a short-seller would immediately lose 70 to 80 percent of the value when the bets he made against Elon Musk's company.</p><p>So, bring it forward and then top it off, you have profitability and great numbers. This, to me, Tesla right here, after this huge rally, isn't something you'd want to jump into. Yesterday was the time to buy Tesla.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm looking at the results, particularly it is cash, people concerned about the level of debt, it's free cash flow came in much higher than expectations.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's about $881 million, its total cash on hand, its $3 billion. Its accounts payable did also rise, but in terms of -- and I'm going to get to Jack and Emily, but in terms of its financial position, it looks better here.</p><p>MURPHY: Looks better. And remember, they have a big bond payment that they have to -- that's coming up. So, you know, early next year, the cash position is going to get more and more focused on, so this is a great start for Elon Musk, but he's going to have to continue this type of movement.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP: So, in regard to Tesla, because obviously, we see everything that's going on outside with Elon Musk and everyone is just going back and forth, for me personally, I don't think this is going to last very long, but how --</p><p>MURPHY: back and forth.</p><p>BREWER: I don't think -- I don't think the growth of the company is going to continue to last as long. I'm scared about the first quarter of next year, when those convertible notes come due, I wonder how they are going to be able to react there and will they be able to continue with the earnings growth.</p><p>But beyond that, in the broader market, here, as you look, and Dagen, you mentioned 38 percent of the companies have missed earnings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Revenue.</p><p>BREWER: Revenue, excuse me. I'm seeing a lot of companies that I didn't expect to hit their earnings growth -- hit their earnings growth. So, what does that mean for our economy, is this going to be something as we go into the first of the year, will we see more and more companies that are expected not to grow, actually hitting their earnings numbers?</p><p>MURPHY: I think the economy is doing great right now, it's booming, things are moving in the right direction, so that's where you want to be -- if you want to focus on that, that's something to focus on right now, is the economy.</p><p>But, when you're investing, you're talking about individual stocks, individual companies within the economy, so I don't want to focus on ones - - not the old-school ones, where they had a good quarter or they're going to put up two good quarters. I want to focus on the long-term growth stories and that's been for the most part, big tech.</p><p>BREWER: But do you rebalance, right now? If you're a normal investor, do you -- what do you do if you're --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because the market just rebalanced.</p><p>MURPHY: I had a -- I had a few friends reached out to me last night, saying things like, are we going to be OK? What should we do here? That tells me that the selling's probably getting a little bit overdone. If you have a long term plan, leave it alone. If you are retiring in two years or three years, and this pullback has you, losing sleep, rebalance right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The President keeps talking about the Federal Reserve chief and the Fed, making a mistake, but every time he does that, I keep thinking about all those responsible people, those savers, who basically gotten screwed by the Federal Reserves of cheap and easy money policy over the last -- more than a decade.</p><p>And so, I think about them. I'm like, the people are actually -- don't hate higher rates here, in fact, it makes people feel more confident when they see particularly longer-term interest rates going up. I mean, it sounds, kind of, upside down and backwards.</p><p>But I want to get to politics, speaking of the President, because he was on the campaign trail last night, in Wisconsin, hitting a number of issues including the mail bombs targeting high-ranking Democrats and CNN.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Federal government is conducting an aggressive investigation, and we will find those responsible, and we will bring them to justice, hopefully, very quickly. Any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself.</p><p>Early voting is now underway, so get out and vote, the decision in this election is so clear all over the country. Republicans are for lower taxes, less regulations and more economic freedom, and that's a good thing. That's a good thing.</p><p>The Democrats are for higher taxes, more regulation and more top-down government control. We don't have borders, we don't have a country, and we have the greatest country on earth, OK?</p><p>Republicans know that the rule of law is essential to national sovereignty, and we know that immigration enforcement is essential to public safety, National Security and the protection of American jobs, wages and public benefits.</p><p>The unemployment rate just fell to the lowest level in over 50 years, 5-0 years, 50. Manufacturing confidence has reached an all-time high in the history of our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Emily, your take on the President last night and so much happening whether it's the market selloff to potentially impact the midterm elections, now less than two weeks away, and now, these pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats?</p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, COMMENTARY WRITER, THE FEDERALIST: Right. Two big stories yesterday, and it's -- I was born and raised in Wisconsin. And he was, last night, really deep in the heart of Trump country. What's interesting is, this is the state where Ted Cruz won the Republican primary, where Donald Trump won by less than one percentage point over Hillary Clinton.</p><p>And yet he's -- when he's in Wisconsin -- when he's in rural Wisconsin, these are people who were hit hard by trade policies of years past, paper mills have shattered. They're in a lot -- there are a lot of problems up there.</p><p>And so, for him to come to the state, at a time when the Wisconsin Senate candidate, Leah Vukmir, is not expected to win, she's, you know, down in the polls.</p><p>You risk -- you risk boosting turnout in Milwaukee and Madison and helping Tammy Baldwin, but at the same time, when you see all of these people, in a state like Wisconsin, flock to this New York billionaire, at a rally, it's a really powerful statement and what he's been able to do in some of these rural communities.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And these events, though, we don't -- I can't recall a major market selloff like this, right ahead of midterm elections before, not in recent history.</p><p>MURPHY: Midterms maybe, but we did selloff going into the last presidential election, if you remember.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, we saw -- right, because -- and then again, rally, when it became clear that President Trump was going to win, so pro-growth policies, we will discuss as the morning moves on.</p><p>A nationwide manhunt, meantime, underway after explosive devices were sent to prominent Democrats and CNN, we have the latest on the investigation, including what was found inside those packages.</p><p>Plus, competition with China, stay with us for Maria's exclusive interview with Oracle Founder Larry Ellison. Hear what he says about protecting American tech.</p><p>MCDOWELL: An intense nationwide manhunt, underway, after pipe bombs were sent to prominent Democrats as well as CNN. Cheryl Casone has the details. Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, good morning, Dagen. While at least eight packages were sent in total, one of them addressed to former President Barack Obama. The Secret Service says that the package with an explosive device was intercepted before it could make it to his home in Washington, D.C., as well as another that was sent to former President Bill and Hillary Clinton's New York home. Former Attorney General Eric Holder had one addressed to him, and one bearing the name of John Brennan, the former CIA Director who publicly sparred with the President, that package meant for Brennan was delivered to CNN, prompting the network to evacuate their New York offices at Time Warner Center.</p><p>Now, officials say the devices made with PVC pipe were packed with shards of glass. The President condemning the attempted attacks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our Democracy itself. No nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, coercion, or control.</p><p>CASONE: Police also are looking into suspicious packages mailed to Congresswoman Maxine Waters in Washington and in California, and another one that was addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden. Investigators believe this is related to another, sent to George Soros, a billionaire liberal donor who lives in New York. Now, the FBI says this could be the work of one person or a group because all packages are similar, manila envelopes, forever stamps, and the return address of Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. A lot of intense things happening yesterday. Dagen, over to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Indeed, Cheryl, thank you for that update, and we'll bring you more as it develops as the morning moves on. But Emily, onto this, because this is -- the Wall Street Journal has an editorial today called the politics of pipe bombs, and they say -- one of the -- one of the things that they note, one that took years literally trying to find out who sent those anthrax-laced letters that killed several people after back in 2001. Especially so close to an election, the public should discount unconfirmed leaks about suspects or motives and the political rhetoric that you're hearing about these explosive devices.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Yes, I think that's probably true. But, I mean, I think in general, turning down the volume couldn't hurt anyone -- turning down the volume on the anger and the -- you know, whatever the -- whatever the polarized rhetoric couldn't hurt any of us. But I think it's probably wise at this point, unless, you know, there may be some very clear information that emerges, that could be the case, there were a lot of package that were sent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And because the devices were not detonated, that would make it -- it makes the job of the FBI much easier to track down.</p><p>JASHINSKY: And it should be fairly easy. I mean, these are in Virginia right now being analyzed. And so, it should be fairly easy for them to determine whether they were viable to begin with, whether these were things that were actually intended to explode or whether these were fakes, that I mean, they should be able to figure that out soon.</p><p>MURPHY: Either way from a political standpoint, like, this is a lunatic, whether whatever political party they are part of, or whatever they were trying to accomplish, it's a crazy person that we -- no one wants to be associated with in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And no one wants to wish harm or bring harm to anybody in this country.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Nobody asked for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A rational sane person. Exactly. However, I will point out that Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi did put out a statement saying Mr. Trump's words bring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence. And The Journal editorial writes, \"As if this is a moment to settle political scores.\" So, some people can't avoid making them political.</p><p>BREWER: They can't. And I, you know, I flew in last night, and was watching the various networks, and I was just blown away by the fact that every single person took President Trump's speech and made it as if he was the one inciting all of the violence, disregard the fact that we've had Republicans shot on baseball fields in D.C. I mean, come on, guys, this is both sides. People need to take a step back. But whenever you start to point the blame at someone else like your mom and dad always told you, you got to look back at yourself first.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And to quote President Obama after the shooting in Tucson, where Gabby -- the one in which Gabby Giffords or Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was injured, he said the lack of civility in politics was not to blame, and he cautioned against a political impulse to quote, lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happened to think differently than we do. So, that bears repeating on this day.</p><p>Coming up, airline hack, Cathay Pacific reporting more than 9 million customers may have had their data compromised. The latest, next. Plus, reliability tanking, Tesla reporting better-than-expected -- well, better- than-expected numbers for the quarter. It actually reported earnings with a car company among several that has slipped in customer reliability. We'll bring you that story ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A view from the top, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison sitting down in an exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo. Take a listen to what he says about a range of issues including his company, Amazon, and competition with China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELLISON: The Oracle database manages most of the world's data. Today, 10 years ago, nothing has changed, all of the world's important valuable data is in the Oracle Database, they're not in Amazon's database. Let me tell you an interesting fact, Amazon does not use AWS to run their business, Amazon runs their entire business on top of Oracle, on top of the Oracle database. They have been unable to migrate to AWS because it's not good enough. We have serious competition going on with China. I'm on team USA, I would like us to be successful, I'd like us to develop and protect our technologies, I think we have to do that. I think we have to invest on -- invest on our economy and grow our economy so we can compete with the first serious -- the first serious threat, if you will, our first serious competitor we've had since the 1930s.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Plus, Maria, also, before she sat down with Larry Ellison, she first spoke with Oracle Co-CEO Mark Hurd, and asked him about growth.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: People are worried about growth, the market is selling off this week, it's been a volatile situation, as people question whether or not these good economic times are sustainable. You've got the leading enterprise companies on Oracle software using Oracle applications, you would know best. What are you seeing, are you seeing a pullback?</p><p>MARK HURD, CEO, ORACLE: No, I wouldn't say that. I think there's always concerns that the Fed sometimes -- I think I've heard a stat where 36 -- out of 36 quarters in a row, they've overestimated growth. And sometimes interest rates moves -- sort of moved ahead of the growth, and in some ways, as you know, can constrict growth. And so, I think there's some concern about what happens to interest rates. But still today, if you have good projects people are investing, the economy certainly in this country is good, growth in this country is solid, particularly in small and medium business. We talk a lot about global companies, and companies that reach outside of the United States, but if you look inside the United States, companies' primary business is domestic, those companies are doing quite well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Be sure to stay with us for Maria's exclusive in-depth interview with Oracle Founder Larry Ellison at 7:00 and 8:00, so in both of those hours. This is a man you never hear from, but who did he choose to sit down with, Maria Bartiromo. You can't miss it.</p><p>Coming up, more sweeping reform on the way, President Trump ready to reveal his plan to lower healthcare costs, plus more highlights from his Wisconsin rally last night. And drink up Mr. Ipa-Nut, people are going nuts over this new peanut-flavored beer combo from Planters. We'll show you more, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, October 25th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Looking at a rebound, Futures are showing gains across the board this morning. The Futures have pulled back a little bit, but we still see 157- point gain on the Dow Futures this morning.

We'll introduce you to an IPA, with a peanuty twist.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, health care in focus, President Trump will outline a plan to lower health care costs this afternoon, ahead of the midterms.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP: Republicans want to create better health care through more choice, lower drug prices and you will see, very soon, drug prices will go plunging downward, you wait, you watch. It's all in motion. And we've created much more competition. Democrats want socialist health care, where private plans are outlawed and abolished.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Recent Fox News Poll shows that health care is, indeed, the number one issue motivating voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.</p><p>Joining me now, Democratic Strategist, Jessica Ehrlich, along with Republican Strategist and Former Trump Campaign Data and Strategy Director, Matt Braynard, Jessica, your reaction to the President's plan and that might impact people who are voting based on health care?</p><p>JESSICA EHRLICH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I would love to see lower health care costs especially lower pharmaceutical costs, I think, everyone would like to see that, but the details of this plan have yet to be revealed.</p><p>And the last two years, given the majority in both the House and the Senate that the President has enjoyed, nothing has been done so far, which I'm sure has frustrated Republicans, but it's also frustrated Democrats and voters, in general.</p><p>So, I'm highly dubious and skeptical that there's anything, you know -- this is the emperor's new clothes, when it comes to an actual plan that's going to be implemented.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Matt, I will point this out, in terms of bringing down prescription drug costs, that this year, the FDA has approved a record number of generic drugs so far this year, and that is another -- delivering on another promise is getting government out of the way.</p><p>And this has been one of the things that, for years, health care analysts have been talking about, so there is that, as well, and then, in Obamacare, the, kind of, standard plan in Obamacare, the premium is actually for next year, going to be slightly lower than it was last year.</p><p>So, there are some things going on that could influence voters.</p><p>MATT BRAYNARD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yes. And I need to correct what my colleague here just said. There was tremendous progress made in health care these last two years, because Trump and the Republicans repealed the most egregious violation of individual rights in Obamacare was and getting rid of the individual mandate, that is gone.</p><p>So, that is a substantial advance. That was a regressive tax on our poor citizens, and that's no more thanks to this president. I'm very excited to see what this plan is going to bring. We do know that the health care issue was, what cost the Democrats control of Congress in 2010. So, going on the offense on this issue, is only going to yield tremendous dividends for our side.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jessica, I'll get your reaction to that, because a lot of the -- a lot of the ads -- and Democrats have roughly -- half the ads that Democrats have been running in the midterm elections are related to health care and a lot of them focused on Republicans want to repeal the coverage for pre-existing conditions.</p><p>It's something that hasn't happened, but nevertheless, they've made that a talking point.</p><p>EHRLICH: Well, I mean, I think that's part of the frustration on both sides, right? So, for a lot of Democrats and even a tremendous number of moderate Republicans and independent voters, the repeal of the Obamacare in its full state, the abolition of the pre-existing conditions, as a pre- requisite for your health care.</p><p>These are things that get people out to the polls, that have energized people that we're seeing in this, I think, what's going to be record turnouts for midterm elections. Contrary, yes, you can hold on to, oh, they took away, you know, they abolished part of this one aspect of Obamacare.</p><p>But the Republicans came in on this wave, with Trump, saying, they were going to appeal it completely and they weren't able to do that, they created a new plan that they could also --</p><p>BRAYNARD: With no help from Democrats.</p><p>EHRLICH: with their own majority. So, these are the facts. And you can spin them any way you want to, but it's a disappointment to a lot of people, yes, it does get people to the polls and we're going to see that this time around.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll say this, it's a disappointment that they've got rid of a tax on people, I don't know if people see that as a disappoint, but I'll get your response and I want to move on.</p><p>EHRLICH: People who wanted Obamacare abolished were disappointed that it wasn't accomplished.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Go ahead, Matt.</p><p>BRAYNARD: There was -- there was --Obamacare was not repealed and replaced, the plan that covers pre-existing conditions because of one arrogant Republican senator. We're likely going to be fixing that in this next Congress.</p><p>And it's very disingenuous to be running ads saying that Republicans, these horrible Republicans are going to get rid of pre-existing condition coverage, when you just made the point that we've had control for the last two years, so why haven't we done it yet?</p><p>These ads are really making the presumption that voters are very stupid and I don't think they're going to succeed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Moving onto immigration, there's a caravan of thousands of migrants heading to the United States from Honduras. The President, saying, that he will send as many troops as possible, to block them from entering our country.</p><p>Matt, how does this going to impact voters, because President Trump has really tried to make -- use this and make immigration a more important issue coming up ahead of the midterms?</p><p>BRAYNARD: Look, if you want to have the potential to break the land speed record here on earth, ask a Democrat, on camera, what they think about this problem and they'll disappear before your eyes. We've already seen some of their leading candidates like Beto O'Rourke, take a pass on the question.</p><p>Republicans around the country need to get footage of this caravan, in their television ads, and make it clear that we are the ones that are going to stop it. The other party is AWOL because they see this as an opportunity to bring in more potential voters.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jessica, your response to that, because I hear a lot of the rhetoric from some Democrats, some people on the left, loud prominent voices, saying that President Trump is trying to stoke fear among the voters, and that he's using these people to basically gin up their fears.</p><p>And I pushed back on that. This is really an issue do you believe in open borders or not? So, it's not based on fear, it's based on President Trump asking people if they believe in the rule of law and our immigration laws that are on the books.</p><p>BRAYNARD: It's based on footage. They can see with their own eyes.</p><p>EHRLICH: I disagree. I think it's the opposite, because contrary to Democrats disappearing on this issue, there was even, you know -- when we were talking about this last night on air, they were showing clips of President Obama, being very strong, actually, that we need to have border security and enforce the laws that are on the books, and that was proven in his record of deportations.</p><p>The issue that's happened is that there's rhetoric that's been out there that gins up people. Immigration is an issue and the fear of immigrants flooding into the country uncontrolled, or in some way, lose on the streets, that is an issue with voters, no question.</p><p>And it certainly gets out Trump's voters and it encourages them to vote. That's why he's been saying at his rallies, talking about border security in the wall, as well as talking about the Supreme Court nominations. These are things that incite his voters.</p><p>However, there's no proof that Democrats want, you know, completely open, fluid borders that that's happened, that that happened under any of the administrations --</p><p>BRAYNARD: Other than how they governed in the last eight years.</p><p>EHRLICH: What's happened is that we have yet to have anything, again, come out of the last two years that has changed the issue where we continue to have. There is yet to be a piece of legislation from the President's office or from the House or the Senate that are Republican-controlled, that have fixed the problem that we currently have. These people are continuing to come.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Matt, I will -- I will hit on that. But I do want to point out that a lot of prominent Democrats talk repeatedly about abolishing ICE. That we went from people being upset about the family separations at the border, to we need to get rid of ICE, which actually stops human and child trafficking.</p><p>So, again, to say that some Democrats don't believe in that, that's inaccurate, that some people talk about that repeatedly, who are running for office, but Matt --</p><p>EHRLICH: There are people running for office who talk about that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAYNARD: But you referenced Obama. He is nor running for office. Where's Schumer on the issue? Where's Pelosi on the issue?</p><p>EHRLICH: It's the same between -- there are -- the people -- there are Democrats and Republicans on both sides, who say things that are of one extreme or the other.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Matt -- I want to get Matt's -- Jessica --</p><p>EHRLICH: That is not referred to all Democrats or all Republicans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to ask Matt, one final word, with President Trump making immigration an issue, Matt, does it highlight -- because he's not running for re-election, it is -- it is Republicans --</p><p>BRAYNARD: He is running for re-election.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, well, the people are going to the polls, Matt, in less than two weeks, to vote on people in Congress and in the Senate. Does it highlight the fact that the Republicans haven't done that much on immigration? They have not fully funded his wall and they have not put financial restrictions on funding for sanctuary cities. Does it hurt them potentially, rather than help Republicans in less than two weeks?</p><p>BRAYNARD: No, and I want to -- no, not at all. Because we are in, at least, in my lifetime, the third re-alignment of the Republican Party, the Congress that comes back, whether we control both Houses or not, is going to be the Trump Republican Party.</p><p>Right now, we are dealing with the dead-enders of the Paul Ryan era, who are basically in the pockets of, you know, China and the Chamber of Commerce. And so, they've been an obstruction in many ways, to this president, but the new Republicans that are coming in, this is the Trump Republican Party, and that's going to change. So, I look forward to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. We've got to -- Matt, we've got to go for breaking news. Thank you both for having a civil conversation.</p><p>EHRLICH: Thanks, good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jessica and Matt, good morning to you both. We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Breaking news right now, you are looking live at pictures in New York City. That is the New York City Police Department transporting a suspicious package found in lower Manhattan. The neighborhood is the Tribeca Neighborhood, that is north of the World Trade Center, the world financial center. This is in the Tribeca Neighborhood.</p><p>This follows a series of explosive devices that were found across the country sent to prominent Democrats and CNN, addressed to John Brennan at CNN. It's not unclear if this is related but the New York City Police Department has responded to reports of a suspicious package. This is in Tribeca in the vicinity of Greenwich and Franklin streets in Tribeca, lower Manhattan. We will bring you more developments as we get it, but this as New Yorkers are going to work this morning.</p><p>This package already in transit, this is in -- this is in the transport vehicle used for explosive devices, so it's being transported to, I believe, it's in the Bronx where this facility is, where the NYPD takes these types of packages suspicious. But, again, this was found down in Tribeca, near Greenwich and Franklin. It's worth-noting that this is also not just a residential neighborhood but also a busy financial area, there's one Citigroup building that's across the street from where the suspicious package was said to be found. We will bring you more as we get it. New York City Police Department transporting that suspicious package found in lower Manhattan.</p><p>Moving onto this, the Director of the CIA has reportedly heard the audio of the killing Journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Cheryl Casone has details on this developing story, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: It is developing as well, Dagen, good morning. Again, CIA Director Gina Haspel is Turkey to investigate the murder that took place in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials through multiple leaks to the media have touted the existence of audiotape of Khashoggi's killing. While the Washington Post has reported that Haspel has heard it, which a source describes as compelling. And Haspel is due back in Washington today to brief President Trump on what she heard, what she learned. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, calling the killing \"a heinous crime\" that cannot be justified. He made the comments at the Future Investment Initiative, that has been, of course, overshadowed by the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>Well, another headline we're following for you this morning. A data breach at Cathay Pacific, the Asian airline confirming the hack may have compromised a personal information of nearly 10 million passengers. That data would include e-mail addresses, passport numbers and date of births. Cathay Pacific apologizing, it's contacting passengers who may have been affected and also says there's no evidence, any personal data may have been misused. Taking a look at shares of Cathay Pacific, the stock is actually down 13 percent so far for the year.</p><p>Well, American car brands slipping in annual reliability rankings published by consumer reports. Ford is at number 18, that's down three slots from last year, followed by General Motors, Buick brand which fell out of the top 10. G.M., Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands, also losing ground. Tesla fell six places, 27th by the way. Meanwhile Lexus, Toyota's luxury brand, regained its title as the most reliable brand. Shares of Toyota are down about seven percent so far this year.</p><p>And then, finally, there was this to leave you with, guys. Mr. Peanut wants you to have your peanuts and drink them at the same time. Planters is teaming up with Chicago's Noon Whistle Brewery to bring you a peanut- flavored beer. It's called Mr. IPA-nut -- there's the can. The new brew is going to have all of the, all of the familiar (INAUDIBLE) you get with an IPA, but it's also going to have Planters iconic honey roasted peanut flavor and a little bit of salt as well. The beer is going to be released on October 27th, just in time for National Beer Day. The catch, you have to head to Illinois if you want a sip, and of course, that day, I already checked, is a Saturday, Dagen, unfortunately for us onset. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl. Cool car there.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, Twitter earnings out in moments. We'll break down the numbers and look at what role social media is playing in the upcoming midterm elections.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Breaking news to bring you. This is a live look at New York City Police Department transporting a suspicious package found in lower Manhattan in the Tribeca neighborhood. This is in the vicinity of Greenwich and Franklin street, this follows a series of explosive devices that were found across the country sent to prominent Democrats and CNN. It's not unclear if this is related but this package was found near the Tribeca Grill, that is the restaurant long associated with Robert de Niro, long owned by Robert de Niro. So, again, that package, suspicious package in transit to the explosive disposal unit of the New York City Police Department.</p><p>Moving onto tech earnings, they're in focus this morning. Twitter is set to report its results momentarily. The stock moving up, it's up about 3- 1/2 percent at the moment. Joining me now is Tech Analyst and Big Eyed Wish Founder Ian Wishingrad. Ian, good to see you this morning. What are you watching for in Twitter's earnings?</p><p>IAN WISHINGRAD, FOUNDER, BIG EYED WISH: Good to see you this morning, as well. Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sorry, I didn't mean to skip over good morning.</p><p>WISHINGRAD: So, everyone is estimating that they're going to have good numbers from a business standpoint. I think there's just going to be a reality check on what kind of business it really is. There are certain businesses that have billions of users like the Facebook and those Instagram, and those are these incredible unicorns that people really want to be able to put a ton of add dollars into. Twitter, I think, unlike Snapchat, have much smaller user bases, so people are just going to have to reset their expectations, deal with their relatively modest user base and how they're able to monetize.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I point at Mike Murphy, because again, but Twitter has tried to right its business in terms of better targeting ads, but all of these social media platforms have been dealing with problems with not securing the user data, but also allegations of going after conservatives -- bias against conservatives.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. I mean, that affects all of them. I think the big story with Twitter is we run venture capital funds, so early stage start-ups are all advertising on Facebook. We never hear someone come in and say, you know, we're allocating our ad dollars that you're giving to us Twitter. So, I think Twitter has to figure out, is it a news source, how does -- what's the best way to monetize its base?</p><p>WISHINGRAD: I 100 percent agree with you. I mean, as an investor, I never bought the stock, I can't buy the stock, I enjoy it. The only prominent ad placement is when you see what's trending and then you try to put your sponsored show or whatever you're trying to promote in that section. But, it really seems to me almost more of a public good or news source than it is a great place to drive any revenue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it's almost as if President Trump has kept this company relevant --</p><p>WISHINGRAD: The best thing ever --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and made it an incredible tool for political communication. Curious to find out how you think that activity on Twitter and other social media platforms will influence the midterm elections, potentially, or how they're using ahead of the midterms?</p><p>WISHINGRAD: What I think we've all learned now, you have to do a little more research than just trust necessarily what's trending; they're talk about deep fakes now, I think. The future is going to be really hairy and the more trusted news outlets are going to become more important than ever to tell you what's real and what's fake, because it's not just going to be Twitter, comments and things that are trending. It's literally visuals that are going to look real that might not be real. So, veracity is going to be the biggest theme for the upcoming election, and all of them are going to be vulnerable forever.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quick, Emily.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Well, I mean -- obviously, the implications of the election, what happens in terms of regulation, what are people thinking about, what are the Democrats are thinking about, what Republicans are thinking about, what would the difference be if Democrats take control of the house?</p><p>WISHINGRAD: That's a good question. I'm not sure --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You don't have to answer if you don't want to.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WISHINGRAD: I don't think that's necessarily a partisan issue. Neither side necessarily benefits from incorrect information being spread, so I think the regulation is inevitable no matter who's in charge.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ian Wishingrad, good to see you.</p><p>WISHINGRAD: Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Twitter earnings, they are coming up. Still ahead, rolls on the run, David Schwimmer responds in the best way to the viral photo of a look- alike rob in a liquor store. Next hour, and Maria with Larry Ellison, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning --</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018102501cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK0-MDF1-DXH2-6178-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7111\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Federal Reserve held interest rates near zero on Wednesday, and reiterated that it would do whatever it takes to support the US economic recovery. In a speech, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the recent uptick in coronavirus cases is beginning to weigh on the recovery .\"If anything, there was more mention of fiscal policy than monetary policy in Powell's speech,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. \"Certainly, while investors ears were leaning into Powell's comments, their minds will likely also be trained on discussions currently underway in Congress about the forthcoming fiscal cliff.\"  Also on Wednesday, the CEOs of big tech companies including Apple , Amazon , Facebook , and Google parent Alphabet gave testimony before the House Antitrust Subcommittee addressing how they are handling antitrust challenges from regulators.

Lululemon Athletica, Coupa Software and Copart cleared buy points on earnings, while several leaders broke out. But recent software IPOs\u00a0Slack Technologies and CrowdStrike fell despite beating views, along with\u00a0Zoom Video Communications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, U.S. economic data weakened, with the August jobs report showing slowing private hiring while a key manufacturing gauge signaled contraction.</p><h>Dow Jones Clears Key Level</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq composite jumped above their 50-day moving averages, a resistance level for several weeks. China trade talks buoyed optimism, though it's unclear if there are reasons for real progress on resolving an escalating tariffs war. Lululemon, Copart and Coupa broke out on earnings. Several other leaders, including Universal Display and Mastercard, also topped buy points. But software earnings were decidedly mixed, with the Zoom Video, CrowdStrike and Slack IPO stocks falling.</p><h>Job Growth Slows, Factories Contract</h><p>The U.S. added just 130,000 jobs last month, less than expected, as private hiring cooled. The jobless rate held at 3.7% even as labor force participation rose to a six-year high. Average hourly wage growth was 3.2%. Manufacturers added a slim 3,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly fell below the neutral 50 level, as U.S. factories joined a global slump.</p><h>Lululemon Jumps On Earnings, Guidance</h><p>IBD 50 stock Lululemon Athletica moved into buy zone after the upmarket yogawear maker reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue. The Canadian retailer also stretched its guidance. It raised its full-year EPS target to $4.63-$4.70 from $4.51-$4.58, which was above analyst views.</p><h>Software Earnings</h><p>Several software makers reported better-than-expected views, but shares went different ways.</p><p>Coupa Software reported Q2 profit rose 40% to 7 cents, defying views for a 10-cent loss. Revenue surged 54% to $95 million while billings jumped 57% to $107.7 million, both beating. Results included the acquisitions of Hipperos and Exari. Shares jumped, clearing a buy point.</p><p>Slack Technologies reported a smaller-than-expected Q2 loss as revenue swelled 58% to $145 million. But the workplace collaboration software maker sees a wider Q3 loss. It faces increasing competition from Microsoft. Slack stock plunged Thursday morning to a record low, following sharply for the week.</p><p>Zoom Video Communications reported adjusted earnings of 8 cents a share, with revenue rising 96% to $145.8 million, topping estimates of 2-cent profit on sales of $130.3 million. For the October quarter, Zoom guided higher. Shares of the April IPO fell nearly 8% Friday.</p><p>Cloudera reported Q2 revenue of $196.7 million, up 74% including the merger with Hortonworks, topping estimates of $182.3 million. The company reported an adjusted loss of 2 cents. Analysts had expected a 10-cent per share loss. Cloudera stock skyrocketed.</p><p>Smartsheet reported better-than-expected quarterly results, but the project management software maker gave weak guidance. Shares plunged Thursday and Friday.</p><h>Cybersecurity</h><p>Palo Alto Networks gave weak profit guidance for fiscal 2020 as it shifts to shorter-term contracts, but projected 20% three-year compound annual growth in total billings to around $6 billion and revenue to $5 billion. Continuing\u00a0an acquisition spree, Palo Alto bought startup Zingbox for $75 million. Shares rose.\u00a0CrowdStrike reported a narrower loss than expected while revenue leapt 94% to $108.1 million. The June IPO also offered solid guidance. But shares plunged Friday. Earlier in the week, CrowdStrike and Proofpoint struck an integration deal, sending both stocks higher.</p><h>Ciena</h><p>Ciena reported fiscal Q3 EPS jumped 48% as revenue rose 17% to $960.6 million, as it continues to gain share in the optical communications market. For the current October quarter,\u00a0Ciena guided revenue estimates slightly higher while gross operating margin fell short of views. It also sees slim revenue growth in fiscal 2020. Shares fell.</p><h>States Launch Facebook Probe</h><p>New York State Attorney General Letitia James on Friday launched an antitrust probe of Facebook. She said Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia will join the investigation. The states will examine Facebook's data privacy and online ad dominance. The Texas AG said he'll launch a separate Big Tech probe on Monday. The Justice Department recently disclosed a probe of Big Tech dominance. Facebook stock fell Friday.</p><p>Facebook launched its online dating service in the U.S., hitting shares in\u00a0Match Group. Facebook plans to integrate Instagram with the dating feature.</p><h>Starbucks Finds Support</h><p>Starbucks cut its fiscal 2020 earnings growth outlook to under 10%, down from prior estimates of at least 13% growth. The coffee giant said it's pulling stock buybacks forward into the current FY 2019. Also, 2020 tax rates will be higher than in 2019. But Starbucks said its \"operating growth model is intact.\" Starbucks fell modestly but rebounded from just above their 50-day line. Shares are up sharply in 2019.</p><h>Airlines</h><p>JetBlue cut its Q3 revenue per available seat mile (RASM) growth amid weaker sales to Puerto Rico and the expected impact of Hurricane Dorian.\u00a0United Airlines reiterated its prior full-year EPS guidance of $10.50 to $12, though the midpoint is below consensus for $11.73. Delta Air Lines said that it was \"on track\" for a 6% to 7% increase in revenue this year and a 25% increase in earnings per share growth. The carrier's August revenue seat miles climbed 5% overall, up 5.9% domestically and 3.6% internationally.</p><h>News In Brief</h><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency wants Boeing to perform in-flight maneuvers with the 737 Max's updated flight-control system both on and off. The Boeing 737 Max likely won't fly during the busy holiday travel season as global regulators reportedly want more information about the aerospace giant's proposed software changes.</p><p>MongoDB narrowed losses to 26 cents per share from 41 cents a year ago, as revenue vaulted 74% to $99 million. The database software stock saw subscription revenue rise 71% and services revenue grow 15%. MongoDB also gave solid guidance.

The IBD 50 salvage car auction specialist soared, clearing a buy point.</p><p>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-4943412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0H-DX11-DYTD-9151-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1171\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

Amazon stock, Facebook stock and Citigroup stock are all in buy zones heading into big events. Amazon.com kicked off Amazon Prime Day on Monday. Facebook, fresh off an FTC settlement, will join Amazon, Apple, and Google parent Alphabet in a House hearing on antitrust on Tuesday, along with cryptocurrency hearings focusing on Facebook Libra.\u00a0Citigroup reports earnings early Monday, kicking off a big week for financials and earnings generally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Amazon, Facebook and Citigroup stock are in buy zones, Apple stock is moving toward a buy point while Google stock is in the process of building the right side of a base.</p><h>Dow Jones Futures Today</h><p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value along with S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.1%.\u00a0Remember that overnight action in\u00a0 and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular  session.</p><p>China's economy grew 6.2% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier, the smallest GDP gain since 1992. That was below Q1's 6.4% pace but met analyst estimates. Meanwhile, June data on retail sales and industrial production topped views, raising hopes that stimulus efforts are offsetting China trade war woes.</p><h>Current Stock Market Rally</h><p>The current stock market rally is looking strong, with the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all hitting new highs.</p><p>A number of top stocks cleared buy points, including FB stock and AMZN stock, with many others closing in on entries.</p><p>Among the\u00a0, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF rose 1.5% last week to nine-month high. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF advanced 1.7%, setting all-time bests. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF jumped 3.2%.</p><p>The indexes all closed the week at essentially their best levels. So any modest gain Monday morning will set new all-time highs.</p><h>Amazon Prime Day</h><p>Amazon Prime Day will run on Monday-Tuesday, 12 hours longer than in prior years. Many deals were available Sunday. While Amazon Prime Day is the e-commerce giant's biggest sales event of the year and a reliable boost for new Amazon Prime memberships, the deals themselves tend to be just OK.</p><p>Amazon stock hasn't had huge moves during Amazon Prime Day week. In 2016, shares fell 1.3%. In 2017, they climbed 2.35%. Last year, AMZN stock was flat during Prime Day week.</p><p>As for last week, Amazon stock rose 3.55% to 2,011, clearing a 1,964.50 buy point from a long  base.</p><p>AMZN stock rose a fraction early Monday.</p><h>Facebook FTC Settlement Lifts FB Stock</h><p>Facebook stock rallied 1.8% to 204.47 on Friday. Most of those gains on word of a $5 billion  over privacy issues. The Facebook FTC settlement also includes some unspecified conditions, but it appears unlikely to have a big impact on the social giant's business model.</p><p>Facebook stock popped 4.3% last week, clearing a 195.50 cup-with-handle pattern. Shares fell a fraction before Monday's open.</p><h>Facebook Not In The Clear</h><p>But the FTC is still mulling Amazon and Facebook antitrust probes. The Justice Department will take the lead on competition concerns regarding Google and Apple. On Tuesday, those Big Tech giants face a House antitrust panel hearing. Several Democratic presidential candidates, notably Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have called for breaking up Big Tech companies.</p><p>Aside from a June 3 tumble on possible Big Tech antitrust probes, investors don't seem too concerned, given Facebook and Amazon stock surging in recent weeks to buy zones.</p><p>Apple stock showed only a modest loss on June 3, with the consumer electronics giant seen as less exposed to antitrust concerns that the internet giants. Apple stock is working toward a 215.41 cup-with-handle buy point. The iPhone giant's handle is now long enough to be its own base. Last week, Apple stock formed a \"handle\" within that handle. That could offer an early entry of 205.18, but even aggressive investors should insist on a strong move in heavy volume to indicate that is a true resistance point for Apple stock.</p><p>Google stock is working a 1,297.07 buy point, but still has long way to go. GOOGL stock rose 1.15% to 1,145.34 last week, reclaiming the 50- and 200-day lines.</p><h>Facebook Libra Faces Scrutiny</h><p>Meanwhile, Facebook also will take part in congressional hearings on cryptocurrencies, after the tech giant unveiled plans last month for digital currency Libra.</p><p>President Trump last week said he was not a fan of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies generally. With regards to Facebook Libra, Trump said the social giant may need a banking charter. A charter would involve a lot more regulation, oversight and capital requirements. Fed chief Jerome Powell also voiced some skepticism about Facebook Libra last week.</p><p>The SEC reportedly is mulling regulating Facebook Libra as a security.</p><h>Citigroup Earnings</h><p>Citigroup earnings are expected to rise\u00a011% to $1.80 a share with revenue roughly flat at $18.489 billion. JPMorgan Chase,\u00a0Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo report Tuesday, with Bank of America on Wednesday and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.</p><p>Citigroup stock rose 0.5% to 71.77 last week, extending a move past a 69.06 cup-with-handle entry on a daily chart. On a weekly chart, Citigroup stock shows a 72.04  entry.</p><p>The  for Citigroup stock has been flat for several months, following a slide from October 2017 to the end of 2018. Longer-term, the RS line has been sliding, reflecting Citi's underperformance vs. the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>Bank stocks can outperform the market, but usually only for short periods.</p><p>Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at \u00a0for stock market updates and more.</p><p>YOU ALSO MIGHT LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-4755651</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK1-12H1-JCBB-K0S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"957\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

The DOJ will have lead oversight of Google and Apple, while the FTC will handle Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>That  on June 3 for Facebook stock, Google stock and Amazon stock, with Apple stock also falling modestly.

The SMH ETF popped 2% on Monday, when it was .</p><p>Among other\u00a0, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF rose 0.2%.

Shares already jumped 4.8% to 14.83 on Tuesday. Snap stock cleared its first-ever base in early June and is up 169% so far in 2019.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   Happy Friday.  It is Friday, October 26th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the button right now, stocks are in sell-off mode once again.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to be down 220 points right out of  the gate.  That's one percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 down 31 points.  That's  better than one percent right now. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the NASDAQ with a decline of 145 points right.  That's down better than  two percent right out of the gate.  It has everything to do with earnings.   We are awaiting the first look at the GDP for the third quarter.  The  expectation calls for growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent.  We are  going to bring you that number as soon as it hits the tape.  That's at 8:30  a.m. and we will have the smartest analysis in the morning right here once  the number hits.  We will bring that to you. </p><p>Global markets this morning under selling pressure once again.  The FT-100  down better than one percent.  The CAC Quarante down almost two percent and  the DAX Index in Germany down one and a half percent right now.  Declines  across the board overnight in Asia.  As you can see worst performer Korea.   Technology earnings are in focus this morning.  That's because last night  Amazon and Snap among the names reporting and Amazon is down better than  eight percent because revenue missed expectations zeroing in on revenue  across technology this morning. </p><p>Snap shares are down almost 12 percent.  We're watching Google parent  Alphabet, the company's profit was up.  Sales were down.  Well, it was  slowing down lower than people expected and as a result the stock is down  five percent on Alphabet.  Plus, there's a bombshell report this morning  out of Google over sexual misconduct.  That's also playing into things  here.  So we'll have more on that coming up.  And then this, the caravan  crisis continues. </p><p>Hundreds more National Guard troops making their way toward the border  right now as President Trump calls on the group of illegal immigrants to  turn around.  That was echoed by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen  Nielsen last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  This  caravan cannot come to the United States.  They will not be allowed in.   They will not be allowed to stay.  If they come here illegally with no  legitimate reason to stay, they absolutely will be apprehended and remove  immediately. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll have the very latest developments this morning on that.   Stay with us on that.  All stories coming up this Friday morning.  And  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Third Seven Advisors Market Strategist, Michael Block, and Fox News  Contributor Liz Peek.  Great to see you this morning. </p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Yes.  It does gets worst  and worst as we're watching this open.  But it's important to note that all  those sell-offs overseas we're in the wake of Amazon's report and Google's  report, and so forth.  I mean it was a tech problem in those markets as  well.  So, you know, the question is the GDP number going to make a  difference? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.  I mean the estimate is 3.3 percent growth.  I  don't know if there's a good outcome here, Dagen, because if we get a  strong number on GDP, that basically keeps the Federal Reserve's plan in  place to raise interest rates in December, and then another three times  next year, if their GDP is worse than expected, that perpetuates the story  that the economy is slowing. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  And there's a story  in The Wall Street Journal today that trade and manufacturing numbers point  to slower fourth quarter growth.  Many forecasters expect the growth rate  to slip below three percent in the -- of the fourth quarter of the current  -- the quarter that we're currently in because the trade deficit and goods  has widened four months in a row. </p><p>That's a problem and then also you saw the durable goods report yesterday,  big increase in military aircraft orders, but excluding defense durable  goods orders fell, and so that's another thing to worry about was for the  month of -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think we also have to talk about some technical things.  You  mentioned the lack of companies in the market buying those stocks.  There's  also tax loss selling going on.  This also could be part of this because  mutual funds and hedge funds have a fiscal year-end of October 31, so there  could be some tax loss selling and as you said earlier companies are not  buying back those stock -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PEEK:  And they're quiet periods.  They're not allowed to sort of --  there's a sort of, you know, there's this back vacancy there where they  have been in pretty powerful force a lot of these stocks -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of these plays into -- in addition to the fundamentals. </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  There's --  there's a (INAUDIBLE) going on in one another tax loss selling this  volatility gets more volatility and more losses and more pain.  One thing I  want to point we're talking about tech earnings and there are some short  falls there.  But overall growth in tech, Goodyear just reported this  morning in industrial space.  I've been negative on this space.  I just  want to point out. </p><p>They're citing -- they're lowering guidance and they're citing raw material  costs escalating.  They're blaming China.  They're blaming economic  uncertainty in Brazil.  There's a lot of things they're throwing out there,  but these are all other issues that are impacting these markets even if the  big tech companies are insulated somewhat from that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just one more statistic as we've been talking about the revenue  misses.  That's in the headlines of the Amazon numbers that sales  underwhelm Alphabet delivering slowing sales growth.  Here's a statistic,  43 percent of companies half of the S&amp;P has reported so far roughly half 43  percent of the companies have missed expectations, same period, second  quarter.  It was only 28 percent missing.  So it's a much larger percentage  for the current reporting period in terms of missing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PEEK:  -- a lot of companies lower their guidance which of course is also a  problem for the market and for these shares. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why you've got tech tumbling this morning.  It is  about revenue.  It is about expectations of slowdown.  Global stocks  extending declines following disappointing third quarter earnings from  internet giants Amazon and Alphabet.  That puts a dent in the solid  earnings season for technology.  Both industry leaders beat on earnings,  but fell short on Wall Street revenue expectations as Dagen just mentioned.   Amazon also forecast the weakest profit growth in two years. </p><p>And let's not forget the cost side of this because amazon just raised  wages, $15 an hour.  That's going to take effect next week.  A number of  input cost have been going up.  Joining us right now on the phone EndPoint  Technologies Associates Founder and President, Roger Kay.  Roger, good to  have you on the program.  Thanks for weighing in here.  What do you think  is going on within technology? </p><p>ROGER KAY, FOUNDER, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATES:  Yes.  Good morning,  Maria.  Well, so basically, we're on a -- the end of a 10-year boom market,  so it's not surprising to think they're slowing down.  The other thing is,  of course, there's just a lot of volatility after all.  It's up hundreds of  points yesterday.  It's going to open probably off, you know, at least 100  points this morning, and it's been doing that back-and-forth for quite a  while. </p><p>I think volatility scares away investors.  It invites speculators that also  like to play volatility.  But I think that ordinary people are spooked when  the market moves several percent a day -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You mentions -- you mentioned that the length of this bull  market, that's something that AlphaOne Capital Partners Founding Pattern  Dan Niles mentioned as well.  He summed it up this way. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain and during a bull market since World War  II.  But if you look at the big picture around growth, you got a lot of  concerns.  You got China starting to slow down, auto sales in China went  from being up 15 percent year-over-year in April to down 10 percent in the  most recent month. </p><p>That's a pretty big change.  We got concerns over Italy and Brexit in  Europe.  And in the U.S., interest rates are going up.  They're at the  highest levels in seven years.  What you see in general during this  earnings season with Boeing being a pretty big exception is that a lot of  companies are guiding much lower.  I'll give you an example.  Texas  Instruments reported last night and I think they're one of the best  indicators in terms of global health. </p><p>They do about 16 billion in revenues, a hundred billion in market cap.   They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology? </p><p>NILES:  I think you absolutely are and this is exacerbated by the fact that  you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest company  in the world, Apple for example, that 89 percent inventory growth year- over-year in the June quarter that they reported.  Their revenues were up  17 percent.  What if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have  to barn that inventory off when we get into the March quarter. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there you go, Roger.  And the iPhone's thousand dollars  for the iPhone X may not sell very well.  What do you think? </p><p>KAY:  Well, right.  So, you know, often in the technology industry  particularly when you're talking about goods as opposed to service in this  because after all part (INAUDIBLE) inventory of services.  But it certainly  there has been in the past channel stopping where the managers of a  company, you know, the main company are motivated to move product at the  end of the quarter.  They push it to distribution and then let the  distribution worry about working it off. </p><p>That's their problem next quarter.  But that of course comes home to roost  within a quarter and you realize that the, you know, the mother ship isn't  get anymore sales.  So I think, you know, that kind of -- it happens, you  know, in a badly management situation, you know, Tim Cook is not known for  bad management, so it's unusual that they had stop inventory at purpose.   But it's possible that normal inventories well went in and that the sales  were slowing at the far end of the feds while there was inventory still. </p><p>But that's indicative of I think across the board this question (INAUDIBLE)  of growth that we come through this long period of growth and everybody has  been just climbing and climbing and then that's your -- that speak under  reported section there was saying there's just a lot of different sources  headwind including rising interest rates.  I think -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- people, you know, they sell first and think alter, Michael. </p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  You know, Roger, we're here looking at this sea of red this  morning maybe lost in the clouds here is Intel which, you know, having a  rough quarter last time around with their core business, and didn't quite  do what they wanted to do in the data room so to speak.  Yet, yesterday,  really came in better than that lower bar and their core business actually  pretty good and they were talking pretty confidentially about the move down  in (INAUDIBLE) what do you think of that, you know, are there bright spots  here?  You know, is everything really -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KAY:  Yes.  What's interesting is I mean the Intel is off a little bit in  premarket, but now as much as the others.  So, you know, if you look at a  handful of big name stocks, you'll see that most of the tech stocks are off  in the two percent range some as high as four percent in premarket.  But  Intel is only a slight decline and I think that reflects the positive  attitude that Intel may have been getting back together with respect to the  process in technology. </p><p>So it's interesting that the (INAUDIBLE) the other side of the shop, you  know, the non-Intel part of the Silicon industry.  It's already basically  talking about (INAUDIBLE) but what's interesting is if you look a  transistor density rather than the sort of (INAUDIBLE) which is what the  (INAUDIBLE) it turns out that Intel's pen is kind of similar to (INAUDIBLE)  and so that actually that puts Intel not as far behind as people had  thought they were. </p><p>So if they pull it together on their 10, they're kind of in the game  against (INAUDIBLE) and that's good news for them, so I think people  interpreting that and conversely they're interpreting the AMD side of that  that's both negative. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>PEEK:  So Roger, what could turn this group around?  What could get the  tech stocks going again? </p><p>KAY:  You know, finding another planet to colonize.  There's got to be some  way to get more growth out of this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Citing more growth?  Yes, sure. </p><p>BLOCK:  Isn't Elon Musk doing that? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) is boring into one.  Roger, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  Thanks for calling in, sir.  Roger Kay  joining us there.  Coming up, the search for a sender is intensifying this  morning.  Authorities are now zeroing in on Florida after locating a 10th  suspicious package.  The very latest on that investigation next.  And then  Saudi Arabia changing its story again about what happened to journalist  Jamal Khashoggi inside its Istanbul interment - embassy.  Khashoggi's son  has arrived in the United States.  He was barred from leaving Saudi for a  while.  Details there next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are lower this morning.  Take a look at  the sell-off going on right now.  Dow Industrials down almost one percent,  221 points lower.  The S&amp;P 500 down 32 points, better than one percent  lower and the NASDAQ is down two percent.  That's 146 points lower.  This  perpetuating view that things are slowing down last night because Amazon  and Google disappointed on revenue.  Meanwhile, there's this, the son of  the murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, his son has now  arrived in the United States.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl? </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is something, Maria.  This  is the eldest son that is now in the United States with his family.  He  previously had been unable to leave Saudi Arabia because of his father's  criticism of the Saudi government.  Well, the State Department says that  U.S. welcomes Saudi Arabia's decision to allow Khashoggi's son to leave  that country.  Meanwhile, the Saudi government changing its story again now  saying the killing was premeditated. </p><p>Saudi officials say that Turkey's evidence shows the murder was planned  contradicting their earlier claim that rouge officials killed Khashoggi by  mistake during a fist fight.  Well, after an intense nationwide manhunt  under -- is underway after 10 pipe bomb packages were sent to prominent  Democrats.  Some new details for you it.  Federal investigators has  searched a mail facility in South Florida.  That happened last night.   Several of the packages actually went through that facility. </p><p>Investigators also focusing on New York City after one of the bombs was  sent to actor Robert De Niro.  Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting, funny  how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for  the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September  11th and the Oklahoma City bombings, yet when I criticize them they go wild  and scream, it's not just presidential.  </p><p>Well, corporate travel trends are changing and so are companies expense  reports, shocker.  Lyft made the top 10 list of the most frequently  expensed business cost in the U.S. for the first time.  This was during the  third quarter, certified track all stuff.  They're a traveling expense  software company.  Lyft was number six on the list with Uber in the top  spot.  Amazon coming in third, interesting.  Both Uber and Amazon had been  moving up the ranks over the last three years. </p><p>And then speaking at people getting paid, Sofia Vergara extending her reign  as queen of television.  The Modern Family actress topping Forbes list of  highest paid T.V. actresses for the seventh year in a row whopping 42.5  million was her take.  That's only twice the 24-1/2 million that Big Bang  Theory actress Kaley Cuoco made.  Coming in third place, Grace Anatomy's  Ellen Pompeo with 23-1/2 million rounding out the top five, Law &amp; Order's  Mariska Hargitay, and then Sofia Vergara's Modern Family co-star, Maria,  Julie Bowen which has got lots of money and she's married to a tall drink  of water -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  Wow.  Lucky to be her. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, caravan crisis, hundreds more  National Guard troops are making their way toward the border right now.   President Trump is calling on the group of illegal immigrants to turn  around.  He says they're not coming in the country.  The very latest there.   Then we are waiting the first read on third quarter GDP.  We have the  number.  The expert analysis as soon as it crosses 3.3 percent growth is  the estimate.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Caravan crisis, President Trump is demanding the  thousands of Central American migrants headed to the United States make a  U-turn.  The warning coming as the administration deploys hundreds of  troops to the southern border.  Joining us right now is Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs and member of the House Judiciary Committee.  Congressman, it's  good to see you.  Thank you for being here.  Arizona, obviously, a border  state. </p><p>You recent tweeted that you support sending the troops to the border.   Assess the situation for us.  Tell us what it looks like today and what can  be done. </p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA:  Well, it's pretty bleak in some respects  because the drug cartels control the border putting more military in the  border actually gives a show of force even though they're not going to be  en0gaged in normal typical military issues.  But we're looking at a convoy  of people that are going to try to overturn the border for the purpose of  the organizers who are (INAUDIBLE) they want to -- they don't want to board  -- they don't want a border between Mexico and the U.S. </p><p>And so it's pretty rough right down there on the border right now. </p><p>PEEK:  Quick - congressman, question.  What can the military actually do?   You hear different reports on this whether they can actually engage with  these marchers or how ever -- this caravan, what role can they play really?  </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, they're going to be a supportive role and what that means  they'll be able to help track people who are coming across the borders to  free up the border patrol agents to actually interdict the people.  They  all need to be -- they should be armed so they can protect themselves  because you got the cartels all armed.  You know, they've got the watchers  and so they are going to be supportive I think and I think that will be a  benefit.  But we got so much more to do on the border than just this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the president -- are you going to  vote for Kevin McCarthy's bill and the president's border wall? </p><p>BIGGS:  Well, you knowledge what, I actually introduced my own bill which I  think is a bill if that's the -- if that's the only bill that comes out --  if it's Kevin's bill, I'll vote for Kevin's bill.  I think mine is better - - </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- bill differ from that bill? </p><p>BIGGS:  My bill actually provides funding sources off general funds to pay  for that bill.  It also restores money to the border patrol agents that  were had their pay reduced under the Obama administration and provides  equipment for the men and women of the border patrol. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let me switch gears and ask you about the fallout from the  Kavanaugh confirmation, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is  referring Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick for possible  criminal prosecution over these allegations of making false statements to  Congress, your reaction, sir. </p><p>BIGGS:  Long overdue.  I'm glad to see that Chairman Grassley is out there  doing that because I think Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick, they really tried  to throw gas on to a fire that was already there for whatever purposes, and  it looks like they made false statements and then they should held -- be  held accountable for that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Congressman, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks very much. </p><p>BIGGS:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Andy Biggs joining us there.  We want to take a  short break and then we are just moments away from getting the first look  at the third quarter GDP.  We are going to bring you those numbers as soon  as it hits the tape.  That is at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  That is in four  minutes from now, 3.3 percent growth is what's expected for the first read  on the third quarter GDP, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th, your  top stories right now just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast, we are a  minute way away from third quarter GDP number.  The expectation calls for  growth of 3.3 percent.  This will be the first reading of growth for the  third quarter.  It comes after the second quarter generated growth of 4.2  percent. </p><p>Ahead of the release, markets are selling-off again this morning.  A  negative tone for stocks, Dow Industrials expected to be down 200 points  almost one percent.  The S&amp;P 500 is down better than one percent and the  NASDAQ down better than two percent right now all because of disappointing  earnings reports.  You had revenue misses.  Google parent company Alphabet  and Amazon -- a sell-off this -- with Amazon down better than eight  percent.  Alphabet down five percent. </p><p>The worry here guidance is weaker than expected and revenue is coming in  weaker than expected within tech.  In Europe, similar story, down across  the board in European indices today.  The FT 100 down better than one  percent.  The CAC quarante in Paris down one and three-quarters percent and  the DAX Index in Germany down one and a third percent.  Asian markets  overnight in the red across the board.  We are waiting on the first look of  third quarter GDP this morning. </p><p>We are in the middle of earnings season.  For the GDP, the expectation  calls for 3.3 percent growth and we are expecting earnings to be up 21  percent for the quarter year-over-year.  Joining us right now is Jon  Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor.  And Jon,  we're going to get the number momentarily.  We know that your often focused  on the consumer.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what consumer is showing within this GDP number, the expect  -- 3.5 percent is the number, Jon.  3.5 percent is better than expected.   We were expecting 3.3 percent, and we are watching markets for any  reaction.  Your expectations and your reaction to a 3.5 percent number,  Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, that's a strong number.  What I want -- what I want to  do is break this down a little bit and see where it comes from.  I think  trade was probably a drag for the quarter.  I think we also have to look  very carefully in addition to the consumer at government.  There's been a - - as we've reported today in The Wall Street Journal, there's been a big  pickup in military spending, government spending is contributing a lot to  growth right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Consumer spending is up four -- consumer spending is doing well  within this, up four percent?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Correct, four percent in the third quarter.  The strongest rate  of growth in almost four years on the consumer side.</p><p>BLOCK:  Street was looking for up 3.3 on that as well, so that's a big  beat.</p><p>PEEK:  That's big.  That's a big beat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  And that -- I mean, that makes sense.  You've got an  unemployment rate that's down under four percent, lowest levels since the  1960s.  And you also have tax cuts that are making their way through the  system, so we should be seeing strong consumer spending right now.  We also  have to look at what's going on on the business investment side, you know,  for this growth to be sustainable in the long run, we need to see more  business investment, and I want to see how that breaks down as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investment by companies was weak, Jon, non-residential, fixed- investment, spending on commercial construction equipment, intellectual  property products like software rose only eight-tenths of one percent in  the third quarter.  That was after rising in an 8.7 percent rate in the  second quarter and 11-1/2 in the first.</p><p>BLOCK:  Inflation is also light here, core PCE came in up 1.6 percent  quarter over quarter, street was looking for up 1.8, so there's not some  runaway inflation story here.  It looks like consumption is strong.  As  Dagen points out, investment weak -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets improving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  One more thing, private inventories which is something  that Liz was talking about, private inventories added more than two  percentage points to the third-quarter growth rate, reversing that trend  that you saw in the second quarter when companies were drawing down their  stockpiles ahead of the tariffs.</p><p>PEEK:  That has been sort of an offset on going quarter-to-quarter with the  trade -- the widening trade deficit.  It seems to me that consumer news  here is very important, because the fourth quarter is all about holiday  sales, all about consumer spending, the fact that that's held up and  actually beat by such a wide margin, I think teases up for less pessimism  if you want to look at it that way about the fourth quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And interesting, there's no revisions on the second quarter,  Jon.  The second quarter was really strong at 4.2 percent, that is not  being revised downward, so that stays in place with the better-than- expected initial or advanced reading, the first reading for the third  quarter at 3-1/2 percent, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, so I'd say a few things here based on these breakdowns  that you've given me.  One is let's go back and talk about that inflation  number, the market has been very concerned and the President has been very  concerned about the Fed continuing to raise interest rates going into next  year.  You know, the inflation numbers have come in kind of soft over the  last couple of months, and I think the Fed is going to have to start paying  attention to that and factor in that into how far they want to go on  interest rate increases.</p><p>On the inventory piece that you talked about, that's a volatile number, it  doesn't fundamentally have much to do with economic growth in the long run.   So, the fact that it added a lot to growth in third quarter I think becomes  a potential drag on growth in the second quarter.  A lot of the estimates  that we get at The Wall Street Journal for fourth quarter is that it's  going to slow down a little bit on overall growth, and it's going to slow  down -- growth is going to slow down going into 2019, that inventory piece  plays into that.</p><p>PEEK:  It seems to me it's almost a percent number for people who are Fed  watchers, though, right?  Because it isn't really high enough to spur alarm  at the Fed, any kind of acceleration, or you know, incremental rate hikes  next year neither is it low enough to kind of take them off their paths.   So, it seems to me that's sort of a neutral. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Although, I will add looking at this report, higher borrowing  costs have hurt housing and auto sales.</p><p>PEEK:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Spending on motor vehicles and parts added just 0.09 percentage  points, so third quarter growth, and in terms of residential-fixed  investment fell at a four percent annual rate in the third quarter.  So, is  --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You know, residential has been -- residential has been a  really big drag for several quarters now, and that's continuing.  It's a  little puzzling because there's under supply in the housing market, but  builders (INAUDIBLE) building because labor is short, and land supply is  short, and costs are going up, so, you know, we should be seeing more  building and we're just not getting it right now. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Jon, there is -- during the summer, there was a plentiful  amount of inventory coming on the market in many housing markets that were  already weak.  There are a lot of pockets of weakness in housing in this  country that are overlooked because we tend to focus on the metropolitan  areas.</p><p>BLOCK:  You know, and supply, actually, has been going up in some of these  metrics.  I think I saw a 7.1 month supply in one of the -- one of the  metrics this week on existing home sales.  The only thing I'll point out  is, even in the Fed minutes, it was pointed out that higher rates might be  crimping residential investments to your point, Jon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I also think that it's, you know, understandable that the  third quarter rate of business investment was weak.  And this is actually  the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2016, spending on structures down,  7.9 percent.  You would expect companies to pull back in terms of spending  with the uncertainties of tariffs, with the uncertainties of the demand  picture on the horizon, because there is all of this worry, this narrative  that things slow down a bit.  So, I'm not surprised that the level of  investment spending is weak in this report, Jon, particularly after we've  seen animal spirits these last two years, spending has been up.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, there are three things going on in the business  investment side we have -- we have to look at.  One is you mentioned  structure is down, structures has been very strong because there's been a  lot of investment going on in oil and gas rates as oil prices came up.   They've stabilized so maybe that spurred a growth that we've gotten that's  also stabilized.  </p><p>The other thing you just mentioned, you know, with tariffs coming on, a lot  of companies are talking about slowing their investment plans because  they're just so uncertain about what the trade landscape is going to look  like.  And then the third piece is tax cuts.  You know, the Trump  administration, Republicans in Congress cut taxes, corporate tax rates very  aggressively to try to spur business investment.  But it looks like this  tariff uncertainty is taking away some of the boom that they were hoping to  get on the business investment side. </p><p>You know, again, if these growth rates are going to be sustainable, it's  going to have to show up in business investment, and I'd say, the soft  number there has got to be a little disappointing today.</p><p>PEEK:  I would say politically, too, that's a problem, because Democrats  have really made the case that the tax cuts for corporations are really  just going into stock buybacks, they're not going to have any impact on  workers, and we need investment to get productivity up, so that wages will  go up, so I do think it's a disappointing number.  And probably is a result  of the uncertainty.</p><p>BLOCK:  You know, Jon, the other day, you know, we're starting to hear some  noises about the yield curve, there were some comments a few weeks ago  saying, well, it's kind of a relief.  It was even in the minutes as well  that with rates backing up and along the curve may be there's not so much  risk of inversion.  We see what the 10-year is doing now.  Look, my call  was actually -- we're going to see the 10-year back below three.  You can  write that down, I'm saying it right now.  Are we going to get the Fed more  concerned now about the possibility of inversion and what that can mean?   Do they care about that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's point out this op-ed in The Journal today written by  Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari titled \"Pause Interest  Rate Hikes to Help the Labor Force Grow.\"  Kashkari writes, \"With the Fed  funds rate at two to 2-1/4 percent, monetary policy is now close to  neutral, neither stimulating nor restricting the economy.  Prematurely  tapping the brakes could restrain wage growth and keep many Americans from  participating in the economic recovery.\"  You expect the 10-year to go back  down below three percent.  Is it partly because you think that they are  going to see a pause in the rate hikes?</p><p>BLOCK:  I think we're going to see a slowdown and I think we are going to  see that happen.  And, you know, look, I'm going to say it right now, I  think next year, I think two hikes max.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two hikes max.</p><p>BLOCK:  That's where I am right now.  I've been there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're at three hikes for next year, Jon, isn't that right?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  And it all comes down to the inflation numbers.  The --  you know, you're talking about the yield curve and long-term interest  rates, and I think long-term interest rates are a signal of how concerned  the long-term investors are in the outlook for inflation.  And if the  inflation numbers come -- continue to come in in soft, and it sounds like  they were soft in this number, then I think the Fed has going to have to  think about maybe slowing down the pace of rate increases.  You know, I  just wanted to ask you all, we've talked about a lot of different  components if this, if anyone has the government spending numbers, I'd love  to know what they are, because they -- military spending is a really big  impact on growth right now, there's a lot -- there's a lot of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, here it is.  We got it, Jon.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Government expenditures were up at 3.3 percent annual rate, and  the third-quarter defense spending rising in an annual rate of 4.6 percent,  Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  Yes, that's a big driver, and that one is going to  continue.  So, the two things I think we have driving economic growth right  now are consumers and government, ironically.</p><p>BLOCK:  You know, the last time we didn't mention explicitly here is that  exports were down 3.5 percent in Q3 and imports rose at 9.1 percent.  It  just plays into this whole rising deficit thing.  Look, I don't think the  bottom market cares but it's part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we -- but we would know that watching these trade deficit  numbers coming in, in the third quarter, Jon, that the trade deficit has  widened throughout the third quarter.  Again, there were some pull forward  in the second quarter where you had, say, soybeans exporters really pushing  inventory overseas ahead of those tariffs between the United States and  China that went into place over the summer, so, again, that reversed course  and showed up in this GDP figure.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's exactly right, Dagen, you have to look at what happened  with trade in the second and third quarter combined, there was a lot of  anticipatory reaction in the second quarter, particularly in agricultural  goods, and that looks like it reversed.  But, you know, with the tariffs  that we have going on, we have to think about trade being a potential drag  for the economy -- for the global economy in the months ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what we were -- we're also expecting companies  to start pulling back as we have seen in this report, because of the  uncertainty of it.  You know, what will the impact of these tariffs be in  this quarter and into 2019?  That's one reason that you --</p><p>PEEK:  That's a little ironic, right?  I mean, basically, under Obama, the  uncertainty all had to do with regulation and changes that the business  community faced day-to-day, now it is so unfortunate that we have that  deregulatory cloud sort of lifting, but in its place, we have uncertainty  about the tariff policies. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, we switched -- we switched from one form of government  swappiness to another.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes, that's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That it's government intervention in business, where if you use  steel in this country, you have to go to the Commerce Department hat in  hand and beg for waivers.</p><p>PEEK:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There have been thousands of waivers.</p><p>BLOCK:  And there is a huge backlog at the Commerce Department right now  for these applications for waivers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, there is a lot of red tape on the trade front. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, Jon, we leave it there.  Great to see you this  morning, Jon, thanks so much.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Great.  Thanks a lot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great analysis, as always, from Jon Hilsenrath from The Wall  Street Journal.  Once again, the GDP is out, this is the first reading of  the third quarter, it came in better-than-expected, up 3.5 percent versus  an estimate of 3.3 percent.</p><p>Coming up next, Microsoft on track to pass Amazon in market cap after  earnings.  We will tell you where that market cap stands.  We break down  the latest numbers right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We told you the breaking news earlier.  The GDP  out moments ago.  The economy grew at a -- at a rate of 3-1/2 percent in  the third quarter.  This is the first take on the third quarter.  GDP is  better than the expectation which calls for 3.3 percent.  </p><p>Futures came off of their lows, then, went back down again.  We're still  looking at a decline at the start of trading, although, we are off of the  lows.  Dow Industrials down 160 points, NASDAQ down 116.  </p><p>\"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney weighs in.  And Stu, what I think is  really a good takeaway is the fact that the consumer part of this report -- </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- consumer spending up four percent, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, the -- what is it?  Consumption, that's the proper  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right. </p><p>VARNEY:  Consumption of, what, four percent.  Now, that's a big number.   That is a very bright spot in this report.  You know, Maria, I was the  party pooper about the Mega Million jackpot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you are.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, I'm not -- I thought I might be the party pooper over GDP  because I was really hoping for a four percent number as growth in that  quarter.  OK, so, we got 3-1/2 percent.  I still think that's pretty good.   I'm a little disappointed because I was looking for four and more, because  that's what we've been promised if we get the tax cut.  But, look, I'll  take 3.5 percent, especially coming on the back of a 4.2 percent growth  rate in the second quarter.  That's the best back-to-back quarter  performance that we've seen in four years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  So, the trend is still very strong and if we keep this up, we're  going to have a much better than three percent gain for the full calendar  year, 2018.  I'll take it, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'll take it.  And let's not forget that the second  quarter that you just mentioned, 4.3 percent, no revision there, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right?  So, we still got the 4.2 percent in the second quarter  and now, 3-1/2 percent for the third quarter.  I know you're going to dig  deep into these numbers in about 10 minutes.  We will see you top of the  hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  You got it, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Stu.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the  hour, 9:00 Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his  great team there.  </p><p>First, though, Microsoft makes a move, the technology giant now on track to  pass Amazon's market cap.  We've got those numbers.  Microsoft's shares  today down two percent, Amazon down eight percent.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have breaking news right now.  An 11th  suspicious package has been found.  This one from an Opa-locka, Florida  facility.  The FBI is confirming that this package was addressed to New  Jersey Senator, Cory Booker.  This is an 11th package coming out of the  Florida facility and we are following that and other things this morning.   We'll bring you the latest there.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we want to look at market, we've got technology earnings have  been leading this market sell-off, disappointing revenue numbers last night  from a number of high-profile companies.  </p><p>Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now  with those details.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   So, we're off of the lows of the morning on that better-than-expected GDP  number.  But we're looking at Amazon which had that revenue miss and the  guidance on revenue, obviously, less than expected.  So, some concerns  potentially about the holiday season, that's one thing, but the other  areas, such as cloud and advertising units continue to grow, have been the  area of growth.  And you've had a mixed bag, some analysts actually raising  their target, some pulling back, and some that are raising still like the  long-term growth story on Amazon.  And those FANG stocks are up 37 percent  annually over the last -- since 2014. </p><p>By the way, as Amazon pulls back, we might see Microsoft move higher in  that closer to the trillion-dollar market.  Remember when Apple crossed it,  didn't close there, but Microsoft now may be getting closer, may surpass  Amazon today with Amazon sell-offs.  So, we'll watch for the market cap  battle.</p><p>And then, there's Alphabet, Google.  The one area that people were  concerned about is people are looking to Amazon to search for products  instead of Google.  So, we've seen, obviously, they've had surging profit  with the slower sales growth.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  And of course, it's been  an incredibly volatile and busy week for stocks.  We had a really busy week  on this program as well.  Take a look at some of the top moments with the  program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) business with the Pentagon.  Amazon wants it, too,  but Google walks away from the business with the DOD, and yet, they are  all-in on going into China.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  I hear Jeff  Bezos and I absolutely agree.  I think U.S. tech companies who say we will  not -- we will not support the U.S. military.  You know, we will not -- we  will not work on any technology that helps our military.  But yet, goes  into China and facilitates the Chinese government, surveilling their  people, is pretty shocking.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is Larry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, the Oracle of Oracle.  What a pleasure.  Nice to  see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tony Stark, I -- did you influence that character?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've heard that.  I didn't know Stanley is (INAUDIBLE)  so I guess -- I guess Tony Stark was invented before (INAUDIBLE) so, I  guess no.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Part of why the President  would like to continue cut tax with the middle class is because it has gone  so well.  He sees the fruits of that tax cut and jobs act which passed last  December without a single Democratic vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This can't possibly happen before the midterms.  The midterms  are 13 days away and this has to be voted on and Congress is -- the House  is not even in session.</p><p>CONWAY:  Well, Washington moves a little bit too slowly for the sheer  volume and velocity of the Trump agenda.</p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Obviously, it was so important to  get tax reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually  very sad, and I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISOR TO THE CLINTONS:  I've seen the biggest buildup  and turnout to a midterm election that we've ever seen, which classically  has fairly low turnout.  And I think we've seen the blue wave become a blue  edge, now, I think fairly it's a blue tossup.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS:   President Trump has been talking to the -- to Saudi Arabia, to the King, as  well as to the Crown Prince.  There's a continual dialogue there.  Our eyes  are wide-open when it comes to what we've seen to be this horrific tragedy.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  If he's found  to have his fingers on this in any way, I think he is likely to be removed  by his -- by his father.</p><p>LT. COL. ALLEN WEST (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  This is in complete violation of  human rights.  We cannot continue to allow this to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The migrant caravan from Honduras has swelled to at least 7,000  people now as it makes its way north.</p><p>KEANE:  We've got to protect our borders, and we have got to protect our  sovereignty.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN:  We're seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how  chaotic and really anarchistic the border situation has become.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Violence and intimidation now on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Individual through a  great big boulder through -- entered the office and another person entered  as well, and they stole equipment.  The one thing about America we believe  in civil discourse.  I mean, you could -- you could agree -- disagree with  someone and not be disagreeable, but then now it's in your face.</p><p>WEST:  We should not be politicizing political terrorism or violence such  as this.  And I would say to those people that are seeking to do so, you  know, this is a crazy unhinged individual, this is not acceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks, your view.</p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  We've had five months to  digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian news is already priced into the  market.  The market has shown us over the summer that it's capable of  handling the current situation.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  I  didn't win the Mega Millions this morning, so here I am joining you from  (INAUDIBLE) from New York.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I haven't checked my numbers yet,  but since I didn't buy a ticket, I'm probably not going to win, that's my  guess.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hi, welcome back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.   Liz Peek?</p><p>PEEK:  Well, I don't think that the GDP report did much for the markets,  but let's -- if the market doesn't completely tank today, I think we're  going to be in a rebuilding phase next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still a good number, 3-1/2 percent growth --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PEEK:  Yes, it definitely was.  And teas up the fourth quarter pretty well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>BLOCK:  Yes, personal consumption was good, investment is challenged, trade  is challenged.  Let's see what happens after midterms.  And longer-term,  I'm going to be -- I'm going to stay optimistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's unusual.  And I will be, too.  So, we have about  half of the S&amp;P 500 is still yet to report, so let's hope for better  revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  See the glass half full.  There you go.   Seize the day, everybody.  Have a great weekend, Dagen McDowell, Michael  Block, and Liz Peek, good to see you.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   Happy Friday.  It is Friday, October 26th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the button right now, stocks are in sell-off mode once again.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to be down 220 points right out of  the gate.  That's one percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 down 31 points.  That's  better than one percent right now. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And the NASDAQ with a decline of 145 points right.  That's down better than  two percent right out of the gate.  It has everything to do with earnings.   We are awaiting the first look at the GDP for the third quarter.  The  expectation calls for growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent.  We are  going to bring you that number as soon as it hits the tape.  That's at 8:30  a.m. and we will have the smartest analysis in the morning right here once  the number hits.  We will bring that to you. </p><p> Global markets this morning under selling pressure once again.  The FT-100  down better than one percent.  The CAC Quarante down almost two percent and  the DAX Index in Germany down one and a half percent right now.  Declines  across the board overnight in Asia.  As you can see worst performer Korea.   Technology earnings are in focus this morning.  That's because last night  Amazon and Snap among the names reporting and Amazon is down better than  eight percent because revenue missed expectations zeroing in on revenue  across technology this morning. </p><p> Snap shares are down almost 12 percent.  We're watching Google parent  Alphabet, the company's profit was up.  Sales were down.  Well, it was  slowing down lower than people expected and as a result the stock is down  five percent on Alphabet.  Plus, there's a bombshell report this morning  out of Google over sexual misconduct.  That's also playing into things  here.  So we'll have more on that coming up.  And then this, the caravan  crisis continues. </p><p> Hundreds more National Guard troops making their way toward the border  right now as President Trump calls on the group of illegal immigrants to  turn around.  That was echoed by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen  Nielsen last night. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  This  caravan cannot come to the United States.  They will not be allowed in.   They will not be allowed to stay.  If they come here illegally with no  legitimate reason to stay, they absolutely will be apprehended and remove  immediately. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll have the very latest developments this morning on that.   Stay with us on that.  All stories coming up this Friday morning.  And  joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  Third Seven Advisors Market Strategist, Michael Block, and Fox News  Contributor Liz Peek.  Great to see you this morning. </p><p> LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Yes.  It does gets worst  and worst as we're watching this open.  But it's important to note that all  those sell-offs overseas we're in the wake of Amazon's report and Google's  report, and so forth.  I mean it was a tech problem in those markets as  well.  So, you know, the question is the GDP number going to make a  difference? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we'll see.  I mean the estimate is 3.3 percent growth.  I  don't know if there's a good outcome here, Dagen, because if we get a  strong number on GDP, that basically keeps the Federal Reserve's plan in  place to raise interest rates in December, and then another three times  next year, if their GDP is worse than expected, that perpetuates the story  that the economy is slowing. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  And there's a story  in The Wall Street Journal today that trade and manufacturing numbers point  to slower fourth quarter growth.  Many forecasters expect the growth rate  to slip below three percent in the -- of the fourth quarter of the current  -- the quarter that we're currently in because the trade deficit and goods  has widened four months in a row. </p><p> That's a problem and then also you saw the durable goods report yesterday,  big increase in military aircraft orders, but excluding defense durable  goods orders fell, and so that's another thing to worry about was for the  month of -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think we also have to talk about some technical things.  You  mentioned the lack of companies in the market buying those stocks.  There's  also tax loss selling going on.  This also could be part of this because  mutual funds and hedge funds have a fiscal year-end of October 31, so there  could be some tax loss selling and as you said earlier companies are not  buying back those stock -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PEEK:  And they're quiet periods.  They're not allowed to sort of --  there's a sort of, you know, there's this back vacancy there where they  have been in pretty powerful force a lot of these stocks -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All of these plays into -- in addition to the fundamentals. </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS:  There's --  there's a (INAUDIBLE) going on in one another tax loss selling this  volatility gets more volatility and more losses and more pain.  One thing I  want to point we're talking about tech earnings and there are some short  falls there.  But overall growth in tech, Goodyear just reported this  morning in industrial space.  I've been negative on this space.  I just  want to point out. </p><p> They're citing -- they're lowering guidance and they're citing raw material  costs escalating.  They're blaming China.  They're blaming economic  uncertainty in Brazil.  There's a lot of things they're throwing out there,  but these are all other issues that are impacting these markets even if the  big tech companies are insulated somewhat from that. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just one more statistic as we've been talking about the revenue  misses.  That's in the headlines of the Amazon numbers that sales  underwhelm Alphabet delivering slowing sales growth.  Here's a statistic,  43 percent of companies half of the S&amp;P has reported so far roughly half 43  percent of the companies have missed expectations, same period, second  quarter.  It was only 28 percent missing.  So it's a much larger percentage  for the current reporting period in terms of missing -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PEEK:  -- a lot of companies lower their guidance which of course is also a  problem for the market and for these shares. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's why you've got tech tumbling this morning.  It is  about revenue.  It is about expectations of slowdown.  Global stocks  extending declines following disappointing third quarter earnings from  internet giants Amazon and Alphabet.  That puts a dent in the solid  earnings season for technology.  Both industry leaders beat on earnings,  but fell short on Wall Street revenue expectations as Dagen just mentioned.   Amazon also forecast the weakest profit growth in two years. </p><p> And let's not forget the cost side of this because amazon just raised  wages, $15 an hour.  That's going to take effect next week.  A number of  input cost have been going up.  Joining us right now on the phone EndPoint  Technologies Associates Founder and President, Roger Kay.  Roger, good to  have you on the program.  Thanks for weighing in here.  What do you think  is going on within technology? </p><p> ROGER KAY, FOUNDER, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATES:  Yes.  Good morning,  Maria.  Well, so basically, we're on a -- the end of a 10-year boom market,  so it's not surprising to think they're slowing down.  The other thing is,  of course, there's just a lot of volatility after all.  It's up hundreds of  points yesterday.  It's going to open probably off, you know, at least 100  points this morning, and it's been doing that back-and-forth for quite a  while. </p><p> I think volatility scares away investors.  It invites speculators that also  like to play volatility.  But I think that ordinary people are spooked when  the market moves several percent a day -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You mentions -- you mentioned that the length of this bull  market, that's something that AlphaOne Capital Partners Founding Pattern  Dan Niles mentioned as well.  He summed it up this way. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  This is the  longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II.  It's been up for  115 months.  The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent  which is the second biggest gain and during a bull market since World War  II.  But if you look at the big picture around growth, you got a lot of  concerns.  You got China starting to slow down, auto sales in China went  from being up 15 percent year-over-year in April to down 10 percent in the  most recent month. </p><p> That's a pretty big change.  We got concerns over Italy and Brexit in  Europe.  And in the U.S., interest rates are going up.  They're at the  highest levels in seven years.  What you see in general during this  earnings season with Boeing being a pretty big exception is that a lot of  companies are guiding much lower.  I'll give you an example.  Texas  Instruments reported last night and I think they're one of the best  indicators in terms of global health. </p><p> They do about 16 billion in revenues, a hundred billion in market cap.   They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth  quarter of 2015.  So it's been almost three years since they missed the top  line.  They talked about every major end market slowing down and they  weren't sure when it was going to stop. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology? </p><p> NILES:  I think you absolutely are and this is exacerbated by the fact that  you have a lot of inventory out there.  So if you pick the biggest company  in the world, Apple for example, that 89 percent inventory growth year- over-year in the June quarter that they reported.  Their revenues were up  17 percent.  What if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have  to barn that inventory off when we get into the March quarter. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, there you go, Roger.  And the iPhone's thousand dollars  for the iPhone X may not sell very well.  What do you think? </p><p> KAY:  Well, right.  So, you know, often in the technology industry  particularly when you're talking about goods as opposed to service in this  because after all part (INAUDIBLE) inventory of services.  But it certainly  there has been in the past channel stopping where the managers of a  company, you know, the main company are motivated to move product at the  end of the quarter.  They push it to distribution and then let the  distribution worry about working it off. </p><p> That's their problem next quarter.  But that of course comes home to roost  within a quarter and you realize that the, you know, the mother ship isn't  get anymore sales.  So I think, you know, that kind of -- it happens, you  know, in a badly management situation, you know, Tim Cook is not known for  bad management, so it's unusual that they had stop inventory at purpose.   But it's possible that normal inventories well went in and that the sales  were slowing at the far end of the feds while there was inventory still. </p><p> But that's indicative of I think across the board this question (INAUDIBLE)  of growth that we come through this long period of growth and everybody has  been just climbing and climbing and then that's your -- that speak under  reported section there was saying there's just a lot of different sources  headwind including rising interest rates.  I think -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- people, you know, they sell first and think alter, Michael. </p><p> BLOCK:  Yes.  You know, Roger, we're here looking at this sea of red this  morning maybe lost in the clouds here is Intel which, you know, having a  rough quarter last time around with their core business, and didn't quite  do what they wanted to do in the data room so to speak.  Yet, yesterday,  really came in better than that lower bar and their core business actually  pretty good and they were talking pretty confidentially about the move down  in (INAUDIBLE) what do you think of that, you know, are there bright spots  here?  You know, is everything really -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KAY:  Yes.  What's interesting is I mean the Intel is off a little bit in  premarket, but now as much as the others.  So, you know, if you look at a  handful of big name stocks, you'll see that most of the tech stocks are off  in the two percent range some as high as four percent in premarket.  But  Intel is only a slight decline and I think that reflects the positive  attitude that Intel may have been getting back together with respect to the  process in technology. </p><p> So it's interesting that the (INAUDIBLE) the other side of the shop, you  know, the non-Intel part of the Silicon industry.  It's already basically  talking about (INAUDIBLE) but what's interesting is if you look a  transistor density rather than the sort of (INAUDIBLE) which is what the  (INAUDIBLE) it turns out that Intel's pen is kind of similar to (INAUDIBLE)  and so that actually that puts Intel not as far behind as people had  thought they were. </p><p> So if they pull it together on their 10, they're kind of in the game  against (INAUDIBLE) and that's good news for them, so I think people  interpreting that and conversely they're interpreting the AMD side of that  that's both negative. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p> PEEK:  So Roger, what could turn this group around?  What could get the  tech stocks going again? </p><p> KAY:  You know, finding another planet to colonize.  There's got to be some  way to get more growth out of this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Citing more growth?  Yes, sure. </p><p> BLOCK:  Isn't Elon Musk doing that? </p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) is boring into one.  Roger, it's good to see you  this morning.  Thanks so much.  Thanks for calling in, sir.  Roger Kay  joining us there.  Coming up, the search for a sender is intensifying this  morning.  Authorities are now zeroing in on Florida after locating a 10th  suspicious package.  The very latest on that investigation next.  And then  Saudi Arabia changing its story again about what happened to journalist  Jamal Khashoggi inside its Istanbul interment - embassy.  Khashoggi's son  has arrived in the United States.  He was barred from leaving Saudi for a  while.  Details there next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are lower this morning.  Take a look at  the sell-off going on right now.  Dow Industrials down almost one percent,  221 points lower.  The S&amp;P 500 down 32 points, better than one percent  lower and the NASDAQ is down two percent.  That's 146 points lower.  This  perpetuating view that things are slowing down last night because Amazon  and Google disappointed on revenue.  Meanwhile, there's this, the son of  the murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, his son has now  arrived in the United States.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl? </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is something, Maria.  This  is the eldest son that is now in the United States with his family.  He  previously had been unable to leave Saudi Arabia because of his father's  criticism of the Saudi government.  Well, the State Department says that  U.S. welcomes Saudi Arabia's decision to allow Khashoggi's son to leave  that country.  Meanwhile, the Saudi government changing its story again now  saying the killing was premeditated. </p><p> Saudi officials say that Turkey's evidence shows the murder was planned  contradicting their earlier claim that rouge officials killed Khashoggi by  mistake during a fist fight.  Well, after an intense nationwide manhunt  under -- is underway after 10 pipe bomb packages were sent to prominent  Democrats.  Some new details for you it.  Federal investigators has  searched a mail facility in South Florida.  That happened last night.   Several of the packages actually went through that facility. </p><p> Investigators also focusing on New York City after one of the bombs was  sent to actor Robert De Niro.  Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting, funny  how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for  the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September  11th and the Oklahoma City bombings, yet when I criticize them they go wild  and scream, it's not just presidential.  </p><p> Well, corporate travel trends are changing and so are companies expense  reports, shocker.  Lyft made the top 10 list of the most frequently  expensed business cost in the U.S. for the first time.  This was during the  third quarter, certified track all stuff.  They're a traveling expense  software company.  Lyft was number six on the list with Uber in the top  spot.  Amazon coming in third, interesting.  Both Uber and Amazon had been  moving up the ranks over the last three years. </p><p> And then speaking at people getting paid, Sofia Vergara extending her reign  as queen of television.  The Modern Family actress topping Forbes list of  highest paid T.V. actresses for the seventh year in a row whopping 42.5  million was her take.  That's only twice the 24-1/2 million that Big Bang  Theory actress Kaley Cuoco made.  Coming in third place, Grace Anatomy's  Ellen Pompeo with 23-1/2 million rounding out the top five, Law &amp; Order's  Mariska Hargitay, and then Sofia Vergara's Modern Family co-star, Maria,  Julie Bowen which has got lots of money and she's married to a tall drink  of water -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CASONE:  Wow.  Lucky to be her. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, caravan crisis, hundreds more  National Guard troops are making their way toward the border right now.   President Trump is calling on the group of illegal immigrants to turn  around.  He says they're not coming in the country.  The very latest there.   Then we are waiting the first read on third quarter GDP.  We have the  number.  The expert analysis as soon as it crosses 3.3 percent growth is  the estimate.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Caravan crisis, President Trump is demanding the  thousands of Central American migrants headed to the United States make a  U-turn.  The warning coming as the administration deploys hundreds of  troops to the southern border.  Joining us right now is Arizona Congressman  Andy Biggs and member of the House Judiciary Committee.  Congressman, it's  good to see you.  Thank you for being here.  Arizona, obviously, a border  state. </p><p> You recent tweeted that you support sending the troops to the border.   Assess the situation for us.  Tell us what it looks like today and what can  be done. </p><p> REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA:  Well, it's pretty bleak in some respects  because the drug cartels control the border putting more military in the  border actually gives a show of force even though they're not going to be  en0gaged in normal typical military issues.  But we're looking at a convoy  of people that are going to try to overturn the border for the purpose of  the organizers who are (INAUDIBLE) they want to -- they don't want to board  -- they don't want a border between Mexico and the U.S. </p><p> And so it's pretty rough right down there on the border right now. </p><p> PEEK:  Quick - congressman, question.  What can the military actually do?   You hear different reports on this whether they can actually engage with  these marchers or how ever -- this caravan, what role can they play really?  </p><p> BIGGS:  Well, they're going to be a supportive role and what that means  they'll be able to help track people who are coming across the borders to  free up the border patrol agents to actually interdict the people.  They  all need to be -- they should be armed so they can protect themselves  because you got the cartels all armed.  You know, they've got the watchers  and so they are going to be supportive I think and I think that will be a  benefit.  But we got so much more to do on the border than just this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the president -- are you going to  vote for Kevin McCarthy's bill and the president's border wall? </p><p> BIGGS:  Well, you knowledge what, I actually introduced my own bill which I  think is a bill if that's the -- if that's the only bill that comes out --  if it's Kevin's bill, I'll vote for Kevin's bill.  I think mine is better - - </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- bill differ from that bill? </p><p> BIGGS:  My bill actually provides funding sources off general funds to pay  for that bill.  It also restores money to the border patrol agents that  were had their pay reduced under the Obama administration and provides  equipment for the men and women of the border patrol. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And let me switch gears and ask you about the fallout from the  Kavanaugh confirmation, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is  referring Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick for possible  criminal prosecution over these allegations of making false statements to  Congress, your reaction, sir. </p><p> BIGGS:  Long overdue.  I'm glad to see that Chairman Grassley is out there  doing that because I think Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick, they really tried  to throw gas on to a fire that was already there for whatever purposes, and  it looks like they made false statements and then they should held -- be  held accountable for that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Congressman, it's good to  see you this morning.  Thanks very much. </p><p> BIGGS:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Andy Biggs joining us there.  We want to take a  short break and then we are just moments away from getting the first look  at the third quarter GDP.  We are going to bring you those numbers as soon  as it hits the tape.  That is at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  That is in four  minutes from now, 3.3 percent growth is what's expected for the first read  on the third quarter GDP, next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, October 26th, your  top stories right now just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast, we are a  minute way away from third quarter GDP number.  The expectation calls for  growth of 3.3 percent.  This will be the first reading of growth for the  third quarter.  It comes after the second quarter generated growth of 4.2  percent. </p><p> Ahead of the release, markets are selling-off again this morning.  A  negative tone for stocks, Dow Industrials expected to be down 200 points  almost one percent.  The S&amp;P 500 is down better than one percent and the  NASDAQ down better than two percent right now all because of disappointing  earnings reports.  You had revenue misses.  Google parent company Alphabet  and Amazon -- a sell-off this -- with Amazon down better than eight  percent.  Alphabet down five percent. </p><p> The worry here guidance is weaker than expected and revenue is coming in  weaker than expected within tech.  In Europe, similar story, down across  the board in European indices today.  The FT 100 down better than one  percent.  The CAC quarante in Paris down one and three-quarters percent and  the DAX Index in Germany down one and a third percent.  Asian markets  overnight in the red across the board.  We are waiting on the first look of  third quarter GDP this morning. </p><p> We are in the middle of earnings season.  For the GDP, the expectation  calls for 3.3 percent growth and we are expecting earnings to be up 21  percent for the quarter year-over-year.  Joining us right now is Jon  Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor.  And Jon,  we're going to get the number momentarily.  We know that your often focused  on the consumer.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And what consumer is showing within this GDP number, the expect  -- 3.5 percent is the number, Jon.  3.5 percent is better than expected.   We were expecting 3.3 percent, and we are watching markets for any  reaction.  Your expectations and your reaction to a 3.5 percent number,  Jon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, that's a strong number.  What I want -- what I want to  do is break this down a little bit and see where it comes from.  I think  trade was probably a drag for the quarter.  I think we also have to look  very carefully in addition to the consumer at government.  There's been a - - as we've reported today in The Wall Street Journal, there's been a big  pickup in military spending, government spending is contributing a lot to  growth right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Consumer spending is up four -- consumer spending is doing well  within this, up four percent?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Correct, four percent in the third quarter.  The strongest rate  of growth in almost four years on the consumer side.</p><p> BLOCK:  Street was looking for up 3.3 on that as well, so that's a big  beat.</p><p> PEEK:  That's big.  That's a big beat.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Jon?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  And that -- I mean, that makes sense.  You've got an  unemployment rate that's down under four percent, lowest levels since the  1960s.  And you also have tax cuts that are making their way through the  system, so we should be seeing strong consumer spending right now.  We also  have to look at what's going on on the business investment side, you know,  for this growth to be sustainable in the long run, we need to see more  business investment, and I want to see how that breaks down as well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Investment by companies was weak, Jon, non-residential, fixed- investment, spending on commercial construction equipment, intellectual  property products like software rose only eight-tenths of one percent in  the third quarter.  That was after rising in an 8.7 percent rate in the  second quarter and 11-1/2 in the first.</p><p> BLOCK:  Inflation is also light here, core PCE came in up 1.6 percent  quarter over quarter, street was looking for up 1.8, so there's not some  runaway inflation story here.  It looks like consumption is strong.  As  Dagen points out, investment weak -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And just one --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Markets improving.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  One more thing, private inventories which is something  that Liz was talking about, private inventories added more than two  percentage points to the third-quarter growth rate, reversing that trend  that you saw in the second quarter when companies were drawing down their  stockpiles ahead of the tariffs.</p><p> PEEK:  That has been sort of an offset on going quarter-to-quarter with the  trade -- the widening trade deficit.  It seems to me that consumer news  here is very important, because the fourth quarter is all about holiday  sales, all about consumer spending, the fact that that's held up and  actually beat by such a wide margin, I think teases up for less pessimism  if you want to look at it that way about the fourth quarter.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And interesting, there's no revisions on the second quarter,  Jon.  The second quarter was really strong at 4.2 percent, that is not  being revised downward, so that stays in place with the better-than- expected initial or advanced reading, the first reading for the third  quarter at 3-1/2 percent, Jon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, so I'd say a few things here based on these breakdowns  that you've given me.  One is let's go back and talk about that inflation  number, the market has been very concerned and the President has been very  concerned about the Fed continuing to raise interest rates going into next  year.  You know, the inflation numbers have come in kind of soft over the  last couple of months, and I think the Fed is going to have to start paying  attention to that and factor in that into how far they want to go on  interest rate increases.</p><p> On the inventory piece that you talked about, that's a volatile number, it  doesn't fundamentally have much to do with economic growth in the long run.   So, the fact that it added a lot to growth in third quarter I think becomes  a potential drag on growth in the second quarter.  A lot of the estimates  that we get at The Wall Street Journal for fourth quarter is that it's  going to slow down a little bit on overall growth, and it's going to slow  down -- growth is going to slow down going into 2019, that inventory piece  plays into that.</p><p> PEEK:  It seems to me it's almost a percent number for people who are Fed  watchers, though, right?  Because it isn't really high enough to spur alarm  at the Fed, any kind of acceleration, or you know, incremental rate hikes  next year neither is it low enough to kind of take them off their paths.   So, it seems to me that's sort of a neutral. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Although, I will add looking at this report, higher borrowing  costs have hurt housing and auto sales.</p><p> PEEK:  Sure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Spending on motor vehicles and parts added just 0.09 percentage  points, so third quarter growth, and in terms of residential-fixed  investment fell at a four percent annual rate in the third quarter.  So, is  --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  You know, residential has been -- residential has been a  really big drag for several quarters now, and that's continuing.  It's a  little puzzling because there's under supply in the housing market, but  builders (INAUDIBLE) building because labor is short, and land supply is  short, and costs are going up, so, you know, we should be seeing more  building and we're just not getting it right now. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, Jon, there is -- during the summer, there was a plentiful  amount of inventory coming on the market in many housing markets that were  already weak.  There are a lot of pockets of weakness in housing in this  country that are overlooked because we tend to focus on the metropolitan  areas.</p><p> BLOCK:  You know, and supply, actually, has been going up in some of these  metrics.  I think I saw a 7.1 month supply in one of the -- one of the  metrics this week on existing home sales.  The only thing I'll point out  is, even in the Fed minutes, it was pointed out that higher rates might be  crimping residential investments to your point, Jon.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I also think that it's, you know, understandable that the  third quarter rate of business investment was weak.  And this is actually  the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2016, spending on structures down,  7.9 percent.  You would expect companies to pull back in terms of spending  with the uncertainties of tariffs, with the uncertainties of the demand  picture on the horizon, because there is all of this worry, this narrative  that things slow down a bit.  So, I'm not surprised that the level of  investment spending is weak in this report, Jon, particularly after we've  seen animal spirits these last two years, spending has been up.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, there are three things going on in the business  investment side we have -- we have to look at.  One is you mentioned  structure is down, structures has been very strong because there's been a  lot of investment going on in oil and gas rates as oil prices came up.   They've stabilized so maybe that spurred a growth that we've gotten that's  also stabilized.  </p><p> The other thing you just mentioned, you know, with tariffs coming on, a lot  of companies are talking about slowing their investment plans because  they're just so uncertain about what the trade landscape is going to look  like.  And then the third piece is tax cuts.  You know, the Trump  administration, Republicans in Congress cut taxes, corporate tax rates very  aggressively to try to spur business investment.  But it looks like this  tariff uncertainty is taking away some of the boom that they were hoping to  get on the business investment side. </p><p> You know, again, if these growth rates are going to be sustainable, it's  going to have to show up in business investment, and I'd say, the soft  number there has got to be a little disappointing today.</p><p> PEEK:  I would say politically, too, that's a problem, because Democrats  have really made the case that the tax cuts for corporations are really  just going into stock buybacks, they're not going to have any impact on  workers, and we need investment to get productivity up, so that wages will  go up, so I do think it's a disappointing number.  And probably is a result  of the uncertainty.</p><p> BLOCK:  You know, Jon, the other day, you know, we're starting to hear some  noises about the yield curve, there were some comments a few weeks ago  saying, well, it's kind of a relief.  It was even in the minutes as well  that with rates backing up and along the curve may be there's not so much  risk of inversion.  We see what the 10-year is doing now.  Look, my call  was actually -- we're going to see the 10-year back below three.  You can  write that down, I'm saying it right now.  Are we going to get the Fed more  concerned now about the possibility of inversion and what that can mean?   Do they care about that?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And let's point out this op-ed in The Journal today written by  Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari titled \"Pause Interest  Rate Hikes to Help the Labor Force Grow.\"  Kashkari writes, \"With the Fed  funds rate at two to 2-1/4 percent, monetary policy is now close to  neutral, neither stimulating nor restricting the economy.  Prematurely  tapping the brakes could restrain wage growth and keep many Americans from  participating in the economic recovery.\"  You expect the 10-year to go back  down below three percent.  Is it partly because you think that they are  going to see a pause in the rate hikes?</p><p> BLOCK:  I think we're going to see a slowdown and I think we are going to  see that happen.  And, you know, look, I'm going to say it right now, I  think next year, I think two hikes max.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Two hikes max.</p><p> BLOCK:  That's where I am right now.  I've been there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're at three hikes for next year, Jon, isn't that right?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.  And it all comes down to the inflation numbers.  The --  you know, you're talking about the yield curve and long-term interest  rates, and I think long-term interest rates are a signal of how concerned  the long-term investors are in the outlook for inflation.  And if the  inflation numbers come -- continue to come in in soft, and it sounds like  they were soft in this number, then I think the Fed has going to have to  think about maybe slowing down the pace of rate increases.  You know, I  just wanted to ask you all, we've talked about a lot of different  components if this, if anyone has the government spending numbers, I'd love  to know what they are, because they -- military spending is a really big  impact on growth right now, there's a lot -- there's a lot of --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, here it is.  We got it, Jon.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Government expenditures were up at 3.3 percent annual rate, and  the third-quarter defense spending rising in an annual rate of 4.6 percent,  Jon.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.  Yes, that's a big driver, and that one is going to  continue.  So, the two things I think we have driving economic growth right  now are consumers and government, ironically.</p><p> BLOCK:  You know, the last time we didn't mention explicitly here is that  exports were down 3.5 percent in Q3 and imports rose at 9.1 percent.  It  just plays into this whole rising deficit thing.  Look, I don't think the  bottom market cares but it's part of it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But we -- but we would know that watching these trade deficit  numbers coming in, in the third quarter, Jon, that the trade deficit has  widened throughout the third quarter.  Again, there were some pull forward  in the second quarter where you had, say, soybeans exporters really pushing  inventory overseas ahead of those tariffs between the United States and  China that went into place over the summer, so, again, that reversed course  and showed up in this GDP figure.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  That's exactly right, Dagen, you have to look at what happened  with trade in the second and third quarter combined, there was a lot of  anticipatory reaction in the second quarter, particularly in agricultural  goods, and that looks like it reversed.  But, you know, with the tariffs  that we have going on, we have to think about trade being a potential drag  for the economy -- for the global economy in the months ahead. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And that's what we were -- we're also expecting companies  to start pulling back as we have seen in this report, because of the  uncertainty of it.  You know, what will the impact of these tariffs be in  this quarter and into 2019?  That's one reason that you --</p><p> PEEK:  That's a little ironic, right?  I mean, basically, under Obama, the  uncertainty all had to do with regulation and changes that the business  community faced day-to-day, now it is so unfortunate that we have that  deregulatory cloud sort of lifting, but in its place, we have uncertainty  about the tariff policies. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, we switched -- we switched from one form of government  swappiness to another.</p><p> PEEK:  Yes, that's true.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That it's government intervention in business, where if you use  steel in this country, you have to go to the Commerce Department hat in  hand and beg for waivers.</p><p> PEEK:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There have been thousands of waivers.</p><p> BLOCK:  And there is a huge backlog at the Commerce Department right now  for these applications for waivers.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  So, there is a lot of red tape on the trade front. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, all right, Jon, we leave it there.  Great to see you this  morning, Jon, thanks so much.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Great.  Thanks a lot. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great analysis, as always, from Jon Hilsenrath from The Wall  Street Journal.  Once again, the GDP is out, this is the first reading of  the third quarter, it came in better-than-expected, up 3.5 percent versus  an estimate of 3.3 percent.</p><p> Coming up next, Microsoft on track to pass Amazon in market cap after  earnings.  We will tell you where that market cap stands.  We break down  the latest numbers right after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We told you the breaking news earlier.  The GDP  out moments ago.  The economy grew at a -- at a rate of 3-1/2 percent in  the third quarter.  This is the first take on the third quarter.  GDP is  better than the expectation which calls for 3.3 percent.  </p><p> Futures came off of their lows, then, went back down again.  We're still  looking at a decline at the start of trading, although, we are off of the  lows.  Dow Industrials down 160 points, NASDAQ down 116.  </p><p> \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney weighs in.  And Stu, what I think is  really a good takeaway is the fact that the consumer part of this report -- </p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- consumer spending up four percent, Stu.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, the -- what is it?  Consumption, that's the proper  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right. </p><p> VARNEY:  Consumption of, what, four percent.  Now, that's a big number.   That is a very bright spot in this report.  You know, Maria, I was the  party pooper about the Mega Million jackpot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know you are.</p><p> VARNEY:  Well, I'm not -- I thought I might be the party pooper over GDP  because I was really hoping for a four percent number as growth in that  quarter.  OK, so, we got 3-1/2 percent.  I still think that's pretty good.   I'm a little disappointed because I was looking for four and more, because  that's what we've been promised if we get the tax cut.  But, look, I'll  take 3.5 percent, especially coming on the back of a 4.2 percent growth  rate in the second quarter.  That's the best back-to-back quarter  performance that we've seen in four years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  So, the trend is still very strong and if we keep this up, we're  going to have a much better than three percent gain for the full calendar  year, 2018.  I'll take it, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'll take it.  And let's not forget that the second  quarter that you just mentioned, 4.3 percent, no revision there, Stu.</p><p> VARNEY:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right?  So, we still got the 4.2 percent in the second quarter  and now, 3-1/2 percent for the third quarter.  I know you're going to dig  deep into these numbers in about 10 minutes.  We will see you top of the  hour.</p><p> VARNEY:  You got it, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Stu.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the  hour, 9:00 Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his  great team there.  </p><p> First, though, Microsoft makes a move, the technology giant now on track to  pass Amazon's market cap.  We've got those numbers.  Microsoft's shares  today down two percent, Amazon down eight percent.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have breaking news right now.  An 11th  suspicious package has been found.  This one from an Opa-locka, Florida  facility.  The FBI is confirming that this package was addressed to New  Jersey Senator, Cory Booker.  This is an 11th package coming out of the  Florida facility and we are following that and other things this morning.   We'll bring you the latest there.  </p><p> Meanwhile, we want to look at market, we've got technology earnings have  been leading this market sell-off, disappointing revenue numbers last night  from a number of high-profile companies.  </p><p> Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now  with those details.  Nic, good morning to you.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   So, we're off of the lows of the morning on that better-than-expected GDP  number.  But we're looking at Amazon which had that revenue miss and the  guidance on revenue, obviously, less than expected.  So, some concerns  potentially about the holiday season, that's one thing, but the other  areas, such as cloud and advertising units continue to grow, have been the  area of growth.  And you've had a mixed bag, some analysts actually raising  their target, some pulling back, and some that are raising still like the  long-term growth story on Amazon.  And those FANG stocks are up 37 percent  annually over the last -- since 2014. </p><p> By the way, as Amazon pulls back, we might see Microsoft move higher in  that closer to the trillion-dollar market.  Remember when Apple crossed it,  didn't close there, but Microsoft now may be getting closer, may surpass  Amazon today with Amazon sell-offs.  So, we'll watch for the market cap  battle.</p><p> And then, there's Alphabet, Google.  The one area that people were  concerned about is people are looking to Amazon to search for products  instead of Google.  So, we've seen, obviously, they've had surging profit  with the slower sales growth.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic.  Thank you so much.  And of course, it's been  an incredibly volatile and busy week for stocks.  We had a really busy week  on this program as well.  Take a look at some of the top moments with the  program.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) business with the Pentagon.  Amazon wants it, too,  but Google walks away from the business with the DOD, and yet, they are  all-in on going into China.</p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE:  I hear Jeff  Bezos and I absolutely agree.  I think U.S. tech companies who say we will  not -- we will not support the U.S. military.  You know, we will not -- we  will not work on any technology that helps our military.  But yet, goes  into China and facilitates the Chinese government, surveilling their  people, is pretty shocking.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is Larry.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hey, the Oracle of Oracle.  What a pleasure.  Nice to  see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tony Stark, I -- did you influence that character?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I've heard that.  I didn't know Stanley is (INAUDIBLE)  so I guess -- I guess Tony Stark was invented before (INAUDIBLE) so, I  guess no.</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Part of why the President  would like to continue cut tax with the middle class is because it has gone  so well.  He sees the fruits of that tax cut and jobs act which passed last  December without a single Democratic vote.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This can't possibly happen before the midterms.  The midterms  are 13 days away and this has to be voted on and Congress is -- the House  is not even in session.</p><p> CONWAY:  Well, Washington moves a little bit too slowly for the sheer  volume and velocity of the Trump agenda.</p><p> REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE:  Obviously, it was so important to  get tax reform passed.  We got no help from the Democrats.  That's actually  very sad, and I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.</p><p> MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISOR TO THE CLINTONS:  I've seen the biggest buildup  and turnout to a midterm election that we've ever seen, which classically  has fairly low turnout.  And I think we've seen the blue wave become a blue  edge, now, I think fairly it's a blue tossup.</p><p> MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS:   President Trump has been talking to the -- to Saudi Arabia, to the King, as  well as to the Crown Prince.  There's a continual dialogue there.  Our eyes  are wide-open when it comes to what we've seen to be this horrific tragedy.</p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  If he's found  to have his fingers on this in any way, I think he is likely to be removed  by his -- by his father.</p><p> LT. COL. ALLEN WEST (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  This is in complete violation of  human rights.  We cannot continue to allow this to happen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The migrant caravan from Honduras has swelled to at least 7,000  people now as it makes its way north.</p><p> KEANE:  We've got to protect our borders, and we have got to protect our  sovereignty.</p><p> FLEISCHMANN:  We're seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how  chaotic and really anarchistic the border situation has become.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Violence and intimidation now on both sides of the aisle.</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Individual through a  great big boulder through -- entered the office and another person entered  as well, and they stole equipment.  The one thing about America we believe  in civil discourse.  I mean, you could -- you could agree -- disagree with  someone and not be disagreeable, but then now it's in your face.</p><p> WEST:  We should not be politicizing political terrorism or violence such  as this.  And I would say to those people that are seeking to do so, you  know, this is a crazy unhinged individual, this is not acceptable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks, your view.</p><p> STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT:  We've had five months to  digest this Iranian news.  This Iranian news is already priced into the  market.  The market has shown us over the summer that it's capable of  handling the current situation.</p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  I  didn't win the Mega Millions this morning, so here I am joining you from  (INAUDIBLE) from New York.</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I haven't checked my numbers yet,  but since I didn't buy a ticket, I'm probably not going to win, that's my  guess.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hi, welcome back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.   Liz Peek?</p><p> PEEK:  Well, I don't think that the GDP report did much for the markets,  but let's -- if the market doesn't completely tank today, I think we're  going to be in a rebuilding phase next week.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Still a good number, 3-1/2 percent growth --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PEEK:  Yes, it definitely was.  And teas up the fourth quarter pretty well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> BLOCK:  Yes, personal consumption was good, investment is challenged, trade  is challenged.  Let's see what happens after midterms.  And longer-term,  I'm going to be -- I'm going to stay optimistic.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's unusual.  And I will be, too.  So, we have about  half of the S&amp;P 500 is still yet to report, so let's hope for better  revenue.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  See the glass half full.  There you go.   Seize the day, everybody.  Have a great weekend, Dagen McDowell, Michael  Block, and Liz Peek, good to see you.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Friday. It is Friday, October 26th, your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the button right now, stocks are in sell-off mode once again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average expected to be down 220 points right out of the gate. That's one percent lower. S&amp;P 500 down 31 points. That's better than one percent right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the NASDAQ with a decline of 145 points right. That's down better than two percent right out of the gate. It has everything to do with earnings. We are awaiting the first look at the GDP for the third quarter. The expectation calls for growth in the third quarter of 3.3 percent. We are going to bring you that number as soon as it hits the tape. That's at 8:30 a.m. and we will have the smartest analysis in the morning right here once the number hits. We will bring that to you.</p><p>Global markets this morning under selling pressure once again. The FT-100 down better than one percent. The CAC Quarante down almost two percent and the DAX Index in Germany down one and a half percent right now. Declines across the board overnight in Asia. As you can see worst performer Korea. Technology earnings are in focus this morning. That's because last night Amazon and Snap among the names reporting and Amazon is down better than eight percent because revenue missed expectations zeroing in on revenue across technology this morning.</p><p>Snap shares are down almost 12 percent. We're watching Google parent Alphabet, the company's profit was up. Sales were down. Well, it was slowing down lower than people expected and as a result the stock is down five percent on Alphabet. Plus, there's a bombshell report this morning out of Google over sexual misconduct. That's also playing into things here. So we'll have more on that coming up. And then this, the caravan crisis continues.</p><p>Hundreds more National Guard troops making their way toward the border right now as President Trump calls on the group of illegal immigrants to turn around. That was echoed by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: This caravan cannot come to the United States. They will not be allowed in. They will not be allowed to stay. If they come here illegally with no legitimate reason to stay, they absolutely will be apprehended and remove immediately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll have the very latest developments this morning on that. Stay with us on that. All stories coming up this Friday morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Third Seven Advisors Market Strategist, Michael Block, and Fox News Contributor Liz Peek. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Yes. It does gets worst and worst as we're watching this open. But it's important to note that all those sell-offs overseas we're in the wake of Amazon's report and Google's report, and so forth. I mean it was a tech problem in those markets as well. So, you know, the question is the GDP number going to make a difference?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see. I mean the estimate is 3.3 percent growth. I don't know if there's a good outcome here, Dagen, because if we get a strong number on GDP, that basically keeps the Federal Reserve's plan in place to raise interest rates in December, and then another three times next year, if their GDP is worse than expected, that perpetuates the story that the economy is slowing.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. And there's a story in The Wall Street Journal today that trade and manufacturing numbers point to slower fourth quarter growth. Many forecasters expect the growth rate to slip below three percent in the -- of the fourth quarter of the current -- the quarter that we're currently in because the trade deficit and goods has widened four months in a row.</p><p>That's a problem and then also you saw the durable goods report yesterday, big increase in military aircraft orders, but excluding defense durable goods orders fell, and so that's another thing to worry about was for the month of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think we also have to talk about some technical things. You mentioned the lack of companies in the market buying those stocks. There's also tax loss selling going on. This also could be part of this because mutual funds and hedge funds have a fiscal year-end of October 31, so there could be some tax loss selling and as you said earlier companies are not buying back those stock --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: And they're quiet periods. They're not allowed to sort of -- there's a sort of, you know, there's this back vacancy there where they have been in pretty powerful force a lot of these stocks --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All of these plays into -- in addition to the fundamentals.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS: There's -- there's a (INAUDIBLE) going on in one another tax loss selling this volatility gets more volatility and more losses and more pain. One thing I want to point we're talking about tech earnings and there are some short falls there. But overall growth in tech, Goodyear just reported this morning in industrial space. I've been negative on this space. I just want to point out.</p><p>They're citing -- they're lowering guidance and they're citing raw material costs escalating. They're blaming China. They're blaming economic uncertainty in Brazil. There's a lot of things they're throwing out there, but these are all other issues that are impacting these markets even if the big tech companies are insulated somewhat from that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just one more statistic as we've been talking about the revenue misses. That's in the headlines of the Amazon numbers that sales underwhelm Alphabet delivering slowing sales growth. Here's a statistic, 43 percent of companies half of the S&amp;P has reported so far roughly half 43 percent of the companies have missed expectations, same period, second quarter. It was only 28 percent missing. So it's a much larger percentage for the current reporting period in terms of missing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: -- a lot of companies lower their guidance which of course is also a problem for the market and for these shares.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's why you've got tech tumbling this morning. It is about revenue. It is about expectations of slowdown. Global stocks extending declines following disappointing third quarter earnings from internet giants Amazon and Alphabet. That puts a dent in the solid earnings season for technology. Both industry leaders beat on earnings, but fell short on Wall Street revenue expectations as Dagen just mentioned. Amazon also forecast the weakest profit growth in two years.</p><p>And let's not forget the cost side of this because amazon just raised wages, $15 an hour. That's going to take effect next week. A number of input cost have been going up. Joining us right now on the phone EndPoint Technologies Associates Founder and President, Roger Kay. Roger, good to have you on the program. Thanks for weighing in here. What do you think is going on within technology?</p><p>ROGER KAY, FOUNDER, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATES: Yes. Good morning, Maria. Well, so basically, we're on a -- the end of a 10-year boom market, so it's not surprising to think they're slowing down. The other thing is, of course, there's just a lot of volatility after all. It's up hundreds of points yesterday. It's going to open probably off, you know, at least 100 points this morning, and it's been doing that back-and-forth for quite a while.</p><p>I think volatility scares away investors. It invites speculators that also like to play volatility. But I think that ordinary people are spooked when the market moves several percent a day --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You mentions -- you mentioned that the length of this bull market, that's something that AlphaOne Capital Partners Founding Pattern Dan Niles mentioned as well. He summed it up this way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS: This is the longest bull market in the S&amp;P 500 since World War II. It's been up for 115 months. The gains over that period of time are up over 330 percent which is the second biggest gain and during a bull market since World War II. But if you look at the big picture around growth, you got a lot of concerns. You got China starting to slow down, auto sales in China went from being up 15 percent year-over-year in April to down 10 percent in the most recent month.</p><p>That's a pretty big change. We got concerns over Italy and Brexit in Europe. And in the U.S., interest rates are going up. They're at the highest levels in seven years. What you see in general during this earnings season with Boeing being a pretty big exception is that a lot of companies are guiding much lower. I'll give you an example. Texas Instruments reported last night and I think they're one of the best indicators in terms of global health.</p><p>They do about 16 billion in revenues, a hundred billion in market cap. They missed revenue expectations for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2015. So it's been almost three years since they missed the top line. They talked about every major end market slowing down and they weren't sure when it was going to stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?</p><p>NILES: I think you absolutely are and this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of inventory out there. So if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple for example, that 89 percent inventory growth year- over-year in the June quarter that they reported. Their revenues were up 17 percent. What if the iPhone doesn't sell well? They're going to have to barn that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, there you go, Roger. And the iPhone's thousand dollars for the iPhone X may not sell very well. What do you think?</p><p>KAY: Well, right. So, you know, often in the technology industry particularly when you're talking about goods as opposed to service in this because after all part (INAUDIBLE) inventory of services. But it certainly there has been in the past channel stopping where the managers of a company, you know, the main company are motivated to move product at the end of the quarter. They push it to distribution and then let the distribution worry about working it off.</p><p>That's their problem next quarter. But that of course comes home to roost within a quarter and you realize that the, you know, the mother ship isn't get anymore sales. So I think, you know, that kind of -- it happens, you know, in a badly management situation, you know, Tim Cook is not known for bad management, so it's unusual that they had stop inventory at purpose. But it's possible that normal inventories well went in and that the sales were slowing at the far end of the feds while there was inventory still.</p><p>But that's indicative of I think across the board this question (INAUDIBLE) of growth that we come through this long period of growth and everybody has been just climbing and climbing and then that's your -- that speak under reported section there was saying there's just a lot of different sources headwind including rising interest rates. I think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- people, you know, they sell first and think alter, Michael.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes. You know, Roger, we're here looking at this sea of red this morning maybe lost in the clouds here is Intel which, you know, having a rough quarter last time around with their core business, and didn't quite do what they wanted to do in the data room so to speak. Yet, yesterday, really came in better than that lower bar and their core business actually pretty good and they were talking pretty confidentially about the move down in (INAUDIBLE) what do you think of that, you know, are there bright spots here? You know, is everything really --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAY: Yes. What's interesting is I mean the Intel is off a little bit in premarket, but now as much as the others. So, you know, if you look at a handful of big name stocks, you'll see that most of the tech stocks are off in the two percent range some as high as four percent in premarket. But Intel is only a slight decline and I think that reflects the positive attitude that Intel may have been getting back together with respect to the process in technology.</p><p>So it's interesting that the (INAUDIBLE) the other side of the shop, you know, the non-Intel part of the Silicon industry. It's already basically talking about (INAUDIBLE) but what's interesting is if you look a transistor density rather than the sort of (INAUDIBLE) which is what the (INAUDIBLE) it turns out that Intel's pen is kind of similar to (INAUDIBLE) and so that actually that puts Intel not as far behind as people had thought they were.</p><p>So if they pull it together on their 10, they're kind of in the game against (INAUDIBLE) and that's good news for them, so I think people interpreting that and conversely they're interpreting the AMD side of that that's both negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: So Roger, what could turn this group around? What could get the tech stocks going again?</p><p>KAY: You know, finding another planet to colonize. There's got to be some way to get more growth out of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Citing more growth? Yes, sure.</p><p>BLOCK: Isn't Elon Musk doing that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) is boring into one. Roger, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much. Thanks for calling in, sir. Roger Kay joining us there. Coming up, the search for a sender is intensifying this morning. Authorities are now zeroing in on Florida after locating a 10th suspicious package. The very latest on that investigation next. And then Saudi Arabia changing its story again about what happened to journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside its Istanbul interment - embassy. Khashoggi's son has arrived in the United States. He was barred from leaving Saudi for a while. Details there next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets are lower this morning. Take a look at the sell-off going on right now. Dow Industrials down almost one percent, 221 points lower. The S&amp;P 500 down 32 points, better than one percent lower and the NASDAQ is down two percent. That's 146 points lower. This perpetuating view that things are slowing down last night because Amazon and Google disappointed on revenue. Meanwhile, there's this, the son of the murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, his son has now arrived in the United States. Cheryl Casone with all the details now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is something, Maria. This is the eldest son that is now in the United States with his family. He previously had been unable to leave Saudi Arabia because of his father's criticism of the Saudi government. Well, the State Department says that U.S. welcomes Saudi Arabia's decision to allow Khashoggi's son to leave that country. Meanwhile, the Saudi government changing its story again now saying the killing was premeditated.</p><p>Saudi officials say that Turkey's evidence shows the murder was planned contradicting their earlier claim that rouge officials killed Khashoggi by mistake during a fist fight. Well, after an intense nationwide manhunt under -- is underway after 10 pipe bomb packages were sent to prominent Democrats. Some new details for you it. Federal investigators has searched a mail facility in South Florida. That happened last night. Several of the packages actually went through that facility.</p><p>Investigators also focusing on New York City after one of the bombs was sent to actor Robert De Niro. Meanwhile, President Trump tweeting, funny how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombings, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, it's not just presidential.</p><p>Well, corporate travel trends are changing and so are companies expense reports, shocker. Lyft made the top 10 list of the most frequently expensed business cost in the U.S. for the first time. This was during the third quarter, certified track all stuff. They're a traveling expense software company. Lyft was number six on the list with Uber in the top spot. Amazon coming in third, interesting. Both Uber and Amazon had been moving up the ranks over the last three years.</p><p>And then speaking at people getting paid, Sofia Vergara extending her reign as queen of television. The Modern Family actress topping Forbes list of highest paid T.V. actresses for the seventh year in a row whopping 42.5 million was her take. That's only twice the 24-1/2 million that Big Bang Theory actress Kaley Cuoco made. Coming in third place, Grace Anatomy's Ellen Pompeo with 23-1/2 million rounding out the top five, Law &amp; Order's Mariska Hargitay, and then Sofia Vergara's Modern Family co-star, Maria, Julie Bowen which has got lots of money and she's married to a tall drink of water --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: Wow. Lucky to be her.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, caravan crisis, hundreds more National Guard troops are making their way toward the border right now. President Trump is calling on the group of illegal immigrants to turn around. He says they're not coming in the country. The very latest there. Then we are waiting the first read on third quarter GDP. We have the number. The expert analysis as soon as it crosses 3.3 percent growth is the estimate. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Caravan crisis, President Trump is demanding the thousands of Central American migrants headed to the United States make a U-turn. The warning coming as the administration deploys hundreds of troops to the southern border. Joining us right now is Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs and member of the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman, it's good to see you. Thank you for being here. Arizona, obviously, a border state.</p><p>You recent tweeted that you support sending the troops to the border. Assess the situation for us. Tell us what it looks like today and what can be done.</p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R), ARIZONA: Well, it's pretty bleak in some respects because the drug cartels control the border putting more military in the border actually gives a show of force even though they're not going to be en0gaged in normal typical military issues. But we're looking at a convoy of people that are going to try to overturn the border for the purpose of the organizers who are (INAUDIBLE) they want to -- they don't want to board -- they don't want a border between Mexico and the U.S.</p><p>And so it's pretty rough right down there on the border right now.</p><p>PEEK: Quick - congressman, question. What can the military actually do? You hear different reports on this whether they can actually engage with these marchers or how ever -- this caravan, what role can they play really?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, they're going to be a supportive role and what that means they'll be able to help track people who are coming across the borders to free up the border patrol agents to actually interdict the people. They all need to be -- they should be armed so they can protect themselves because you got the cartels all armed. You know, they've got the watchers and so they are going to be supportive I think and I think that will be a benefit. But we got so much more to do on the border than just this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you going to vote for the president -- are you going to vote for Kevin McCarthy's bill and the president's border wall?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, you knowledge what, I actually introduced my own bill which I think is a bill if that's the -- if that's the only bill that comes out -- if it's Kevin's bill, I'll vote for Kevin's bill. I think mine is better - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- bill differ from that bill?</p><p>BIGGS: My bill actually provides funding sources off general funds to pay for that bill. It also restores money to the border patrol agents that were had their pay reduced under the Obama administration and provides equipment for the men and women of the border patrol.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And let me switch gears and ask you about the fallout from the Kavanaugh confirmation, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is referring Michael Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick for possible criminal prosecution over these allegations of making false statements to Congress, your reaction, sir.</p><p>BIGGS: Long overdue. I'm glad to see that Chairman Grassley is out there doing that because I think Mr. Avenatti and Ms. Swetnick, they really tried to throw gas on to a fire that was already there for whatever purposes, and it looks like they made false statements and then they should held -- be held accountable for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much.</p><p>BIGGS: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Andy Biggs joining us there. We want to take a short break and then we are just moments away from getting the first look at the third quarter GDP. We are going to bring you those numbers as soon as it hits the tape. That is at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. That is in four minutes from now, 3.3 percent growth is what's expected for the first read on the third quarter GDP, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, October 26th, your top stories right now just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast, we are a minute way away from third quarter GDP number. The expectation calls for growth of 3.3 percent. This will be the first reading of growth for the third quarter. It comes after the second quarter generated growth of 4.2 percent.</p><p>Ahead of the release, markets are selling-off again this morning. A negative tone for stocks, Dow Industrials expected to be down 200 points almost one percent. The S&amp;P 500 is down better than one percent and the NASDAQ down better than two percent right now all because of disappointing earnings reports. You had revenue misses. Google parent company Alphabet and Amazon -- a sell-off this -- with Amazon down better than eight percent. Alphabet down five percent.</p><p>The worry here guidance is weaker than expected and revenue is coming in weaker than expected within tech. In Europe, similar story, down across the board in European indices today. The FT 100 down better than one percent. The CAC quarante in Paris down one and three-quarters percent and the DAX Index in Germany down one and a third percent. Asian markets overnight in the red across the board. We are waiting on the first look of third quarter GDP this morning.</p><p>We are in the middle of earnings season. For the GDP, the expectation calls for 3.3 percent growth and we are expecting earnings to be up 21 percent for the quarter year-over-year. Joining us right now is Jon Hilsenrath, The Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor. And Jon, we're going to get the number momentarily. We know that your often focused on the consumer.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what consumer is showing within this GDP number, the expect -- 3.5 percent is the number, Jon. 3.5 percent is better than expected. We were expecting 3.3 percent, and we are watching markets for any reaction. Your expectations and your reaction to a 3.5 percent number, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, that's a strong number. What I want -- what I want to do is break this down a little bit and see where it comes from. I think trade was probably a drag for the quarter. I think we also have to look very carefully in addition to the consumer at government. There's been a - - as we've reported today in The Wall Street Journal, there's been a big pickup in military spending, government spending is contributing a lot to growth right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Consumer spending is up four -- consumer spending is doing well within this, up four percent?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Correct, four percent in the third quarter. The strongest rate of growth in almost four years on the consumer side.</p><p>BLOCK: Street was looking for up 3.3 on that as well, so that's a big beat.</p><p>PEEK: That's big. That's a big beat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right. And that -- I mean, that makes sense. You've got an unemployment rate that's down under four percent, lowest levels since the 1960s. And you also have tax cuts that are making their way through the system, so we should be seeing strong consumer spending right now. We also have to look at what's going on on the business investment side, you know, for this growth to be sustainable in the long run, we need to see more business investment, and I want to see how that breaks down as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Investment by companies was weak, Jon, non-residential, fixed- investment, spending on commercial construction equipment, intellectual property products like software rose only eight-tenths of one percent in the third quarter. That was after rising in an 8.7 percent rate in the second quarter and 11-1/2 in the first.</p><p>BLOCK: Inflation is also light here, core PCE came in up 1.6 percent quarter over quarter, street was looking for up 1.8, so there's not some runaway inflation story here. It looks like consumption is strong. As Dagen points out, investment weak --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Markets improving.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. One more thing, private inventories which is something that Liz was talking about, private inventories added more than two percentage points to the third-quarter growth rate, reversing that trend that you saw in the second quarter when companies were drawing down their stockpiles ahead of the tariffs.</p><p>PEEK: That has been sort of an offset on going quarter-to-quarter with the trade -- the widening trade deficit. It seems to me that consumer news here is very important, because the fourth quarter is all about holiday sales, all about consumer spending, the fact that that's held up and actually beat by such a wide margin, I think teases up for less pessimism if you want to look at it that way about the fourth quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And interesting, there's no revisions on the second quarter, Jon. The second quarter was really strong at 4.2 percent, that is not being revised downward, so that stays in place with the better-than- expected initial or advanced reading, the first reading for the third quarter at 3-1/2 percent, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, so I'd say a few things here based on these breakdowns that you've given me. One is let's go back and talk about that inflation number, the market has been very concerned and the President has been very concerned about the Fed continuing to raise interest rates going into next year. You know, the inflation numbers have come in kind of soft over the last couple of months, and I think the Fed is going to have to start paying attention to that and factor in that into how far they want to go on interest rate increases.</p><p>On the inventory piece that you talked about, that's a volatile number, it doesn't fundamentally have much to do with economic growth in the long run. So, the fact that it added a lot to growth in third quarter I think becomes a potential drag on growth in the second quarter. A lot of the estimates that we get at The Wall Street Journal for fourth quarter is that it's going to slow down a little bit on overall growth, and it's going to slow down -- growth is going to slow down going into 2019, that inventory piece plays into that.</p><p>PEEK: It seems to me it's almost a percent number for people who are Fed watchers, though, right? Because it isn't really high enough to spur alarm at the Fed, any kind of acceleration, or you know, incremental rate hikes next year neither is it low enough to kind of take them off their paths. So, it seems to me that's sort of a neutral.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Although, I will add looking at this report, higher borrowing costs have hurt housing and auto sales.</p><p>PEEK: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Spending on motor vehicles and parts added just 0.09 percentage points, so third quarter growth, and in terms of residential-fixed investment fell at a four percent annual rate in the third quarter. So, is --</p><p>HILSENRATH: You know, residential has been -- residential has been a really big drag for several quarters now, and that's continuing. It's a little puzzling because there's under supply in the housing market, but builders (INAUDIBLE) building because labor is short, and land supply is short, and costs are going up, so, you know, we should be seeing more building and we're just not getting it right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, Jon, there is -- during the summer, there was a plentiful amount of inventory coming on the market in many housing markets that were already weak. There are a lot of pockets of weakness in housing in this country that are overlooked because we tend to focus on the metropolitan areas.</p><p>BLOCK: You know, and supply, actually, has been going up in some of these metrics. I think I saw a 7.1 month supply in one of the -- one of the metrics this week on existing home sales. The only thing I'll point out is, even in the Fed minutes, it was pointed out that higher rates might be crimping residential investments to your point, Jon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I also think that it's, you know, understandable that the third quarter rate of business investment was weak. And this is actually the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2016, spending on structures down, 7.9 percent. You would expect companies to pull back in terms of spending with the uncertainties of tariffs, with the uncertainties of the demand picture on the horizon, because there is all of this worry, this narrative that things slow down a bit. So, I'm not surprised that the level of investment spending is weak in this report, Jon, particularly after we've seen animal spirits these last two years, spending has been up.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, there are three things going on in the business investment side we have -- we have to look at. One is you mentioned structure is down, structures has been very strong because there's been a lot of investment going on in oil and gas rates as oil prices came up. They've stabilized so maybe that spurred a growth that we've gotten that's also stabilized.</p><p>The other thing you just mentioned, you know, with tariffs coming on, a lot of companies are talking about slowing their investment plans because they're just so uncertain about what the trade landscape is going to look like. And then the third piece is tax cuts. You know, the Trump administration, Republicans in Congress cut taxes, corporate tax rates very aggressively to try to spur business investment. But it looks like this tariff uncertainty is taking away some of the boom that they were hoping to get on the business investment side.</p><p>You know, again, if these growth rates are going to be sustainable, it's going to have to show up in business investment, and I'd say, the soft number there has got to be a little disappointing today.</p><p>PEEK: I would say politically, too, that's a problem, because Democrats have really made the case that the tax cuts for corporations are really just going into stock buybacks, they're not going to have any impact on workers, and we need investment to get productivity up, so that wages will go up, so I do think it's a disappointing number. And probably is a result of the uncertainty.</p><p>BLOCK: You know, Jon, the other day, you know, we're starting to hear some noises about the yield curve, there were some comments a few weeks ago saying, well, it's kind of a relief. It was even in the minutes as well that with rates backing up and along the curve may be there's not so much risk of inversion. We see what the 10-year is doing now. Look, my call was actually -- we're going to see the 10-year back below three. You can write that down, I'm saying it right now. Are we going to get the Fed more concerned now about the possibility of inversion and what that can mean? Do they care about that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And let's point out this op-ed in The Journal today written by Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari titled \"Pause Interest Rate Hikes to Help the Labor Force Grow.\" Kashkari writes, \"With the Fed funds rate at two to 2-1/4 percent, monetary policy is now close to neutral, neither stimulating nor restricting the economy. Prematurely tapping the brakes could restrain wage growth and keep many Americans from participating in the economic recovery.\" You expect the 10-year to go back down below three percent. Is it partly because you think that they are going to see a pause in the rate hikes?</p><p>BLOCK: I think we're going to see a slowdown and I think we are going to see that happen. And, you know, look, I'm going to say it right now, I think next year, I think two hikes max.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Two hikes max.</p><p>BLOCK: That's where I am right now. I've been there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're at three hikes for next year, Jon, isn't that right?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes. And it all comes down to the inflation numbers. The -- you know, you're talking about the yield curve and long-term interest rates, and I think long-term interest rates are a signal of how concerned the long-term investors are in the outlook for inflation. And if the inflation numbers come -- continue to come in in soft, and it sounds like they were soft in this number, then I think the Fed has going to have to think about maybe slowing down the pace of rate increases. You know, I just wanted to ask you all, we've talked about a lot of different components if this, if anyone has the government spending numbers, I'd love to know what they are, because they -- military spending is a really big impact on growth right now, there's a lot -- there's a lot of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, here it is. We got it, Jon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Government expenditures were up at 3.3 percent annual rate, and the third-quarter defense spending rising in an annual rate of 4.6 percent, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes. Yes, that's a big driver, and that one is going to continue. So, the two things I think we have driving economic growth right now are consumers and government, ironically.</p><p>BLOCK: You know, the last time we didn't mention explicitly here is that exports were down 3.5 percent in Q3 and imports rose at 9.1 percent. It just plays into this whole rising deficit thing. Look, I don't think the bottom market cares but it's part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we -- but we would know that watching these trade deficit numbers coming in, in the third quarter, Jon, that the trade deficit has widened throughout the third quarter. Again, there were some pull forward in the second quarter where you had, say, soybeans exporters really pushing inventory overseas ahead of those tariffs between the United States and China that went into place over the summer, so, again, that reversed course and showed up in this GDP figure.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's exactly right, Dagen, you have to look at what happened with trade in the second and third quarter combined, there was a lot of anticipatory reaction in the second quarter, particularly in agricultural goods, and that looks like it reversed. But, you know, with the tariffs that we have going on, we have to think about trade being a potential drag for the economy -- for the global economy in the months ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And that's what we were -- we're also expecting companies to start pulling back as we have seen in this report, because of the uncertainty of it. You know, what will the impact of these tariffs be in this quarter and into 2019? That's one reason that you --</p><p>PEEK: That's a little ironic, right? I mean, basically, under Obama, the uncertainty all had to do with regulation and changes that the business community faced day-to-day, now it is so unfortunate that we have that deregulatory cloud sort of lifting, but in its place, we have uncertainty about the tariff policies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, we switched -- we switched from one form of government swappiness to another.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, that's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That it's government intervention in business, where if you use steel in this country, you have to go to the Commerce Department hat in hand and beg for waivers.</p><p>PEEK: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There have been thousands of waivers.</p><p>BLOCK: And there is a huge backlog at the Commerce Department right now for these applications for waivers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So, there is a lot of red tape on the trade front.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, all right, Jon, we leave it there. Great to see you this morning, Jon, thanks so much.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Great. Thanks a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great analysis, as always, from Jon Hilsenrath from The Wall Street Journal. Once again, the GDP is out, this is the first reading of the third quarter, it came in better-than-expected, up 3.5 percent versus an estimate of 3.3 percent.</p><p>Coming up next, Microsoft on track to pass Amazon in market cap after earnings. We will tell you where that market cap stands. We break down the latest numbers right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We told you the breaking news earlier. The GDP out moments ago. The economy grew at a -- at a rate of 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter. This is the first take on the third quarter. GDP is better than the expectation which calls for 3.3 percent.</p><p>Futures came off of their lows, then, went back down again. We're still looking at a decline at the start of trading, although, we are off of the lows. Dow Industrials down 160 points, NASDAQ down 116.</p><p>\"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney weighs in. And Stu, what I think is really a good takeaway is the fact that the consumer part of this report --</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- consumer spending up four percent, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, the -- what is it? Consumption, that's the proper (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>VARNEY: Consumption of, what, four percent. Now, that's a big number. That is a very bright spot in this report. You know, Maria, I was the party pooper about the Mega Million jackpot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you are.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, I'm not -- I thought I might be the party pooper over GDP because I was really hoping for a four percent number as growth in that quarter. OK, so, we got 3-1/2 percent. I still think that's pretty good. I'm a little disappointed because I was looking for four and more, because that's what we've been promised if we get the tax cut. But, look, I'll take 3.5 percent, especially coming on the back of a 4.2 percent growth rate in the second quarter. That's the best back-to-back quarter performance that we've seen in four years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: So, the trend is still very strong and if we keep this up, we're going to have a much better than three percent gain for the full calendar year, 2018. I'll take it, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I'll take it. And let's not forget that the second quarter that you just mentioned, 4.3 percent, no revision there, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right? So, we still got the 4.2 percent in the second quarter and now, 3-1/2 percent for the third quarter. I know you're going to dig deep into these numbers in about 10 minutes. We will see you top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY: You got it, Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Stu. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9:00 Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart and his great team there.</p><p>First, though, Microsoft makes a move, the technology giant now on track to pass Amazon's market cap. We've got those numbers. Microsoft's shares today down two percent, Amazon down eight percent. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We have breaking news right now. An 11th suspicious package has been found. This one from an Opa-locka, Florida facility. The FBI is confirming that this package was addressed to New Jersey Senator, Cory Booker. This is an 11th package coming out of the Florida facility and we are following that and other things this morning. We'll bring you the latest there.</p><p>Meanwhile, we want to look at market, we've got technology earnings have been leading this market sell-off, disappointing revenue numbers last night from a number of high-profile companies.</p><p>Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now with those details. Nic, good morning to you.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. So, we're off of the lows of the morning on that better-than-expected GDP number. But we're looking at Amazon which had that revenue miss and the guidance on revenue, obviously, less than expected. So, some concerns potentially about the holiday season, that's one thing, but the other areas, such as cloud and advertising units continue to grow, have been the area of growth. And you've had a mixed bag, some analysts actually raising their target, some pulling back, and some that are raising still like the long-term growth story on Amazon. And those FANG stocks are up 37 percent annually over the last -- since 2014.</p><p>By the way, as Amazon pulls back, we might see Microsoft move higher in that closer to the trillion-dollar market. Remember when Apple crossed it, didn't close there, but Microsoft now may be getting closer, may surpass Amazon today with Amazon sell-offs. So, we'll watch for the market cap battle.</p><p>And then, there's Alphabet, Google. The one area that people were concerned about is people are looking to Amazon to search for products instead of Google. So, we've seen, obviously, they've had surging profit with the slower sales growth. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Nic. Thank you so much. And of course, it's been an incredibly volatile and busy week for stocks. We had a really busy week on this program as well. Take a look at some of the top moments with the program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) business with the Pentagon. Amazon wants it, too, but Google walks away from the business with the DOD, and yet, they are all-in on going into China.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ORACLE: I hear Jeff Bezos and I absolutely agree. I think U.S. tech companies who say we will not -- we will not support the U.S. military. You know, we will not -- we will not work on any technology that helps our military. But yet, goes into China and facilitates the Chinese government, surveilling their people, is pretty shocking.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is Larry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, the Oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tony Stark, I -- did you influence that character?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've heard that. I didn't know Stanley is (INAUDIBLE) so I guess -- I guess Tony Stark was invented before (INAUDIBLE) so, I guess no.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Part of why the President would like to continue cut tax with the middle class is because it has gone so well. He sees the fruits of that tax cut and jobs act which passed last December without a single Democratic vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This can't possibly happen before the midterms. The midterms are 13 days away and this has to be voted on and Congress is -- the House is not even in session.</p><p>CONWAY: Well, Washington moves a little bit too slowly for the sheer volume and velocity of the Trump agenda.</p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R), TENNESSEE: Obviously, it was so important to get tax reform passed. We got no help from the Democrats. That's actually very sad, and I think that's going to hurt them in the midterms.</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISOR TO THE CLINTONS: I've seen the biggest buildup and turnout to a midterm election that we've ever seen, which classically has fairly low turnout. And I think we've seen the blue wave become a blue edge, now, I think fairly it's a blue tossup.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: President Trump has been talking to the -- to Saudi Arabia, to the King, as well as to the Crown Prince. There's a continual dialogue there. Our eyes are wide-open when it comes to what we've seen to be this horrific tragedy.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: If he's found to have his fingers on this in any way, I think he is likely to be removed by his -- by his father.</p><p>LT. COL. ALLEN WEST (RET.), U.S. ARMY: This is in complete violation of human rights. We cannot continue to allow this to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The migrant caravan from Honduras has swelled to at least 7,000 people now as it makes its way north.</p><p>KEANE: We've got to protect our borders, and we have got to protect our sovereignty.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: We're seeing by virtue of this caravan right now just how chaotic and really anarchistic the border situation has become.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Violence and intimidation now on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Individual through a great big boulder through -- entered the office and another person entered as well, and they stole equipment. The one thing about America we believe in civil discourse. I mean, you could -- you could agree -- disagree with someone and not be disagreeable, but then now it's in your face.</p><p>WEST: We should not be politicizing political terrorism or violence such as this. And I would say to those people that are seeking to do so, you know, this is a crazy unhinged individual, this is not acceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Impact of Iran sanctions within two weeks, your view.</p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, PUBLISHER, THE SCHORK REPORT: We've had five months to digest this Iranian news. This Iranian news is already priced into the market. The market has shown us over the summer that it's capable of handling the current situation.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. I didn't win the Mega Millions this morning, so here I am joining you from (INAUDIBLE) from New York.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I haven't checked my numbers yet, but since I didn't buy a ticket, I'm probably not going to win, that's my guess.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hi, welcome back. Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Liz Peek?</p><p>PEEK: Well, I don't think that the GDP report did much for the markets, but let's -- if the market doesn't completely tank today, I think we're going to be in a rebuilding phase next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Still a good number, 3-1/2 percent growth --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: Yes, it definitely was. And teas up the fourth quarter pretty well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes, personal consumption was good, investment is challenged, trade is challenged. Let's see what happens after midterms. And longer-term, I'm going to be -- I'm going to stay optimistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, that's unusual. And I will be, too. So, we have about half of the S&amp;P 500 is still yet to report, so let's hope for better revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. See the glass half full. There you go. Seize the day, everybody.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond warned on sales.</p><p>Lyft stock retreated 5% before the open despite a solid Q4, but after surging 14% in the three sessions following Uber earnings results last week. Uber stock edged higher after spiking 11% in the prior three days. Akamai stock rose 4.6%, signaling a move out of buy range. NMI stock plunged 8%, backing away from a buy point. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock crashed 26%.</p><h>Shopify Earnings</h><p>Shopify earnings jumped 59% to 43 cents a share with revenue up 47% to $505.16 million. Analysts expected Shopify earnings falling to 24 cents a share as the e-commerce software leader invests to more directly take on Amazon, with revenue rising $482 million. Analysts expect booming Shopify earnings growth in 2020.</p><p>Shopify sees Q1 revenue of $440 million to $446 million and full-year revenue of $2.130 billion to $2.160 billion. Q1 guidance is in line while the full-year target is slightly above analyst views.</p><p>Several top software makers have reported disappointing results or guidance in recent days, notably Paycom and Paylocity.

But the  took a toll on megacap techs, huge weights on the major indexes. The FTC will review the five tech titans' acquisitions over the past decade, even the ones so small that they didn't bother to seek regulatory approval.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat after hitting a new all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 index rose 0.2% and the Nasdaq composite 0.1%, slightly adding to Monday's new highs.</p><p>Microsoft stock, Apple stock, Amazon stock and Google stock are the four biggest U.S. companies by market cap, all above $1 trillion. Facebook stock is at $591 billion.</p><p>Facebook stock slid 2.8%, falling back below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft stock fell 2.3%, reversing from a record high. But that's after running up 18% from its Jan. 27 low to Monday's close. Apple stock edged down 0.6%. Amazon stock and Google stock rose slightly after hitting record highs intraday.</p><p>Meanwhile, many leading stocks held up well or delivered solid gains.</p><p>Among the\u00a0, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF rose 0.3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF dipped 0.2%, with Microsoft stock a notable IGV holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF jumped 2.1% as SMH component\u00a0AMD rose 2.9%.</p><p>If megacap stocks take a breather\u00a0\u2014 especially for fast-running Microsoft stock and Amazon stock\u00a0\u2014 that could be healthy for the broader stock market rally. The major indexes have rebounded powerfully from the brief coronavirus pullback, moving back to the top of short-term channel lines.</p><p>Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter via\u00a0\u00a0for stock market updates and more.</p><p>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-5491796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y67-0H81-DYTD-910V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

The coronavirus stock market rally had a solid session Wednesday for growth names, with upbeat economic data and vaccine news. That's despite record new U.S. coronavirus cases as well as fresh Covid-19 restrictions and corporate actions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All eyes are on Tesla, with TSLA stock continuing to soar early Thursday on second-quarter deliveries data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FANG stocks Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet showed bullish action Wednesday, while Teladoc Health and Okta cleared buy points. Among the FANG internet giants, Amazon stock and Netflix stock hit record highs, with NFLX stock moving back into a buy zone. Facebook stock and Google stock continued to rebound from last Friday's sell-offs, but those are a little murkier.</p><p>Teladoc stock and Okta stock offered entries for aggressive investors.

It's a stock picker's market. Diversify among leaders, but not across the stock market.</p><h>Dow Jones Futures Today</h><p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.85% vs. fair value, while S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.7%.

Covid-19 deaths rose above 519,000.</p><p>Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have climbed to 2.78 million, with deaths near 131,000. New U.S. Covid-19 cases topped 51,000 on Wednesday, a record high, after clearing 40,000 for six straight days.</p><p>Arizona, California, Texas, Florida, Georgia and several other states are hitting record new coronavirus cases. Increased testing is a big factor, but the share of positive tests has spiked in many states as well.</p><p>New York halted plans to resume indoor dining amid the nationwide resurgence. That comes a day after New Jersey made the same move. On Tuesday, New York added California and seven other states to its Covid-19 quarantine rule. Travelers to New York from hot spot states must quarantine for 14 days.</p><p>Apple is closing 30 more Apple Stores as of Thursday. That's a total of 77 Apple Stores closed down temporarily once again as coronavirus cases soar again in much of the U.S. Apple stock edged lower Wednesday, but it's still near record highs.</p><p>Fellow Dow Jones component\u00a0McDonald's is pausing further re-opening of dine-in service in the U.S. Shares fell late Wednesday but turned slightly higher in Thursday's premarket.</p><p>Covid-19 Deaths have continued to trend lower for the past several weeks despite soaring coronavirus cases. However, Arizona did report a daily record for coronavirus deaths, along with a new peak in daily infections. Texas reported its highest daily death toll in six weeks.</p><p>A reason for optimism is progress on coronavirus treatments and vaccines. Early Tuesday, Dow Jones giant\u00a0Pfizer and BioNTech announced positive early Phase 1/2 Trial results for its coronavirus vaccine candidate. But there some side-effects at higher doses and the results haven't been peer reviewed. Pfizer stock pared gains but still closed with a 3.2% gain. BioNTech stock closed down 3.9%.</p><h>Coronavirus Stock Market Rally</h><p>The coronavirus stock market rally had a modest but upbeat session on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine news and upbeat economic data.\u00a0The ISM manufacturing index shot up 9.5 points in June to 52.6, better than expected and back above 50, signaling growth. Before the open, the ADP employment report found that private jobs grew by 2.37 million, less than expected. But May's figures were revised from -2.76 million to a gain of 3.065 million.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average faded into the close, sliding 0.3% in Wednesday's\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/\">stock market trading</url>.\u00a0The S&amp;P 500 index rose 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.95%. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 hit a record high, with FANG stocks Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google all contributing, along with Tesla stock.</p><p>Among the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/best-etfs-exchange-traded-funds/\">best ETFs</url>, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF rallied 1.25%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF jumped 2.1%, hitting a record high. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF sank 0.6%.</p><p>While there are many growth stocks showing bullish action, it's a stock picker's market. Although the Nasdaq is right at record highs, the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/market-trend/dow-jones-today-dow-stocks-stock-market-news/\">Dow Jones today</url>\u00a0is still below its 200-day line.</p><h>Tesla Stock Soars On Deliveries</h><p>TSLA stock shot up 10% to 1,228 before the open, signaling a new all-time high.</p><p>Tesla delivered 90,650 electric vehicles, above estimates of around 88,000. Model 3 and Y deliveries were 80,050, while Model S and X deliveries were 10,600. Overall production from the Fremont and Shanghai plants was 82,272.</p><p>In news that broke late Wednesday, another \"leaked\" Musk email praised staff, \"Just amazing how well you executed, especially in such difficult times.\" Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his TSLA price target to 1,250 from 1,000, and his bull case target to 2,000 from 1,500.</p><p>Tesla stock rallied 3.7% to 1,119.63 on Wednesday. That extended Tuesday's 7% surge, clearing a short shelf consolidation, as well as Monday's 5.2% pop. Optimism soared after a \"leaked\" email Tuesday afternoon from CEO Elon Musk to employees said Tesla was close to being break-even.</p><p>At this point, Tesla stock is well extended even from the short consolidation, especially with delivery news on tap. Investors are pricing in a lot of good news for Tesla stock, both short and long term.</p><p>Tesla stock does have a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/research/options/tesla-stock-option-trade-may-offer-74-percent-return-in-stock-market/\">potential options play</url> for investors who believe it'll hold above 1,000 over the next several weeks.</p><p>In addition to Tesla stock, Chinese rival Nio continued to surge after reporting its Q2 deliveries. EV delivery van startup Workhouse Group and Blink Charging, which have hot stocks in recent days, also are up sharply before the open. The exception is EV and hydrogen truck startup Nikola.</p><h>Tesla Earnings?</h><p>If Musk wants to report Tesla earnings for the second quarter, he likely can recognize sufficient emission credits and Full Self Driving revenue to make that happen. Another quarter of Tesla earnings could spur TSLA stock's entry into the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>Also late Wednesday, the NHTSA confirmed to the Los Angeles Times that the safety regulator is probing a possible design flaw in older Model S battery packs. Last week Business Insider said Tesla knew of the flaw that made them at higher risk of fires, but choose not to fix it.</p><h>Tesla Deliveries, Production Outlook</h><p>Looking ahead to third quarter, Tesla production should be at high voltage. Demand is more of an unknown.</p><p>It's unclear how much backlog remains in the U.S. for the Model Y, though price cuts and a lower-priced variant could keep demand going.</p><p>Europe potentially could see a boost in Tesla sales, fueled by new subsidies and perhaps limited supply in Q2. However, EV competition is growing in Europe, with the cheaper VW ID.3 finally set to launch in September.</p><p>As for China, how much backlog will remain for the relatively new made-in-China Tesla Model 3 LR variant, especially with lower subsidies? Several EV and hybrid rivals are entering the field.</p><p>Tesla has now trimmed the China price of imported Model S and Model X vehicles by 1%, offsetting a July 1 price hike for \"FSD.\" In the U.S., Tesla hiked the cost of FSD by $1,000 on July 1 to $8,000.</p><h>Amazon Stock Hits High</h><p>Amazon stock rose 4.35% on Wednesday, hitting a record high. AMZN stock is acting well but doesn't have an actionable buy point.</p><h>Netflix Stock A Buy</h><p>Netflix stock advanced 6.7% to 485.64, also setting a new peak. The internet TV streaming giant rose to the top of a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-surges-record-high-tops-must-keep-tv-list/\">Must Keep TV</url>\" list.</p><p>NFLX stock cleared a 459.07 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/\">buy point</url> on June 22. Shares soon pulled back before Monday's bullish rebound from its 50-day and 10-week moving averages. Actionable entry points include 459.07 but also 474.11, just above the June 23 all-time high.</p><h>Facebook Stock, Google Stock Extend Rebounds</h><p>Facebook stock rose 4.6% to 237.55 and Google stock 1.7% to 1,442, both continuing to rebound strongly from sharp sell-offs. Both are potentially actionable, after Facebook stock and Google stock suffered serious damage last week.</p><p>On Friday, FB stock plunged 8.3% to 216.08 as a Facebook ad boycott grew. That was below its 50-day line and slightly above its original 215.38 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-buy-stocks-cup-with-handle-base-alibaba-stock-buy-point/\">cup-with-handle</url> buy point. Monday morning, Facebook stock tumbled to 207.11 intraday. At this point, anyone who bought at an alternative 224.30 entry should have been long gone, while even those who bought near 215.38 probably should have exited. However, FB stock rallied to close higher on Monday, then kept rising.</p><p>For investors who hung on to Facebook stock, they can keep holding. Anyone looking to enter or reenter FB stock may want to wait for a move above the 245.19 high. Even better, shares will consolidate for a time before making a new move.</p><p>Google stock dived 5.45% on Friday to 1,362.54, below its 50-day line and its 1,145.63 cup-with-handle buy point, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith\">MarketSmith analysis</url>. GOOGL stock reclaimed its 50-day line and its original entry point on Tuesday.</p><p>Google stock never triggered the 7%-8% down automatic sell rule, though investors understandably might have exited the position. GOOGL stock may be forming a new handle with a 1,475.89 entry.</p><h>Teladoc Stock</h><p>Teladoc stock rose 4.2% to 198.85. Shares hit 201.33 intraday, just clearing a very short trend line. That could provide an early entry for TDOC stock. Investors also could use 208.73 as a high-handle buy point from a recent consolidation.</p><h>Okta Stock</h><p>Okta stock jumped 5.3% to 210.92, a new high. The cybersecurity leader cleared a short consolidation, though it's too short for a proper base. But aggressive traders might use 205.81 or 206.19 as an entry point.</p><h>Coronavirus Stock Market Rally Won't Stop</h><p>After last week's sell-off, the expectation was that the coronavirus stock market rally would take a breather, perhaps with a deeper pullback or sideways action over several weeks. That would be normal and healthy, and perhaps overdue. The market rally's ascent has been too fast, too furious to be sustainable long term.</p><p>But the stock market rally is going to do what it's going to do. The Nasdaq is at record highs with growth stocks powering ahead. Facebook stock and Google stock looked seriously damaged Monday morning, but now look a lot better. Netflix stock, Okta stock and Teladoc are in or flirting with buy areas, while Tesla stock has taken off like a SpaceX rocket.</p><p>Don't try to guess what the stock market trend will be; pay attention to what the market is doing right now. Right now, it's a good time to be invested in growth stocks. But stay engaged and ready to act.</p><p>Read\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/category/market-trend/the-big-picture/\">The Big Picture</url>\u00a0every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.</p><p>Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/IBD_ECarson\">@IBD_ECarson</url>\u00a0for stock market updates and more.</p><p>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-futures-coronavirus-stock-market-rally-teladoc-tesla-stock/\">Four New Breakouts; What's Next For Tesla?</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/\">Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/research/coronavirus-stock-market-crash-survival-guide/\">Coronavirus Stock Market Survival Guide</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/best-growth-stocks-buy-watch-ibd-stock-lists/\">Best Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/product/ibd-digital/?artProdLink=IBD_Digital\">IBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-5987894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6088-PXK1-DYTD-9254-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2055\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

The current stock market correction intensified Monday as FANG stocks Facebook, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon.com plunged on antitrust fears, while Apple stock\u00a0reversed lower. More worrisome was the action of the market-leading software sector. From\u00a0Microsoft to ServiceNow, top software stocks were big losers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's nearly impossible for the  to advance when the four biggest stocks by market value\u00a0\u2014 Microsoft stock, Amazon stock, Apple and Google stock, along with No. 6 Facebook stock \u2014 are selling off fiercely.</p><p>Meanwhile,\u00a0Coupa Software recouped much of Monday's 6.2% overnight after . Business software giant Salesforce.com plunged 4.2% Monday ahead of its Tuesday night earnings.</p><h>Dow Jones Futures Today</h><p>Dow Jones futures rose 0.55% vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.5%.</p><p>One reason for the rally in stock futures? There's rumbling in Congress that it may oppose the Trump tariffs on Mexico. Many lawmakers say Trump must declare another national emergency to do impose tariffs on Mexico. That would Congress a chance to try block them, with many Senate GOP members opposed to the Mexico tariffs. Administration officials say he already has the statutory authority.</p><p>Australia's central bank cut rates to record low on Tuesday and signaled it could do more. Investors are betting on Fed rate cuts, though that sentiment didn't buoy stocks on Monday.</p><p>It's going to take a lot more than fractional gains in Dow futures to signal an end to the stock market correction.</p><p>Remember that overnight action in\u00a0 and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular  session. Dow Jones futures signaled modest, shrinking losses heading into Monday's stock market open. While the major averages briefly traded positive near the open, selling in tech giants and software leaders quickly took hold.</p><h>Current Stock Market Correction</h><p>The major averages tumbled last month on the escalating China trade war, President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Mexico, and the potential fallout on the global economy. Big Tech antitrust fears gave the current stock market correction yet another reason to head lower.</p><p>The Nasdaq composite lost 1.6% to its worst levels since February, dragged down by Alphabet stock, Facebook stock and Amazon stock. The S&amp;P 500 index fell 0.3%. The Dow Jones eked out a tiny gain, even with Apple stock and Microsoft stock falling.</p><p>That's despite St. Louis Fed President James Bullard signaling support for a Fed rate cut, following similar dovish comments from Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida last Thursday. A slew of Fed officials speak Tuesday, including Fed chief Jerome Powell.</p><p>Markets are , with two more by January.</p><p>While the prospect of Fed rate cuts are a positive, those would only occur if the stock market correction continues and economic data worsens, presumably amid an escalating China trade war and Mexican tariffs.</p><h>Big Tech Wreck</h><p>The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have divided up some Big Tech companies for antitrust review. will launch an antitrust probe of Google and will have oversight over Apple. The FTC likely will probe Facebook and will take the lead on Amazon antitrust issues.</p><p>Facebook stock plunged 7.5%, Google stock dropped 6.1%, and Amazon stock fell 4.6%. Facebook tested its 200-day line while Amazon stock undercut that key support. The  for Google stock fell to its lowest since 2017.</p><p>Apple stock, which had been modestly higher until the DOJ antitrust probe news, retreated 1%.</p><p>Facebook edged lower early Tuesday, while Google, Amazon and Apple were up, less than Nasdaq futures.</p><p>Investors can no longer ignore the mounting regulatory and political risk for Big Tech. At best, they face years of stricter oversight. At worst, they face serious challenges to their business models.</p><h>Software Stocks Plunge</h><p>The software sector has been the top-performing market sector in 2019. The sector came under some pressure last month, but held up reasonably well during the stock market correction. Growth stocks usually fall more than the broader market in pullbacks, so software's performance was especially notable.</p><p>But on Monday, software stocks were big losers, with top-rated names leading the selling. Microsoft stock fell 3.1% after just closing above its 50-day line on Friday. ServiceNow stock fell 5.2%, Twilio lost 5.6%, and MongoDB shed 7%, all knifing below their 50-day lines. Adobe, which ended last week just below its 50-day, fell 4.4%.</p><p>The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF fell 3.3%, hitting its lowest level since Feb. 8 and approaching its 200-day line.</p><p>Microsoft stock and several other software leaders were trading near record levels with RS lines at all-time highs. Monday's stock market action shows that some individual names, groups or sectors can look strong until they suddenly don't.</p><p>While the current stock market correction may not end up as painful as the late-2018 bear market, selling is fierce and there are few places to hide.\u00a0Bottom line: Investors should not be making new buys and should be largely, if not entirely, in cash.</p><p>Among other , the Innovator IBD 50 ETF slid 1.8%, even with Kirkland Lake Gold breaking out. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF dipped 0.1% after a brutal May.</p><p>Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at \u00a0for stock market updates and more.</p><p>YOU ALSO MIGHT LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-4622903</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W88-6GK1-DYTD-9000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures also were lower. The stock market rally powered ahead Wednesday, with the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 index setting all-time highs and the Nasdaq composite nearly there. Apple stock is approaching a buy point. So are FANG internet giants Facebook stock, Amazon stock, Netflix stock, while Google stock is trying to bounce back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iif and when Apple and FANG stocks such as Facebook, Amazon.com and Netflix break out, which will be stock market rally winners? Sure these stocks, along with Google parent Alphabet, have had enormous runs, but investors should focus on the best stocks today, not past legends. Using the  is a good way to determine whether these tech titans, or any other stock, is a leader, laggard, or just tagging along.</p><h>Dow Jones Futures Today</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow Jones futures fell\u00a0 0.1% vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.15%. Nasdaq 100 futures retreated 0.15%.\u00a0Remember that overnight action in\u00a0 and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular  session.</p><p>Dow Jones futures traded normally on the Fourth of July even as U.S. stock markets were closed. Asian markets were mixed Friday for a second straight session. European markets were slightly lower.</p><h>Jobs Report Key For Rate Cuts</h><p>Meanwhile,\u00a0\u00a0due out at 8:30 a.m. ET will go a long way toward figuring out if a July 31 Fed rate cut will be a quarter point or 50 basis points.</p><p>Wall Street estimates the U.S. added 165,000 jobs, with the jobless rate holding at 3.6% and hourly wages picking up to a 3.2% gain.</p><p>Markets expect a Fed rate cut on July 31, with a 30% chance that it'll be 50 basis points. There's a 75% chance that policymakers will cut Fed rates by a total of 50 basis points by the September meeting.</p><p>Next week's testimony by Fed chief Jerome Powell and minutes from the June policy meeting also will be key</p><h>Current Stock Market Rally</h><p>The current stock market rally powered to all-time highs for the S&amp;P 500 index and Dow Jones on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite is less than 0.1% below record highs.</p><p>Nasdaq 100 futures, which include Apple stock and all the FANG stocks, suggest that the Nasdaq composite will set an all-time best on Friday.</p><p>Among the\u00a0, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF climbed 0.8% on Wednesday, hitting its best close since Oct. 8. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF rallied 1.1%, hitting a record high. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF dipped 0.4%.</p><h>Facebook Stock</h><p>Facebook stock rose 1.1% Wednesday to 197.20. That's just below a 198.58 buy point from a long, deep  base. The cup depth of 44% is worrisome. However, the handle itself is long enough to be its own base. By that measure, Facebook stock does not have an unhealthy drop.</p><p>The relative strength line for Facebook stock has trended higher since late November. It's just below its handle high, a bullish sign. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, reflects a stock's performance vs. the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>Facebook earnings are expected to fall 7% in 2019. But analysts see EPS growth rebounding to a robust 32% in 2020.</p><p>One worry for Facebook and Google, and to a lesser extent Apple and Amazon, is the growing push by regulators and politicians to crack down on Big Tech. While Facebook stock and Google stock plunged on antitrust probe fears on June 3, helping to set the recent stock market low, investors haven't been too concerned so far about threats to Big Tech business models.</p><h>Amazon Stock</h><p>Amazon stock edged up 0.2% to 1,939 on Wednesday. That's just below a 1,964.50 cup-with-handle entry. As with Facebook stock, Amazon's handle is long enough to be its own base.</p><p>The RS line for Amazon stock is not far from the handle high, though it hasn't really made much progress in recent weeks.</p><p>Amazon earnings are expected to grow 36% in 2019 and 40% in 2020, a rapid pace for a such a large company. Credit Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing arm. But core e-commerce sales growth has been struggling, with overall sales growth decelerating for the past four quarters.</p><h>Netflix Stock</h><p>Netflix stock popped 1.7% to 381.72 on Wednesday. Shares are close to a 386.09 buy point. The RS line has moved higher in the past few weeks, but it's been trending slightly lower since mid-January.</p><p>Part of that may reflect concern about competition from the upcoming Disney+ streaming service. Walt Disney has soared since unveiling its streaming plans in early April. On Wednesday, Disney stock reclaimed a buy point.</p><p>Still, analysts expect adjusted Netflix earnings to rise 28% in 2019 and 72% in 2020.</p><h>Apple Stock</h><p>Apple stock advanced 0.8% to 204.41.  is working toward a 215.41 cup-with-handle buy point, but a little further away than Facebook or Amazon stock. Like those two FANGs, Apple's handle is long enough to be its own base.</p><p>The RS line has improved somewhat in the past few weeks, but is still some distance from handle highs.</p><p>Apple earnings are expected to fall 4% in the current fiscal year and then rebound, somewhat, to 10% growth in fiscal 2020. Meanwhile, Apple stock and earnings are exposed to the China trade war. If trade talks fall apart, Apple could be a notable loser.</p><h>Google Stock</h><p>Google stock is the clear laggard in this group. Shares rose 0.9% to 1,122.99 on Wednesday. That's just below the 200-day line with the 50-day line the next hurdle.</p><p>While technically in a consolidation, Google stock is still off a potential buy point of 1,297.07. Ironically, Google stock is the only one of these five tech titans that actually hit a record high in 2019, doing so on April 29. But a weak Google earnings report sent shares plunging the next day and beyond.</p><p>The RS line is just above June's two-year low. More broadly, Google stock hasn't really outperformed the market for the past three years.</p><p>Google earnings are expected to rise just 1% in 2019 but rebound 18% in 2020.</p><h>Stock Market Rally Outlook</h><p>On a technical basis, investors want to see the stock market rally convincingly clear old highs. But it's still a news-driven market rally.</p><p>Renewed China trade talks and expectations of multiple Fed rate cuts have recharged the stock market rally from a June 3 low. It's still unclear if China trade talks will lead to a comprehensive deal. If not, then the China trade war could escalate again in a few months.</p><p>Please follow Ed Carson on Twitter at \u00a0for stock market updates and more.</p><p>YOU ALSO MIGHT LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-4721540</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGN-B0H1-JCBB-K3J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1079\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100,CAC 40, DAX 30 Fundamental ForecastsFriday saw the major equity markets undergo a vicious sell-off as investors fled risk assets amid a deteriorating US-China trade relationship. While many expected Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to strike a dovish tone during his Jackson Hole speech,which he arguably did , President Trump was quick to express his distaste for the pace of expected cuts. </p><p>Interested in longer-term trades? Check out our Q3 Forecasts for equities, Gold, oil and more. Shortly thereafter, President Trump announced that the 25% tariff tranche facing China will be increased to 30% on October 1 and the 10% tax scheduled for September 1 will jump to 15% in response to China's retaliatory tariffs totaling $75 billion on US goods that they issued early Friday morning. Together, the fast-paced hikes confirm the economic conflict is more than a mere skirmish. Since President Trump's tariff hike was released to markets after the close, the resultant price action will unfold on Monday. With such a steep escalation, expect risk aversion to grip markets. Meanwhile, uncertainty could ignite further during the G-7 Summit over the weekend. Dow Jones ForecastOutlook: BearishThat said, theDJIAwill have to negotiate the fallout from the US-China trade war flare-up. Given the lack ofscheduled speechesby Fed members, the Industrial Average - and theS P 500- will have to cope with the underlying issues facing the market without the tailwind of persistent dovish commentary. Further, futures suggest investors are nearly certain a 25-basis point cut is coming at the SeptemberFOMCmeeting. Regardless, the Dow Jones may look to threaten key technical supportthat I outlined on Friday. Dow Jones Price Chart: Daily Time Frame (February 2018 - August 2019) (Chart 1) Nasdaq 100 ForecastOutlook: BearishThe Nasdaq will have to cope with similar themes, while also enduring elevated uncertainty over the weekend from the G-7 Summit where French President Macron is expected to meet with President Trump. President Macron has recently discussed a possible tax on US-tech companies which, if pursued, would likely spur retaliation from the Trump administration. Nasdaq 100 Price Chart: Daily Time Frame (March - August) (Chart 2) Coupled with the looming threat of domestic regulation, the big-tech companies that are responsible for large swathes of growth in the current bull market face uncertain times. Consequently, the Nasdaq finds itself in a very precarious position moving forward. CAC 40 ForecastOutlook: NeutralLike the Nasdaq, the CAC 40 will look closely to discussions between the various French and US officials. According to Bloomberg, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire on the sidelines of the G-7 Summit. Should the officials fail to agree on terms to avoid the new taxes, retaliation should be expected - a potentially devastating development for the CAC 40. Since trade spats have become more common between the United States and France - along with the entirety of the European Union - a potential option for retaliatory tariffs is automobiles. CAC 40 Price Chart: Daily Time Frame (December 2018 - August 2019) (Chart 3) DAX 30 ForecastOutlook: Neutral With that in mind, we turn our attention to the German DAX, which would have the most to lose if the Trump administration decided to impose widespread auto tariffs instead of targeting France specifically. At present, there is nothing to suggest auto tariffs will be the weapon of choice - if a weapon is needed at all. Regardless, the Administration has until November 14 to decide whether to impose the auto levies, which leaves the option on the table. DAX 30 Price Chart: 4 - Hour Time Frame (May - August) (Chart 4) Apart from the fluid fundamental themes over the weekend, next week ispacked with important economic dataranging from German unemployment numbers to US GDP to Chinese manufacturing data. While officials trudge through trade negotiations and monetary policy discussions, markets will look to the hard data for influence - between the various Tweets and talks that will inevitably unfold in the week ahead.

A new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives could also change the regulatory equation in 2019.<br/><br/>'As corporate leaders, we have a responsibility to employees, customers, and society,' Twilio's (ticker: TWLO) Lawson said from the cloud-communications platform company's San Francisco headquarters this month. 'We're a company that determines who we do business with. If the Klan, for instance, tried to use our service to plan an event, we wouldn't allow it.'<br/><br/>Social-media companies spent most of 2018 trying to find a balance between free speech, safety, and running a sticky platform.<br/><br/>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg initially defended users' right to deny the Holocaust before backtracking. And Apple (AAPL), Spotify Technology (SPOT), Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), and Alphabet 's (GOOGL) YouTube all struggled with how to respond to hate-mongering from Alex Jones and his InfoWars site. Most of these platforms eventually banned Jones, though Twitter decided to hold out for a while, putting the company in the unusual position of defending hate speech. Twilio notes that Jones was never a customer.<br/><br/>Lawson reset Twilio's policy on hate speech after the violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. Twilio does not allow any group whose mission or purpose is 'hateful' on its platform, regardless of their activity.<br/><br/>One could argue that Twilio's direct approach helped propel the stock 270% in 2018, even as the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.4%. Twilio's cloud platform is used by companies like Nordstrom (JWN) and U-Haul parent Amerco (UHAL) to engage digitally with costumers.<br/><br/>Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block used the word 'trust' 18 times in a recent 45-minute interview. 'In our business model, everything starts with trust,' Block said. Salesforce.com (CRM) shares are up 32% in 2018.<br/><br/>If there's a deficit of trust these days, Big Tech has itself to blame. Well before the market's late-year selloff, shares of Facebook and Twitter were pummeled for their roles in the 2016 presidential election, the spread of 'fake news,' and their perceived anticonservative bias. Google has also faced questions about its perceived anticonservative bias.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, Barron's argued that a new divide had emerged in tech, with ad-driven giants like Facebook and Google on one side and direct-to-consumer sales models like Apple and Netflix on the other. The ad-dependent, and thus data-driven, names were the ones struggling the most with trust.<br/><br/>Several of Silicon Valley's most-successful chief executives, led by Apple CEO Tim Cook, were critical of how Facebook and Google share consumer data in an almost Faustian bargain with business partners and advertisers. Facebook shares, which peaked at $ 218.62 in late July, closed at $ 134.56 on Thursday-a drop of 38%. Twitter, which reached $ 47.79 in early July, closed at $ 28.68 on Thursday, down 40%.<br/><br/>But even Apple has now been drawn into the privacy debate, in the case over its business dealings in China. And its stock has struggled mightily in the last quarter of the year.<br/><br/>Cook has insisted that Apple has not compromised user privacy in China, despite criticism that its decision to host Chinese users' iCloud accounts in a new data center within the country would give Chinese authorities easier access to text messages, email, and other data.<br/><br/>Investors, and Barron's, continue to debate the importance of trust when it comes to stock prices. In some cases, users have yet to show much concern. Facebook's still massive user base is one example-at last count, Facebook had 2.27 billion active monthly users.<br/><br/>But Silicon Valley executives have other worries, namely keeping talent. Employers are acutely aware that highly-skilled tech workers, already in great demand, have more leverage and feel unencumbered criticizing their bosses. Google employees took umbrage at the company's secret plan to build a censored search engine in China (Google has no plans to relaunch the search engine, CEO Sundar Pichai told a congressional panel on Tuesday, amid increased scrutiny of big tech firms). And Facebook lost the co-founders of Instagram and WhatsApp, which Facebook shelled out some $ 20 billion to buy, earlier this year. They were unhappy with Facebook's direction and left money on the table to make their point.<br/><br/>EDITORS' CHOICE<br/><br/>Working More Magic at Disney<br/><br/>Investors Might Be Paying Too Much for These Index Funds<br/><br/>Vanguard Founder Jack Bogle Says It's Time to Play It Safe<br/><br/>'We're in an era of the empowered tech employee,' Brian Halligan, CEO and co-founder of HubSpot, an inbound marketing and sales software company, said over coffee in San Francisco's financial district recently. 'They expect more from their employers than financial compensation and the products they create. They want a place of good standing in society.'<br/><br/>Mindful of what can happen to a high-profile public company that loses the trust of the public and its workforce, a batch of initial public-offering candidates have adopted greater due diligence, says David Larcker, director of the Corporate Governance Research Initiative at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.<br/><br/>If there's hope for change in 2019, it could come from those new public companies that have the chance to reset the notion of a 21st century tech company. Uber, Lyft, and Slack Technologies are reportedly finishing up their IPO paperwork. Their executives, lawyers, and investors would do well to put trust at their very top of their priority list.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V37-M0V1-JD3Y-Y2X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 31, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 index joined the Nasdaq composite below that key support.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow Jones stock Apple\u00a0fell below its buy point as breakouts struggle. FANG giant Facebook tested support amid Facebook Libra woes. TD Ameritrade joined Charles Schwab in eliminating stock and ETF trading fees. TD Ameritrade stock kept falling, along with other online brokers. Homebuilder Lennar popped on a surprise earnings gain.</p><p>The stock market rally has come under heavy pressure as Tuesday's grim U.S. manufacturing report, along with weak reports around the world, heighten recession risks. On top of that, investors must deal with\u00a0uncertainty from China trade talks, an impeachment inquiry confronting President Donald Trump, increasingly violent Hong Kong unrest, and no-deal Brexit risks.</p><h>Dow Jones Today</h><p>In morning trade, the Dow Jones fell 1.25%. The S&amp;P 500 retreated 1.3%. The Nasdaq composite sank 1.4%, moving closer to its 200-day moving average than its 50-day.</p><p>Asian markets fell Wednesday, with China's Shanghai Composite still closed for several more days. European markets sold off hard.</p><p>The ADP Employment report showed private hiring slowed to 135,000 in September, in the range of various estimates. August hiring was revised down by 38,000 to 157,000. The official jobs report is due Friday morning.</p><p>Remember that overnight action in\u00a0 and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular  session. Tuesday's Dow Jones futures foreshadowed a positive open, but didn't provide any insight into the day's sharp reversal lower.</p><h>Apple Stock Struggles To Hold On</h><p>Apple stock fell 1.5% to 221.18, just below its 221.47  buy point. The iPhone maker reclaimed that entry on Monday. On Tuesday, Apple stock hit a 2019 high intraday and came close to its all-time high of 233.47 set on Oct. 3, 2018. Shares eventually eked out a gain, closing up 0.3% to 224.59, providing some support for the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq. The  for Apple stock hit an 11-month high.</p><p>But with bears mauling the stock market rally, other breakouts have faltered. Can Apple stock hold on? Remember that Apple stock looked strong at the start of the late 2018 stock market correction, until suddenly it didn't.</p><h>TD Ameritrade Joins No-Fee Stock Trading</h><p>TD Ameritrade stock sank 1.1% in volatile morning trade after tumbling 26% to a three-year low on Tuesday. Late Tuesday, bowing to the inevitable,  as of Oct. 3, down from $6.95 now. Options trades will no longer have the $6.95 fee but will still pay 65 cents per contract.</p><p>Ameritrade stock plunged Tuesday after Charles Schwab moved to zero-fee stock trading. That came a few days after Interactive Brokers announced a zero-fee IBKR Lite service, while its existing low-fee service would be renamed IBKR Pro.</p><p>Charles Schwab stock fell 2% early Wednesday after tumbling almost 10% on Tuesday.\u00a0E-Trade Financial, which for now still has $6.95 stock and ETF trades, fell 1.6% after selling off 16% Tuesday.\u00a0Interactive Brokers stock also extended losses.</p><p>TD Ameritrade stock and other online broker stocks have struggled the past few years as lower stock trading fees took their toll on profits.</p><p>The zero-fee Robinhood app has attracted many younger investors in recent years. With Schwab, Ameritrade and other established players adopting zero-fee stock trading, that could hit Robinhood growth and its hoped-for IPO.</p><h>Lennar Earnings Surprise</h><p>Homebuilder  before the open, with per-share earnings up 14% and revenue up 3%, both beating analyst estimates. Lennar stock rose 1.5%. Lennar stock already was slightly extended from a buy point.</p><p>Homebuilders like Lennar are benefiting from low mortgage rates and a generally strong U.S. consumer, still insulated from global economic woes.</p><h>Facebook Stock, Facebook Libra Falter</h><p>In morning action, Facebook stock fell 0.5%, dipping below its 200-day. Facebook stock closed Tuesday just above its 200-day line, an area of support on multiple occasions since late January.</p><p>Payment companies that were founding members of the Facebook Libra Association are having second thoughts, according to multiple reports, raising doubts about the stability of the proposed stablecoin.\u00a0Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe are worried about angering U.S. and European regulators and politicians that have expressed skepticism or opposition regarding Facebook Libra.</p><p>More broadly, Facebook faces threats from regulators and politicians to rein in or break up the social giant. On Tuesday, leaked audio revealed Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg vowing to fight Big Tech breakup proposals, including from rising Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.</p><h>Current Stock Market Rally</h><p>The \u00a0is still not that far from all-time highs. But the stock market rally is showing severe stress in recent days. The Nasdaq composite actually moved back above its 50-day line Tuesday morning, only to come tumbling back after the ISM manufacturing index. For the S&amp;P 500 index to undercut that key support level on the same day was telling.</p><p>This could be the last stand for the stock market rally.

KEY FACTS The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6%, over 150 points, on Wednesda...</p><p>TOPLINE  The market finished higher on Wednesday as investors cheered the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to keep interest rates near zero and shares of Big Tech stocks rallied.        KEY FACTS     The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6%, over 150 points, on Wednesday, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4%.      The Federal Reserve, which concluded its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, kept interest rates unchanged at near zero to continue to support the economy through the coronavirus pandemic.      The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet testified before the House Antitrust Subcommittee, which gave investors some insight into how Big Tech companies are handling challenges from regulators.        Shares of all four companies rose following the hearings, but while they\u2019re among the best-performing stocks so far this year, there are rising concerns on Wall Street that heavy market concentration in a small handful of Big Tech names could pose downside risks.      The busiest week of the second quarter earnings season continued, with shares of General Electric, Advanced Micro Devices, General Motors and Shopify all rising after the companies reported better-than-expected results.      Boeing and Starbucks, meanwhile, posted wider-than-expected losses last quarter, but both stocks traded higher heading into the market open.     crucial quote   \u201cThe pace of the recovery may have slowed in recent months as virus cases have surged across the country and the Fed appears to be in no hurry to change the status quo,\u201d says Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. \u201cUltimately, the Fed does not intend to upset the applecart until some certainty and clarity can be instilled in the economic outlook as progress is made towards price stability and full employment.\u201d   Key background   Investors also continued to assess the latest coronavirus relief bill unveiled by Senate Republicans late on Monday, titled the Heath, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection and Schools (HEALS) Act. The GOP proposal for the next round of federal coronavirus aid includes a second round of $1,200 stimulus checks and more funds for small business loans in the Paycheck Protection Program. The bill would also eliminate the $600-per-week federal unemployment supplement, which states stopped paying out this week, to be replaced with a 70% wage-replacement program.    Tangent   The Federal Reserve wrapped up its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, saying that U.S. economic activity and employment \u201chave picked up somewhat in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year.\u201d The last time Fed officials met in June, they decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0% to 0.25%. On Tuesday, the central bank announced that it would extend loan programs through the end of 2020 as it continues to support the U.S. economy amid the pandemic.

KEY FACTS The Dow Jones Ind...</p><p>TOPLINE  The stock market finished higher on Monday, as coronavirus stimulus talks remained deadlocked and President Trump signed several executive orders over the weekend to extend economic relief to Americans amid the pandemic.        KEY FACTS     The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3%, over 350 points, on Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4%.      Boeing and Nike were among the best-performers in the Dow, while transportation stocks also surged. Shares of Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Netflix and Facebook led the market\u2019s declines, dragging the Nasdaq lower.       Shares of airlines soared after federal data showed air travel returning to its highest level in nearly five months: American, Delta and United Airlines all jumped by between 7% and 10%.      After coronavirus stimulus talks between Democrats, Republicans and the White House ended in a stalemate last week, President Trump on Saturday signed several executive orders to extend economic relief programs.      The orders would expand federal unemployment benefits\u2014at a reduced rate of $400 per week, defer student loan payments through 2020, extend a federal moratorium on evictions and provide a payroll tax holiday.      Trump\u2019s executive action was met with criticism from both parties and is likely to face legal challenges, since continuing the programs would require federal funding from Congress.      Meanwhile, Twitter became the latest company to show interest in buying Chinese-owned social media app TikTok, although Microsoft is still seen as the most likely candidate to close a deal.       Shares of Eastman Kodak, on the other hand, plunged by up to 43% on Monday amid news that the company\u2019s $765 million federal loan will be put on hold as regulators look into allegations of wrongdoing.     What to watch for   Market sentiment also took a hit from ongoing U.S.-China tensions, which have continued to deteriorate in recent weeks over a range of issues including Hong Kong, technology companies and the coronavirus pandemic. Following a fresh round of U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials\u2014including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam\u2014last week, China on Monday imposed sanctions on 11 U.S. citizens, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.).   Crucial quote   \u201cTrump\u2019s executive orders dominated the weekend news, but these should be considered a political gesture aimed at creating the illusion of action for November rather than a genuine attempt to bolster the economy,\u201d says Vital Knowledge founder Adam Crisafulli. \u201cIt still seems that a negotiated deal on formal fiscal legislation remains more likely than not, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the two sides resume negotiations in the coming days.\u201d   Key background   Stocks posted strong gains last week to kick off the month of August, with the Dow climbing 3.8%, its biggest weekly gain since June. The S&amp;P moved 2.5% higher, now sitting just over 1% below its record high set back in February. The market\u2019s gains were also in large part boosted by continued strength in Big Tech stocks: Shares of Facebook, Apple and Microsoft rallied more than 3% last week.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAN HOPKINS, GUEST HOST: Tonight: Andersen fights for its survival.  The company continues to hemorrhage clients.  Its overseas units are defecting, and the company still faces criminal charges. Several Andersen employees join us with their thoughts on the future of Andersen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Being down doesn't mean being out.  Iridium planned a universal phone system which failed, and so did the company.  But now Iridium is back from the brink.  We'll tell you what turned it around.</p><p>And for the first time in four decades, the Academy Awards are back in Hollywood.  We'll tell you how the city is pinning its rebirth hopes on the Oscars.  And \"Variety\" editor Peter Bart looks at this weekend's possible winners.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE for Friday, March 22. Sitting in for Lou Dobbs, Jan Hopkins.</p><p>HOPKINS: Good evening.  An emergency rescue package is in the works tonight for Andersen. Former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, hired to overhaul the firm, has outlined a series of steps to save the company.  But time is quickly running out. Andersen's world-wide empire is crumbling.  More overseas partners today defected and more clients deserted the firm.  Andersen's new Zealand affiliate is the latest to break ranks.  It's joining forces with a rival.  And in an ironic twist today, Waste Management, which was embroiled in its own Andersen-related accounting scandal two years ago, fired the firm.</p><p>Allan Chernoff has the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Volcker's plan is to sweep out Andersen's U.S. management and put his oversight board in power to change the firm.</p><p>PAUL VOLCKER, FORMER CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: We feel strongly enough so that we're willing to take control of the firm if some very serious conditions are met.  It will certainly involve changes in leadership, may involve some new management.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Volcker is hoping his prestige can save Andersen, but his proposal is contingent on conditions that may be impossible to meet: a capping of Andersen's liability in class action lawsuits, a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, dismissal or suspension of the Justice Department suit, and support of most Andersen partners.  Anderson partner James Patterson says he's keeping an open mind.</p><p>JAMES PATTERSON, NATIONAL PARTNER, ANDERSEN: Well, as our chairman indicated at the outset of this process, the firm would be supportive of recommendations from the Volcker commission.  And I look forward to the leadership of our firm Studying those recommendations.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Volcker and Andersen are fighting the clock. Defections from Andersen are accelerating.  On Friday alone, the firm lost clients Hartford Financial Services, Occidental Petroleum, Apache Corporation, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, ChoicePoint, as well as Waste Management, the firm whose cooked books Andersen had approved several years ago.</p><p>And the list of Andersen partnership defections is growing, New Zealand partners saying they'll join with Ernst &amp; Young, following similar defections in Russia, Hong Kong and China.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>At the beginning of the week, Andersen world-wide said its non- U.S. partners were planning to join with KPMG.  But as the company's problems mount here in the U.S., the attitude at Andersen offices around the globe appears to be \"Every man for himself.\"</p><p>Minutes ago, Andersen released a statement in response to Volcker plan.  Quote, \"This is a positive and constructive proposal that works to resolve the difficult issues with the SEC, the Department of Justice and other claimants\" -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Is there time for it to work?</p><p>CHERNOFF: It's really going to be right now up to the Department of Justice and the SEC.  Can they work out a deal?  Andersen is hoping that Volcker can pressure the DoJ enough that they'll back off.  It's a long shot.</p><p>HOPKINS: Very interesting.  In terms of these overseas partners that are decided that they're going to go with other firms, how easy is it for them to do that?</p><p>CHERNOFF: Not at all because there are requirements that the partnerships around the globe put in money every year.  And if they want to break away, they're supposed to pay one-and-one-half times their annual revenue just to break away.</p><p>HOPKINS: Wow.  Thanks, Allan Chernoff.</p><p>Andersen employees today staged another rally to protest the government's decision to indict the entire firm for shredding Enron- related documents.  The rally took place in Chicago.  They were joined by friends and family, just some of the many thousands of Andersen employees who say they had nothing to do with the Enron account.</p><p>Three Andersen employees join us tonight.  From San Francisco, Bill Parsons.  He's a business consulting partner who's been with Andersen for the past 10 years.  Also from Chicago, Michelle Ivy. She's an executive assistant at Andersen who has been with the company for two years.  She spoke at today's rally.  And Susan Bell, an audit partner in Atlanta, who has been with Andersen for nearly 18 years.</p><p>Welcome to all of you.  Let me start first in Chicago with Michelle.  You spoke at rally today in part because you wrote a letter to President Bush.  What did you say?</p><p>MICHELLE IVY, ANDERSEN: In the letter?</p><p>HOPKINS: And at rally.</p><p>IVY: Oh.  Well, at the rally today, basically, I just explained how I felt, how it was affecting me personally. And I just basically said I had no knowledge of Enron before this whole ordeal began.  I didn't even know who they were.  But I wanted to let them know how I was being affected, how the kids that I tutor through the Stockton (ph) Reading Day program was affected also and the fact that it was really hard to tell a 3rd-grader that you can't go on a field trip with them any longer because the company might not be around, come that time.</p><p>HOPKINS: Let's go to San Francisco and Bill Parsons, a business partner with Andersen, a consulting partner.  You sold your own consulting business to Andersen a few years ago. So all of your company's equity is wrapped up in Andersen, right?</p><p>WILLIAM PARSONS, ANDERSEN: That would be correct.  About 10 years ago, I was the president of an independent consulting practice in Los Angeles.  And for a number of reasons, we decided to sell the firm.  And I had known a number of Andersen partners and a number of Andersen people in the marketplace and had always been impressed with them and decided that when it was time for us to move on that Andersen would be the ideal place for not only myself but our entire organization to be.  And yes, much of our proceeds were put into the organization.</p><p>HOPKINS: Did you have anything to do with Enron?</p><p>PARSONS: Absolutely not.  I've never been there.</p><p>HOPKINS: And yet now your whole livelihood is wrapped up in Andersen, and at risk, at this point.  That's what you're concerned about, I assume.</p><p>PARSONS: No, actually, I'm very upset about it.  You know, we all -- in the San Francisco office, all 1,100 people whom I interact with are all very upset, very concerned about our future, about the stability of the organization and about our ability to meet all our obligations.  So yes, our future is somewhat uncertain.</p><p>HOPKINS: Let's go to Atlanta now and Susan Bell, an audit partner with Andersen.  What about the mood in your office in Atlanta? Was Enron a client at all?</p><p>SUSAN BELL, ANDERSEN: No.  Enron was never a client of Atlanta, and our people don't know anything about Enron.  The mood in the office\u2026</p><p>HOPKINS: Go he ahead.</p><p>BELL: I was just going say the mood in the office is really sad. It's -- people are very scared about what's happening to our firm and what's happening to each of them.</p><p>HOPKINS: What about the charges, though, about massive shredding of documents?  Doesn't that concern you?  Especially in a case that could end up being a criminal case? Susan, you first.</p><p>BELL: Well, absolutely, it concerns me.  When I first heard it, I was shocked and disappointed.  But I truly can't imagine that any of our people shredded documents on purpose.  Our people make mistakes sometimes.  Our people may make dumb moves.  But they are not bad people.  They're not criminals.  And they just possibly could not have shredded documents on purpose.</p><p>HOPKINS: And Michelle, what about in the Chicago office?  I mean, what's your response to this massive shredding of documents, which is really the basis of the government's case against Andersen?</p><p>IVY: Well, actually, when I heard about it, naturally, I was upset at the fact that I thought first, initially, that they shredded these documents for whatever reason, from what I heard in the media. However, I come to learn that -- well, in my opinion, I don't think, as far as what the interaction I've had with Andersen employees, like she said, that they would have ever done anything on purpose.  I don't believe that they shredded documents, knowing that those documents would have been called or they would be involved somehow in a criminal case.  I don't think they would have been that stupid, personally.</p><p>HOPKINS: Bill Parsons, what about the Paul Volcker plan to save Andersen?  Do you think there's time for it to work?</p><p>PARSONS: Well, I think we're all very appreciative of Mr. Volcker for lending his credibility and prestige to the firm. Clearly, he's come up with some ideas that seem to make a lot of sense.  I think the biggest concern we all have is, is there enough time for our organization to survive in the marketplace, where every day and day out, our integrity, which has now been challenged, is all- important?</p><p>I mean, unfortunately, we seem to be guilty before we are proven innocent.  And in the professional services world, integrity is really all you have.  So if Paul -- if Mr. Volcker can restore that, we would -- we'll be very grateful.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thank you all for joining us.  Bill Parsons and Michelle Ivy and Susan Bell.  Thank you, all.</p><p>On Wall Street, stocks finished the session lower, pushing the markets lower for the week.  Investors today focused on the outlook for corporate profits, the Dow falling 52 points, the NASDAQ losing 17.  The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 5.</p><p>For the week as a whole, the Dow ended a five-week winning streak and it fell nearly 2 percent for the week.  The NASDAQ was down nearly 1 percent, and the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.5 percent.  Among the most widely held issues today, McDonald's fell more than 1, after it warned about its first quarter results. UAL was up after announcing that United Airlines would add more 2,000 employees to accommodate increased flight schedules.  Hewlett-Packard low after the head of its services unit said profits are below forecast.  Lucent Technologies fell after Moody's cut its rating for the company.</p><p>Looking at some other market movers, shares at Baker Hughes tumbled 2.5. The company slashed its earning estimates, citing a drop in North American drilling activity.  Schlumberger fell after a downgrade from SalomonSmith Barney.  Nike fell nearly 4.  That was despite a 30 percent jump in net income.  But Nike warned that orders grew at a slower pace than last year.</p><p>Shares of Palm gained 20 percent after returning to profitability after a year of losses.  And Travelers Property Casualty gained 1 on its first day of trading, the most actively traded stock on the big board.</p><p>My next guest expects trading to remain choppy, saying the recovery will be subtle.  For more on the markets, Todd Eberhard joins us now.</p><p>The recovery will be subtle, but the markets' response won't necessarily be subtle?</p><p>TODD EBERHARD, EBERHARD INVESTMENT ASSOC.: Well, the markets are not being subtle at all in either direction.  It depends on the day you pick.  But we have great swings on the up side and great swings on the down side, today -- put -- put today aside to some degree.</p><p>HOPKINS: So -- and that's what we need to get used to?  I mean, one day investors are optimistic that the recovery is here to stay, and the next day, investors are worried about company earnings.</p><p>EBERHARD: Exactly.  It's a tug-of-war, depending on the day. And what the news is really putting out early on in the day will direct the markets.  And if you have earnings that seem OK from one or two companies, the markets overall go higher.  If an Andersen story or Enron story come out and that's the focus, we have lower days.  And they just go back and forth.  It's a great trading market for people doing that.  It's not been a great market for investors for the long term yet.</p><p>HOPKINS: Well, what should investors for the long term be doing? Because one of the things that happened last week was the Federal Reserve met, and it's pretty clear that rates are going up in the future.  Not quite yet.  So how do you position yourself for this kind of environment?</p><p>EBERHARD: If you're a long-term investor, you have to really look at buying opportunities on those bad days, when the markets are down dramatically, and look for companies that you're interested in buying on the days when we see the pullbacks.  And that's what the markets have been doing. We've had terrible days, we're down 150, 200 points, and everybody buys it back up to close to even.  And that's a nice thing to see.  Maybe we're building a little bit of a base.  But because of the recession that we've gone into and theoretically starting to come out of was not so deep, we're not going to have such a great recovery that everybody would expect, like the '91-'92 term.</p><p>HOPKINS: So then the market's not going to go much higher?</p><p>EBERHARD: Well, it is, but it's going to -- in our opinion, it is.  But it's going to take time.  And really, it's got to be a building process.  It's not dramatic, 500, 600 points here and there every -- every step of the -- of weeks.  We'll have days we're up 100, days we're down 100.  And really buy those dips.  Look for the rises to -- to come through.  And just hold those stocks over the longer term, as the market builds upon itself.</p><p>HOPKINS: Now, what things should you be looking at?  The same things as the last time around? Technology?</p><p>EBERHARD: No.  We don't think so.  We think tech, at this point, is going to be the last one recovering generally from this market. We've talked about a few things, one you just touched on, which are the airlines.  We really believe in the airlines right now and have been buying them since the September 11th terrorist attack and really look at those as a recovery point.  And truly, you could spend hours discussing why, but a good story today is more jobs being brought back on line for more flights and more people traveling.  And\u2026</p><p>HOPKINS: So is it clear that people really are coming back? Because I was reading today that the business traveler is not coming back.</p><p>EBERHARD: Well, I think it's a little different city to city, and that's something we've looked at.  The Northeast corridor has come back dramatically.  But California has not so much because, again, the tech stocks who were out there have not recovered so much to spend money to travel.  But we're seeing numbers that most of the airlines are off, versus the same point last year, about 17 percent.  But their stocks are down 60 percent, on average.  So should it be off or the stocks be off that much?  We don't think so.</p><p>HOPKINS: And then what about hotel stocks and all of the other stocks that are associated with the travel industry?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EBERHARD: If you're buying that type of area -- and the question is really diversification.  If the airlines recover, in theory, so will the hotels, so will gaming stocks.  But I'm not sure you want to spread your money into every one of those industries because they are very interrelated.</p><p>HOPKINS: Now, we had big news this week on GE.  Bill Gross (ph)\u2026</p><p>EBERHARD: Yes.</p><p>HOPKINS: \u2026 from Pemco (ph) raised a lot of questions about GE. Do you think that investors should be careful about this company?</p><p>EBERHARD: I like GE.  We think it's a very strong company.  But again, with all the rumor mills going on about all companies out there and their -- certainly, in GE's case, the debt question, as well as financials in general, I think it's scaring everybody.  So everybody's taking a step back, and GE's just become the focus because, truly, they're the big guy on the block.</p><p>I think if you look at GE very closely -- and we certainly have in my firm, and we see a firm that is growing in the teens every year consistently, is a very diversified company -- it's one you do want to own.  But it's one that's going to get beat up on these rumors.  It will eventually rebound, and this may become, again, a buying opportunity for people to look at it.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Todd Eberhard.  We'll see you later on the program.</p><p>EBERHARD: Great.</p><p>HOPKINS: And coming up next on MONEYLINE: After the terrorist attack on the church in Pakistan, the State Department orders dozens of U.S. citizens to leave the country.  We'll have a report next.</p><p>Cease-fire talks go ahead in the Middle East, even though another suicide bomber blows himself up.  We'll have details in a moment.</p><p>And the remarkable recovery of a satellite telephone company that many had lost faith in.</p><p>All that and more after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: The United States is ordering all non-essential staff members and their families to leave the U.S. embassy and consulates in Pakistan.  That follows a deadly grenade attack on a church near the embassy last week.  For more on this, I'm joined by Andrea Koppel. She's at the State Department -- Andrea.</p><p>ANDREA KOPPEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Jan.</p><p>Immediately following last Sunday's cold-blooded grenade attack, which killed five people, including an American employee of the U.S. embassy and her teenage daughter, the U.S. embassy encouraged all of its diplomats to send their dependents, to send their family members home.  But all that changed today when that option became an order, this on the very same day that 11 suspects were charged with the recent kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl.</p><p>Nevertheless, State Department officials noted Secretary of State Powell called Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, today to explain the U.S. decision and to emphasize that this move was not due to a lack of U.S. confidence in Musharraf.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We really appreciate the efforts of President Musharraf and his government. We believe that the war against terrorism in Pakistan is far from over and that we will be able to carry it on with greater focus if our dependents are not present at U.S. facilities there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KOPPEL: Now, what U.S. officials say this evening, Jan, is that last Sunday's brutal attack, the grenade attack on that church in Islamabad, and the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl are two examples of what they say appears to be a pattern of now Islamic militants targeting American citizens overseas.  And for that reason, their warning tonight goes out not only to American embassy employees, but also to all American citizens who may be in Pakistan, who may be thinking about traveling there -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: And American businesses that do business in Pakistan, as well?</p><p>KOPPEL: Absolutely.  The warning goes out to everyone to be on alert if they live in Pakistan, to vary their travel routes, keep in touch with the embassy and just be on alert.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much. Andrea Koppel at the State Department.</p><p>Violence and talks to stop it took place almost simultaneously in the Middle East today.  Arab-Israeli cease-fire talks reconvened today after they were canceled yesterday following a suicide attack on an Israeli bus.  Shortly after today's meeting, Israel said a Palestinian blew himself up at a roadblock near the West Bank town of Jenin. One Israeli officer was slightly injured in that attack.</p><p>U.S. envoy Anthony Zinni met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat this morning.  Vice President Dick Cheney says he will return to the region to meet with Arafat if the Palestinian leader implements the Tenet cease-fire plan.</p><p>A major evacuation today at New York's La Guardia airport. Several aircraft were ordered back to a terminal and more than 1,000 passengers were evacuated following a security breach at the Delta Airlines terminal.  An airline spokesperson says a passenger on a stretcher passed through a security check point, but two medical workers were not screened.  Service returned to normal about 90 minutes later.</p><p>President Bush says that poor countries who govern fairly and encourage economic freedom will be eligible for more international assistance.  The president made those comments while addressing a United Nations-sponsored conference on poverty in Monterey, Mexico. Major Garrett is traveling with the president, and he joins us now from Monterey -- Major.</p><p>MAJOR GARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Jan.</p><p>The Bush administration says it came here to Monterey in part to change the entire debate around the world on developmental assistance. The Bush administration says for too long that entire debate has been about processes and inputs -- how much money you're putting into development instead of what that development aid is actually achieving.  The president said those days are over, at least as far as this White House is concerned.</p><p>The president is going to tie $10 billion of assistance that will be made available over the next three years, starting in the year 2004, to concrete reforms that developing nations carry out -- rooting out corruption, dealing with health and education and also opening their markets to free trade.  If those moves are not made, the president said, this bonus aid will not be forthcoming.  If they are, more aid will follow.</p><p>The president said it's important for developing countries to change themselves internally, so development dollars can make a big, big difference.  But he also said that where poverty exists, terrorism can also take root.  And while he don't equate the two, he said the war on poverty is also, at least in part, a war on the potential of terrorism setting in.  Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: History has called us to a titanic struggle whose stakes could not be higher because we're fighting for freedom itself.  We're pursuing great and worthy goals, to make the world safer, and as we do, to make it better.  We will challenge the poverty and hopelessness and lack of education and failed governments that too often allow conditions that terrorists can seize and try to turn to their advantage.  Our new approach for development places responsibility on developing nations and on all nations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARRETT: Jan, here are some of the hard numbers.  The United States provides about $10 billion annually in what is considered traditional development aid.  That will all continue.  This new $10 billion will start in the year 2004 and be an additional carrot, the administration says, to getting those developing nations to carry out the reforms I just described.</p><p>There was also another interesting development here, Jan.  Up until last night about midnight, U.S. and Canadian negotiators were trying to figure out a way to solve a long-running dispute between the United States and Canada over the imports of Canadian soft wood lumber.  Those talks did not prove successful, and today the United States Commerce Department announced that it would slap 29 percent duties on all Canadian soft wood lumber imports.</p><p>That was very good news to the besieged U.S. lumber industry, bad news to Canadian importers -- rather, Canadian exporters, and possibly bad news to U.S. consumers, who will see prices for things like wood to buy for decks and home improvements and flooring increase because those duties will increase the cost of Canadian soft wood lumber, which accounts for $6 billion of the U.S. market -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: I would think that there would be a lot of talk about tariffs on steel and now on lumber at these talks in Monterey.</p><p>GARRETT: It's sort of an underlying theme here, Jan.  You know, in the development world or the world of talking about development aid, throughout the '90s there was tremendous emphasis on free trade being sort of a dynamic force to lift developing countries out of poverty.  Well, the results have been spotty, to say the least.  And so here there has been an emphasis not only on trade but also on putting more development dollars on the table for developing nations.</p><p>And as the United States continues to move against steel imports from the European Union and now soft wood lumber imports from Canada, some are asking, well, how committed actually is the Bush administration to free trade?  I put that very question to a senior administration official, and he said, \"Look, the political environment in Congress is such that if we don't enforce existing free trade rules, we will never win from Congress free trade authority so the president can negotiate future free trade agreements.  We are a free- trading administration, but that doesn't mean we're not going to enforce existing free trade pacts\" -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Interesting.  Major Garrett in Monterey, Mexico.</p><p>As Major was saying, Canada is not just dealing with lumber tariffs, it's also facing new U.S. steel tariffs.  These duties went into effect this week.  And while NAFTA protects Canada from the higher duties, it does not protect against steel dumping.  Canada is investigating whether to hike its steel tariffs to protect against a flood of cheaper steel.</p><p>Meanwhile, Europe continues to seethe over the U.S. tariffs on steel.  The EU began drawing up a list of American goods for retaliation.  Those goods could face sanctions of up to $2 billion. And as Ceci Rodgers reports, it's not just the Europeans who are angry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Steel workers in Pennsylvania cheered the Bush administration this week.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED STEEL WORKER: The tariffs got us to the 30-yard line.</p><p>RODGERS: But domestic steel may be the only industry happy about the new tariffs, ranging from 8 to 30 percent.  Manufacturers meeting in Chicago are bracing for the impact of the tariffs, the most immediate being an anticipated jump in the price of steel.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It could take us from having what minimal bottom line we have to not having a bottom line at all.  I mean, that's -- it's that significant because, you know all of our products are steel.</p><p>RODGERS: Bison Gear, which makes steel parts for exercise equipment, says that steel tariffs would not come at a worse time, just as manufacturing is recovering from a 15-month-long recession.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got the dynamics going right now.  and I'm afraid that the steel cost increases could dampen that somewhat.</p><p>HOPKINS: Steel prices have already risen 20 percent since January, but that's after years of declines that pushed the price of steel to a 20-year low.</p><p>JERRY JASINOWSKI, NATIONAL ASSN. OF MFG.: I do think that these tariffs will erase steel prices, but my opinion is not as much as people think.</p><p>HOPKINS (on camera): More important than the price of steel is the potential for a global trade war.  With that in mind, the U.S. is delaying collecting the steel tariffs and is holding discussions with trading partners affected by it.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers, CNN Financial News, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOPKINS: Still to come on MONEYLINE: talking stocks, a roundtable discussion about what lies ahead as investors prepare for first quarter earnings</p><p>Business school graduates once the most sort-after recruits in corporate America, but the times are changing.  We'll tell you why.</p><p>And why developers are banking on star power to help boost real estate values in Hollywood.</p><p>All that and more after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: In corporate news tonight, DaimlerChrysler ends one legal battle, but faces another, the Chrysler arm to settle its lemon law case in California.  The state charged the company with selling returned vehicles with defects to unsuspecting Customers.  Chrysler will pay the state $325,000.</p><p>In another case, the judge has refused to dismiss shareholder lawsuits against DaimlerChrysler. That $36 billion deal between Daimler and Chrysler was billed as a merger of equals.  But Curt Kirkoyian (ph) and others say that instead Chrysler has been regulated to a mere division of the company, not a deal they would have approved.</p><p>And Philip Morris was handed a legal setback tonight in Oregon. A jury has ordered the company to pay $150 million to the family of a woman who died of lung cancer.  Michele Schwartz (ph) smoked low-tar cigarettes for years because she thought they were safer.  Philip Morris argued she should have known better because she went to nursing school and was married to a physician.  Philip Morris will appeal.</p><p>Cigarette maker lost another case in the same Portland courthouse two years ago.  In that case, a $81-million award was later reduced to 32 million.  It too is under appeal.</p><p>Now, let's go back to the losing week on Wall Street. The Dow's five-week winning streak came to an end.  Here with more, our own Christine Romans and Greg Clarkin and we'll be rejoined By Todd Eberhard as well.</p><p>So, Christine, you first, the Dow gave some back this week.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS: A setback -- A 1.7-percent decline for the Dow, but that's really not much considering we've had a nice rally for five weeks, and there were some good things that happened.</p><p>The bottom of the recent range held, and in fact you were putting in sort of a 10,300 to 10,700 range for the Dow. We'll watch next week, a shortened week, to see if that holds.</p><p>It was a great week for IPOs.  Travelers, we also had a Brazilian mining company, also Nestle had a spin-off of its Alcon (ph) eye care unit.  That was all well received -- $4.7 billion on the NYCNITOs (ph) this week, and UAL said it's actually going to start hiring back people, not only the people it furloughed, but new employees as well.</p><p>So, there were good signs on Wall Street, even though the market as a whole is pretty lackluster.</p><p>HOPKINS: The technology did better.</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS: It barely budged. It was down about one percent on the week, but you know we're hearing that we're kind of in this in between period.</p><p>You've got signs of the recovery, but still corporate profits have got to show some improvement.  That's whey this earning season, I have a feeling is going to be really kind of a tightrope walk for a lot of investors.</p><p>You know, the first sign you see of real weakness in some of these big tech companies, are very vulnerable at these levels.</p><p>HOPKINS: Do you agree Todd?</p><p>EBERHARD: Absolutely.  That's why I think we're seeing early on prior to any warning season or anything else that's happening.  EMC'S a great example, pounded down and then over the last couple of days of this week it went up dramatically, about six percent each day.</p><p>And you're going to see those type of moves back and forth.  And if they come out and start talking about warnings or the fact that they can't foresee the future to some degree, you're going to get them heading back again.</p><p>HOPKINS: So investors are prepared for the earnings not to be great, but they aren't prepared for companies to say they don't see a bottom.</p><p>EBERHARD: I think that's true.  I think everybody's expecting earnings to be somewhat flat.  And that's built into to a great degree.  But if the companies come out and say we don't know about next quarter again, that's going to be setting the market \u2026</p><p>CLARKIN: Without a doubt, I think -- I think people really are assuming that everybody has basically said we've turned the corner. You know, we've heard that kind of repeatedly, especially in technology.</p><p>If anybody came out and said that, it'd be a whole other story. But, you know just to show the holding pattern, the volume on the Nasdaq this week was incredibly light.  It was 15, some days 20 percent lighter than normal.</p><p>ROMANS: At the big board too, but there is new money coming into the market, which is something that are a lot of fund managers are saying, that they're using pullbacks in GE to deploy their assets and IBM, you know, even though they're concerned about the headlines, they just see some of these levels on some of the big name stocks as, you know, they're just grabs at this point.</p><p>HOPKINS: You know another headline, though, this week was interest rates.  The Federal Reserve -- the Fed acted and then the next day the market reacted and didn't like the idea of higher interest rates.  I mean how much is that hanging over the market?</p><p>CLARKIN: I think an awful lot.  It was another wrinkle this week and on top of that yesterday, I believe, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) numbers, which kind of threw a whole another side to that.  So I think a lot of folks \u2026</p><p>ROMANS: Because they were weak.</p><p>CLARKIN: Exactly.  So was the recovery as strong as you know some folks were anticipating already?  It's just another wrinkle that everybody's trying to figure through it.</p><p>ROMANS: So if you think that higher interest rates are going to be something that's going to be a problem for the market, considered that small caps generally outperform the rest of the market during periods of long, stable low interest rates. If we're in for that, there are places where you know, even if higher rates or the threat of it is doubling the market, there are still places that you can, you know, place your bets.</p><p>HOPKINS: Where are they, Todd?</p><p>EBERHARD: Well, there are special situations and I know I'm going to bring up one stock.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, K-Mart.</p><p>EBERHARD: I'm going to bring up my K-Mart special. I spoke about this a week ago and so far, I may never come back on this show again just because this may be wrong, but we're up about 20 percent since I spoke about it.  But I think there are special situations, as we touched on, the airlines I think are a very good one to look at.</p><p>You certainly have to be willing to take a lot of risks to go into these positions, so this is not the place, the whole nest egg and hope.  But I think there are places -- GE on a pullback that we're seeing.  Those are things you want to look at as potential buys.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Todd Eberhard and Christine Romans and Greg Clarkin.</p><p>It was an ambitious project called Iridium.  A satellite based network allowing mobile phones to be used anywhere on the planet.  The service worked well on the top of a mountain, but not downtown.  The service was also very expensive, $1,000 for a phone.  Calls cost a few bucks a minute and few customers bought it.</p><p>Iridium eventually went bust and cost Motorola, its biggest backer, billions of dollars. But now the war on terrorism has given the project a new lease on life.  Tim O'Brien has the story from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM O'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When the U.S. military launched missile strikes in Afghanistan, they were coordinated over wireless telephones and bad connections were not an option.  The company the government relied on, Iridium Satellite, claims it can provide uninterrupted telephone communication to any place on Earth, from poll pole to pole, including the remote wilderness of Alaska where Iridium sponsored this month's running of the Iditarod dog sled race.  Yet this is a firm that went bust only two years ago, now it's boom.</p><p>GINO PICASSO: Our subscriber numbers are in tens of thousands, which we are very pleased with as well, again unplanned, as expected, and business is good.</p><p>O'BRIEN: Through the reorganization of the company, a new group of private investors were able to pick up $5 billion in assets for a relatively paltry $25 million.  The analysts are impressed and surprised.</p><p>MICHAEL MASSEY, PIONEER COUNSELING: I was personally one of the ones who had kind of written them off and kind of forgotten about them, and now they seem to be steaming along and actually making some noise out there.  So they'll be exciting to watch.</p><p>O'BRIEN: Iridium now has 66 satellites in low orbit around the earth and 12 backup satellites, which they estimate will provide continuous coverage through 20/10.</p><p>The airtime rate on this phone is a very uncompetitive $1 to $1.50 a minute, and as you can see, it's not the kind of phone you can easily stick in your shirt pocket when you go out for dinner.  But the unique selling point that you can reach or be reached by anyone anywhere in the world has its appeal.</p><p>In addition to maritime communications and offshore oil rigs, there is a huge potential market with commercial aircraft and of course, there is the military.</p><p>JIM STROUD, THE CARMEL GROUP: I think the Defense Department is a natural.  I think other defense departments across the world are a natural.  I think the consumer market will grow, but I don't think it will ever be sort of a global force in telecommunications.</p><p>O'BRIEN: Bulky and expensive they may never be the consumer's choice.

But the downsizing in Wall Street and consulting firms means those graduates are not getting many job offers this year.  Fred Katayama has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's the business school blues.  Jobs are scarce, even summer internships.  Forget multiple job offers, students are lucky if they get one.</p><p>CHRISTY WILLIAMS, STUDENT DUKE UNIVERSITY: The majority of my peers are in the mind-set that if they get an offer they're going to take it.  Just because they think that there are so few options out there available.</p><p>KATAYAMA: That's not surprising, given that a recession followed the dot-com bust.  Then came 9-11.  Companies suddenly cut back on hiring, especially the sexiest sectors, investment banking and consulting.</p><p>DANIEL NAGY, ASSOC. DEAN DUKE UNIV.: I would put it right up there as one of the worst I've seen in my 30 years.  The consulting firms typically in the last few years at most of the top ten schools have recruited maybe 30, 35 percent of a class.  This year, if we hit seven or eight percent on consulting, we'll probably be doing good.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Soon to be graduates are begging for jobs.  Typically at top business schools roughly 80 percent of students would have lined up jobs by now.  This year, it's down to around 65 percent.</p><p>And so these schools are scrambling to fill up job boards. Duke's (UNINTELLIGIBLE) school has contacted more than 500 head- hunting firms.  Rice University is appealing to alumni for jobs.  And it's not limiting itself to the blue chips.</p><p>GILBERT WHITAKER, DEAN RICE UNIVERSITY: We're helping a lot in trying to create new opportunities for them with what we're calling the mid-size firms.  We're working directly with companies from 200 million to one to one and a half billion in sales to get them to look to us for jobs.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Students are looking beyond Wall Street.  In \"Vogue\", old-line industries like manufacturing.  Take Cargill, which deals in flour and fertilizers.</p><p>JAMES HAYMAKER, V.P.

Amid signs that the economy is picking up, these schools say they're hopeful they will get more job listings.  But many students say they'll take anything they can get -- Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: And I assume that a company like Andersen would not be hiring at all this year.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Yes, the whole consulting sector has been hit hard, Andersen probably included.

A report next on what the ceremony means for the local economy, the likely winners or losers.  \"Variety's\" editor-in-chief will be here to tell us his picks are right after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: The Oscars will be given out on Sunday night and you might be surprised to learn that the awards show is returning to Hollywood for the first time in more than four decades. It's all part of a major Hollywood face-lift that seeks to return Southern California's most famous neighborhood to its former glory.  Casey Wian has the story from Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's been 40 years since movie stars last walked the red carpet in Hollywood.  Recently the Oscars have been held in an auditorium several miles away. This year they'll once again step out of their limos onto Hollywood Boulevard and the entrance to the new Kodak Theater.  It's part of a $615-million retail and entertainment complex, that's wowing tourists and breathing new life into the fabled but fated Boulevard of dreams.</p><p>It's not just movie stars looking to make dreams come true here. Developers after years of neglect and delays are pouring money into projects to bring tourists and business back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's going on in Hollywood is very important. Hollywood is an icon for Southern California. Why do tourists come to Southern California?  They want to see Hollywood. They want to see the stars. They have gone to Hollywood and in the past they've been very, very disappointed. What you're seeing now is a genuine rebirth.</p><p>WIAN: At Hollywood and Vine, historic buildings are restored as modern office space.  At Sunset and Vine, plans call for condos and trendy shops, replace Merv Griffin's decrepit theater.  Pacific Theater's 1960's Cinerama Dome is now reopening, part of a giant movie complex, $1 billion of development is in Hollywood's pipeline.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have one of the most powerful brand names in the world, in Hollywood, and yet for years everyone was afraid to give it a try because of the reputation of Hollywood.</p><p>We had a few courageous developers who saw the potential and have stepped in.</p><p>WIAN: But the rebirth has had complications. The Hollywood and Highland complex went over budget and then opened in November in the post-9-11 tourist slump.  Its owners, Trizacon (ph) have written more than $200 million off its value and put the property up for sale.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Still in the long run, local officials believe money spent bringing real-life Hollywood to match its more glamorous image will prove as bankable as an Oscar winning movie star -Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: So Casey, what's going on there a couple of days before the Oscars?</p><p>WIAN: Well, a lot of setup, a lot of security.  You know, there's people out here having their pictures taken in front of the statue. Big preparations, the security issue, of course is paramount this year. There's going to be a smaller crowd this year. There was sort of a lottery for people who wanted to sit behind me in these bleachers and watch the stars walk down the red carpet.  Only about one out of every 10 people that applied to get one of those seats actually got in.  So heavy security procedures, a lot of the streets in town being closed off. That's the main focus right now.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Casey Wian, standing by the Oscar Theater. Thanks.</p><p>An Oscar win translates into big money at the box office. Joining us now for a look at the business end of show business is Peter Bart, he's editor-in-chief of \"Variety\" magazine.  Welcome back, Peter.</p><p>PETER BART, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, VARIETY MAGAZINE: Thank you.</p><p>HOPKINS: You know, I was very interested in a \"Wall Street Journal\" survey today that basically showed that most people had not or at least \"Wall Street Journal\" readers had not seen most of the movies that were nominated.  Is that because more and more of the nominated movies are kind of small pictures?</p><p>BART: Yes, that's exactly the case, and it's been so in recent years. The trouble with Hollywood pictures, of course is they're going for the big audience with big tent-pole pictures.  And indeed, the minute the Academy Awards end, all of Hollywood's real products starts to pour out, whether it's \"Star Wars\" or \"Men In Black II\" or \"Spiderman.\"</p><p>That's when all the biggies start pouring out. But a couple of the pictures, for example, that are up for best picture have only grossed about $30 million in the United States.  So you can see A, they are smaller, not tent-pole pictures, and, B, if they win, there's a real upside economically.</p><p>HOPKINS: How much of an upside is there?</p><p>BART: Well, in the past, some of the smaller pictures have doubled or even tripled their gross as a result of the publicity here and overseas. This country alone, about 45 million people watch the Academy Awards.  And you know one sign of hope, by the way, Jan, is that the -- it's really a sellout in terms of spots.  A 60-second spot goes for about 1.1 million this year versus about 1.4 million in last year, but it sold out. So that's the sign that there is -- there's hope in the advertising economy.</p><p>HOPKINS: It may be a sign that advertising has indeed bottomed.</p><p>BART: Yes, I think there are definite -- the trouble is there's always a lag time between the time that an economy recovers from the recession and advertising shows that comeback too, because it takes a while to redo your ad budgets.</p><p>HOPKINS: Let's talk a little bit about the Oscars and your bets. It seems to me that the betting now seems to be on \"A Beautiful Mind.\", whereas I thought earlier it was on \"Lord of the Rings.\" What do you think is actually going to win?</p><p>BART: Well, you see, it's so close that what will likely happen is that one picture could easily cancel out the other.  You know, the producers' guild ballots \"Moulin Rouge\" ended up winning.  So I could make a case for any of the five winning.  You know, I don't -- I don't bet first because \"Variety\" should be objective, and second because I probably would be wrong.</p><p>HOPKINS: One of the nominated pictures \"Gosford Park,\" apparently has picked up a lot of business as a result of the nomination.</p><p>BERT: Yes, that's absolutely true.  You know this is a -- really a relatively small English picture.  And it's got a lot of impetus. But you know the fact that \"E.T.\" is opening this weekend is symbolic in terms of the Oscars, because when \"E.T.\" opened 20 years ago, remember, the Academy Awards snubbed it; they chose \"Gandhi\" that year.  And again, there's a tendency of the -- of the members of the Academy to choose the big, portentous, meaningful picture over the entertaining movie, and here we have \"E.T.\" coming back 20 years later, more beloved than ever.  It got my vote that year, 20 years ago.</p><p>HOPKINS: How is it going to do this time around, do you think?</p><p>BART: You know, I think it's going to do great, I think, even though many people have seen it on television.  It's the kind of picture that you like to rediscover and that every generation I think will rediscover.</p><p>HOPKINS: Ryan O'Neal, I understand is going to be presenting on Sunday night, despite the fact that he's battling cancer. That's a surprise, I guess, that despite his illness that he's going to be there.  I guess it shows how important it is.</p><p>BART: Well, it is.  Ryan is an old friend of mine, and he's a stalwart guy. I certainly wish him the best.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Peter Bart, and I assume you'll be watching on Sunday night.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>BART: I'll be there.  I'll be at the \u2026</p><p>HOPKINS: Oh, you'll be there, good. We'll talk to you next week.</p><p>\"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\" begins in a few minutes. For a preview, let's go to Wolf in Washington -- Wolf.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, HOST, \"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\": Thank you very much, Jan.  Major developments today in Pakistan.  We'll tell you why the U.S. government wants families of diplomats and all so-called non- essential personnel to leave the country right away.</p><p>Also, the Pakistani government outlines plans to try the suspects in the Daniel Pearl kidnapping and murder.  And I'll have a special interview with Hamid Rasheed.  He's the best-selling author of \"Taliban.\" It's all coming up right at the top of the hour.  Jan, have a great weekend.</p><p>HOPKING: You too, Wolf. Thanks.</p><p>In tonight's segment \"In Their Words,\" President Bush addresses the U.N. poverty summit.  State Department orders non-essential U.S. employees in Pakistan to leave the country, and a former president shares his view on U.S.-Cuba trade relations \"In Their Words.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When nations respect their people, open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid.  Every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.  We must tie greater aid to political and legal and economic reforms.  And by insisting on reform, we do the work of compassion.</p><p>PHILLIP REEKER, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: After a careful review of our security posture in Pakistan, the department has decided to move to an ordered departure of all dependents and non-emergency personnel at our embassy in Islamabad and our consulates in Pakistan. The embassy will identify non-emergency personnel on a case by case basis.</p><p>FORMER PRES. JIMMY CARTER: Well, I think the best way to bring about democratic changes in Cuba is obviously to have maximum commerce and trade and visitation by Americans and others who know freedom and to let the Cuban people know the advantages of freedom.  That's the best way to bring about change, and not to punish the Cuban people themselves by imposing an embargo on them, which makes Castro seem to be a hero, because he's defending his own people against the abusive of Americans.  So this is a position that I've taken for the last 20 years or more.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOPKINS: That's MONEYLINE\" for this Friday evening. Thanks for joining us. I'm Jan Hopkins in for Lou Dobbs. Good night from New York. \"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS\" begins right now.

The news sent the shares about 1 percent higher after the bell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the news is likely to help technology shares extend their rally early Tuesday, the biggest focus of that day's session will be the Fed, which is widely expected to keep interest rates steady at a more than 40-year low at its monetary policy meeting.</p><p>However, there is some concern that the central bank might change the language in its post-meeting statement to imply that it may raise rates sooner than had been expected. (For an in-depth look at the Fed's meeting, click here.)</p><p>\"If there's nervousness about the Fed tomorrow, then why is the Dow up so much?,\" said John Hughes, market analyst at MKM Partners. \"They're not expected to do anything. Depending on whether they change the language in their statement, you could see the market use it as an excuse to take profits, or an excuse to extend the rally.\"</p><p>Tuesday's only other economic news is the October reading on wholesale inventories, expected to show little change from September and rarely a market mover.</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average added around 1 percent, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index added 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq composite added around 0.6 percent.</p><p>The Dow's close was the highest since May 28, 2002, when it closed at 9,981.58.</p><p>The Nasdaq meandered during most of the session, before finally joining in by the close, although its gains were much more modest, after having trading briefly above the key psychological level of 2,000 last week.</p><p>\"I think what you're seeing today is a trend that you're going to continue to see through the end of the year: a rotational shift out of some of the big tech gainers, particularly the [semiconductors], as well as other small-caps, and into the less exciting stocks that haven't participated as much this year,\" said John Shields, a market analyst at Shields &amp; Co.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Blue chips gain</p><p>Among the movers, General Motors continued to build on last week's gains after the company announced strong November auto sales, adding 2.4 percent. Other big Dow movers included Altria, up 2 percent after a bullish Goldman Sachs note about its Philip Morris unit, and Boeing, up nearly 3 percent</p><p>Technology shares bounced after sliding during the morning and early afternoon.</p><p>Microsoft rose 1 percent after brokerage firm SoundView upgraded it to \"outperform\" from \"neutral\" based on the company's solid showing in SoundView's recent business study.</p><p>Shares of CV Therapeutics plunged 27.1 percent in unusually active Nasdaq trade after U.S. regulators expressed concern about the angina treatment the company is developing.</p><p>On the New York Stock Exchange, the second most-active issue was hospital stock Health Management Associates, which lost 11.1 percent after UBS downgraded it to \"reduce\" from \"neutral,\" citing concerns about how it accounts for charges in its contracts with health insurers amid recent regulatory scrutiny of the industry.</p><p>Market breadth turned positive by the close. On the NYSE, where 1.18 billion shares changed hands, gainers outnumbered losers by more than two to one. On the Nasdaq, advancers beat decliners by around eight to seven on volume of 1.58 billion shares.</p><p>The dollar continued to reel after Friday's weaker-than-forecast growth in monthly payrolls, with investors continuing to worry about how the greenback's slide might impact U.S. investments internationally and international investments in the United States. The dollar has been hitting all-time lows versus the euro for seven consecutive sessions, and has lost value against the yen as well.</p><p>\"The dollar news has already been in people's minds for some time, so it's not carrying much sway,\" said Peter Green, a market analyst at MKM Partners.</p><p>Heavy snowstorms on the East Coast took their toll on retail sales over the weekend and kept oil prices rising. NYMEX light sweet crude oil futures rose $1.37 to $32.10 a barrel. COMEX gold rose 20 cents to settle at $407.50 an ounce.</p><p>Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note's yield at 4.27 percent, up from 4.23 percent late Friday, as its price fell 10/32 of a point. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4B64-5DV0-01PR-2324-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2003 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>December 8, 2003 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>WELLINGTON SHIELDS &amp;

HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Hello to you all. I'm T.J. Holmes, sitting in today for Tony Harris here in the CNN NEWSROOM. And once again, the financial crisis is not just exclusive to us here in the U.S. This is a financial -- a global financial crisis that's once again dominating the news on this Monday, October 6th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks across the world are tumbling as investors realize that financial rescue plan, you know, that $700 billion plan, is not going to be a quick fix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You are in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>Well, some people are running scared now right now, and they are running from the markets. Fear is what's driving investors today.</p><p>The Dow plunged below 10,000 at midmorning. That's the first time in four years we have seen that number below 10,000. Right now, the Dow is down, as you see there, 461 points, 452 points, off about 5 percent for the day.</p><p>Now, that pretty much is in line with markets in Europe, as well as Asia. And most major indices there skidded 4 to 8 percent today.</p><p>We're keeping an eye on all of this.</p><p>Also, we know that President Bush has made some comments, talking about it's going to take some time for that financial plan to work. We're expecting to hear those comments specifically from him as soon as they come into us. We have a reporter on the story and we'll pass them along to you.</p><p>Also, our Susan Lisovicz is keeping an eye on things. We have our reporters really at the Nasdaq, at the New York Stock Exchange. Also, in New York, our Ali Velshi is.</p><p>We're going to take you now with Susan Lisovicz, who's keeping an eye on things for us.</p><p>Susan, hello to you again.</p><p>We talk about this confidence is the key right now. This is really an emotional time for a lot of people. </p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and, you know, fear is something that is often said to be one of the components of stock market trading. It's fear and greed. So, fear is a component, panic is something else.</p><p>And you know, I'm looking at this note that the chief markets strategist for Edward Jones, Alan Skrainka, sent me. And it says, \"A financial crisis is a severe disruption in financial markets that spill over to the broader economy. A financial panic is characterized by intense fear that can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"</p><p>That's why you see the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department and governments in Europe -- it's bad enough, they don't want it to get any worse. And what you're seeing is a lot of fear, intense fear. In some cases, panic, and what it's culminating in today is a ferocious sell-off.</p><p>We're coming in after the worst week on Wall Street since the aftermath of 9/11. It was also, T.J., a year ago this week that the Dow hit its all-time high, above 14,000. Today, before the opening bell, a trader was wearing a Dow 10,000 cap which was passed out during the great bull market of the 1990s. It was, in fact, in 1999 when that milestone was first reached.</p><p>But there is a sell-off here. We saw a sell-off, a massive sell- off overseas.</p><p>There are more signs of weakness and a lack of confidence in overseas companies by not only the companies themselves, a lack of confidence in lending to each other, but also by investors, as well as customers. We saw a halt in trading in Russia, also in Brazil. And the stark realization here on Wall Street that this bailout, this landmark $700 billion bailout package, is going to take some time to work, if it works.</p><p>In the meantime, well, you know, we have clear and undeniable signs that the U.S. economy, the biggest in the world, is decelerating. And the Fed stepped in again before the open. As one economist told me today, the Fed is using a bazooka to try to open up lending. It's also going to start paying interest on commercial bank reserves. It has the power now because of that bill.</p><p>One last thing I want to mention. You're looking at stock prices, but oil prices are something we're also looking at. Crude right now down more than $4, below $90 a barrel. And that's another sign of the toll expected because of what we're seeing, a slowdown in business and ultimately consumer spending -- T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: All right. Susan Lisovicz for us there at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Want to turn to Ali Velshi here now, who is watching Wall Street for us as well in New York.</p><p>Ali, I guess you just heard Susan there talk about a bazooka. </p><p>ALI VELSHI, CNN SR. BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>HOLMES: Some of this lingo you all are using today has blown our minds here. But tell us, the Fed using all kinds of tools is essentially what she's saying, trying to help out. What is it going to take to calm people down? Because you talk about that fear and this being an emotional time. That $700 billion didn't at least -- we know it's coming.</p><p>That didn't calm people down. What will?</p><p>VELSHI: Right. The bailout wasn't a stock market bailout, bottom line. And that's what it comes down to.</p><p>What causes people to buy stocks is they think the underlying companies will do well. So, we had a credit problem, and this $700 billion is meant to address that. But how does this help Macy's or JCPenney, or a shipping company?</p><p>It doesn't necessarily. It frees up some credit if they were having problems meeting their operating expenses, but how does it make the price of stock go up?</p><p>Well, the one thing that makes the price of stocks go up is when people spend money. And with all the sort of gloom that we've got around particularly unemployment, low home prices, why would they be spending more money?</p><p>The one piece of interesting news, as Susan said, oil prices are going down. So that might help you out a little bit.</p><p>But folks have stopped me, T.J., and saying, you know, \"My portfolio is down 30 percent from the beginning of the year.\" Well, if you look at the S&amp;P 500, which is one of the broader measures that we use of the stock market, broader than the Dow, it's down 28 and change percent since the beginning of the year. The Dow itself is down 25 and change percent since the beginning of the year.</p><p>So this is to say, if you're looking at your 401(k), look at that, since last October, when we hit our highs, until now. One year. This is the shape the Dow has taken.</p><p>So, that may not make you feel good about where you are right now, T.J., but it should make you understand that you weren't alone and you didn't make independently bad decisions. So don't feel worse than the market should make you feel.</p><p>The panic doesn't help you. If you were diversified, you still got burned, and that happens from time to time in the markets.</p><p>They also come back. And these present buying opportunities for people, T.J.</p><p>So, all is not lost. There is something to be said for an orderly sell-off of markets. It means they come back later.</p><p>This isn't panic selling at the moment. And frankly, for those of us -- those of you watching this, panic doesn't help you. You've got to make sound decisions. Gerri's going to tell you a little bit how to make those sound decisions specifically. They can be made. You can learn a lot about the markets and make decisions that can at least protect your portfolio from further devastation.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes. And Ali, we will go right over to Gerri, as you mentioned there.</p><p>Gerri Willis standing by for us as well, a member of this CNN money team.</p><p>And tell us again, what should make people feel better right now, or how can you help yourself feel better by making some good decisions and not, like you say, just grab your money and run right now out of this market?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITOR: Well, we've seen bear markets before. This is nothing new. And if you've been invested in the market with your 401(k) for any period of time, you've been through a bear market, and that's what we're in right now.</p><p>Stocks down 30 percent, 87 percent of mutual funds were in the red for the third quarter. And this is just what the stock market does. If you don't have the stomach for this, maybe you shouldn't be invested at all.</p><p>The basic steps that you want to take right now, understand what you're invested in. What is it that you own?</p><p>Look at your 401(k). Look at the mutual funds that you own. Go to morningstar.com, plug those tickers in, see what individual holdings are in those mutual funds so you understand what it is you own.</p><p>Also, pay down your credit cards. If you want a guaranteed rate of return these days, about the only way to get it is to pay off high interest rate debt. That's absolutely an essential and one thing I know a lot of people are already thinking about. All you have to do is look at the major economic indicators right now.</p><p>You know, we've had too much debt in this society. It's time to pay some of that down. It's time to save.</p><p>Think about putting some money away because, look, at the end of the day, I believe that the biggest threat to you right now isn't the stock market, particularly if you're years from retirement. You've got lots of time to make that up.</p><p>The biggest threat to you right now is what's going on with jobs and the economy. You have to make sure you have some emergency savings on the side so that if worse comes to worse, you can pull on your savings rather than having a financial problem that dogs you for years.</p><p>So, calm down, take a breath. This is a bear market. We've seen it before, we've been through it before. Stocks go down as well as up, as most investors know. You just have to ignore your emotions here, try to hold them at bay, and really look at where you sit in this market.</p><p>Also, understand where your money is. What accounts do you have? What kind of bank accounts do you have? Where are they? Where is the money?</p><p>You really need to take stock right now, understand what it is you do own -- T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: I know that's tough for people to set those emotions aside when they see themselves losing money they've been saving over the years. But you're right, it might be time to make a move, but don't do anything rash and erratic. Stop and think it through, and you will be just fine.</p><p>Gerri Willis, thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIS: That's right, T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes.</p><p>We want to remind our viewers, again, we're keeping an eye on the markets. We'll keep that box up throughout the show. Keeping an eye, down 450 points now at the Dow at this point.</p><p>Also want to let you know that we are keeping an eye out for comments President Bush made just a short time ago about the economy. A live picture here of Air Force One. This is at the airport in San Antonio. The President in Texas right now.</p><p>Made some comments about the economy, certainly saying it's going to take a while for that financial package to kick in and start to work. It's not going to be a quick fix, which we certainly knew. But as soon as we get those comments, we will turn those around and pass those along to you. </p><p>Also, we've been checking in with our financial reporters in New York, over at the New York Stock Exchange. Also, we have our Poppy Harlow at the Nasdaq. We're going to check in with her. That important index as well down today. And also, the volatility index, giving us a gauge of how people feel right now about the economy, it's not doing so well either.</p><p>Also, let's turn now to Washington, where Congress is searching for the fall guy in this whole financial crisis, possibly. Of course, that $700 billion bailout bill that lawmakers did pass, a lot of them still didn't like it. Some of them said outright that they hated the bill even though they had to vote for it.</p><p>But Lehman Brothers CEO, Richard Fuld, is first to feel the heat today. These are live pictures of the hearing going on right now. This is the House Government Oversight Committee having a hearing.</p><p>Congressman Waxman of California, who is the chair of this committee, says he wants to know what went wrong and who should be held accountable for this entire mess. Lehman, of course, that 158- year-old company, a prestigious Wall Street investment firm, collapsed three weeks ago. Well, tomorrow, Waxman's committee will question execs from the insurance giant AIG.</p><p>Well, you can follow the markets and get up-to-the-minute news on the financial crisis on our Web site any time you want to. Just log on CNNMoney.com. That is your place to be.</p><p>All right. Less than a month now, can you believe it? Twenty- nine days and counting until the presidential election. The candidates certainly revving up the rhetoric. And it's right on time. We see this around election time, about a month out, every time around.</p><p>There you see Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin. She was touting her running mate, John McCain, as the best person to handle both the wars and the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: John McCain is the only man in this race who will solve our economic crisis and not exploit it. And he's the only man in this race with a plan that will actually help our working families and cut your taxes and get our economy back on track.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>He's the only man in this race who talks about the wars that America is fighting, and he isn't afraid to use the word \"victory.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: Meanwhile, John McCain, he's on the trail in New Mexico, holding a rally later today in Albuquerque. After that, he's heading to Nashville. He's got a little something to do there tomorrow night -- the second presidential debate, which, of course, you'll e watching right here on CNN.</p><p>Barack Obama, he's also prepping for the debate. After rallying supporters in Asheville, North Carolina, yesterday, Obama did take some time out this morning to call into the \"Tom Joyner Radio Show.\" He accused the McCain campaign of using attacks to avoid addressing the issues.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to talk about the things that matter to the American people. The last couple of days, while Senator McCain's campaign has been engaging in the low road, we've been talking about health care and how we can make sure that every single American can get health care. We're going to talk about how we put people back to work and create jobs in the new energy sector. You know, those are going to be the topics that we think the American people want to hear about. And that's what I'm going to talk about during the debate.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: Well, his vice presidential running mate, Joe Biden, has canceled his campaign appearances for today and tomorrow because of a death in the family. Biden's mother-in-law died yesterday after a long illness. The funeral and private burial will take place tomorrow in Pennsylvania.</p><p>So what can we expect during debate tonight, round two with John McCain and Barack Obama? Our senior political analyst, Bill Schneider, is live for us from Nashville with a preview of tomorrow night's match-up.</p><p>And this is a different kind of match-up, certainly, a different format. They're not just going to be standing up there and listening to a moderate toss some questions at them. This one is going to be a little different.</p><p>WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, this is a town hall format. There will be voters on the stage asking questions, along with the moderator. Those voters are carefully selected, they're uncommitted voters, they haven't made up their minds.</p><p>They are unlikely to want to hear negative personal attacks. What they're likely to want to hear -- in fact, demand to hear -- is what each candidate is going to do about the economy, because those economic fears and concerns have been rising very, very rapidly.</p><p>HOLMES: Right. And like you said, it's on everybody's mind. Certainly we're talking about it today. It's dominating all the news.</p><p>So how do people feel these days, though we've been asking questions of them, those voters? How are they feeling right now about this economy and where it's going?</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Very fearful. We asked the question just this weekend of voters around the country, and the question described the Great Depression of the 1930s, which a lot of Americans are not old enough to remember.</p><p>The question said, \"In the '30s, the U.S. went through a depression in which roughly one of American workers were unemployed, banks failed, and millions of people were temporarily homeless or unable to feed their families. How likely is it that something like this could happen again now?\"</p><p>A solid 59 percent of Americans thought it was very likely or somewhat likely that what we are headed for in this country is another Great Depression. That is a very frightening number. Just 42 percent believe that it is not likely. So nearly 60 percent think another Great Depression is likely. How do they feel about economic conditions in the country today? Just 16 percent describe economic conditions as good, 84 percent says those conditions are, in fact, poor.</p><p>How will this affect you, the ordinary American? Thirty-six percent say they expect this economic crisis to affect them immediately. Another 19 percent say within the year. So that's a majority of Americans expect to feel the impact of this economic crisis within the next year.</p><p>There's a lot of concern, a lot of anxiety around the country right now. And this interviewing was done over the weekend, before today's news -- T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: Well, we hate to see those numbers after today's news. And 16 percent in those numbers say the conditions are good. A lot of people probably wondering, where in the world are those 16 percent, because this economy is affecting everybody.</p><p>Bill Schneider, thank you so much there in Nashville, where the debate will take place tomorrow night.</p><p>And, of course, the presidential candidates, it's their second of three debates. Tuesday night, make sure you watch it right here, CNN, with the best political team on television.</p><p>We will turn back now -- keeping an eye on the financial markets. We've been keeping an eye on the Dow this morning, keeping an eye on that index. Well, the Nasdaq not faring so well either.</p><p>Poppy Harlow, I will come to you. It's not a matter of asking how are things there, it's just a matter of asking how bad are they.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM: Yes. Well, at the Nasdaq, they're the worst for the all the major averages. Worse than the Dow, worse than the S&amp;P. The Nasdaq is down 5.5 percent right now. Want to talk about why that is.</p><p>There's a lot of big tech companies traded here -- Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco. Some companies all of you out there might be invested in. They're getting beaten up because when financial institutions fail, when there's a crisis on Wall Street, it affects their business in a big way. Lehman Brothers, those names, are some of their biggest clients.</p><p>Also, you might know this, though. A lot of regional banks are traded on the Nasdaq, names like Zions. That might be your bank. Or names like Fifth Third Bank Corp.</p><p>Zions is down 5 percent. That's a big bank in Utah and across the Southwest. Fifth Third Bank Corp. down 9 percent. That's big in Indiana and in Michigan.</p><p>This is not just a Wall Street problem. This is a Main Street problem. This is affecting these small banks as well. That's why you're seeing this index down so much. And the Nasdaq is down more than 30 percent, T.J., so far this year.</p><p>I want to also turn to something else. That's called the Volatility Index. It's the VIX.</p><p>I have it on the board behind me. It is down. Take a look at it there.</p><p>It's up 19 percent in a single day. It is over 50 points right now. In September, it was about 20 points. That is a huge change.</p><p>What the Volatility Index does is it really measures how much people think there is going to be a swing in the markets. There are massive bets being placed on big swings in the market right now, mostly to the downside.</p><p>The reading we're seeing on the VIX today, the highest since, get this, 1989. People are incredibly worried. It's a massive, massive jump for that index, T.J. So that's playing into things a lot. And it's interesting to see the Nasdaq, these tech companies, these regional banks, feeling the pressure even more than the Dow right now -- T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: All right. And we know, Poppy -- you stand by there with us. We know you talked to some traders there today as well. Certainly want to hear what they're talking about.</p><p>We want to let our viewers know we're standing by here. We're waiting to hear from President Bush.</p><p>President Bush made some comments today about the economy, certainly talking about that financial package that was put into place just last week by the Congress and signed by the president, a $700 billion package. Well, it hasn't really made people feel better about the markets. We still see a drop in all those indices, but here's the president here in Texas about to make comments here about this.</p><p>We're just getting this in. So let's go ahead here and listen in to the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE. W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A very illuminating conversation with small business owners here. We have a car dealer, an automobile repair shop, a restaurateur, two restaurateurs. And it's clear that these small business owners are dealing with the effects of a credit crunch.</p><p>And by that, I mean they're having trouble getting money to be able to continue to either expand their business or to be able to -- for money to help their consumers be able to buy their products. And it's -- and I told them one of the reasons why I was so strongly for this rescue package was, inherent in the strategy of the rescue package is to free up credit, just to get money moving. And it's going to take a while. I signed the bill on -- last week, but it's going to take a while to get in place a program that, one, is effective, and, two, that doesn't waste taxpayers' money. We don't want to rush into this situation and not have the program be effective.</p><p>It's going to take a while to restore confidence in the financial system. But one thing people can be certain of is that the bill I signed is a big step toward solving this problem.</p><p>A lot of the people here in Texas and around the country are not pleased with the government having to take the steps they took. Their question is, I pay my bills, I pay my mortgage, why are you helping Wall Street?</p><p>And the answer is because had we not done anything, people like the folks behind me would be a lot worse off. We'll make sure as time goes on this doesn't happen again. In the meantime, we've got to solve the problem. And that's why people sent me to Washington, D.C. When you see a problem, put a team together and solve it.</p><p>And I want to thank you all for your time. I'm glad to be back here in Texas. I miss my friends in Texas.</p><p>I am -- people say, \"You looking forward to coming home?\" Yes, I'm looking forward to living here, but in the meantime, it looks like I'm going to have a lot of work to do between today and when the new president takes office. But Laura and I are glad to be with our friends.</p><p>And thank you for your time. Thank you all very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: The president saying there he's not going to be able to vacation his way out of his job. He has work to do in Washington, certainly with this financial mess.</p><p>Listening to the president there talking about -- really echoing some of those sentiments, a lot of things we heard leading up to that whole $700 billion package. It's bad now, but you can imagine, it's going to worse if we don't have this package. Also talking about it's going to take a while, don't want to rush into things, going to take a while to restore confidence.</p><p>Well, Kathleen Koch standing by for us at the White House now.</p><p>Kathleen, I don't know. A lot of the people were saying, why do we have to rush into getting this bill passed? Lawmakers said we needed to. Now that it's passed, the president saying we need to take our time here and do it right.</p><p>I guess is that the new theme now, now we need to slow things down?</p><p>KATHLEEN KOCH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, T.J., the White House clearly -- though they now have the authority, the administration has the authority to buy these bad mortgages and other failed assets from these banks, clearly they have to set up a system to make it happen. And the President is -- and the treasury secretary have been very clear on that point, that it is -- it's not the kind of thing that happens overnight.</p><p>They've never done this sort of thing before. And again, you want to do it right, you want to do it with proper oversight. So I don't think any in Congress either would take issue with that, with the president saying we are going to take some time.</p><p>I think a lot of people have some questions about, well, hey, what's happening with the market now? We thought we passed this bailout package on -- this rescue plan on Friday, and this would bring calm and stability to the markets. And certainly that was something that the administration had hoped would occur as well.</p><p>When I reached out to the deputy press secretary, Tony Fratto, to see what the administration thought about the plunge in U.S. markets, and obviously also the plunge overseas, he said that they don't comment on daily market activity. But commenting on what's happening overseas, Fratto did point out that -- he said the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, other government agencies, are working with their counterparts overseas to try to bring some stability to the global financial crisis. And he said that the administration is \"confident\" that sustained attention to the root causes of the crisis will eventually bring that stability and confidence.</p><p>But right now, T.J., it appears there's not a lot that anyone can do to stop the markets from doing what they want. And right now it's plunged.</p><p>HOLMES: And that is what they're doing, some 477 points down now.</p><p>Kathleen Koch for us at the White House.</p><p>Kathleen, thank you so much.</p><p>KOCH: You bet.</p><p>HOLMES: We'll also be looking into -- the Supreme Court coming up next. They are back in session today. What will the impact of the election have on that court? We'll ask our senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin. He's coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOLMES: Well, it is issue #1 right there on the campaign trail. And right there what you're seeing, 472 points down, the Dow. The Nasdaq also down some 5 percent today. World markets tanked overnight. We're just seeing a lack of confidence right now in the markets despite that $700 billion bailout package that is in place now here in the U.S.</p><p>We are keeping an eye on all things economy related for you today.</p><p>Also want to turn now back to something else going on. The Supreme Court, they're back in session today. And certainly some major news being made out of there. One in particular about the case of Troy Davis. You may remember this name. He was on death row for a long time here in the state of Georgia, actually.</p><p>Kelli Arena is there at the Supreme Court.</p><p>What has been the movement, or what is the news on this particular case?</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, as you said, Troy Davis has been on death row there in Georgia since 1993. He was convicted of killing an off-duty police officer there in Savannah.</p><p>There have been some questions regarding that case of whether or not witness testimony was indeed reliable. After several witnesses had testified that he was indeed the person who shot and killed that police officer, they recanted that testimony. Of course, Mr. Davis has claimed that he was innocent all along, and so there's been a large spotlight on that case.</p><p>What the Supreme Court decided -- was supposed to decide on that case today, whether or not they were going to consider that appeal or not. Earlier, our guidance was that they had passed on that. But I want to clarify and make sure that we get this correct.</p><p>What the Supreme Court has done is nothing yet. What they're going to take this up on Friday instead. So Troy Davis still has a chance that his case could be heard before the Supreme Court.</p><p>He was supposed to be executed just a couple of weeks ago. That execution was stayed, obviously, while both sides are waiting for the courts to decide. So we should get a definitive answer on whether or not the Supreme Court justices will hear his appeal on Friday. And we did not get proper guidance earlier. I want to make sure our viewers know, Friday is the day.</p><p>HOLMES: Friday is the day, so he still has a chance for the Supreme Court to take..</p><p>ARENA: He still has a chance, absolutely.</p><p>HOLMES: ... up his case.</p><p>ARENA: A very controversial case.</p><p>HOLMES: OK. OK. Friday is the day.</p><p>Kelli Arena, thank you so much for that.</p><p>ARENA: You're welcome.</p><p>HOLMES: And of course the first Monday in October, we see the Supreme Court beginning that new term today. Well, the biggest decision of the year though may come Election Day.</p><p>Our senior legal correspondent, Jeffrey Toobin, the author of the book \"The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court,\" so he knows a little bit about what's happening up there.</p><p>Jeff joins me now from New York.</p><p>Jeff, a lot of things going on out there on the campaign trail. You know, usually, the Supreme Court is at least a part of the back and forth in a debate during an election time. Well, here we are, they're back in the news. They're starting their session today.</p><p>So will voters now stop and think, wait a minute, how could this change the makeup of this court? And that's going to be an issue now on the campaign trail for the last month?</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SR. LEGAL ANALYST: Well, perhaps they should, but every indication I've seen is that the Supreme Court, yet again, will not be a major issue in this campaign. The economy has just swamped everything. But if people want to think about what the impact of the next president is going to be, the Supreme Court almost certainly will be the 44th president's perhaps most important legacy.</p><p>The court now is divided -- four very conservative justices, four liberal justices, Anthony Kennedy in the middle -- deciding case after case. Three of those liberals are likely to resign in the next few years, so the next president may have the opportunity to move the court way to the right or keep it more or less the way it is.</p><p>HOLMES: OK. Well, again, you say you never see this. I guess, what would it take? I guess -- and what do they have, I guess, on their schedule for this particular session? Is there any particular case that will certainly jump out at people? And then, again, like you say, voters are really not going to make this that big of a deal. But still, what could possibly get voter's attention.</p><p>TOOBIN: Well, certainly the Troy Davis case is the big case at the moment. And there's a very interesting legal issue in that case. You'd think it would have been resolved by now, but here it is. Is it constitutional to execute an innocent person? The Supreme Court has never answered that question. And this case may present it if they decide to take it up.</p><p>Another, not so important but actually interesting kind of case, is the Federal Communications Commission has levied fines against television (ph) networks for stray expletives. Remember, Cher said some things she shouldn't have said. And Bono said some things. Can you fine a network for expletives that they didn't plan or know was going to happen. </p><p>Certainly there are going to be more cases about Guantanamo Bay. That issue has been a constant throughout the Bush years. And always, in the background, abortion and affirmative action likely to come up. If not this year, very soon. HOLMES: And again, the likelihood, like you said, possible that three of the liberal judges could be stepping down in the next several years. None of the conservatives, we're going to lose them any time soon.</p><p>TOOBIN: Doesn't look that way, although, you know, you never know how people's health is going to go, but you've got -- the older justices on the liberal side and that tends to be the people who leave first.</p><p>HOLMES: There it is. All right, Jeff Toobin.</p><p>Sir, thank you so much. Good to see you this morning.</p><p>TOOBIN: See you, T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: Oil prices continue to fall. That would, you know, normally be good news to people. But the reason the oil prices are falling is anything but good. CNN.com's Poppy Harlow on our Energy Fix today from New York, from the Nasdaq.</p><p>You've been covering all kind of stuff for us. So what's the word on these oil prices?</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, we're here at the Nasdaq because of the volatility in the stock market, but there's a lot of volatility in the oil market, which you would see right downtown from here at the NYMEX. The New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil is down more than $4 right now. It is right now below $90 a barrel. We haven't seen that since February.</p><p>This would be welcome news, but the reason behind it is not welcoming at all. We are hugely off of that record high we saw of over $147 a barrel back in July. That has to do with the fundamental of supply and demand. Traders selling off their oil contracts because they are concerned that around the world the demand for oil and the products that use oil is not going to be anywhere near where it was this summer.</p><p>What that means for you, your gas prices are down for a 19th straight day, $3.50 a gallon right now according to AAA. But again, it all has to do with that sinking global economy. It's not just how many cars will run on gasoline, it's the demand for the products that take petroleum, that take oil to make them, T.J.</p><p>So some bad news today. Oil down again. I guess good news if you have to heat your home and fill your take. But otherwise, bad fundamentals behind it.</p><p>HOLMES: The fundamentals. And, I guess, it's common supply and demand and people -- it's, you know.</p><p>Poppy Harlow for us there at the Nasdaq. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. Keeping an eye on all that stuff for us.</p><p>We want to turn now back to that $700 billion bailout package. It passed Congress. No immediate silver bullet, however, as we've been seeing for borrowers. We will explain why straight ahead. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOLMES: The Dow Jones Industrial average about 500 points down today. Ten thousand below that number for the first time in four years. It's sitting there at about 9,800. Our Susan Lisovicz, Ali Velshi both keeping an eye on the markets for us today. There they both are. Good to see you both.</p><p>Susan, I am going to start with you.</p><p>We've still got another three and a half hours to watch this board. What are we going to be seeing?</p><p>LISOVICZ: Well, you know, it's very volatile. I know Poppy was talking to you earlier about this index. The fear index. The volatility index. It's called the VIX. And it's at very, very high levels. It might be at an all-time high.</p><p>So things are volatile. A lot of the investors are afraid. And you can't predict when you have emotions running the market. But we have seen the market selling off now for a period of time. We are well into a bear market.</p><p>And the headlines today are clearly showing that the distress we're seeing in the U.S. financial market is not limited to this market. We've seen extraordinary measures occurring today and over the weekend to bolster banking systems overseas. The German government agreed on a nearly $70 billion bailout of a lender there. A French bank, BNP Paribas, agreed to acquire a big stake in a Belgian bank. And also, a number of governments, like Germany, Ireland, Iceland, guaranteeing bank deposits.</p><p>You know, a few years ago all you had to do was breath and you could get a loan. Now you have companies like GE, with a AAA credit rating, that strike a deal with Warren Buffett to inject some cash into the company. And at very favorable rates, I might add, for Warren Buffett. So credit is just basically frozen.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is doubling its auctions of cash to banks. That was announced today. And I saw an interesting quote, T.J. that -- from one analyst who says, it's pretty much all out war. They're pulling out all the stops to try and get borrowers and lenders to meet and do transactions once again. To do what they used to do maybe a year ago. Once we start to see the credit bubble really burst, these are different times we're living in.</p><p>In any case, I know Poppy mentioned oil. Oil is falling. And you're seeing safe havens. A real attraction today. Gold is up about 3.5 percent. As for stocks, 3,000 of them are trading to the downside here, T.J. A hundred of them are higher. So let's end it on a bright note.</p><p>Hartford Financial Services. Let's hear it for an insurance company. Its shares are up 11.5 percent because a German firm, Allianz, is injecting $2.5 billion into Hartford. So Hartford, right now, is one of those 100 stocks that are moving higher today.</p><p>HOLMES: All right. Susan Lisovicz there for us at the New York Stock Exchange. All you had to do was breathe and you could get a loan. That's a heck of a way to put it. You certainly have to do more than that right now.</p><p>We will turn now to -- actually we're going to have our Ali Velshi stand by. We're going to listen in to Richard Fuld. He's the CEO of Lehman Brothers. There testifying at a committee on Capitol Hill. Let's listen in to his opening statement.</p><p>RICHARD FULD, LEHMAN BROTHERS CEO: Today, there is unprecedented turmoil in our capital markets. Nobody, including me, anticipated how the problems that started in the mortgage markets would spread to our credit markets and our banking system and now threaten our entire financial system and our country. Like many other financial institutions, Lehman Brothers got caught in this financial tsunami.</p><p>But I want to be very clear. I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took. Based on the information that we had at the time, I believed that these decisions and actions were both prudent and appropriate. None of us ever gets the opportunity to turn back the clock. But with the benefit of hindsight, would I have done things differently? Yes, I would have.</p><p>As painful as this is for all of the people affected by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, this is not just about Lehman Brothers. These problems are not limited to Wall Street or even main street. This is a crisis for the global economy.</p><p>We live in a world where large investment, large independent U.S. investment banks are now extinct. Where AIG and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are under government control. And where major institutions are being rescued. And where regulators are engaged in a daily struggle to stabilize the financial system.</p><p>In this environment, it's not surprising that the media coverage of Lehman's demise has been right with rumors and inaccuracies. I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight for this committee and to be as helpful as possible in explaining why we ultimately could not prevent a bankruptcy filing. And then I want to respond to your questions.</p><p>I'm a Lehman lifer. I joined as an intern in 1966 and got a full-time job as a commercial paper trader while earning my business degree at night. In 1994, when Lehman Brothers was spun out of American Express as a separate company and I became the CEO, we were a small, domestic bond firm. By 2007, we had built Lehman into a diversified global firm with 28,000 employees.</p><p>I feel a deep, personal connection to those 28,000 great people. Many of whom have dedicated their entire careers to Lehman Brothers. I feel horrible about what has happened to the company and its effects on so many. My colleagues, my shareholders, creditors and my clients. As CEO, I was a significant shareholder and my long-term financial interests were completely aligned with those of all the other shareholders. No one had more incentive to see Lehman Brothers succeed. And because I believed so deeply in the company, I never sold the vast majority of my Lehman Brothers stocks and still owned 10 million when we filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>As I said following the spin off of Lehman Brothers from American Express, our business was almost exclusively in fixed income. We recognized the need for diversification. And over the subsequent 14 years, we built and required significant equity in asset management businesses. We established a presence in 28 countries. We also continually strengthened our risk management infrastructure.</p><p>Lehman Brothers did have a significant presence in the mortgage market. This should not be surprising though. U.S. residential mortgages are an $11 trillion market. More than twice the size of the U.S. Treasury market. And a serious participant in the fixed income businesses had a significant presence in the mortgage market.</p><p>As the environment changed, we took numerous actions to reduce our risk. We strengthened our balance sheet, reduced leverage, improved liquidity, closed our mortgage origination businesses and reduced our exposure to troubled assets. We also raised over $10 billion in new capital.</p><p>We explored converting into a bank holding company. We looked at a wide range of strategic alternatives, including spinning off our commercial real estate assets to our shareholders. We also considered selling part or all of the company. We approached many potential investors, but in a market paralyzed by a crisis in confidence, none of these decisions came to fruition. Indeed, contrary to what you may have read, I never turned down an offer to buy Lehman Brothers.</p><p>Throughout 2008, the SEC and the Federal Reserve conducted regular, and at times daily oversight of our business and our balance sheet. They saw what we saw in realtime as they reviewed our liquidity and our funding, our capital, risk management and our mark to market process.</p><p>As the crisis in confidence spread throughout the capital markets, naked short sellers targeted financial institutions and spread rumors and false information. The impact of this market manipulation became self-fulfilling as short sellers drove down the stock prices of financial firms. The rating agencies lowered their ratings because lower stock prices made it harder to raise capital and reduce financial flexibility. The downgrades in turn caused lenders and counter parties to reduce credit lines and then demand more collateral which increased liquidity pressures.</p><p>At Lehman Brothers, the crisis in confidence that permeated the markets led to an extraordinary run on the bank. In the end, despite all of our efforts, we were overwhelmed. However, what happened to Lehman Brothers could have happened to any financial institution and almost did happen to others. Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch all were trapped in this vicious cycle. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also came under attack. Lehman's demise was brought on by many destabilizing factors. The collapse of the real estate market, naked short attacks, false rumors, widening spreads on credit default swaps, rating agency downgrades, a loss of confidence by clients and counter parties and buyers sitting on the sidelines waiting for an assisted deal.</p><p>Again, this is not just a Lehman Brothers story, it's now an all too familiar tale. It is too late for Lehman Brothers, but the government has now been forced to dramatically change the rules and provide substantial support to other institutions.</p><p>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. And if I can be helpful to this committee in any way to understand how we got here and what our country can do to move forward, I am happy to do so.</p><p>Thank you, sir.</p><p>REP. HENRY WAXMAN, (D) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Fuld.</p><p>Without objection, the chair and the ranking member will control 10 minutes, which they can use or reserve and use at a subsequent time. And hearing no objection, that will be the order.</p><p>The chair will recognize himself.</p><p>Mr. Fuld, the committee -- our economy requested all the documents relating to your salary, bonuses and stock sales. The committee staff put together a chart, which I hope will come up on the screen. This chart will show your compensation for the last eight years. It shows your base salary, your cash bonuses and your stock sales. In 2000, you received over $52 million. In 2001, that increased to $98 million. It dipped for a few years and then, in 2005, you took home $89 million. In 2006, you made a huge stock sale and you received over $100 million in that year alone. Are these figures basically accurate?</p><p>FULD: Sir, if those are the documents that we provided to you, I would assume they are.</p><p>WAXMAN: OK.</p><p>The bottom line is that since 2000, you've taken home more than $480 million. That's almost half a billion dollars. And that's difficult to comprehend for a lot of people. Your company is now bankrupt, our economy is in a state of crisis, but you get to keep $480 million. I have a very basic question for you. Is this fair?</p><p>FULD: Mr. Chairman, your first question was about this slide, are those numbers accurate. They are accurate the way you have put them up on that slide. But I believe your number of cash and salary bonuses are accurate. The option exercises the way you have them portrayed here I believe represent a full option without the strike price. And the only reason I exercised those options was because they came due at maturity. If I had not exercised those, I would have lost them. There was that stock sale.</p><p>WAXMAN: Well, I'll leave the record open for you to give me any changes in that list, but basically, didn't you take home around $400 million to $500 million as the head of Lehman Brothers for the last -- since 2000 to now?</p><p>FULD: The majority of my stock, sir, came -- excuse me, the majority of my compensation came as stock. The vast majority of the stock that I got, I still owned at the point of our filing.</p><p>WAXMAN: the stock is in addition to the numbers that I've indicated because those were your salary and your bonuses. Now, you had bonuses and, in addition to that, you had some stock sales. You've lost some money of the stock that you've received as compensation, which you received as compensation on top of these other figures. So you've been able to pocket close to half a million dollars. And my question to you is, a lot of people ask, is that fair for the CEO of a company that's now bankrupt to have made that kind of money? It's just unimaginable to so many people.</p><p>FULD: I would say to you the 500 number is not accurate. I would say to you that although it's still a large number, I think for the years that you're talking about here, I believe my cash compensation was close to 60 million, which you have indicated here. And I believe the amount that I took out of the company over and above that was, I believe, a little bit less than 250 million. Still a large number though.</p><p>WAXMAN: Still a large amount of money.. You have a $14 million ocean front home in Florida. You have a summer vacation home in Sun Valley, Idaho. Yet you and your wife have an art collection filled with million dollar paintings. Your former president, Joe Gregory (ph), used to travel to work in his own private helicopter. </p><p>I guess people wonder, if you made all this money by taking risks with other people's money, you could have done other things. You had high leverage. Thirty to one and higher. You didn't pay out billions of dollars in dividends and you didn't have to pay out these millions of dollars in dividends and bonuses. You could have saved some of these funds for the lean times, but you didn't.</p><p>Do you think it's fair and do you have any recommendations on fundamental reforms that would bring a new approach to executive compensation, because it seems that the system worked for you, but it didn't seem to work for the rest of the country and the taxpayers who now have to pay up to $700 billion to bail out our economy. We can't continue to have a system where Wall Street executives privatize all the gains and then socialize the losses. Accountability needs to be a two-way street.</p><p>Do you disagree with that? And do you have any recommendations what we ought to be doing in this area? FULD: Mr. Chairman, we had a compensation committee that spent a tremendous amount of time making sure that the interests of the executives and the employees were aligned with shareholders. My employees owned close to 30 percent of our company. And that was because we wanted them to think, act and behave like shareholders. When the company did well, we did well. When the company did not do well, sir, we did not do well.</p><p>WAXMAN: Well, Mr. Fuld, there's seems to be a break down because you did very well when the company was doing well and you did very well when the company wasn't doing well. And now your shareholders, who owned your company, have nothing. I'm going to reserve the balance of my time and we're going to go on to other members.</p><p>Mr. Shays.</p><p>REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS, (R) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: If you'd yield me two minutes.</p><p>Gentlemen, Mr. Fuld, I'd like to ask you first, who appoints the compensation committee?</p><p>FULD: The compensation committee is now appointed by the corporate governance committee of the board.</p><p>SHAYS: But did you have a major role in appointing the compensation committee?</p><p>FULD: I believe I had more of the role in the early or mid-90s. Clearly less of a role these last number of years.</p><p>SHAYS: And then, finally, of the 10 million shares that you had in the company, that's what you have right now, 10 million shares?</p><p>FULD: No. I don't have the exact amount. I think it's closer to 8 million shares. And that does not include the options that expired worthless. Well, actually, they haven't expired. That are still there, with a longer term vesting, but with a much higher strike price than, obviously, where the stock is today.</p><p>SHAYS: Thank you.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Shays.</p><p>I want to recognize Miss Maloney for five minutes.</p><p>REP. CAROLYN MALONEY, (D) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>We are in a financial crisis and we lost four major investment banks in a week and taxpayers have been called upon to assume a potential $1.7 billion in taxpayer liability to backstop our financial institutions. During this hearing today, we've seen a long list of examples of deregulation and we've heard about the net capital rule, which was eliminated so that Lehman and other investment banks could ramp up their leverage to very dangerous, high levels, putting their institutions at risk. And for almost 30 years, this rule kept investment banks from taking on debt more than 12 times the value of the banks investments. Firms were required to stop trading if their debt exceeded that ratio.</p><p>As a result, most investment banks did not take on excessive debt. Yet this report in \"The New York Times,\" and I'd like permission to have it referenced or put in the record . . .</p><p>WAXMAN: Without objection.</p><p>MALONEY: Last Friday called the agency 04 (ph) rule let banks pile up new debt. And many people feel that this was a major cause of the crisis. And they reference a meeting in April of 2004.</p><p>And I'd like to ask you, where you at that meeting? Did you lobby for this change? Why did Lehman want to increase its leverage? And, in hindsight, do you think the SEC rule -- that changing this SEC rule was appropriate for protecting safety and soundness, the stability of our markets and taxpayers' money?</p><p>FULD: Congresswoman, I was not at that meeting, I believe, in 2004. And I do not recall if any other of my people were there.</p><p>I had a chance to, while I was sitting in the waiting room, I saw, I would assume, almost all of the first panel (ph). The information about leverage, I think, has been grossly misunderstood. There are two numbers. One is gross leverage and one is net leverage.</p><p>Gross leverage includes, and excuse me if I get technical. If I get to technical, please stop me. Close to half of our balance sheet, if not more, was what we called the matched book. The matched book was predominantly government securities and agencies that we took on our balance sheet to finance for our clients.</p><p>We were one of the top U.S. Treasury government traders and financiers, meaning financing the U.S. government debt, and we supplied a tremendous amount of liquidity to institutional investors that owned U.S. government debt and agencies. At times, that was as high as 300 to probably more, $300 billion. I heard some of the earlier remarks about, if you lost 3 percent or 4 percent of that, for the match book, those are government securities. So the real number, the effective number is net leverage.</p><p>MALONEY: So did you lobby for this capital rule change? And do you think it contributed to the financial instability and loss of safety and soundness in financial institutions such as your own that allowed this increased leverage?</p><p>FULD: I, myself, did not lobby for the increased leverage.</p><p>MALONEY: Did Lehman Brothers lobby for it?</p><p>FULD: I'm not aware of that. MALONEY: I would like to ask you, now that we have the opportunity of looking back, and we want to look forward on what needs to be done, if you had to give government advice on how we could strengthen the safety and soundness of our institutions and the accountability and transparency that all of us want, what would you recommend? To change the system?</p><p>FULD: In my written testimony, I spoke about the need for additional regulation and new regulation, because when the original regulations were written, it was a very different environment. I believe there were 10 million shares a day traded, and today there are close to 5 billion shares traded.</p><p>The electronic connectivity today, not only within this country, but country to country. Investors today, given that electronic activity, have the right to move their money to the highest-returning asset. And money moves very quickly and freely. So it's not just about regulation within the U.S. I believe this also more of the matrix regulation that is more global in nature.</p><p>I would focus also, on capitol requirements. Capital requirements meaning more capital for less liquid assets, and a more robust understanding of mark to market, which I believe is one of the pillars of the new plan. Mark to market during periods of stress create one set of numbers and, obviously, in a functioning non-credit crisis environment, produce another set of numbers.</p><p>WAXMAN: Your prepared statement, which has these recommendations, are in the record. And we want to move on to other questions. Did you want to add one last point?</p><p>FULD: Yes, please. And the other is something I strongly believe in, is the creation of what I call a master netting system, where all capital market counterparties download, each night, all their transactions to one local spot, first in the U.S., and then eventually, hopefully, make that global. That's about all transactions and trades. It's about positions. It's about capital. It's about leverage -- excuse me.</p><p>And it would give whatever regulators, then in control of that master netting system, a complete view of the financial landscape, the available capital to each and every asset class, flexibility within those asset classes, and vulnerability within those asset classes, and vulnerability of one institution versus the next.</p><p>What I am proposing is clearly expensive, costly, but by comparison to the unprecedented regulation this Congress just passed, it is a fraction and, I believe, money well spent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. Mr. Mica. Five minutes.</p><p>REP. JOHN MICA (R-FL), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>And looking at, first, your comment on Lehman Brothers primarily dealing in some -- for most of its history. FULD: Sir, I apologize. I cannot hear you. I'm sorry.</p><p>MICA: Can you hear me now?</p><p>FULD: Yes, thank you.</p><p>MICA: Again, you -- when you opened your statement, you said that Lehman Brothers was around for, what, 150 years, dealt in some pretty hard assets and some secure investments. You've been around a while. What -- what turned the corner for you to get into some more speculative ventures like subprime and some of the other, again, riskier investments?</p><p>FULD: As I said in my verbal testimony, our participation in the mortgage-related businesses was clearly a natural for us, given our dominance in fixed income. That was something that went back a number of years.</p><p>Even as I listened, as I say, to the panel before me, they correctly pointed out that this was a goal of the government: to provide funding and mortgages to a number of people that typically would not or could not have received a mortgage.</p><p>MICA: One of your big -- well, one of the big package or yours, or the competitor, so to speak, was Fannie Mae, which was deep into this. And you were -- you were dealing in some of the paper, I think, for secondary markets and other securitized mortgage paper to basically package it and make money off it. Is that right?</p><p>FULD: Yes, sir.</p><p>MICA: What was Lehman Brothers' exposure to the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? And what role did their collapse play in precipitating some of your financial troubles? Did it matter?</p><p>FULD: Our exposure to both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was de minimis, sir.</p><p>MICA: OK. But their collapse, did that help precipitate any problems with your firm?</p><p>FULD: It certainly set the stage for an environment, as I talked about loss of confidence and credit-crisis mentality that permeated our market, clearly set -- set the stage for investors losing confidence, counterparties asking for additional collateral. And clearly an environment that lost liquidity, which is the life blood of the capitol market system.</p><p>MICA: I notice -- I notice some questions were asked about your political participation. I pulled Lehman Brothers' contributions -- contributions to federal candidates for the last ten years. Fortunately, I didn't find my name there, but -- not like some of the other members of Congress.</p><p>I added some of this up. It's about $300,000 that you gave to influence members of Congress. I also got your personal, which wasn't much. You probably bet a bit too much on Hillary, too. But this is -- this is pretty much the extent of your financial contributions? Members of Congress to lobby...</p><p>FULD: I -- I believe that that was a result of Lehmans' PAC...</p><p>MICA: Right.</p><p>FULD: ... which was not corporate moneys.</p><p>MICA: Right, right. I'm just telling you. Wait till you hear this one. If you haven't discovered your role, you're the villain today, so you've got to act like the villain here.</p><p>But guess what Fannie Mae did in the same period of time? A hundred and seventy-five million dollars in lobbying contracts over ten years. Does that surprise you? You were out-lobbied. It sounds like, rather than just some greed on Wall Street, we had a little greed in Washington. What would you say to that?</p><p>FULD: I think that's more of a matter for your committee, sir.</p><p>WAXMAN: Gentleman's time has expired.</p><p>MICA: Thank you.</p><p>WAXMAN: We now go to Mr. Cummings.</p><p>REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-MD), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Mr. Fuld, I really appreciate that you began your testimony by taking full responsibility for the company's downfall which occurred on your watch, but there are some concerns that I want to get to. </p><p>As you know, the American taxpayer, many of them, our constituents, just -- we just passed legislation giving $700 billion to rescue Wall Street. One complaint that I've heard over and over again from my constituents is that there seems to be a complete lack of accountability. They see Wall Street executives like you walking away with millions of dollars.</p><p>It was very interesting. When you were talking about the chart that Mr. Waxman was -- showed you on the board, you said that it was inaccurate. But I'm going to discount it for you. And sort of $448 million over eight years. Let's say 350. How about that, 350? Is that OK? Can we discount it a little bit? You said it was not accurate. What would you say is accurate?</p><p>FULD: I'd say that's closer, sir.</p><p>CUMMINGS: OK. I want to ask you about one of the e-mails obtained by the committee. On June 9, 2008, a former top Lehman executive -- can you hear me OK?</p><p>FULD: Yes, sir. CUMMINGS: Benoit Gangelon (ph) sent an e-mail to Hugh McGee, who was the global head of investment banking at Lehman. The e-mail says that many bankers has been calling in the last few days, and the mood has become truly awful. It warns that, and I -- quote -- \"all of the hard work we have put in could unravel very quickly,\" end of quote.</p><p>And it offers the following advice. It says, \"Some senior managers have to be much less arrogant and internally admit that major mistakes have been made. We can't continue to say we are great and the market doesn't understand.\" End of quote.</p><p>Mr. McGee forwarded this e-mail to you on the same day and explained that it was representative -- representative of many others. When you read the e-mail -- and this is interesting -- what was your action -- reaction? I'm just curious.</p><p>FULD: Sorry, sir. What was the date? I'm sorry.</p><p>CUMMINGS: That would be June 9, 2008. You remember that e-mail? </p><p>FULD: I do not. I do not recount.</p><p>CUMMINGS: Well, let me -- let me try to refresh your recollection a little bit. Let me tell you what you did, since you don't remember the e-mail. Here's what happened.</p><p>You didn't take any personal responsibility. Instead, three days later, Mr. Fuld, on June 12, you fired Erin Allen [SIC], your chief financial officer, and Joseph Gregory, your chief operating officer. But you know, you stayed on and admitted no mistakes. You were CEO. Why didn't you take responsibility? Like today, you said you took full responsibility. Why didn't you take responsibility for Lehmans' mistakes? Why did you continue to say, quote, \"We are great and the market doesn't understand\"?</p><p>In your testimony today, right here, right now, you continued to deflect personal responsibility. You cite what you call a litany of reasons for Lehmans' bankruptcy. Mr. Fuld, I want you to -- I want to ask you about your personal responsibility, since you've taken it. Do you agree that Lehman took on excessive leverage under your leadership? Please answer yes or no.</p><p>FULD: It's not that easy. I would say to you our leverage at times was higher, but as we entered this difficult market over this last year, we continued to bring our leverage down so that, even at the point, Congressman, on September 10, when we announced our third- quarter results, we had grossly reduced our balance sheet by close to 200 billion, specifically around residential mortgages and commercial real estate and leverage loans.</p><p>CUMMINGS: Mr. Fuld -- Mr. Fuld, I've only got -- I've got about less than a minute. I've got to get this question in. I assume your answer is no? I'm just giving you the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>FULD: At the end of the day, we worked hard. Our leverage was way down. One of the best... CUMMINGS: All right. Let me ask you...</p><p>FULD: Sorry, sir. One of the best leverage ratios on the street, and our Tier 1 capital was one of the highest.</p><p>CUMMINGS: So you feel -- you feel comfortable with that, what you did? Is that right? That's not one of the things that you said your...</p><p>FULD: Yes, sir.</p><p>CUMMINGS: OK, fine. Do you regret spending $10 billion in Lehmans' cash reserves on bonuses, stock dividends and stock buybacks as your firm faced a liquidity crisis? Do you regret that now?</p><p>FULD: I heard some of that while I was in the other room. I think that is a misunderstanding, which I'd like to clear up.</p><p>CUMMINGS: Well, let me go back to -- go ahead. You go ahead. I'm sorry.</p><p>FULD: Because it's important that this committee understands exactly what that was. When I talked about my employees owning close to 30 percent, what's typical of Wall Street is you take a percentage of your revenues, and you pay your people. We asked our employees to take a big percentage of their compensation in stock.</p><p>And so what that 10 billion was -- we had close to 19 billion of revenues -- what most of that 10 billion was, was compensation to our employees that they received in stock with a five-year forward vest. So they didn't get that stock until five years, which aligned our interests, our employees, with the interests of shareholders.</p><p>To avoid dilution, because we took that 10 billion, gave it to the employees in stock, we had to take the 10 billion that they didn't get and go back into the open marketplace and buy back that stock so that we did not dilute our shareholders. And we did it each and every year. From where you sit, it just looks like we spent an extra 10 billion. That is not sir, what we did.</p><p>CUMMINGS: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>WAXMAN: Sounds like, though, to yield myself time here, that you were trying to -- not to dilute the payment to those employees while you were in a liquidity crisis. Wouldn't it have made more sense to use that money to pay off the debts that you were -- that were heavily on your shoulders at that point, and you knew that you were in a difficult situation?</p><p>FULD: At that time, at the end of the year, last year, I didn't believe that we had that problem.</p><p>WAXMAN: You didn't believe that you had a liquidity problem?</p><p>FULD: And we did not have a liquidity problem at the end of last year. We had just completed a record year, none of which, by the way, came from mortgages. We paid our people fairly and what we thought was competitive with the rest of the street.</p><p>WAXMAN: OK. I accept your answer. You didn't think you had a liquidity problem, so you were trying to make sure your employees were fully compensated.</p><p>FULD: Yes, sir.</p><p>WAXMAN: OK, thanks. Mr. Tierney (ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>[Byline: T.J.

HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello to you all.  I'm T.J. Holmes, sitting in today for Tony Harris here in the CNN NEWSROOM.  And once again, the financial crisis is not just exclusive to us here in the U.S.  This is a financial -- a global financial crisis that's once again dominating the news on this Monday, October 6th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      Stocks across the world are tumbling as investors realize that financial rescue plan, you know, that $700 billion plan, is not going to be a quick fix.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      You are in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>      Well, some people are running scared now right now, and they are running from the markets.  Fear is what's driving investors today.  </p><p>      The Dow plunged below 10,000 at midmorning.  That's the first time in four years we have seen that number below 10,000.  Right now, the Dow is down, as you see there, 461 points, 452 points, off about 5 percent for the day.  </p><p>      Now, that pretty much is in line with markets in Europe, as well as Asia.  And most major indices there skidded 4 to 8 percent today.</p><p>      We're keeping an eye on all of this.  </p><p>      Also, we know that President Bush has made some comments, talking about it's going to take some time for that financial plan to work. We're expecting to hear those comments specifically from him as soon as they come into us.  We have a reporter on the story and we'll pass them along to you.  </p><p>      Also, our Susan Lisovicz is keeping an eye on things.  We have our reporters really at the Nasdaq, at the New York Stock Exchange. Also, in New York, our Ali Velshi is.</p><p>      We're going to take you now with Susan Lisovicz, who's keeping an eye on things for us.</p><p>      Susan, hello to you again.  </p><p>      We talk about this confidence is the key right now.  This is really an emotional time for a lot of people.  </p><p>      SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and, you know, fear is something that is often said to be one of the components of stock market trading.  It's fear and greed.  So, fear is a component, panic is something else.  </p><p>      And you know, I'm looking at this note that the chief markets strategist for Edward Jones, Alan Skrainka, sent me.  And it says, \"A financial crisis is a severe disruption in financial markets that spill over to the broader economy.  A financial panic is characterized by intense fear that can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"</p><p>      That's why you see the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department and governments in Europe -- it's bad enough, they don't want it to get any worse.  And what you're seeing is a lot of fear, intense fear.  In some cases, panic, and what it's culminating in today is a ferocious sell-off.</p><p>      We're coming in after the worst week on Wall Street since the aftermath of 9/11.  It was also, T.J., a year ago this week that the Dow hit its all-time high, above 14,000.  Today, before the opening bell, a trader was wearing a Dow 10,000 cap which was passed out during the great bull market of the 1990s.  It was, in fact, in 1999 when that milestone was first reached.</p><p>      But there is a sell-off here.  We saw a sell-off, a massive sell- off overseas.  </p><p>      There are more signs of weakness and a lack of confidence in overseas companies by not only the companies themselves, a lack of confidence in lending to each other, but also by investors, as well as customers.  We saw a halt in trading in Russia, also in Brazil.  And the stark realization here on Wall Street that this bailout, this landmark $700 billion bailout package, is going to take some time to work, if it works.  </p><p>      In the meantime, well, you know, we have clear and undeniable signs that the U.S. economy, the biggest in the world, is decelerating.  And the Fed stepped in again before the open.  As one economist told me today, the Fed is using a bazooka to try to open up lending.  It's also going to start paying interest on commercial bank reserves.  It has the power now because of that bill.</p><p>      One last thing I want to mention.  You're looking at stock prices, but oil prices are something we're also looking at.  Crude right now down more than $4, below $90 a barrel.  And that's another sign of the toll expected because of what we're seeing, a slowdown in business and ultimately consumer spending -- T.J.  </p><p>      HOLMES:  All right.  Susan Lisovicz for us there at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>      Want to turn to Ali Velshi here now, who is watching Wall Street for us as well in New York.  </p><p>      Ali, I guess you just heard Susan there talk about a bazooka.  </p><p>      ALI VELSHI, CNN SR. BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>      HOLMES:  Some of this lingo you all are using today has blown our minds here.  But tell us, the Fed using all kinds of tools is essentially what she's saying, trying to help out.  What is it going to take to calm people down?  Because you talk about that fear and this being an emotional time.  That $700 billion didn't at least -- we know it's coming.  </p><p>      That didn't calm people down.  What will?</p><p>      VELSHI:  Right.  The bailout wasn't a stock market bailout, bottom line.  And that's what it comes down to.</p><p>      What causes people to buy stocks is they think the underlying companies will do well.  So, we had a credit problem, and this $700 billion is meant to address that.  But how does this help Macy's or JCPenney, or a shipping company?  </p><p>      It doesn't necessarily.  It frees up some credit if they were having problems meeting their operating expenses, but how does it make the price of stock go up?  </p><p>      Well, the one thing that makes the price of stocks go up is when people spend money.  And with all the sort of gloom that we've got around particularly unemployment, low home prices, why would they be spending more money?</p><p>      The one piece of interesting news, as Susan said, oil prices are going down.  So that might help you out a little bit.</p><p>      But folks have stopped me, T.J., and saying, you know, \"My portfolio is down 30 percent from the beginning of the year.\"  Well, if you look at the S&amp;P 500, which is one of the broader measures that we use of the stock market, broader than the Dow, it's down 28 and change percent since the beginning of the year.  The Dow itself is down 25 and change percent since the beginning of the year.  </p><p>      So this is to say, if you're looking at your 401(k), look at that, since last October, when we hit our highs, until now.  One year. This is the shape the Dow has taken.  </p><p>      So, that may not make you feel good about where you are right now, T.J., but it should make you understand that you weren't alone and you didn't make independently bad decisions.  So don't feel worse than the market should make you feel.</p><p>      The panic doesn't help you.  If you were diversified, you still got burned, and that happens from time to time in the markets.  </p><p>      They also come back.  And these present buying opportunities for people, T.J.</p><p>      So, all is not lost.  There is something to be said for an orderly sell-off of markets.  It means they come back later.  </p><p>      This isn't panic selling at the moment.  And frankly, for those of us -- those of you watching this, panic doesn't help you.  You've got to make sound decisions.  Gerri's going to tell you a little bit how to make those sound decisions specifically.      They can be made.  You can learn a lot about the markets and make decisions that can at least protect your portfolio from further devastation.  </p><p>      HOLMES:  Yes.  And Ali, we will go right over to Gerri, as you mentioned there.  </p><p>      Gerri Willis standing by for us as well, a member of this CNN money team.</p><p>      And tell us again, what should make people feel better right now, or how can you help yourself feel better by making some good decisions and not, like you say, just grab your money and run right now out of this market?  </p><p>      GERRI WILLIS, CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITOR:  Well, we've seen bear markets before.  This is nothing new.  And if you've been invested in the market with your 401(k) for any period of time, you've been through a bear market, and that's what we're in right now.</p><p>      Stocks down 30 percent, 87 percent of mutual funds were in the red for the third quarter.  And this is just what the stock market does.  If you don't have the stomach for this, maybe you shouldn't be invested at all.</p><p>      The basic steps that you want to take right now, understand what you're invested in.  What is it that you own?</p><p>      Look at your 401(k).  Look at the mutual funds that you own.  Go to morningstar.com, plug those tickers in, see what individual holdings are in those mutual funds so you understand what it is you own.  </p><p>      Also, pay down your credit cards.  If you want a guaranteed rate of return these days, about the only way to get it is to pay off high interest rate debt.  That's absolutely an essential and one thing I know a lot of people are already thinking about.  All you have to do is look at the major economic indicators right now.</p><p>      You know, we've had too much debt in this society.  It's time to pay some of that down.  It's time to save.</p><p>      Think about putting some money away because, look, at the end of the day, I believe that the biggest threat to you right now isn't the stock market, particularly if you're years from retirement.  You've got lots of time to make that up.</p><p>      The biggest threat to you right now is what's going on with jobs and the economy.  You have to make sure you have some emergency savings on the side so that if worse comes to worse, you can pull on your savings rather than having a financial problem that dogs you for years.  </p><p>      So, calm down, take a breath.  This is a bear market.  We've seen it before, we've been through it before.        Stocks go down as well as up, as most investors know.  You just have to ignore your emotions here, try to hold them at bay, and really look at where you sit in this market.</p><p>      Also, understand where your money is.  What accounts do you have? What kind of bank accounts do you have?  Where are they?  Where is the money?</p><p>      You really need to take stock right now, understand what it is you do own -- T.J.</p><p>      HOLMES:  I know that's tough for people to set those emotions aside when they see themselves losing money they've been saving over the years.  But you're right, it might be time to make a move, but don't do anything rash and erratic.  Stop and think it through, and you will be just fine.  </p><p>      Gerri Willis, thank you so much.  </p><p>      WILLIS:  That's right, T.J.</p><p>      HOLMES:  Yes.</p><p>      We want to remind our viewers, again, we're keeping an eye on the markets.  We'll keep that box up throughout the show.  Keeping an eye, down 450 points now at the Dow at this point.</p><p>      Also want to let you know that we are keeping an eye out for comments President Bush made just a short time ago about the economy. A live picture here of Air Force One.  This is at the airport in San Antonio.  The President in Texas right now.  </p><p>      Made some comments about the economy, certainly saying it's going to take a while for that financial package to kick in and start to work.  It's not going to be a quick fix, which we certainly knew.  But as soon as we get those comments, we will turn those around and pass those along to you.  </p><p>      Also, we've been checking in with our financial reporters in New York, over at the New York Stock Exchange.  Also, we have our Poppy Harlow at the Nasdaq.  We're going to check in with her.  That important index as well down today.  And also, the volatility index, giving us a gauge of how people feel right now about the economy, it's not doing so well either.  </p><p>      Also, let's turn now to Washington, where Congress is searching for the fall guy in this whole financial crisis, possibly.  Of course, that $700 billion bailout bill that lawmakers did pass, a lot of them still didn't like it.  Some of them said outright that they hated the bill even though they had to vote for it.  </p><p>      But Lehman Brothers CEO, Richard Fuld, is first to feel the heat today.  These are live pictures of the hearing going on right now. This is the House Government Oversight Committee having a hearing.  </p><p>      Congressman Waxman of California, who is the chair of this committee, says he wants to know what went wrong and who should be held accountable for this entire mess.  Lehman, of course, that 158- year-old company, a prestigious Wall Street investment firm, collapsed three weeks ago.  Well, tomorrow, Waxman's committee will question execs from the insurance giant AIG.  </p><p>      Well, you can follow the markets and get up-to-the-minute news on the financial crisis on our Web site any time you want to.  Just log on CNNMoney.com.  That is your place to be.</p><p>      All right.  Less than a month now, can you believe it?  Twenty- nine days and counting until the presidential election.  The candidates certainly revving up the rhetoric.  And it's right on time. We see this around election time, about a month out, every time around.  </p><p>      There you see Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin.  She was touting her running mate, John McCain, as the best person to handle both the wars and the economy.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  John McCain is the only man in this race who will solve our economic crisis and not exploit it.  And he's the only man in this race with a plan that will actually help our working families and cut your taxes and get our economy back on track.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      He's the only man in this race who talks about the wars that America is fighting, and he isn't afraid to use the word \"victory.\"  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      HOLMES:  Meanwhile, John McCain, he's on the trail in New Mexico, holding a rally later today in Albuquerque.  After that, he's heading to Nashville.  He's got a little something to do there tomorrow night -- the second presidential debate, which, of course, you'll e watching right here on CNN.  </p><p>      Barack Obama, he's also prepping for the debate.  After rallying supporters in Asheville, North Carolina, yesterday, Obama did take some time out this morning to call into the \"Tom Joyner Radio Show.\" He accused the McCain campaign of using attacks to avoid addressing the issues.</p><p>      (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>      SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're going to talk about the things that matter to the American people.  The last couple of days, while Senator McCain's campaign has been engaging in the low road, we've been talking about health care and how we can make sure that every single American can get health care.  We're going to talk about how we put people back to work and create jobs in the new energy sector.        You know, those are going to be the topics that we think the American people want to hear about.  And that's what I'm going to talk about during the debate.  </p><p>      (END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>      HOLMES:  Well, his vice presidential running mate, Joe Biden, has canceled his campaign appearances for today and tomorrow because of a death in the family.  Biden's mother-in-law died yesterday after a long illness.  The funeral and private burial will take place tomorrow in Pennsylvania.  </p><p>      So what can we expect during debate tonight, round two with John McCain and Barack Obama?  Our senior political analyst, Bill Schneider, is live for us from Nashville with a preview of tomorrow night's match-up.</p><p>      And this is a different kind of match-up, certainly, a different format.  They're not just going to be standing up there and listening to a moderate toss some questions at them.  This one is going to be a little different.  </p><p>      WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes, this is a town hall format.  There will be voters on the stage asking questions, along with the moderator.  Those voters are carefully selected, they're uncommitted voters, they haven't made up their minds.  </p><p>      They are unlikely to want to hear negative personal attacks. What they're likely to want to hear -- in fact, demand to hear -- is what each candidate is going to do about the economy, because those economic fears and concerns have been rising very, very rapidly.  </p><p>      HOLMES:  Right.  And like you said, it's on everybody's mind. Certainly we're talking about it today.  It's dominating all the news.</p><p>      So how do people feel these days, though we've been asking questions of them, those voters?  How are they feeling right now about this economy and where it's going?  </p><p>      SCHNEIDER:  Very fearful.  We asked the question just this weekend of voters around the country, and the question described the Great Depression of the 1930s, which a lot of Americans are not old enough to remember.  </p><p>      The question said, \"In the '30s, the U.S. went through a depression in which roughly one of American workers were unemployed, banks failed, and millions of people were temporarily homeless or unable to feed their families.  How likely is it that something like this could happen again now?\"</p><p>      A solid 59 percent of Americans thought it was very likely or somewhat likely that what we are headed for in this country is another Great Depression.  That is a very frightening number.  Just 42 percent believe that it is not likely.  So nearly 60 percent think another Great Depression is likely.        How do they feel about economic conditions in the country today? Just 16 percent describe economic conditions as good, 84 percent says those conditions are, in fact, poor.  </p><p>      How will this affect you, the ordinary American?  Thirty-six percent say they expect this economic crisis to affect them immediately.  Another 19 percent say within the year.  So that's a majority of Americans expect to feel the impact of this economic crisis within the next year.  </p><p>      There's a lot of concern, a lot of anxiety around the country right now.  And this interviewing was done over the weekend, before today's news -- T.J.  </p><p>      HOLMES:  Well, we hate to see those numbers after today's news. And 16 percent in those numbers say the conditions are good.  A lot of people probably wondering, where in the world are those 16 percent, because this economy is affecting everybody.</p><p>      Bill Schneider, thank you so much there in Nashville, where the debate will take place tomorrow night.  </p><p>      And, of course, the presidential candidates, it's their second of three debates.  Tuesday night, make sure you watch it right here, CNN, with the best political team on television.  </p><p>      We will turn back now -- keeping an eye on the financial markets. We've been keeping an eye on the Dow this morning, keeping an eye on that index.  Well, the Nasdaq not faring so well either.  </p><p>      Poppy Harlow, I will come to you.  It's not a matter of asking how are things there, it's just a matter of asking how bad are they.  </p><p>      POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM:  Yes.  Well, at the Nasdaq, they're the worst for the all the major averages.  Worse than the Dow, worse than the S&amp;P.  The Nasdaq is down 5.5 percent right now.  Want to talk about why that is.</p><p>      There's a lot of big tech companies traded here -- Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco.  Some companies all of you out there might be invested in.  They're getting beaten up because when financial institutions fail, when there's a crisis on Wall Street, it affects their business in a big way.  Lehman Brothers, those names, are some of their biggest clients.  </p><p>      Also, you might know this, though.  A lot of regional banks are traded on the Nasdaq, names like Zions.  That might be your bank.  Or names like Fifth Third Bank Corp.</p><p>      Zions is down 5 percent.  That's a big bank in Utah and across the Southwest.  Fifth Third Bank Corp. down 9 percent.  That's big in Indiana and in Michigan.</p><p>      This is not just a Wall Street problem.  This is a Main Street problem.  This is affecting these small banks as well.  That's why you're seeing this index down so much.      And the Nasdaq is down more than 30 percent, T.J., so far this year.  </p><p>      I want to also turn to something else.  That's called the Volatility Index.  It's the VIX.</p><p>      I have it on the board behind me.  It is down.  Take a look at it there.  </p><p>      It's up 19 percent in a single day.  It is over 50 points right now.  In September, it was about 20 points.  That is a huge change.  </p><p>      What the Volatility Index does is it really measures how much people think there is going to be a swing in the markets.  There are massive bets being placed on big swings in the market right now, mostly to the downside.  </p><p>      The reading we're seeing on the VIX today, the highest since, get this, 1989.  People are incredibly worried.  It's a massive, massive jump for that index, T.J.  So that's playing into things a lot.  And it's interesting to see the Nasdaq, these tech companies, these regional banks, feeling the pressure even more than the Dow right now -- T.J.  </p><p>      HOLMES:  All right.  And we know, Poppy -- you stand by there with us.  We know you talked to some traders there today as well. Certainly want to hear what they're talking about.  </p><p>      We want to let our viewers know we're standing by here.  We're waiting to hear from President Bush.  </p><p>      President Bush made some comments today about the economy, certainly talking about that financial package that was put into place just last week by the Congress and signed by the president, a $700 billion package.  Well, it hasn't really made people feel better about the markets.  We still see a drop in all those indices, but here's the president here in Texas about to make comments here about this.  </p><p>      We're just getting this in.  So let's go ahead here and listen in to the president.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      GEORGE. W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  A very illuminating conversation with small business owners here.  We have a car dealer, an automobile repair shop, a restaurateur, two restaurateurs.  And it's clear that these small business owners are dealing with the effects of a credit crunch.  </p><p>      And by that, I mean they're having trouble getting money to be able to continue to either expand their business or to be able to -- for money to help their consumers be able to buy their products.  And it's -- and I told them one of the reasons why I was so strongly for this rescue package was, inherent in the strategy of the rescue package is to free up credit, just to get money moving.  And it's going to take a while.        I signed the bill on -- last week, but it's going to take a while to get in place a program that, one, is effective, and, two, that doesn't waste taxpayers' money.  We don't want to rush into this situation and not have the program be effective.  </p><p>      It's going to take a while to restore confidence in the financial system.  But one thing people can be certain of is that the bill I signed is a big step toward solving this problem.  </p><p>      A lot of the people here in Texas and around the country are not pleased with the government having to take the steps they took.  Their question is, I pay my bills, I pay my mortgage, why are you helping Wall Street?  </p><p>      And the answer is because had we not done anything, people like the folks behind me would be a lot worse off.  We'll make sure as time goes on this doesn't happen again.  In the meantime, we've got to solve the problem.  And that's why people sent me to Washington, D.C. When you see a problem, put a team together and solve it.  </p><p>      And I want to thank you all for your time.  I'm glad to be back here in Texas.  I miss my friends in Texas.  </p><p>      I am -- people say, \"You looking forward to coming home?\"  Yes, I'm looking forward to living here, but in the meantime, it looks like I'm going to have a lot of work to do between today and when the new president takes office.  But Laura and I are glad to be with our friends.</p><p>      And thank you for your time.  Thank you all very much.</p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      HOLMES:  The president saying there he's not going to be able to vacation his way out of his job.  He has work to do in Washington, certainly with this financial mess.  </p><p>      Listening to the president there talking about -- really echoing some of those sentiments, a lot of things we heard leading up to that whole $700 billion package.  It's bad now, but you can imagine, it's going to worse if we don't have this package.  Also talking about it's going to take a while, don't want to rush into things, going to take a while to restore confidence.  </p><p>      Well, Kathleen Koch standing by for us at the White House now.  </p><p>      Kathleen, I don't know.  A lot of the people were saying, why do we have to rush into getting this bill passed?  Lawmakers said we needed to.  Now that it's passed, the president saying we need to take our time here and do it right.  </p><p>      I guess is that the new theme now, now we need to slow things down?  </p><p>      KATHLEEN KOCH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, T.J., the White House clearly -- though they now have the authority, the administration has the authority to buy these bad mortgages and other failed assets from these banks, clearly they have to set up a system to make it happen. And the President is -- and the treasury secretary have been very clear on that point, that it is -- it's not the kind of thing that happens overnight.  </p><p>      They've never done this sort of thing before.  And again, you want to do it right, you want to do it with proper oversight.  So I don't think any in Congress either would take issue with that, with the president saying we are going to take some time.</p><p>      I think a lot of people have some questions about, well, hey, what's happening with the market now?  We thought we passed this bailout package on -- this rescue plan on Friday, and this would bring calm and stability to the markets.  And certainly that was something that the administration had hoped would occur as well.  </p><p>      When I reached out to the deputy press secretary, Tony Fratto, to see what the administration thought about the plunge in U.S. markets, and obviously also the plunge overseas, he said that they don't comment on daily market activity.  But commenting on what's happening overseas, Fratto did point out that -- he said the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, other government agencies, are working with their counterparts overseas to try to bring some stability to the global financial crisis.  And he said that the administration is \"confident\" that sustained attention to the root causes of the crisis will eventually bring that stability and confidence.</p><p>      But right now, T.J., it appears there's not a lot that anyone can do to stop the markets from doing what they want.  And right now it's plunged.  </p><p>      HOLMES:  And that is what they're doing, some 477 points down now.  </p><p>      Kathleen Koch for us at the White House.</p><p>      Kathleen, thank you so much.  </p><p>      KOCH:  You bet.</p><p>      HOLMES:  We'll also be looking into -- the Supreme Court coming up next.  They are back in session today.  What will the impact of the election have on that court?  We'll ask our senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin.  He's coming up next.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>      HOLMES:  Well, it is issue #1 right there on the campaign trail. And right there what you're seeing, 472 points down, the Dow.  The Nasdaq also down some 5 percent today.  World markets tanked overnight.  We're just seeing a lack of confidence right now in the markets despite that $700 billion bailout package that is in place now here in the U.S.  </p><p>      We are keeping an eye on all things economy related for you today.  </p><p>      Also want to turn now back to something else going on.  The Supreme Court, they're back in session today.  And certainly some major news being made out of there.  One in particular about the case of Troy Davis.  You may remember this name.  He was on death row for a long time here in the state of Georgia, actually.  </p><p>      Kelli Arena is there at the Supreme Court.</p><p>      What has been the movement, or what is the news on this particular case?  </p><p>      KELLI ARENA, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as you said, Troy Davis has been on death row there in Georgia since 1993.  He was convicted of killing an off-duty police officer there in Savannah.  </p><p>      There have been some questions regarding that case of whether or not witness testimony was indeed reliable.  After several witnesses had testified that he was indeed the person who shot and killed that police officer, they recanted that testimony.  Of course, Mr. Davis has claimed that he was innocent all along, and so there's been a large spotlight on that case.</p><p>      What the Supreme Court decided -- was supposed to decide on that case today, whether or not they were going to consider that appeal or not.  Earlier, our guidance was that they had passed on that.  But I want to clarify and make sure that we get this correct.</p><p>      What the Supreme Court has done is nothing yet.  What they're going to take this up on Friday instead.  So Troy Davis still has a chance that his case could be heard before the Supreme Court.  </p><p>      He was supposed to be executed just a couple of weeks ago.  That execution was stayed, obviously, while both sides are waiting for the courts to decide.  So we should get a definitive answer on whether or not the Supreme Court justices will hear his appeal on Friday.  And we did not get proper guidance earlier.  I want to make sure our viewers know, Friday is the day.  </p><p>      HOLMES:  Friday is the day, so he still has a chance for the Supreme Court to take..  </p><p>      ARENA:  He still has a chance, absolutely.  </p><p>      HOLMES:  ... up his case.</p><p>      ARENA:  A very controversial case.</p><p>      HOLMES:  OK.  OK.  Friday is the day.</p><p>      Kelli Arena, thank you so much for that.  </p><p>      ARENA:  You're welcome.</p><p>      HOLMES:  And of course the first Monday in October, we see the Supreme Court beginning that new term today.        Well, the biggest decision of the year though may come Election Day.  </p><p>      Our senior legal correspondent, Jeffrey Toobin, the author of the book \"The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court,\" so he knows a little bit about what's happening up there.</p><p>      Jeff joins me now from New York.</p><p>      Jeff, a lot of things going on out there on the campaign trail. You know, usually, the Supreme Court is at least a part of the back and forth in a debate during an election time.  Well, here we are, they're back in the news.  They're starting their session today.</p><p>      So will voters now stop and think, wait a minute, how could this change the makeup of this court?  And that's going to be an issue now on the campaign trail for the last month?  </p><p>      JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SR. LEGAL ANALYST:  Well, perhaps they should, but every indication I've seen is that the Supreme Court, yet again, will not be a major issue in this campaign.  The economy has just swamped everything.  But if people want to think about what the impact of the next president is going to be, the Supreme Court almost certainly will be the 44th president's perhaps most important legacy.  </p><p>      The court now is divided -- four very conservative justices, four liberal justices, Anthony Kennedy in the middle -- deciding case after case.  Three of those liberals are likely to resign in the next few years, so the next president may have the opportunity to move the court way to the right or keep it more or less the way it is.  </p><p>      HOLMES:  OK.  Well, again, you say you never see this.  I guess, what would it take?  I guess -- and what do they have, I guess, on their schedule for this particular session?  Is there any particular case that will certainly jump out at people?  And then, again, like you say, voters are really not going to make this that big of a deal. But still, what could possibly get voter's attention.  </p><p>      TOOBIN:  Well, certainly the Troy Davis case is the big case at the moment.  And there's a very interesting legal issue in that case. You'd think it would have been resolved by now, but here it is.  Is it constitutional to execute an innocent person?  The Supreme Court has never answered that question.  And this case may present it if they decide to take it up.</p><p>      Another, not so important but actually interesting kind of case, is the Federal Communications Commission has levied fines against television (ph) networks for stray expletives.  Remember, Cher said some things she shouldn't have said.  And Bono said some things.  Can you fine a network for expletives that they didn't plan or know was going to happen.  </p><p>      Certainly there are going to be more cases about Guantanamo Bay. That issue has been a constant throughout the Bush years.  And always, in the background, abortion and affirmative action likely to come up. If not this year, very soon.        HOLMES: And again, the likelihood, like you said, possible that three of the liberal judges could be stepping down in the next several years.  None of the conservatives, we're going to lose them any time soon.  </p><p>      TOOBIN: Doesn't look that way, although, you know, you never know how people's health is going to go, but you've got -- the older justices on the liberal side and that tends to be the people who leave first.  </p><p>      HOLMES: There it is.  All right, Jeff Toobin.</p><p>      Sir, thank you so much.  Good to see you this morning.  </p><p>      TOOBIN: See you, T.J.</p><p>      HOLMES: Oil prices continue to fall.  That would, you know, normally be good news to people. But the reason the oil prices are falling is anything but good.  CNN.com's Poppy Harlow on our Energy Fix today from New York, from the Nasdaq.  </p><p>      You've been covering all kind of stuff for us.  So what's the word on these oil prices? </p><p>      HARLOW:  Yes, we're here at the Nasdaq because of the volatility in the stock market, but there's a lot of volatility in the oil market, which you would see right downtown from here at the NYMEX. The New York Mercantile Exchange.  Oil is down more than $4 right now. It is right now below $90 a barrel.  We haven't seen that since February.  </p><p>      This would be welcome news, but the reason behind it is not welcoming at all.  We are hugely off of that record high we saw of over $147 a barrel back in July.  That has to do with the fundamental of supply and demand.  Traders selling off their oil contracts because they are concerned that around the world the demand for oil and the products that use oil is not going to be anywhere near where it was this summer.  </p><p>      What that means for you, your gas prices are down for a 19th straight day, $3.50 a gallon right now according to AAA.  But again, it all has to do with that sinking global economy.  It's not just how many cars will run on gasoline, it's the demand for the products that take petroleum, that take oil to make them, T.J.  </p><p>      So some bad news today.  Oil down again.  I guess good news if you have to heat your home and fill your take.  But otherwise, bad fundamentals behind it.</p><p>      HOLMES: The fundamentals.  And, I guess, it's common supply and demand and people -- it's, you know.</p><p>      Poppy Harlow for us there at the Nasdaq.  We appreciate you. Thank you so much.  Keeping an eye on all that stuff for us.</p><p>      We want to turn now back to that $700 billion bailout package. It passed Congress.  No immediate silver bullet, however, as we've been seeing for borrowers.  We will explain why straight ahead.  Stay with us.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>      HOLMES: The Dow Jones Industrial average about 500 points down today.  Ten thousand below that number for the first time in four years.  It's sitting there at about 9,800.  Our Susan Lisovicz, Ali Velshi both keeping an eye on the markets for us today.  There they both are.  Good to see you both.</p><p>      Susan, I am going to start with you.</p><p>      We've still got another three and a half hours to watch this board.  What are we going to be seeing?</p><p>      LISOVICZ:  Well, you know, it's very volatile.  I know Poppy was talking to you earlier about this index.  The fear index.  The volatility index.  It's called the VIX.  And it's at very, very high levels.  It might be at an all-time high.</p><p>      So things are volatile.  A lot of the investors are afraid.  And you can't predict when you have emotions running the market.  But we have seen the market selling off now for a period of time.  We are well into a bear market.  </p><p>      And the headlines today are clearly showing that the distress we're seeing in the U.S. financial market is not limited to this market.  We've seen extraordinary measures occurring today and over the weekend to bolster banking systems overseas.  The German government agreed on a nearly $70 billion bailout of a lender there. A French bank, BNP Paribas, agreed to acquire a big stake in a Belgian bank.  And also, a number of governments, like Germany, Ireland, Iceland, guaranteeing bank deposits.  </p><p>      You know, a few years ago all you had to do was breath and you could get a loan.  Now you have companies like GE, with a AAA credit rating, that strike a deal with Warren Buffett to inject some cash into the company.  And at very favorable rates, I might add, for Warren Buffett.  So credit is just basically frozen.  </p><p>      The Federal Reserve is doubling its auctions of cash to banks. That was announced today. And I saw an interesting quote, T.J. that -- from one analyst who says, it's pretty much all out war.  They're pulling out all the stops to try and get borrowers and lenders to meet and do transactions once again.  To do what they used to do maybe a year ago.  Once we start to see the credit bubble really burst, these are different times we're living in.  </p><p>      In any case, I know Poppy mentioned oil.  Oil is falling.  And you're seeing safe havens.  A real attraction today.  Gold is up about 3.5 percent.  As for stocks, 3,000 of them are trading to the downside here, T.J.  A hundred of them are higher.  So let's end it on a bright note.</p><p>      Hartford Financial Services.  Let's hear it for an insurance company.  Its shares are up 11.5 percent because a German firm, Allianz, is injecting $2.5 billion into Hartford.  So Hartford, right now, is one of those 100 stocks that are moving higher today.  </p><p>      HOLMES: All right.  Susan Lisovicz there for us at the New York Stock Exchange.  All you had to do was breathe and you could get a loan.  That's a heck of a way to put it.  You certainly have to do more than that right now.</p><p>      We will turn now to -- actually we're going to have our Ali Velshi stand by.  We're going to listen in to Richard Fuld.  He's the CEO of Lehman Brothers.  There testifying at a committee on Capitol Hill.  Let's listen in to his opening statement.</p><p>      RICHARD FULD, LEHMAN BROTHERS CEO:  Today, there is unprecedented turmoil in our capital markets.  Nobody, including me, anticipated how the problems that started in the mortgage markets would spread to our credit markets and our banking system and now threaten our entire financial system and our country.  Like many other financial institutions, Lehman Brothers got caught in this financial tsunami.  </p><p>      But I want to be very clear.  I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took.  Based on the information that we had at the time, I believed that these decisions and actions were both prudent and appropriate.  None of us ever gets the opportunity to turn back the clock.  But with the benefit of hindsight, would I have done things differently?  Yes, I would have.  </p><p>      As painful as this is for all of the people affected by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, this is not just about Lehman Brothers. These problems are not limited to Wall Street or even main street. This is a crisis for the global economy.  </p><p>      We live in a world where large investment, large independent U.S. investment banks are now extinct.  Where AIG and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are under government control.  And where major institutions are being rescued.  And where regulators are engaged in a daily struggle to stabilize the financial system.  </p><p>      In this environment, it's not surprising that the media coverage of Lehman's demise has been right with rumors and inaccuracies.  I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight for this committee and to be as helpful as possible in explaining why we ultimately could not prevent a bankruptcy filing.  And then I want to respond to your questions.</p><p>      I'm a Lehman lifer.  I joined as an intern in 1966 and got a full-time job as a commercial paper trader while earning my business degree at night.  In 1994, when Lehman Brothers was spun out of American Express as a separate company and I became the CEO, we were a small, domestic bond firm.  By 2007, we had built Lehman into a diversified global firm with 28,000 employees.</p><p>      I feel a deep, personal connection to those 28,000 great people. Many of whom have dedicated their entire careers to Lehman Brothers. I feel horrible about what has happened to the company and its effects on so many.  My colleagues, my shareholders, creditors and my clients.       As CEO, I was a significant shareholder and my long-term financial interests were completely aligned with those of all the other shareholders.  No one had more incentive to see Lehman Brothers succeed.  And because I believed so deeply in the company, I never sold the vast majority of my Lehman Brothers stocks and still owned 10 million when we filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>      As I said following the spin off of Lehman Brothers from American Express, our business was almost exclusively in fixed income.  We recognized the need for diversification.  And over the subsequent 14 years, we built and required significant equity in asset management businesses.  We established a presence in 28 countries.  We also continually strengthened our risk management infrastructure.  </p><p>Lehman Brothers did have a significant presence in the mortgage market.  This should not be surprising though.  U.S. residential mortgages are an $11 trillion market.  More than twice the size of the U.S. Treasury market.  And a serious participant in the fixed income businesses had a significant presence in the mortgage market.  </p><p>      As the environment changed, we took numerous actions to reduce our risk.  We strengthened our balance sheet, reduced leverage, improved liquidity, closed our mortgage origination businesses and reduced our exposure to troubled assets.  We also raised over $10 billion in new capital.  </p><p>      We explored converting into a bank holding company.  We looked at a wide range of strategic alternatives, including spinning off our commercial real estate assets to our shareholders.  We also considered selling part or all of the company.  We approached many potential investors, but in a market paralyzed by a crisis in confidence, none of these decisions came to fruition.  Indeed, contrary to what you may have read, I never turned down an offer to buy Lehman Brothers.  </p><p>      Throughout 2008, the SEC and the Federal Reserve conducted regular, and at times daily oversight of our business and our balance sheet.  They saw what we saw in realtime as they reviewed our liquidity and our funding, our capital, risk management and our mark to market process.  </p><p>      As the crisis in confidence spread throughout the capital markets, naked short sellers targeted financial institutions and spread rumors and false information.  The impact of this market manipulation became self-fulfilling as short sellers drove down the stock prices of financial firms.  The rating agencies lowered their ratings because lower stock prices made it harder to raise capital and reduce financial flexibility.  The downgrades in turn caused lenders and counter parties to reduce credit lines and then demand more collateral which increased liquidity pressures.  </p><p>      At Lehman Brothers, the crisis in confidence that permeated the markets led to an extraordinary run on the bank.  In the end, despite all of our efforts, we were overwhelmed.  However, what happened to Lehman Brothers could have happened to any financial institution and almost did happen to others.        Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch all were trapped in this vicious cycle.  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also came under attack.  Lehman's demise was brought on by many destabilizing factors.  The collapse of the real estate market, naked short attacks, false rumors, widening spreads on credit default swaps, rating agency downgrades, a loss of confidence by clients and counter parties and buyers sitting on the sidelines waiting for an assisted deal.  </p><p>      Again, this is not just a Lehman Brothers story, it's now an all too familiar tale.  It is too late for Lehman Brothers, but the government has now been forced to dramatically change the rules and provide substantial support to other institutions.  </p><p>      I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. And if I can be helpful to this committee in any way to understand how we got here and what our country can do to move forward, I am happy to do so.  </p><p>      Thank you, sir.  </p><p>      REP. HENRY WAXMAN, (D) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Fuld.  </p><p>      Without objection, the chair and the ranking member will control 10 minutes, which they can use or reserve and use at a subsequent time.  And hearing no objection, that will be the order.</p><p>      The chair will recognize himself.  </p><p>      Mr. Fuld, the committee -- our economy requested all the documents relating to your salary, bonuses and stock sales.  The committee staff put together a chart, which I hope will come up on the screen.  This chart will show your compensation for the last eight years.  It shows your base salary, your cash bonuses and your stock sales.  In 2000, you received over $52 million.  In 2001, that increased to $98 million.  It dipped for a few years and then, in 2005, you took home $89 million.  In 2006, you made a huge stock sale and you received over $100 million in that year alone.  Are these figures basically accurate? </p><p>      FULD: Sir, if those are the documents that we provided to you, I would assume they are.  </p><p>      WAXMAN: OK.  </p><p>      The bottom line is that since 2000, you've taken home more than $480 million.  That's almost half a billion dollars.  And that's difficult to comprehend for a lot of people.  Your company is now bankrupt, our economy is in a state of crisis, but you get to keep $480 million.  I have a very basic question for you.  Is this fair? </p><p>      FULD: Mr. Chairman, your first question was about this slide, are those numbers accurate.  They are accurate the way you have put them up on that slide.  But I believe your number of cash and salary bonuses are accurate.  The option exercises the way you have them portrayed here I believe represent a full option without the strike price.  And the only reason I exercised those options was because they came due at maturity.  If I had not exercised those, I would have lost them.  There was that stock sale.  </p><p>      WAXMAN: Well, I'll leave the record open for you to give me any changes in that list, but basically, didn't you take home around $400 million to $500 million as the head of Lehman Brothers for the last -- since 2000 to now? </p><p>      FULD: The majority of my stock, sir, came -- excuse me, the majority of my compensation came as stock.  The vast majority of the stock that I got, I still owned at the point of our filing.  </p><p>      WAXMAN: the stock is in addition to the numbers that I've indicated because those were your salary and your bonuses.  Now, you had bonuses and, in addition to that, you had some stock sales. You've lost some money of the stock that you've received as compensation, which you received as compensation on top of these other figures.  So you've been able to pocket close to half a million dollars.  And my question to you is, a lot of people ask, is that fair for the CEO of a company that's now bankrupt to have made that kind of money?  It's just unimaginable to so many people.</p><p>      FULD: I would say to you the 500 number is not accurate.  I would say to you that although it's still a large number, I think for the years that you're talking about here, I believe my cash compensation was close to 60 million, which you have indicated here.  And I believe the amount that I took out of the company over and above that was, I believe, a little bit less than 250 million.  Still a large number though.  </p><p>      WAXMAN: Still a large amount of money..  You have a $14 million ocean front home in Florida.  You have a summer vacation home in Sun Valley, Idaho.  Yet you and your wife have an art collection filled with million dollar paintings.  Your former president, Joe Gregory (ph), used to travel to work in his own private helicopter.  </p><p>      I guess people wonder, if you made all this money by taking risks with other people's money, you could have done other things.  You had high leverage.  Thirty to one and higher.  You didn't pay out billions of dollars in dividends and you didn't have to pay out these millions of dollars in dividends and bonuses.  You could have saved some of these funds for the lean times, but you didn't.</p><p>      Do you think it's fair and do you have any recommendations on fundamental reforms that would bring a new approach to executive compensation, because it seems that the system worked for you, but it didn't seem to work for the rest of the country and the taxpayers who now have to pay up to $700 billion to bail out our economy.  We can't continue to have a system where Wall Street executives privatize all the gains and then socialize the losses.  Accountability needs to be a two-way street.  </p><p>      Do you disagree with that?  And do you have any recommendations what we ought to be doing in this area?       FULD: Mr. Chairman, we had a compensation committee that spent a tremendous amount of time making sure that the interests of the executives and the employees were aligned with shareholders.  My employees owned close to 30 percent of our company.  And that was because we wanted them to think, act and behave like shareholders. When the company did well, we did well.  When the company did not do well, sir, we did not do well.  </p><p>      WAXMAN: Well, Mr. Fuld, there's seems to be a break down because you did very well when the company was doing well and you did very well when the company wasn't doing well.  And now your shareholders, who owned your company, have nothing.  I'm going to reserve the balance of my time and we're going to go on to other members.  </p><p>      Mr. Shays.</p><p>      REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS, (R) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: If you'd yield me two minutes.  </p><p>      Gentlemen, Mr. Fuld, I'd like to ask you first, who appoints the compensation committee? </p><p>      FULD: The compensation committee is now appointed by the corporate governance committee of the board.  </p><p>      SHAYS: But did you have a major role in appointing the compensation committee? </p><p>      FULD: I believe I had more of the role in the early or mid-90s. Clearly less of a role these last number of years.  </p><p>      SHAYS: And then, finally, of the 10 million shares that you had in the company, that's what you have right now, 10 million shares? </p><p>      FULD: No.  I don't have the exact amount.  I think it's closer to 8 million shares.  And that does not include the options that expired worthless.  Well, actually, they haven't expired.  That are still there, with a longer term vesting, but with a much higher strike price than, obviously, where the stock is today.  </p><p>      SHAYS: Thank you.  </p><p>      Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Shays.  </p><p>      I want to recognize Miss Maloney for five minutes.</p><p>      REP. CAROLYN MALONEY, (D) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      We are in a financial crisis and we lost four major investment banks in a week and taxpayers have been called upon to assume a potential $1.7 billion in taxpayer liability to backstop our financial institutions.  During this hearing today, we've seen a long list of examples of deregulation and we've heard about the net capital rule, which was eliminated so that Lehman and other investment banks could ramp up their leverage to very dangerous, high levels, putting their institutions at risk.  And for almost 30 years, this rule kept investment banks from taking on debt more than 12 times the value of the banks investments.  Firms were required to stop trading if their debt exceeded that ratio.  </p><p>      As a result, most investment banks did not take on excessive debt.  Yet this report in \"The New York Times,\" and I'd like permission to have it referenced or put in the record . . .</p><p>      WAXMAN: Without objection.</p><p>      MALONEY: Last Friday called the agency 04 (ph) rule let banks pile up new debt.  And many people feel that this was a major cause of the crisis.  And they reference a meeting in April of 2004.  </p><p>      And I'd like to ask you, where you at that meeting?  Did you lobby for this change?  Why did Lehman want to increase its leverage? And, in hindsight, do you think the SEC rule -- that changing this SEC rule was appropriate for protecting safety and soundness, the stability of our markets and taxpayers' money? </p><p>      FULD: Congresswoman, I was not at that meeting, I believe, in 2004.  And I do not recall if any other of my people were there.  </p><p>      I had a chance to, while I was sitting in the waiting room, I saw, I would assume, almost all of the first panel (ph).  The information about leverage, I think, has been grossly misunderstood. There are two numbers.  One is gross leverage and one is net leverage. </p><p>      Gross leverage includes, and excuse me if I get technical.  If I get to technical, please stop me.  Close to half of our balance sheet, if not more, was what we called the matched book.  The matched book was predominantly government securities and agencies that we took on our balance sheet to finance for our clients.  </p><p>      We were one of the top U.S. Treasury government traders and financiers, meaning financing the U.S. government debt, and we supplied a tremendous amount of liquidity to institutional investors that owned U.S. government debt and agencies.  At times, that was as high as 300 to probably more, $300 billion.  I heard some of the earlier remarks about, if you lost 3 percent or 4 percent of that, for the match book, those are government securities.  So the real number, the effective number is net leverage.</p><p>      MALONEY: So did you lobby for this capital rule change?  And do you think it contributed to the financial instability and loss of safety and soundness in financial institutions such as your own that allowed this increased leverage? </p><p>      FULD:  I, myself, did not lobby for the increased leverage.  </p><p>      MALONEY:  Did Lehman Brothers lobby for it? </p><p>      FULD:  I'm not aware of that.        MALONEY:  I would like to ask you, now that we have the opportunity of looking back, and we want to look forward on what needs to be done, if you had to give government advice on how we could strengthen the safety and soundness of our institutions and the accountability and transparency that all of us want, what would you recommend?  To change the system?  </p><p>      FULD:  In my written testimony, I spoke about the need for additional regulation and new regulation, because when the original regulations were written, it was a very different environment.  I believe there were 10 million shares a day traded, and today there are close to 5 billion shares traded.  </p><p>      The electronic connectivity today, not only within this country, but country to country.  Investors today, given that electronic activity, have the right to move their money to the highest-returning asset.  And money moves very quickly and freely.  So it's not just about regulation within the U.S.  I believe this also more of the matrix regulation that is more global in nature.  </p><p>      I would focus also, on capitol requirements.  Capital requirements meaning more capital for less liquid assets, and a more robust understanding of mark to market, which I believe is one of the pillars of the new plan.  Mark to market during periods of stress create one set of numbers and, obviously, in a functioning non-credit crisis environment, produce another set of numbers.  </p><p>      WAXMAN:  Your prepared statement, which has these recommendations, are in the record.  And we want to move on to other questions.  Did you want to add one last point? </p><p>      FULD:  Yes, please.  And the other is something I strongly believe in, is the creation of what I call a master netting system, where all capital market counterparties download, each night, all their transactions to one local spot, first in the U.S., and then eventually, hopefully, make that global.  That's about all transactions and trades.  It's about positions.  It's about capital. It's about leverage -- excuse me.  </p><p>      And it would give whatever regulators, then in control of that master netting system, a complete view of the financial landscape, the available capital to each and every asset class, flexibility within those asset classes, and vulnerability within those asset classes, and vulnerability of one institution versus the next.  </p><p>      What I am proposing is clearly expensive, costly, but by comparison to the unprecedented regulation this Congress just passed, it is a fraction and, I believe, money well spent.  </p><p>      UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.  Mr. Mica.  Five minutes.  </p><p>      REP. JOHN MICA (R-FL), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE:  Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      And looking at, first, your comment on Lehman Brothers primarily dealing in some -- for most of its history.        FULD:  Sir, I apologize.  I cannot hear you.  I'm sorry.</p><p>      MICA:  Can you hear me now?</p><p>      FULD:  Yes, thank you.</p><p>      MICA:  Again, you -- when you opened your statement, you said that Lehman Brothers was around for, what, 150 years, dealt in some pretty hard assets and some secure investments.  You've been around a while.  What -- what turned the corner for you to get into some more speculative ventures like subprime and some of the other, again, riskier investments? </p><p>      FULD:  As I said in my verbal testimony, our participation in the mortgage-related businesses was clearly a natural for us, given our dominance in fixed income.  That was something that went back a number of years.  </p><p>      Even as I listened, as I say, to the panel before me, they correctly pointed out that this was a goal of the government: to provide funding and mortgages to a number of people that typically would not or could not have received a mortgage.  </p><p>      MICA:  One of your big -- well, one of the big package or yours, or the competitor, so to speak, was Fannie Mae, which was deep into this.  And you were -- you were dealing in some of the paper, I think, for secondary markets and other securitized mortgage paper to basically package it and make money off it.  Is that right? </p><p>      FULD:  Yes, sir.  </p><p>      MICA:  What was Lehman Brothers' exposure to the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?  And what role did their collapse play in precipitating some of your financial troubles?  Did it matter?</p><p>      FULD:  Our exposure to both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was de minimis, sir. </p><p>      MICA:  OK.  But their collapse, did that help precipitate any problems with your firm? </p><p>      FULD:  It certainly set the stage for an environment, as I talked about loss of confidence and credit-crisis mentality that permeated our market, clearly set -- set the stage for investors losing confidence, counterparties asking for additional collateral.  And clearly an environment that lost liquidity, which is the life blood of the capitol market system.  </p><p>      MICA:  I notice -- I notice some questions were asked about your political participation.  I pulled Lehman Brothers' contributions -- contributions to federal candidates for the last ten years. Fortunately, I didn't find my name there, but -- not like some of the other members of Congress.  </p><p>      I added some of this up.  It's about $300,000 that you gave to influence members of Congress.  I also got your personal, which wasn't much.  You probably bet a bit too much on Hillary, too.  But this is -- this is pretty much the extent of your financial contributions? Members of Congress to lobby... </p><p>      FULD:  I -- I believe that that was a result of Lehmans' PAC...</p><p>      MICA:  Right.</p><p>      FULD:  ... which was not corporate moneys.  </p><p>      MICA:  Right, right.  I'm just telling you.  Wait till you hear this one.  If you haven't discovered your role, you're the villain today, so you've got to act like the villain here.  </p><p>      But guess what Fannie Mae did in the same period of time?  A hundred and seventy-five million dollars in lobbying contracts over ten years.  Does that surprise you?  You were out-lobbied.  It sounds like, rather than just some greed on Wall Street, we had a little greed in Washington.  What would you say to that? </p><p>      FULD:  I think that's more of a matter for your committee, sir.  </p><p>      WAXMAN:  Gentleman's time has expired.  </p><p>      MICA:  Thank you.</p><p>      WAXMAN:  We now go to Mr. Cummings.  </p><p>      REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-MD), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      Mr. Fuld, I really appreciate that you began your testimony by taking full responsibility for the company's downfall which occurred on your watch, but there are some concerns that I want to get to.  </p><p>      As you know, the American taxpayer, many of them, our constituents, just -- we just passed legislation giving $700 billion to rescue Wall Street.  One complaint that I've heard over and over again from my constituents is that there seems to be a complete lack of accountability.  They see Wall Street executives like you walking away with millions of dollars.  </p><p>      It was very interesting.  When you were talking about the chart that Mr. Waxman was -- showed you on the board, you said that it was inaccurate.  But I'm going to discount it for you.  And sort of $448 million over eight years.  Let's say 350.  How about that, 350?  Is that OK?  Can we discount it a little bit?  You said it was not accurate.  What would you say is accurate? </p><p>      FULD:  I'd say that's closer, sir.  </p><p>      CUMMINGS:  OK.  I want to ask you about one of the e-mails obtained by the committee.  On June 9, 2008, a former top Lehman executive -- can you hear me OK?</p><p>      FULD:  Yes, sir.      CUMMINGS:  Benoit Gangelon (ph) sent an e-mail to Hugh McGee, who was the global head of investment banking at Lehman.  The e-mail says that many bankers has been calling in the last few days, and the mood has become truly awful.  It warns that, and I -- quote --  \"all of the hard work we have put in could unravel very quickly,\" end of quote.  </p><p>      And it offers the following advice.  It says, \"Some senior managers have to be much less arrogant and internally admit that major mistakes have been made.  We can't continue to say we are great and the market doesn't understand.\"  End of quote.  </p><p>      Mr. McGee forwarded this e-mail to you on the same day and explained that it was representative -- representative of many others. When you read the e-mail -- and this is interesting -- what was your action -- reaction?  I'm just curious.</p><p>      FULD:  Sorry, sir.  What was the date?  I'm sorry.</p><p>      CUMMINGS:  That would be June 9, 2008.  You remember that e-mail? </p><p>      FULD:  I do not.  I do not recount.</p><p>      CUMMINGS:  Well, let me -- let me try to refresh your recollection a little bit.  Let me tell you what you did, since you don't remember the e-mail.  Here's what happened.  </p><p>      You didn't take any personal responsibility.  Instead, three days later, Mr. Fuld, on June 12, you fired Erin Allen [SIC], your chief financial officer, and Joseph Gregory, your chief operating officer. But you know, you stayed on and admitted no mistakes.  You were CEO. Why didn't you take responsibility?  Like today, you said you took full responsibility.  Why didn't you take responsibility for Lehmans' mistakes?  Why did you continue to say, quote, \"We are great and the market doesn't understand\"?  </p><p>      In your testimony today, right here, right now, you continued to deflect personal responsibility.  You cite what you call a litany of reasons for Lehmans' bankruptcy.  Mr. Fuld, I want you to -- I want to ask you about your personal responsibility, since you've taken it.  Do you agree that Lehman took on excessive leverage under your leadership?  Please answer yes or no.  </p><p>      FULD:  It's not that easy.  I would say to you our leverage at times was higher, but as we entered this difficult market over this last year, we continued to bring our leverage down so that, even at the point, Congressman, on September 10, when we announced our third- quarter results, we had grossly reduced our balance sheet by close to 200 billion, specifically around residential mortgages and commercial real estate and leverage loans.  </p><p>      CUMMINGS:  Mr. Fuld -- Mr. Fuld, I've only got -- I've got about less than a minute.  I've got to get this question in.  I assume your answer is no?  I'm just giving you the benefit of the doubt.  </p><p>      FULD:  At the end of the day, we worked hard.  Our leverage was way down.  One of the best...      CUMMINGS:  All right.  Let me ask you...</p><p>      FULD:  Sorry, sir.  One of the best leverage ratios on the street, and our Tier 1 capital was one of the highest.  </p><p>      CUMMINGS:  So you feel -- you feel comfortable with that, what you did?  Is that right?  That's not one of the things that you said your...</p><p>      FULD:  Yes, sir.  </p><p>      CUMMINGS:  OK, fine.  Do you regret spending $10 billion in Lehmans' cash reserves on bonuses, stock dividends and stock buybacks as your firm faced a liquidity crisis?  Do you regret that now?</p><p>      FULD:  I heard some of that while I was in the other room.  I think that is a misunderstanding, which I'd like to clear up.  </p><p>      CUMMINGS:  Well, let me go back to -- go ahead.  You go ahead. I'm sorry.</p><p>      FULD:  Because it's important that this committee understands exactly what that was.  When I talked about my employees owning close to 30 percent, what's typical of Wall Street is you take a percentage of your revenues, and you pay your people.  We asked our employees to take a big percentage of their compensation in stock.  </p><p>      And so what that 10 billion was -- we had close to 19 billion of revenues -- what most of that 10 billion was, was compensation to our employees that they received in stock with a five-year forward vest. So they didn't get that stock until five years, which aligned our interests, our employees, with the interests of shareholders.  </p><p>      To avoid dilution, because we took that 10 billion, gave it to the employees in stock, we had to take the 10 billion that they didn't get and go back into the open marketplace and buy back that stock so that we did not dilute our shareholders.  And we did it each and every year.  From where you sit, it just looks like we spent an extra 10 billion.  That is not sir, what we did. </p><p>      CUMMINGS:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      WAXMAN:  Sounds like, though, to yield myself time here, that you were trying to -- not to dilute the payment to those employees while you were in a liquidity crisis.  Wouldn't it have made more sense to use that money to pay off the debts that you were -- that were heavily on your shoulders at that point, and you knew that you were in a difficult situation? </p><p>      FULD:  At that time, at the end of the year, last year, I didn't believe that we had that problem.  </p><p>      WAXMAN:  You didn't believe that you had a liquidity problem? </p><p>      FULD:  And we did not have a liquidity problem at the end of last year.  We had just completed a record year, none of which, by the way, came from mortgages.  We paid our people fairly and what we thought was competitive with the rest of the street.  </p><p>      WAXMAN:  OK.  I accept your answer.  You didn't think you had a liquidity problem, so you were trying to make sure your employees were fully compensated.  </p><p>      FULD:  Yes, sir.  </p><p>      WAXMAN:  OK, thanks.  Mr. Tierney (ph).</p><p>      UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p> [Byline: T.J.

HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello to you all.  I'm T.J. Holmes, sitting in today for Tony Harris here in the CNN NEWSROOM.  And once again, the financial crisis is not just exclusive to us here in the U.S.  This is a financial -- a global financial crisis that's once again dominating the news on this Monday, October 6th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks across the world are tumbling as investors realize that financial rescue plan, you know, that $700 billion plan, is not going to be a quick fix.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You are in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>Well, some people are running scared now right now, and they are running from the markets.  Fear is what's driving investors today.  </p><p>The Dow plunged below 10,000 at midmorning.  That's the first time in four years we have seen that number below 10,000.  Right now, the Dow is down, as you see there, 461 points, 452 points, off about 5 percent for the day.  </p><p>Now, that pretty much is in line with markets in Europe, as well as Asia.  And most major indices there skidded 4 to 8 percent today.</p><p>We're keeping an eye on all of this.  </p><p>Also, we know that President Bush has made some comments, talking about it's going to take some time for that financial plan to work. We're expecting to hear those comments specifically from him as soon as they come into us.  We have a reporter on the story and we'll pass them along to you.  </p><p>Also, our Susan Lisovicz is keeping an eye on things.  We have our reporters really at the Nasdaq, at the New York Stock Exchange. Also, in New York, our Ali Velshi is.</p><p>We're going to take you now with Susan Lisovicz, who's keeping an eye on things for us.</p><p>Susan, hello to you again.  </p><p>We talk about this confidence is the key right now.  This is really an emotional time for a lot of people.  </p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, and, you know, fear is something that is often said to be one of the components of stock market trading.  It's fear and greed.  So, fear is a component, panic is something else.  </p><p>And you know, I'm looking at this note that the chief markets strategist for Edward Jones, Alan Skrainka, sent me.  And it says, \"A financial crisis is a severe disruption in financial markets that spill over to the broader economy.  A financial panic is characterized by intense fear that can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"</p><p>That's why you see the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department and governments in Europe -- it's bad enough, they don't want it to get any worse.  And what you're seeing is a lot of fear, intense fear.  In some cases, panic, and what it's culminating in today is a ferocious sell-off.</p><p>We're coming in after the worst week on Wall Street since the aftermath of 9/11.  It was also, T.J., a year ago this week that the Dow hit its all-time high, above 14,000.  Today, before the opening bell, a trader was wearing a Dow 10,000 cap which was passed out during the great bull market of the 1990s.  It was, in fact, in 1999 when that milestone was first reached.</p><p>But there is a sell-off here.  We saw a sell-off, a massive sell- off overseas.  </p><p>There are more signs of weakness and a lack of confidence in overseas companies by not only the companies themselves, a lack of confidence in lending to each other, but also by investors, as well as customers.  We saw a halt in trading in Russia, also in Brazil.  And the stark realization here on Wall Street that this bailout, this landmark $700 billion bailout package, is going to take some time to work, if it works.  </p><p>In the meantime, well, you know, we have clear and undeniable signs that the U.S. economy, the biggest in the world, is decelerating.  And the Fed stepped in again before the open.  As one economist told me today, the Fed is using a bazooka to try to open up lending.  It's also going to start paying interest on commercial bank reserves.  It has the power now because of that bill.</p><p>One last thing I want to mention.  You're looking at stock prices, but oil prices are something we're also looking at.  Crude right now down more than $4, below $90 a barrel.  And that's another sign of the toll expected because of what we're seeing, a slowdown in business and ultimately consumer spending -- T.J.  </p><p>HOLMES:  All right.  Susan Lisovicz for us there at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>Want to turn to Ali Velshi here now, who is watching Wall Street for us as well in New York.  </p><p>Ali, I guess you just heard Susan there talk about a bazooka.  </p><p>ALI VELSHI, CNN SR. BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>HOLMES:  Some of this lingo you all are using today has blown our minds here.  But tell us, the Fed using all kinds of tools is essentially what she's saying, trying to help out.  What is it going to take to calm people down?  Because you talk about that fear and this being an emotional time.  That $700 billion didn't at least -- we know it's coming.  </p><p>That didn't calm people down.  What will?</p><p>VELSHI:  Right.  The bailout wasn't a stock market bailout, bottom line.  And that's what it comes down to.</p><p>What causes people to buy stocks is they think the underlying companies will do well.  So, we had a credit problem, and this $700 billion is meant to address that.  But how does this help Macy's or JCPenney, or a shipping company?  </p><p>It doesn't necessarily.  It frees up some credit if they were having problems meeting their operating expenses, but how does it make the price of stock go up?  </p><p>Well, the one thing that makes the price of stocks go up is when people spend money.  And with all the sort of gloom that we've got around particularly unemployment, low home prices, why would they be spending more money?</p><p>The one piece of interesting news, as Susan said, oil prices are going down.  So that might help you out a little bit.</p><p>But folks have stopped me, T.J., and saying, you know, \"My portfolio is down 30 percent from the beginning of the year.\"  Well, if you look at the S&amp;P 500, which is one of the broader measures that we use of the stock market, broader than the Dow, it's down 28 and change percent since the beginning of the year.  The Dow itself is down 25 and change percent since the beginning of the year.  </p><p>So this is to say, if you're looking at your 401(k), look at that, since last October, when we hit our highs, until now.  One year. This is the shape the Dow has taken.  </p><p>So, that may not make you feel good about where you are right now, T.J., but it should make you understand that you weren't alone and you didn't make independently bad decisions.  So don't feel worse than the market should make you feel.</p><p>The panic doesn't help you.  If you were diversified, you still got burned, and that happens from time to time in the markets.  </p><p>They also come back.  And these present buying opportunities for people, T.J.</p><p>So, all is not lost.  There is something to be said for an orderly sell-off of markets.  It means they come back later.  </p><p>This isn't panic selling at the moment.  And frankly, for those of us -- those of you watching this, panic doesn't help you.  You've got to make sound decisions.  Gerri's going to tell you a little bit how to make those sound decisions specifically.      They can be made.  You can learn a lot about the markets and make decisions that can at least protect your portfolio from further devastation.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Yes.  And Ali, we will go right over to Gerri, as you mentioned there.  </p><p>Gerri Willis standing by for us as well, a member of this CNN money team.</p><p>And tell us again, what should make people feel better right now, or how can you help yourself feel better by making some good decisions and not, like you say, just grab your money and run right now out of this market?  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITOR:  Well, we've seen bear markets before.  This is nothing new.  And if you've been invested in the market with your 401(k) for any period of time, you've been through a bear market, and that's what we're in right now.</p><p>Stocks down 30 percent, 87 percent of mutual funds were in the red for the third quarter.  And this is just what the stock market does.  If you don't have the stomach for this, maybe you shouldn't be invested at all.</p><p>The basic steps that you want to take right now, understand what you're invested in.  What is it that you own?</p><p>Look at your 401(k).  Look at the mutual funds that you own.  Go to morningstar.com, plug those tickers in, see what individual holdings are in those mutual funds so you understand what it is you own.  </p><p>Also, pay down your credit cards.  If you want a guaranteed rate of return these days, about the only way to get it is to pay off high interest rate debt.  That's absolutely an essential and one thing I know a lot of people are already thinking about.  All you have to do is look at the major economic indicators right now.</p><p>You know, we've had too much debt in this society.  It's time to pay some of that down.  It's time to save.</p><p>Think about putting some money away because, look, at the end of the day, I believe that the biggest threat to you right now isn't the stock market, particularly if you're years from retirement.  You've got lots of time to make that up.</p><p>The biggest threat to you right now is what's going on with jobs and the economy.  You have to make sure you have some emergency savings on the side so that if worse comes to worse, you can pull on your savings rather than having a financial problem that dogs you for years.  </p><p>So, calm down, take a breath.  This is a bear market.  We've seen it before, we've been through it before.        Stocks go down as well as up, as most investors know.  You just have to ignore your emotions here, try to hold them at bay, and really look at where you sit in this market.</p><p>Also, understand where your money is.  What accounts do you have? What kind of bank accounts do you have?  Where are they?  Where is the money?</p><p>You really need to take stock right now, understand what it is you do own -- T.J.</p><p>HOLMES:  I know that's tough for people to set those emotions aside when they see themselves losing money they've been saving over the years.  But you're right, it might be time to make a move, but don't do anything rash and erratic.  Stop and think it through, and you will be just fine.  </p><p>Gerri Willis, thank you so much.  </p><p>WILLIS:  That's right, T.J.</p><p>HOLMES:  Yes.</p><p>We want to remind our viewers, again, we're keeping an eye on the markets.  We'll keep that box up throughout the show.  Keeping an eye, down 450 points now at the Dow at this point.</p><p>Also want to let you know that we are keeping an eye out for comments President Bush made just a short time ago about the economy. A live picture here of Air Force One.  This is at the airport in San Antonio.  The President in Texas right now.  </p><p>Made some comments about the economy, certainly saying it's going to take a while for that financial package to kick in and start to work.  It's not going to be a quick fix, which we certainly knew.  But as soon as we get those comments, we will turn those around and pass those along to you.  </p><p>Also, we've been checking in with our financial reporters in New York, over at the New York Stock Exchange.  Also, we have our Poppy Harlow at the Nasdaq.  We're going to check in with her.  That important index as well down today.  And also, the volatility index, giving us a gauge of how people feel right now about the economy, it's not doing so well either.  </p><p>Also, let's turn now to Washington, where Congress is searching for the fall guy in this whole financial crisis, possibly.  Of course, that $700 billion bailout bill that lawmakers did pass, a lot of them still didn't like it.  Some of them said outright that they hated the bill even though they had to vote for it.  </p><p>But Lehman Brothers CEO, Richard Fuld, is first to feel the heat today.  These are live pictures of the hearing going on right now. This is the House Government Oversight Committee having a hearing.  </p><p>Congressman Waxman of California, who is the chair of this committee, says he wants to know what went wrong and who should be held accountable for this entire mess.  Lehman, of course, that 158- year-old company, a prestigious Wall Street investment firm, collapsed three weeks ago.  Well, tomorrow, Waxman's committee will question execs from the insurance giant AIG.  </p><p>Well, you can follow the markets and get up-to-the-minute news on the financial crisis on our Web site any time you want to.  Just log on CNNMoney.com.  That is your place to be.</p><p>All right.  Less than a month now, can you believe it?  Twenty- nine days and counting until the presidential election.  The candidates certainly revving up the rhetoric.  And it's right on time. We see this around election time, about a month out, every time around.  </p><p>There you see Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin.  She was touting her running mate, John McCain, as the best person to handle both the wars and the economy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  John McCain is the only man in this race who will solve our economic crisis and not exploit it.  And he's the only man in this race with a plan that will actually help our working families and cut your taxes and get our economy back on track.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>He's the only man in this race who talks about the wars that America is fighting, and he isn't afraid to use the word \"victory.\"  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES:  Meanwhile, John McCain, he's on the trail in New Mexico, holding a rally later today in Albuquerque.  After that, he's heading to Nashville.  He's got a little something to do there tomorrow night -- the second presidential debate, which, of course, you'll e watching right here on CNN.  </p><p>Barack Obama, he's also prepping for the debate.  After rallying supporters in Asheville, North Carolina, yesterday, Obama did take some time out this morning to call into the \"Tom Joyner Radio Show.\" He accused the McCain campaign of using attacks to avoid addressing the issues.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're going to talk about the things that matter to the American people.  The last couple of days, while Senator McCain's campaign has been engaging in the low road, we've been talking about health care and how we can make sure that every single American can get health care.  We're going to talk about how we put people back to work and create jobs in the new energy sector.        You know, those are going to be the topics that we think the American people want to hear about.  And that's what I'm going to talk about during the debate.  </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES:  Well, his vice presidential running mate, Joe Biden, has canceled his campaign appearances for today and tomorrow because of a death in the family.  Biden's mother-in-law died yesterday after a long illness.  The funeral and private burial will take place tomorrow in Pennsylvania.  </p><p>So what can we expect during debate tonight, round two with John McCain and Barack Obama?  Our senior political analyst, Bill Schneider, is live for us from Nashville with a preview of tomorrow night's match-up.</p><p>And this is a different kind of match-up, certainly, a different format.  They're not just going to be standing up there and listening to a moderate toss some questions at them.  This one is going to be a little different.  </p><p>WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes, this is a town hall format.  There will be voters on the stage asking questions, along with the moderator.  Those voters are carefully selected, they're uncommitted voters, they haven't made up their minds.  </p><p>They are unlikely to want to hear negative personal attacks. What they're likely to want to hear -- in fact, demand to hear -- is what each candidate is going to do about the economy, because those economic fears and concerns have been rising very, very rapidly.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Right.  And like you said, it's on everybody's mind. Certainly we're talking about it today.  It's dominating all the news.</p><p>So how do people feel these days, though we've been asking questions of them, those voters?  How are they feeling right now about this economy and where it's going?  </p><p>SCHNEIDER:  Very fearful.  We asked the question just this weekend of voters around the country, and the question described the Great Depression of the 1930s, which a lot of Americans are not old enough to remember.  </p><p>The question said, \"In the '30s, the U.S. went through a depression in which roughly one of American workers were unemployed, banks failed, and millions of people were temporarily homeless or unable to feed their families.  How likely is it that something like this could happen again now?\"</p><p>A solid 59 percent of Americans thought it was very likely or somewhat likely that what we are headed for in this country is another Great Depression.  That is a very frightening number.  Just 42 percent believe that it is not likely.  So nearly 60 percent think another Great Depression is likely.        How do they feel about economic conditions in the country today? Just 16 percent describe economic conditions as good, 84 percent says those conditions are, in fact, poor.  </p><p>How will this affect you, the ordinary American?  Thirty-six percent say they expect this economic crisis to affect them immediately.  Another 19 percent say within the year.  So that's a majority of Americans expect to feel the impact of this economic crisis within the next year.  </p><p>There's a lot of concern, a lot of anxiety around the country right now.  And this interviewing was done over the weekend, before today's news -- T.J.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Well, we hate to see those numbers after today's news. And 16 percent in those numbers say the conditions are good.  A lot of people probably wondering, where in the world are those 16 percent, because this economy is affecting everybody.</p><p>Bill Schneider, thank you so much there in Nashville, where the debate will take place tomorrow night.  </p><p>And, of course, the presidential candidates, it's their second of three debates.  Tuesday night, make sure you watch it right here, CNN, with the best political team on television.  </p><p>We will turn back now -- keeping an eye on the financial markets. We've been keeping an eye on the Dow this morning, keeping an eye on that index.  Well, the Nasdaq not faring so well either.  </p><p>Poppy Harlow, I will come to you.  It's not a matter of asking how are things there, it's just a matter of asking how bad are they.  </p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM:  Yes.  Well, at the Nasdaq, they're the worst for the all the major averages.  Worse than the Dow, worse than the S&amp;P.  The Nasdaq is down 5.5 percent right now.  Want to talk about why that is.</p><p>There's a lot of big tech companies traded here -- Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco.  Some companies all of you out there might be invested in.  They're getting beaten up because when financial institutions fail, when there's a crisis on Wall Street, it affects their business in a big way.  Lehman Brothers, those names, are some of their biggest clients.  </p><p>Also, you might know this, though.  A lot of regional banks are traded on the Nasdaq, names like Zions.  That might be your bank.  Or names like Fifth Third Bank Corp.</p><p>Zions is down 5 percent.  That's a big bank in Utah and across the Southwest.  Fifth Third Bank Corp. down 9 percent.  That's big in Indiana and in Michigan.</p><p>This is not just a Wall Street problem.  This is a Main Street problem.  This is affecting these small banks as well.  That's why you're seeing this index down so much.      And the Nasdaq is down more than 30 percent, T.J., so far this year.  </p><p>I want to also turn to something else.  That's called the Volatility Index.  It's the VIX.</p><p>I have it on the board behind me.  It is down.  Take a look at it there.  </p><p>It's up 19 percent in a single day.  It is over 50 points right now.  In September, it was about 20 points.  That is a huge change.  </p><p>What the Volatility Index does is it really measures how much people think there is going to be a swing in the markets.  There are massive bets being placed on big swings in the market right now, mostly to the downside.  </p><p>The reading we're seeing on the VIX today, the highest since, get this, 1989.  People are incredibly worried.  It's a massive, massive jump for that index, T.J.  So that's playing into things a lot.  And it's interesting to see the Nasdaq, these tech companies, these regional banks, feeling the pressure even more than the Dow right now -- T.J.  </p><p>HOLMES:  All right.  And we know, Poppy -- you stand by there with us.  We know you talked to some traders there today as well. Certainly want to hear what they're talking about.  </p><p>We want to let our viewers know we're standing by here.  We're waiting to hear from President Bush.  </p><p>President Bush made some comments today about the economy, certainly talking about that financial package that was put into place just last week by the Congress and signed by the president, a $700 billion package.  Well, it hasn't really made people feel better about the markets.  We still see a drop in all those indices, but here's the president here in Texas about to make comments here about this.  </p><p>We're just getting this in.  So let's go ahead here and listen in to the president.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE. W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  A very illuminating conversation with small business owners here.  We have a car dealer, an automobile repair shop, a restaurateur, two restaurateurs.  And it's clear that these small business owners are dealing with the effects of a credit crunch.  </p><p>And by that, I mean they're having trouble getting money to be able to continue to either expand their business or to be able to -- for money to help their consumers be able to buy their products.  And it's -- and I told them one of the reasons why I was so strongly for this rescue package was, inherent in the strategy of the rescue package is to free up credit, just to get money moving.  And it's going to take a while.        I signed the bill on -- last week, but it's going to take a while to get in place a program that, one, is effective, and, two, that doesn't waste taxpayers' money.  We don't want to rush into this situation and not have the program be effective.  </p><p>It's going to take a while to restore confidence in the financial system.  But one thing people can be certain of is that the bill I signed is a big step toward solving this problem.  </p><p>A lot of the people here in Texas and around the country are not pleased with the government having to take the steps they took.  Their question is, I pay my bills, I pay my mortgage, why are you helping Wall Street?  </p><p>And the answer is because had we not done anything, people like the folks behind me would be a lot worse off.  We'll make sure as time goes on this doesn't happen again.  In the meantime, we've got to solve the problem.  And that's why people sent me to Washington, D.C. When you see a problem, put a team together and solve it.  </p><p>And I want to thank you all for your time.  I'm glad to be back here in Texas.  I miss my friends in Texas.  </p><p>I am -- people say, \"You looking forward to coming home?\"  Yes, I'm looking forward to living here, but in the meantime, it looks like I'm going to have a lot of work to do between today and when the new president takes office.  But Laura and I are glad to be with our friends.</p><p>And thank you for your time.  Thank you all very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES:  The president saying there he's not going to be able to vacation his way out of his job.  He has work to do in Washington, certainly with this financial mess.  </p><p>Listening to the president there talking about -- really echoing some of those sentiments, a lot of things we heard leading up to that whole $700 billion package.  It's bad now, but you can imagine, it's going to worse if we don't have this package.  Also talking about it's going to take a while, don't want to rush into things, going to take a while to restore confidence.  </p><p>Well, Kathleen Koch standing by for us at the White House now.  </p><p>Kathleen, I don't know.  A lot of the people were saying, why do we have to rush into getting this bill passed?  Lawmakers said we needed to.  Now that it's passed, the president saying we need to take our time here and do it right.  </p><p>I guess is that the new theme now, now we need to slow things down?  </p><p>KATHLEEN KOCH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, T.J., the White House clearly -- though they now have the authority, the administration has the authority to buy these bad mortgages and other failed assets from these banks, clearly they have to set up a system to make it happen. And the President is -- and the treasury secretary have been very clear on that point, that it is -- it's not the kind of thing that happens overnight.  </p><p>They've never done this sort of thing before.  And again, you want to do it right, you want to do it with proper oversight.  So I don't think any in Congress either would take issue with that, with the president saying we are going to take some time.</p><p>I think a lot of people have some questions about, well, hey, what's happening with the market now?  We thought we passed this bailout package on -- this rescue plan on Friday, and this would bring calm and stability to the markets.  And certainly that was something that the administration had hoped would occur as well.  </p><p>When I reached out to the deputy press secretary, Tony Fratto, to see what the administration thought about the plunge in U.S. markets, and obviously also the plunge overseas, he said that they don't comment on daily market activity.  But commenting on what's happening overseas, Fratto did point out that -- he said the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, other government agencies, are working with their counterparts overseas to try to bring some stability to the global financial crisis.  And he said that the administration is \"confident\" that sustained attention to the root causes of the crisis will eventually bring that stability and confidence.</p><p>But right now, T.J., it appears there's not a lot that anyone can do to stop the markets from doing what they want.  And right now it's plunged.  </p><p>HOLMES:  And that is what they're doing, some 477 points down now.  </p><p>Kathleen Koch for us at the White House.</p><p>Kathleen, thank you so much.  </p><p>KOCH:  You bet.</p><p>HOLMES:  We'll also be looking into -- the Supreme Court coming up next.  They are back in session today.  What will the impact of the election have on that court?  We'll ask our senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin.  He's coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>HOLMES:  Well, it is issue #1 right there on the campaign trail. And right there what you're seeing, 472 points down, the Dow.  The Nasdaq also down some 5 percent today.  World markets tanked overnight.  We're just seeing a lack of confidence right now in the markets despite that $700 billion bailout package that is in place now here in the U.S.</p><p>We are keeping an eye on all things economy related for you today.  </p><p>Also want to turn now back to something else going on.  The Supreme Court, they're back in session today.  And certainly some major news being made out of there.  One in particular about the case of Troy Davis.  You may remember this name.  He was on death row for a long time here in the state of Georgia, actually.  </p><p>Kelli Arena is there at the Supreme Court.</p><p>What has been the movement, or what is the news on this particular case?  </p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as you said, Troy Davis has been on death row there in Georgia since 1993.  He was convicted of killing an off-duty police officer there in Savannah.  </p><p>There have been some questions regarding that case of whether or not witness testimony was indeed reliable.  After several witnesses had testified that he was indeed the person who shot and killed that police officer, they recanted that testimony.  Of course, Mr. Davis has claimed that he was innocent all along, and so there's been a large spotlight on that case.</p><p>What the Supreme Court decided -- was supposed to decide on that case today, whether or not they were going to consider that appeal or not.  Earlier, our guidance was that they had passed on that.  But I want to clarify and make sure that we get this correct.</p><p>What the Supreme Court has done is nothing yet.  What they're going to take this up on Friday instead.  So Troy Davis still has a chance that his case could be heard before the Supreme Court.  </p><p>He was supposed to be executed just a couple of weeks ago.  That execution was stayed, obviously, while both sides are waiting for the courts to decide.  So we should get a definitive answer on whether or not the Supreme Court justices will hear his appeal on Friday.  And we did not get proper guidance earlier.  I want to make sure our viewers know, Friday is the day.  </p><p>HOLMES:  Friday is the day, so he still has a chance for the Supreme Court to take..  </p><p>ARENA:  He still has a chance, absolutely.  </p><p>HOLMES:  ... up his case.</p><p>ARENA:  A very controversial case.</p><p>HOLMES:  OK.  OK.  Friday is the day.</p><p>Kelli Arena, thank you so much for that.  </p><p>ARENA:  You're welcome.</p><p>HOLMES:  And of course the first Monday in October, we see the Supreme Court beginning that new term today.        Well, the biggest decision of the year though may come Election Day.  </p><p>Our senior legal correspondent, Jeffrey Toobin, the author of the book \"The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court,\" so he knows a little bit about what's happening up there.</p><p>Jeff joins me now from New York.</p><p>Jeff, a lot of things going on out there on the campaign trail. You know, usually, the Supreme Court is at least a part of the back and forth in a debate during an election time.  Well, here we are, they're back in the news.  They're starting their session today.</p><p>So will voters now stop and think, wait a minute, how could this change the makeup of this court?  And that's going to be an issue now on the campaign trail for the last month?  </p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SR. LEGAL ANALYST:  Well, perhaps they should, but every indication I've seen is that the Supreme Court, yet again, will not be a major issue in this campaign.  The economy has just swamped everything.  But if people want to think about what the impact of the next president is going to be, the Supreme Court almost certainly will be the 44th president's perhaps most important legacy.  </p><p>The court now is divided -- four very conservative justices, four liberal justices, Anthony Kennedy in the middle -- deciding case after case.  Three of those liberals are likely to resign in the next few years, so the next president may have the opportunity to move the court way to the right or keep it more or less the way it is.  </p><p>HOLMES:  OK.  Well, again, you say you never see this.  I guess, what would it take?  I guess -- and what do they have, I guess, on their schedule for this particular session?  Is there any particular case that will certainly jump out at people?  And then, again, like you say, voters are really not going to make this that big of a deal. But still, what could possibly get voter's attention.  </p><p>TOOBIN:  Well, certainly the Troy Davis case is the big case at the moment.  And there's a very interesting legal issue in that case. You'd think it would have been resolved by now, but here it is.  Is it constitutional to execute an innocent person?  The Supreme Court has never answered that question.  And this case may present it if they decide to take it up.</p><p>Another, not so important but actually interesting kind of case, is the Federal Communications Commission has levied fines against television (ph) networks for stray expletives.  Remember, Cher said some things she shouldn't have said.  And Bono said some things.  Can you fine a network for expletives that they didn't plan or know was going to happen.  </p><p>Certainly there are going to be more cases about Guantanamo Bay. That issue has been a constant throughout the Bush years.  And always, in the background, abortion and affirmative action likely to come up. If not this year, very soon.        HOLMES: And again, the likelihood, like you said, possible that three of the liberal judges could be stepping down in the next several years.  None of the conservatives, we're going to lose them any time soon.  </p><p>TOOBIN: Doesn't look that way, although, you know, you never know how people's health is going to go, but you've got -- the older justices on the liberal side and that tends to be the people who leave first.  </p><p>HOLMES: There it is.  All right, Jeff Toobin.</p><p>Sir, thank you so much.  Good to see you this morning.  </p><p>TOOBIN: See you, T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: Oil prices continue to fall.  That would, you know, normally be good news to people. But the reason the oil prices are falling is anything but good.  CNN.com's Poppy Harlow on our Energy Fix today from New York, from the Nasdaq.  </p><p>You've been covering all kind of stuff for us.  So what's the word on these oil prices? </p><p>HARLOW:  Yes, we're here at the Nasdaq because of the volatility in the stock market, but there's a lot of volatility in the oil market, which you would see right downtown from here at the NYMEX. The New York Mercantile Exchange.  Oil is down more than $4 right now. It is right now below $90 a barrel.  We haven't seen that since February.  </p><p>This would be welcome news, but the reason behind it is not welcoming at all.  We are hugely off of that record high we saw of over $147 a barrel back in July.  That has to do with the fundamental of supply and demand.  Traders selling off their oil contracts because they are concerned that around the world the demand for oil and the products that use oil is not going to be anywhere near where it was this summer.  </p><p>What that means for you, your gas prices are down for a 19th straight day, $3.50 a gallon right now according to AAA.  But again, it all has to do with that sinking global economy.  It's not just how many cars will run on gasoline, it's the demand for the products that take petroleum, that take oil to make them, T.J.  </p><p>So some bad news today.  Oil down again.  I guess good news if you have to heat your home and fill your take.  But otherwise, bad fundamentals behind it.</p><p>HOLMES: The fundamentals.  And, I guess, it's common supply and demand and people -- it's, you know.</p><p>Poppy Harlow for us there at the Nasdaq.  We appreciate you. Thank you so much.  Keeping an eye on all that stuff for us.</p><p>We want to turn now back to that $700 billion bailout package. It passed Congress.  No immediate silver bullet, however, as we've been seeing for borrowers.  We will explain why straight ahead.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOLMES: The Dow Jones Industrial average about 500 points down today.  Ten thousand below that number for the first time in four years.  It's sitting there at about 9,800.  Our Susan Lisovicz, Ali Velshi both keeping an eye on the markets for us today.  There they both are.  Good to see you both.</p><p>Susan, I am going to start with you.</p><p>We've still got another three and a half hours to watch this board.  What are we going to be seeing?</p><p>LISOVICZ:  Well, you know, it's very volatile.  I know Poppy was talking to you earlier about this index.  The fear index.  The volatility index.  It's called the VIX.  And it's at very, very high levels.  It might be at an all-time high.</p><p>So things are volatile.  A lot of the investors are afraid.  And you can't predict when you have emotions running the market.  But we have seen the market selling off now for a period of time.  We are well into a bear market.  </p><p>And the headlines today are clearly showing that the distress we're seeing in the U.S. financial market is not limited to this market.  We've seen extraordinary measures occurring today and over the weekend to bolster banking systems overseas.  The German government agreed on a nearly $70 billion bailout of a lender there. A French bank, BNP Paribas, agreed to acquire a big stake in a Belgian bank.  And also, a number of governments, like Germany, Ireland, Iceland, guaranteeing bank deposits.  </p><p>You know, a few years ago all you had to do was breath and you could get a loan.  Now you have companies like GE, with a AAA credit rating, that strike a deal with Warren Buffett to inject some cash into the company.  And at very favorable rates, I might add, for Warren Buffett.  So credit is just basically frozen.  </p><p>The Federal Reserve is doubling its auctions of cash to banks. That was announced today. And I saw an interesting quote, T.J. that -- from one analyst who says, it's pretty much all out war.  They're pulling out all the stops to try and get borrowers and lenders to meet and do transactions once again.  To do what they used to do maybe a year ago.  Once we start to see the credit bubble really burst, these are different times we're living in.  </p><p>In any case, I know Poppy mentioned oil.  Oil is falling.  And you're seeing safe havens.  A real attraction today.  Gold is up about 3.5 percent.  As for stocks, 3,000 of them are trading to the downside here, T.J.  A hundred of them are higher.  So let's end it on a bright note.</p><p>Hartford Financial Services.  Let's hear it for an insurance company.  Its shares are up 11.5 percent because a German firm, Allianz, is injecting $2.5 billion into Hartford.  So Hartford, right now, is one of those 100 stocks that are moving higher today.  </p><p>HOLMES: All right.  Susan Lisovicz there for us at the New York Stock Exchange.  All you had to do was breathe and you could get a loan.  That's a heck of a way to put it.  You certainly have to do more than that right now.</p><p>We will turn now to -- actually we're going to have our Ali Velshi stand by.  We're going to listen in to Richard Fuld.  He's the CEO of Lehman Brothers.  There testifying at a committee on Capitol Hill.  Let's listen in to his opening statement.</p><p>RICHARD FULD, LEHMAN BROTHERS CEO:  Today, there is unprecedented turmoil in our capital markets.  Nobody, including me, anticipated how the problems that started in the mortgage markets would spread to our credit markets and our banking system and now threaten our entire financial system and our country.  Like many other financial institutions, Lehman Brothers got caught in this financial tsunami.  </p><p>But I want to be very clear.  I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took.  Based on the information that we had at the time, I believed that these decisions and actions were both prudent and appropriate.  None of us ever gets the opportunity to turn back the clock.  But with the benefit of hindsight, would I have done things differently?  Yes, I would have.  </p><p>As painful as this is for all of the people affected by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, this is not just about Lehman Brothers. These problems are not limited to Wall Street or even main street. This is a crisis for the global economy.  </p><p>We live in a world where large investment, large independent U.S. investment banks are now extinct.  Where AIG and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are under government control.  And where major institutions are being rescued.  And where regulators are engaged in a daily struggle to stabilize the financial system.  </p><p>In this environment, it's not surprising that the media coverage of Lehman's demise has been right with rumors and inaccuracies.  I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight for this committee and to be as helpful as possible in explaining why we ultimately could not prevent a bankruptcy filing.  And then I want to respond to your questions.</p><p>I'm a Lehman lifer.  I joined as an intern in 1966 and got a full-time job as a commercial paper trader while earning my business degree at night.  In 1994, when Lehman Brothers was spun out of American Express as a separate company and I became the CEO, we were a small, domestic bond firm.  By 2007, we had built Lehman into a diversified global firm with 28,000 employees.</p><p>I feel a deep, personal connection to those 28,000 great people. Many of whom have dedicated their entire careers to Lehman Brothers. I feel horrible about what has happened to the company and its effects on so many.  My colleagues, my shareholders, creditors and my clients.       As CEO, I was a significant shareholder and my long-term financial interests were completely aligned with those of all the other shareholders.  No one had more incentive to see Lehman Brothers succeed.  And because I believed so deeply in the company, I never sold the vast majority of my Lehman Brothers stocks and still owned 10 million when we filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>As I said following the spin off of Lehman Brothers from American Express, our business was almost exclusively in fixed income.  We recognized the need for diversification.  And over the subsequent 14 years, we built and required significant equity in asset management businesses.  We established a presence in 28 countries.  We also continually strengthened our risk management infrastructure.  </p><p>Lehman Brothers did have a significant presence in the mortgage market.  This should not be surprising though.  U.S. residential mortgages are an $11 trillion market.  More than twice the size of the U.S. Treasury market.  And a serious participant in the fixed income businesses had a significant presence in the mortgage market.  </p><p>As the environment changed, we took numerous actions to reduce our risk.  We strengthened our balance sheet, reduced leverage, improved liquidity, closed our mortgage origination businesses and reduced our exposure to troubled assets.  We also raised over $10 billion in new capital.  </p><p>We explored converting into a bank holding company.  We looked at a wide range of strategic alternatives, including spinning off our commercial real estate assets to our shareholders.  We also considered selling part or all of the company.  We approached many potential investors, but in a market paralyzed by a crisis in confidence, none of these decisions came to fruition.  Indeed, contrary to what you may have read, I never turned down an offer to buy Lehman Brothers.  </p><p>Throughout 2008, the SEC and the Federal Reserve conducted regular, and at times daily oversight of our business and our balance sheet.  They saw what we saw in realtime as they reviewed our liquidity and our funding, our capital, risk management and our mark to market process.  </p><p>As the crisis in confidence spread throughout the capital markets, naked short sellers targeted financial institutions and spread rumors and false information.  The impact of this market manipulation became self-fulfilling as short sellers drove down the stock prices of financial firms.  The rating agencies lowered their ratings because lower stock prices made it harder to raise capital and reduce financial flexibility.  The downgrades in turn caused lenders and counter parties to reduce credit lines and then demand more collateral which increased liquidity pressures.  </p><p>At Lehman Brothers, the crisis in confidence that permeated the markets led to an extraordinary run on the bank.  In the end, despite all of our efforts, we were overwhelmed.  However, what happened to Lehman Brothers could have happened to any financial institution and almost did happen to others.        Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch all were trapped in this vicious cycle.  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also came under attack.  Lehman's demise was brought on by many destabilizing factors.  The collapse of the real estate market, naked short attacks, false rumors, widening spreads on credit default swaps, rating agency downgrades, a loss of confidence by clients and counter parties and buyers sitting on the sidelines waiting for an assisted deal.  </p><p>Again, this is not just a Lehman Brothers story, it's now an all too familiar tale.  It is too late for Lehman Brothers, but the government has now been forced to dramatically change the rules and provide substantial support to other institutions.  </p><p>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. And if I can be helpful to this committee in any way to understand how we got here and what our country can do to move forward, I am happy to do so.  </p><p>Thank you, sir.  </p><p>REP. HENRY WAXMAN, (D) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Fuld.  </p><p>Without objection, the chair and the ranking member will control 10 minutes, which they can use or reserve and use at a subsequent time.  And hearing no objection, that will be the order.</p><p>The chair will recognize himself.  </p><p>Mr. Fuld, the committee -- our economy requested all the documents relating to your salary, bonuses and stock sales.  The committee staff put together a chart, which I hope will come up on the screen.  This chart will show your compensation for the last eight years.  It shows your base salary, your cash bonuses and your stock sales.  In 2000, you received over $52 million.  In 2001, that increased to $98 million.  It dipped for a few years and then, in 2005, you took home $89 million.  In 2006, you made a huge stock sale and you received over $100 million in that year alone.  Are these figures basically accurate? </p><p>FULD: Sir, if those are the documents that we provided to you, I would assume they are.  </p><p>WAXMAN: OK.  </p><p>The bottom line is that since 2000, you've taken home more than $480 million.  That's almost half a billion dollars.  And that's difficult to comprehend for a lot of people.  Your company is now bankrupt, our economy is in a state of crisis, but you get to keep $480 million.  I have a very basic question for you.  Is this fair? </p><p>FULD: Mr. Chairman, your first question was about this slide, are those numbers accurate.  They are accurate the way you have put them up on that slide.  But I believe your number of cash and salary bonuses are accurate.  The option exercises the way you have them portrayed here I believe represent a full option without the strike price.  And the only reason I exercised those options was because they came due at maturity.  If I had not exercised those, I would have lost them.  There was that stock sale.  </p><p>WAXMAN: Well, I'll leave the record open for you to give me any changes in that list, but basically, didn't you take home around $400 million to $500 million as the head of Lehman Brothers for the last -- since 2000 to now? </p><p>FULD: The majority of my stock, sir, came -- excuse me, the majority of my compensation came as stock.  The vast majority of the stock that I got, I still owned at the point of our filing.  </p><p>WAXMAN: the stock is in addition to the numbers that I've indicated because those were your salary and your bonuses.  Now, you had bonuses and, in addition to that, you had some stock sales. You've lost some money of the stock that you've received as compensation, which you received as compensation on top of these other figures.  So you've been able to pocket close to half a million dollars.  And my question to you is, a lot of people ask, is that fair for the CEO of a company that's now bankrupt to have made that kind of money?  It's just unimaginable to so many people.</p><p>FULD: I would say to you the 500 number is not accurate.  I would say to you that although it's still a large number, I think for the years that you're talking about here, I believe my cash compensation was close to 60 million, which you have indicated here.  And I believe the amount that I took out of the company over and above that was, I believe, a little bit less than 250 million.  Still a large number though.  </p><p>WAXMAN: Still a large amount of money..  You have a $14 million ocean front home in Florida.  You have a summer vacation home in Sun Valley, Idaho.  Yet you and your wife have an art collection filled with million dollar paintings.  Your former president, Joe Gregory (ph), used to travel to work in his own private helicopter.  </p><p>I guess people wonder, if you made all this money by taking risks with other people's money, you could have done other things.  You had high leverage.  Thirty to one and higher.  You didn't pay out billions of dollars in dividends and you didn't have to pay out these millions of dollars in dividends and bonuses.  You could have saved some of these funds for the lean times, but you didn't.</p><p>Do you think it's fair and do you have any recommendations on fundamental reforms that would bring a new approach to executive compensation, because it seems that the system worked for you, but it didn't seem to work for the rest of the country and the taxpayers who now have to pay up to $700 billion to bail out our economy.  We can't continue to have a system where Wall Street executives privatize all the gains and then socialize the losses.  Accountability needs to be a two-way street.  </p><p>Do you disagree with that?  And do you have any recommendations what we ought to be doing in this area?       FULD: Mr. Chairman, we had a compensation committee that spent a tremendous amount of time making sure that the interests of the executives and the employees were aligned with shareholders.  My employees owned close to 30 percent of our company.  And that was because we wanted them to think, act and behave like shareholders. When the company did well, we did well.  When the company did not do well, sir, we did not do well.  </p><p>WAXMAN: Well, Mr. Fuld, there's seems to be a break down because you did very well when the company was doing well and you did very well when the company wasn't doing well.  And now your shareholders, who owned your company, have nothing.  I'm going to reserve the balance of my time and we're going to go on to other members.  </p><p>Mr. Shays.</p><p>REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS, (R) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: If you'd yield me two minutes.  </p><p>Gentlemen, Mr. Fuld, I'd like to ask you first, who appoints the compensation committee? </p><p>FULD: The compensation committee is now appointed by the corporate governance committee of the board.  </p><p>SHAYS: But did you have a major role in appointing the compensation committee? </p><p>FULD: I believe I had more of the role in the early or mid-90s. Clearly less of a role these last number of years.  </p><p>SHAYS: And then, finally, of the 10 million shares that you had in the company, that's what you have right now, 10 million shares? </p><p>FULD: No.  I don't have the exact amount.  I think it's closer to 8 million shares.  And that does not include the options that expired worthless.  Well, actually, they haven't expired.  That are still there, with a longer term vesting, but with a much higher strike price than, obviously, where the stock is today.  </p><p>SHAYS: Thank you.  </p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Shays.  </p><p>I want to recognize Miss Maloney for five minutes.</p><p>REP. CAROLYN MALONEY, (D) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>We are in a financial crisis and we lost four major investment banks in a week and taxpayers have been called upon to assume a potential $1.7 billion in taxpayer liability to backstop our financial institutions.  During this hearing today, we've seen a long list of examples of deregulation and we've heard about the net capital rule, which was eliminated so that Lehman and other investment banks could ramp up their leverage to very dangerous, high levels, putting their institutions at risk.  And for almost 30 years, this rule kept investment banks from taking on debt more than 12 times the value of the banks investments.  Firms were required to stop trading if their debt exceeded that ratio.  </p><p>As a result, most investment banks did not take on excessive debt.  Yet this report in \"The New York Times,\" and I'd like permission to have it referenced or put in the record . . .</p><p>WAXMAN: Without objection.</p><p>MALONEY: Last Friday called the agency 04 (ph) rule let banks pile up new debt.  And many people feel that this was a major cause of the crisis.  And they reference a meeting in April of 2004.  </p><p>And I'd like to ask you, where you at that meeting?  Did you lobby for this change?  Why did Lehman want to increase its leverage? And, in hindsight, do you think the SEC rule -- that changing this SEC rule was appropriate for protecting safety and soundness, the stability of our markets and taxpayers' money? </p><p>FULD: Congresswoman, I was not at that meeting, I believe, in 2004.  And I do not recall if any other of my people were there.  </p><p>I had a chance to, while I was sitting in the waiting room, I saw, I would assume, almost all of the first panel (ph).  The information about leverage, I think, has been grossly misunderstood. There are two numbers.  One is gross leverage and one is net leverage. </p><p>Gross leverage includes, and excuse me if I get technical.  If I get to technical, please stop me.  Close to half of our balance sheet, if not more, was what we called the matched book.  The matched book was predominantly government securities and agencies that we took on our balance sheet to finance for our clients.  </p><p>We were one of the top U.S. Treasury government traders and financiers, meaning financing the U.S. government debt, and we supplied a tremendous amount of liquidity to institutional investors that owned U.S. government debt and agencies.  At times, that was as high as 300 to probably more, $300 billion.  I heard some of the earlier remarks about, if you lost 3 percent or 4 percent of that, for the match book, those are government securities.  So the real number, the effective number is net leverage.</p><p>MALONEY: So did you lobby for this capital rule change?  And do you think it contributed to the financial instability and loss of safety and soundness in financial institutions such as your own that allowed this increased leverage? </p><p>FULD:  I, myself, did not lobby for the increased leverage.  </p><p>MALONEY:  Did Lehman Brothers lobby for it? </p><p>FULD:  I'm not aware of that.        MALONEY:  I would like to ask you, now that we have the opportunity of looking back, and we want to look forward on what needs to be done, if you had to give government advice on how we could strengthen the safety and soundness of our institutions and the accountability and transparency that all of us want, what would you recommend?  To change the system?  </p><p>FULD:  In my written testimony, I spoke about the need for additional regulation and new regulation, because when the original regulations were written, it was a very different environment.  I believe there were 10 million shares a day traded, and today there are close to 5 billion shares traded.  </p><p>The electronic connectivity today, not only within this country, but country to country.  Investors today, given that electronic activity, have the right to move their money to the highest-returning asset.  And money moves very quickly and freely.  So it's not just about regulation within the U.S.  I believe this also more of the matrix regulation that is more global in nature.  </p><p>I would focus also, on capitol requirements.  Capital requirements meaning more capital for less liquid assets, and a more robust understanding of mark to market, which I believe is one of the pillars of the new plan.  Mark to market during periods of stress create one set of numbers and, obviously, in a functioning non-credit crisis environment, produce another set of numbers.  </p><p>WAXMAN:  Your prepared statement, which has these recommendations, are in the record.  And we want to move on to other questions.  Did you want to add one last point? </p><p>FULD:  Yes, please.  And the other is something I strongly believe in, is the creation of what I call a master netting system, where all capital market counterparties download, each night, all their transactions to one local spot, first in the U.S., and then eventually, hopefully, make that global.  That's about all transactions and trades.  It's about positions.  It's about capital. It's about leverage -- excuse me.  </p><p>And it would give whatever regulators, then in control of that master netting system, a complete view of the financial landscape, the available capital to each and every asset class, flexibility within those asset classes, and vulnerability within those asset classes, and vulnerability of one institution versus the next.  </p><p>What I am proposing is clearly expensive, costly, but by comparison to the unprecedented regulation this Congress just passed, it is a fraction and, I believe, money well spent.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.  Mr. Mica.  Five minutes.  </p><p>REP. JOHN MICA (R-FL), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE:  Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>And looking at, first, your comment on Lehman Brothers primarily dealing in some -- for most of its history.        FULD:  Sir, I apologize.  I cannot hear you.  I'm sorry.</p><p>MICA:  Can you hear me now?</p><p>FULD:  Yes, thank you.</p><p>MICA:  Again, you -- when you opened your statement, you said that Lehman Brothers was around for, what, 150 years, dealt in some pretty hard assets and some secure investments.  You've been around a while.  What -- what turned the corner for you to get into some more speculative ventures like subprime and some of the other, again, riskier investments? </p><p>FULD:  As I said in my verbal testimony, our participation in the mortgage-related businesses was clearly a natural for us, given our dominance in fixed income.  That was something that went back a number of years.  </p><p>Even as I listened, as I say, to the panel before me, they correctly pointed out that this was a goal of the government: to provide funding and mortgages to a number of people that typically would not or could not have received a mortgage.  </p><p>MICA:  One of your big -- well, one of the big package or yours, or the competitor, so to speak, was Fannie Mae, which was deep into this.  And you were -- you were dealing in some of the paper, I think, for secondary markets and other securitized mortgage paper to basically package it and make money off it.  Is that right? </p><p>FULD:  Yes, sir.  </p><p>MICA:  What was Lehman Brothers' exposure to the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?  And what role did their collapse play in precipitating some of your financial troubles?  Did it matter?</p><p>FULD:  Our exposure to both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was de minimis, sir. </p><p>MICA:  OK.  But their collapse, did that help precipitate any problems with your firm? </p><p>FULD:  It certainly set the stage for an environment, as I talked about loss of confidence and credit-crisis mentality that permeated our market, clearly set -- set the stage for investors losing confidence, counterparties asking for additional collateral.  And clearly an environment that lost liquidity, which is the life blood of the capitol market system.  </p><p>MICA:  I notice -- I notice some questions were asked about your political participation.  I pulled Lehman Brothers' contributions -- contributions to federal candidates for the last ten years. Fortunately, I didn't find my name there, but -- not like some of the other members of Congress.  </p><p>I added some of this up.  It's about $300,000 that you gave to influence members of Congress.  I also got your personal, which wasn't much.  You probably bet a bit too much on Hillary, too.  But this is -- this is pretty much the extent of your financial contributions? Members of Congress to lobby... </p><p>FULD:  I -- I believe that that was a result of Lehmans' PAC...</p><p>MICA:  Right.</p><p>FULD:  ... which was not corporate moneys.  </p><p>MICA:  Right, right.  I'm just telling you.  Wait till you hear this one.  If you haven't discovered your role, you're the villain today, so you've got to act like the villain here.  </p><p>But guess what Fannie Mae did in the same period of time?  A hundred and seventy-five million dollars in lobbying contracts over ten years.  Does that surprise you?  You were out-lobbied.  It sounds like, rather than just some greed on Wall Street, we had a little greed in Washington.  What would you say to that? </p><p>FULD:  I think that's more of a matter for your committee, sir.  </p><p>WAXMAN:  Gentleman's time has expired.  </p><p>MICA:  Thank you.</p><p>WAXMAN:  We now go to Mr. Cummings.  </p><p>REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-MD), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Mr. Fuld, I really appreciate that you began your testimony by taking full responsibility for the company's downfall which occurred on your watch, but there are some concerns that I want to get to.  </p><p>As you know, the American taxpayer, many of them, our constituents, just -- we just passed legislation giving $700 billion to rescue Wall Street.  One complaint that I've heard over and over again from my constituents is that there seems to be a complete lack of accountability.  They see Wall Street executives like you walking away with millions of dollars.  </p><p>It was very interesting.  When you were talking about the chart that Mr. Waxman was -- showed you on the board, you said that it was inaccurate.  But I'm going to discount it for you.  And sort of $448 million over eight years.  Let's say 350.  How about that, 350?  Is that OK?  Can we discount it a little bit?  You said it was not accurate.  What would you say is accurate? </p><p>FULD:  I'd say that's closer, sir.  </p><p>CUMMINGS:  OK.  I want to ask you about one of the e-mails obtained by the committee.  On June 9, 2008, a former top Lehman executive -- can you hear me OK?</p><p>FULD:  Yes, sir.      CUMMINGS:  Benoit Gangelon (ph) sent an e-mail to Hugh McGee, who was the global head of investment banking at Lehman.  The e-mail says that many bankers has been calling in the last few days, and the mood has become truly awful.  It warns that, and I -- quote --  \"all of the hard work we have put in could unravel very quickly,\" end of quote.  </p><p>And it offers the following advice.  It says, \"Some senior managers have to be much less arrogant and internally admit that major mistakes have been made.  We can't continue to say we are great and the market doesn't understand.\"  End of quote.  </p><p>Mr. McGee forwarded this e-mail to you on the same day and explained that it was representative -- representative of many others. When you read the e-mail -- and this is interesting -- what was your action -- reaction?  I'm just curious.</p><p>FULD:  Sorry, sir.  What was the date?  I'm sorry.</p><p>CUMMINGS:  That would be June 9, 2008.  You remember that e-mail? </p><p>FULD:  I do not.  I do not recount.</p><p>CUMMINGS:  Well, let me -- let me try to refresh your recollection a little bit.  Let me tell you what you did, since you don't remember the e-mail.  Here's what happened.  </p><p>You didn't take any personal responsibility.  Instead, three days later, Mr. Fuld, on June 12, you fired Erin Allen [SIC], your chief financial officer, and Joseph Gregory, your chief operating officer. But you know, you stayed on and admitted no mistakes.  You were CEO. Why didn't you take responsibility?  Like today, you said you took full responsibility.  Why didn't you take responsibility for Lehmans' mistakes?  Why did you continue to say, quote, \"We are great and the market doesn't understand\"?  </p><p>In your testimony today, right here, right now, you continued to deflect personal responsibility.  You cite what you call a litany of reasons for Lehmans' bankruptcy.  Mr. Fuld, I want you to -- I want to ask you about your personal responsibility, since you've taken it.  Do you agree that Lehman took on excessive leverage under your leadership?  Please answer yes or no.  </p><p>FULD:  It's not that easy.  I would say to you our leverage at times was higher, but as we entered this difficult market over this last year, we continued to bring our leverage down so that, even at the point, Congressman, on September 10, when we announced our third- quarter results, we had grossly reduced our balance sheet by close to 200 billion, specifically around residential mortgages and commercial real estate and leverage loans.  </p><p>CUMMINGS:  Mr. Fuld -- Mr. Fuld, I've only got -- I've got about less than a minute.  I've got to get this question in.  I assume your answer is no?  I'm just giving you the benefit of the doubt.  </p><p>FULD:  At the end of the day, we worked hard.  Our leverage was way down.  One of the best...      CUMMINGS:  All right.  Let me ask you...</p><p>FULD:  Sorry, sir.  One of the best leverage ratios on the street, and our Tier 1 capital was one of the highest.  </p><p>CUMMINGS:  So you feel -- you feel comfortable with that, what you did?  Is that right?  That's not one of the things that you said your...</p><p>FULD:  Yes, sir.  </p><p>CUMMINGS:  OK, fine.  Do you regret spending $10 billion in Lehmans' cash reserves on bonuses, stock dividends and stock buybacks as your firm faced a liquidity crisis?  Do you regret that now?</p><p>FULD:  I heard some of that while I was in the other room.  I think that is a misunderstanding, which I'd like to clear up.  </p><p>CUMMINGS:  Well, let me go back to -- go ahead.  You go ahead. I'm sorry.</p><p>FULD:  Because it's important that this committee understands exactly what that was.  When I talked about my employees owning close to 30 percent, what's typical of Wall Street is you take a percentage of your revenues, and you pay your people.  We asked our employees to take a big percentage of their compensation in stock.  </p><p>And so what that 10 billion was -- we had close to 19 billion of revenues -- what most of that 10 billion was, was compensation to our employees that they received in stock with a five-year forward vest. So they didn't get that stock until five years, which aligned our interests, our employees, with the interests of shareholders.  </p><p>To avoid dilution, because we took that 10 billion, gave it to the employees in stock, we had to take the 10 billion that they didn't get and go back into the open marketplace and buy back that stock so that we did not dilute our shareholders.  And we did it each and every year.  From where you sit, it just looks like we spent an extra 10 billion.  That is not sir, what we did. </p><p>CUMMINGS:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>WAXMAN:  Sounds like, though, to yield myself time here, that you were trying to -- not to dilute the payment to those employees while you were in a liquidity crisis.  Wouldn't it have made more sense to use that money to pay off the debts that you were -- that were heavily on your shoulders at that point, and you knew that you were in a difficult situation? </p><p>FULD:  At that time, at the end of the year, last year, I didn't believe that we had that problem.  </p><p>WAXMAN:  You didn't believe that you had a liquidity problem? </p><p>FULD:  And we did not have a liquidity problem at the end of last year.  We had just completed a record year, none of which, by the way, came from mortgages.  We paid our people fairly and what we thought was competitive with the rest of the street.  </p><p>WAXMAN:  OK.  I accept your answer.  You didn't think you had a liquidity problem, so you were trying to make sure your employees were fully compensated.  </p><p>FULD:  Yes, sir.  </p><p>WAXMAN:  OK, thanks.  Mr. Tierney (ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>[Byline: T.J.

And once again, the financial crisis is not just exclusive to us here in the U.S. This is a financial -- a global financial crisis that's once again dominating the news on this Monday, October 6th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks across the world are tumbling as investors realize that financial rescue plan, you know, that $700 billion plan, is not going to be a quick fix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You are in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>Well, some people are running scared now right now, and they are running from the markets. Fear is what's driving investors today.</p><p>The Dow plunged below 10,000 at midmorning. That's the first time in four years we have seen that number below 10,000. Right now, the Dow is down, as you see there, 461 points, 452 points, off about 5 percent for the day.</p><p>Now, that pretty much is in line with markets in Europe, as well as Asia. And most major indices there skidded 4 to 8 percent today.</p><p>We're keeping an eye on all of this.</p><p>Also, we know that <person><nameText>President Bush </nameText></person>has made some comments, talking about it's going to take some time for that financial plan to work. We're expecting to hear those comments specifically from him as soon as they come into us. We have a reporter on the story and we'll pass them along to you.</p><p>Also, our Susan Lisovicz is keeping an eye on things. We have our reporters really at the Nasdaq, at the New York Stock Exchange. Also, in New York, our Ali Velshi is.</p><p>We're going to take you now with Susan Lisovicz, who's keeping an eye on things for us.</p><p>Susan, hello to you again.</p><p>We talk about this confidence is the key right now. This is really an emotional time for a lot of people.</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and, you know, fear is something that is often said to be one of the components of stock market trading. It's fear and greed. So, fear is a component, panic is something else.</p><p>And you know, I'm looking at this note that the chief markets strategist for Edward Jones, Alan Skrainka, sent me. And it says, \"A financial crisis is a severe disruption in financial markets that spill over to the broader economy. A financial panic is characterized by intense fear that can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"</p><p>That's why you see the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department and governments in Europe -- it's bad enough, they don't want it to get any worse. And what you're seeing is a lot of fear, intense fear. In some cases, panic, and what it's culminating in today is a ferocious sell-off.</p><p>We're coming in after the worst week on Wall Street since the aftermath of 9/11. It was also, T.J., a year ago this week that the Dow hit its all-time high, above 14,000. Today, before the opening bell, a trader was wearing a Dow 10,000 cap which was passed out during the great bull market of the 1990s. It was, in fact, in 1999 when that milestone was first reached.</p><p>But there is a sell-off here. We saw a sell-off, a massive sell- off overseas.</p><p>There are more signs of weakness and a lack of confidence in overseas companies by not only the companies themselves, a lack of confidence in lending to each other, but also by investors, as well as customers. We saw a halt in trading in Russia, also in Brazil. And the stark realization here on Wall Street that this bailout, this landmark $700 billion bailout package, is going to take some time to work, if it works.</p><p>In the meantime, well, you know, we have clear and undeniable signs that the U.S. economy, the biggest in the world, is decelerating. And the Fed stepped in again before the open. As one economist told me today, the Fed is using a bazooka to try to open up lending. It's also going to start paying interest on commercial bank reserves. It has the power now because of that bill.</p><p>One last thing I want to mention. You're looking at stock prices, but oil prices are something we're also looking at. Crude right now down more than $4, below $90 a barrel. And that's another sign of the toll expected because of what we're seeing, a slowdown in business and ultimately consumer spending -- T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: All right. Susan Lisovicz for us there at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Want to turn to Ali Velshi here now, who is watching Wall Street for us as well in New York.</p><p>Ali, I guess you just heard Susan there talk about a bazooka.</p><p>ALI VELSHI, CNN SR. BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>HOLMES: Some of this lingo you all are using today has blown our minds here. But tell us, the Fed using all kinds of tools is essentially what she's saying, trying to help out. What is it going to take to calm people down? Because you talk about that fear and this being an emotional time. That $700 billion didn't at least -- we know it's coming.</p><p>That didn't calm people down. What will?</p><p>VELSHI: Right. The bailout wasn't a stock market bailout, bottom line. And that's what it comes down to.</p><p>What causes people to buy stocks is they think the underlying companies will do well. So, we had a credit problem, and this $700 billion is meant to address that. But how does this help Macy's or JCPenney, or a shipping company?</p><p>It doesn't necessarily. It frees up some credit if they were having problems meeting their operating expenses, but how does it make the price of stock go up?</p><p>Well, the one thing that makes the price of stocks go up is when people spend money. And with all the sort of gloom that we've got around particularly unemployment, low home prices, why would they be spending more money?</p><p>The one piece of interesting news, as Susan said, oil prices are going down. So that might help you out a little bit.</p><p>But folks have stopped me, T.J., and saying, you know, \"My portfolio is down 30 percent from the beginning of the year.\" Well, if you look at the S&amp;P 500, which is one of the broader measures that we use of the stock market, broader than the Dow, it's down 28 and change percent since the beginning of the year. The Dow itself is down 25 and change percent since the beginning of the year.</p><p>So this is to say, if you're looking at your 401(k), look at that, since last October, when we hit our highs, until now. One year. This is the shape the Dow has taken.</p><p>So, that may not make you feel good about where you are right now, T.J., but it should make you understand that you weren't alone and you didn't make independently bad decisions. So don't feel worse than the market should make you feel.</p><p>The panic doesn't help you. If you were diversified, you still got burned, and that happens from time to time in the markets.</p><p>They also come back. And these present buying opportunities for people, T.J.</p><p>So, all is not lost. There is something to be said for an orderly sell-off of markets. It means they come back later.</p><p>This isn't panic selling at the moment. And frankly, for those of us -- those of you watching this, panic doesn't help you. You've got to make sound decisions. Gerri's going to tell you a little bit how to make those sound decisions specifically. They can be made. You can learn a lot about the markets and make decisions that can at least protect your portfolio from further devastation.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes. And Ali, we will go right over to Gerri, as you mentioned there.</p><p>Gerri Willis standing by for us as well, a member of this CNN money team.</p><p>And tell us again, what should make people feel better right now, or how can you help yourself feel better by making some good decisions and not, like you say, just grab your money and run right now out of this market?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, CNN PERSONAL FINANCE EDITOR: Well, we've seen bear markets before. This is nothing new. And if you've been invested in the market with your 401(k) for any period of time, you've been through a bear market, and that's what we're in right now.</p><p>Stocks down 30 percent, 87 percent of mutual funds were in the red for the third quarter. And this is just what the stock market does. If you don't have the stomach for this, maybe you shouldn't be invested at all.</p><p>The basic steps that you want to take right now, understand what you're invested in. What is it that you own?</p><p>Look at your 401(k). Look at the mutual funds that you own. Go to morningstar.com, plug those tickers in, see what individual holdings are in those mutual funds so you understand what it is you own.</p><p>Also, pay down your credit cards. If you want a guaranteed rate of return these days, about the only way to get it is to pay off high interest rate debt. That's absolutely an essential and one thing I know a lot of people are already thinking about. All you have to do is look at the major economic indicators right now.</p><p>You know, we've had too much debt in this society. It's time to pay some of that down. It's time to save.</p><p>Think about putting some money away because, look, at the end of the day, I believe that the biggest threat to you right now isn't the stock market, particularly if you're years from retirement. You've got lots of time to make that up.</p><p>The biggest threat to you right now is what's going on with jobs and the economy. You have to make sure you have some emergency savings on the side so that if worse comes to worse, you can pull on your savings rather than having a financial problem that dogs you for years.</p><p>So, calm down, take a breath. This is a bear market. We've seen it before, we've been through it before. Stocks go down as well as up, as most investors know. You just have to ignore your emotions here, try to hold them at bay, and really look at where you sit in this market.</p><p>Also, understand where your money is. What accounts do you have? What kind of bank accounts do you have? Where are they? Where is the money?</p><p>You really need to take stock right now, understand what it is you do own -- T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: I know that's tough for people to set those emotions aside when they see themselves losing money they've been saving over the years. But you're right, it might be time to make a move, but don't do anything rash and erratic. Stop and think it through, and you will be just fine.</p><p>Gerri Willis, thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIS: That's right, T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes.</p><p>We want to remind our viewers, again, we're keeping an eye on the markets. We'll keep that box up throughout the show. Keeping an eye, down 450 points now at the Dow at this point.</p><p>Also want to let you know that we are keeping an eye out for comments <person><nameText>President Bush </nameText></person>made just a short time ago about the economy. A live picture here of Air Force One. This is at the airport in San Antonio. The President in Texas right now.</p><p>Made some comments about the economy, certainly saying it's going to take a while for that financial package to kick in and start to work. It's not going to be a quick fix, which we certainly knew. But as soon as we get those comments, we will turn those around and pass those along to you.</p><p>Also, we've been checking in with our financial reporters in New York, over at the New York Stock Exchange. Also, we have our Poppy Harlow at the Nasdaq. We're going to check in with her. That important index as well down today. And also, the volatility index, giving us a gauge of how people feel right now about the economy, it's not doing so well either.</p><p>Also, let's turn now to Washington, where Congress is searching for the fall guy in this whole financial crisis, possibly. Of course, that $700 billion bailout bill that lawmakers did pass, a lot of them still didn't like it. Some of them said outright that they hated the bill even though they had to vote for it.</p><p>But Lehman Brothers CEO, Richard Fuld, is first to feel the heat today. These are live pictures of the hearing going on right now. This is the House Government Oversight Committee having a hearing.</p><p>Congressman Waxman of California, who is the chair of this committee, says he wants to know what went wrong and who should be held accountable for this entire mess. Lehman, of course, that 158- year-old company, a prestigious Wall Street investment firm, collapsed three weeks ago. Well, tomorrow, Waxman's committee will question execs from the insurance giant AIG.</p><p>Well, you can follow the markets and get up-to-the-minute news on the financial crisis on our Web site any time you want to. Just log on CNNMoney.com. That is your place to be.</p><p>All right. Less than a month now, can you believe it? Twenty- nine days and counting until the presidential election. The candidates certainly revving up the rhetoric. And it's right on time. We see this around election time, about a month out, every time around.</p><p>There you see Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin. She was touting her running mate, <person><nameText>John McCain, </nameText></person>as the best person to handle both the wars and the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>is the only man in this race who will solve our economic crisis and not exploit it. And he's the only man in this race with a plan that will actually help our working families and cut your taxes and get our economy back on track.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>He's the only man in this race who talks about the wars that America is fighting, and he isn't afraid to use the word \"victory.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: Meanwhile, <person><nameText>John McCain, </nameText></person>he's on the trail in New Mexico, holding a rally later today in Albuquerque. After that, he's heading to Nashville. He's got a little something to do there tomorrow night -- the second presidential debate, which, of course, you'll e watching right here on CNN.</p><p>Barack Obama, he's also prepping for the debate. After rallying supporters in Asheville, North Carolina, yesterday, Obama did take some time out this morning to call into the \"Tom Joyner Radio Show.\" He accused the McCain campaign of using attacks to avoid addressing the issues.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to talk about the things that matter to the American people. The last couple of days, while Senator McCain's campaign has been engaging in the low road, we've been talking about health care and how we can make sure that every single American can get health care. We're going to talk about how we put people back to work and create jobs in the new energy sector. You know, those are going to be the topics that we think the American people want to hear about. And that's what I'm going to talk about during the debate.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: Well, his vice presidential running mate, Joe Biden, has canceled his campaign appearances for today and tomorrow because of a death in the family. Biden's mother-in-law died yesterday after a long illness. The funeral and private burial will take place tomorrow in Pennsylvania.</p><p>So what can we expect during debate tonight, round two with <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>and Barack Obama? Our senior political analyst, Bill Schneider, is live for us from Nashville with a preview of tomorrow night's match-up.</p><p>And this is a different kind of match-up, certainly, a different format. They're not just going to be standing up there and listening to a moderate toss some questions at them. This one is going to be a little different.</p><p>WILLIAM SCHNEIDER, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, this is a town hall format. There will be voters on the stage asking questions, along with the moderator. Those voters are carefully selected, they're uncommitted voters, they haven't made up their minds.</p><p>They are unlikely to want to hear negative personal attacks. What they're likely to want to hear -- in fact, demand to hear -- is what each candidate is going to do about the economy, because those economic fears and concerns have been rising very, very rapidly.</p><p>HOLMES: Right. And like you said, it's on everybody's mind. Certainly we're talking about it today. It's dominating all the news.</p><p>So how do people feel these days, though we've been asking questions of them, those voters? How are they feeling right now about this economy and where it's going?</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Very fearful. We asked the question just this weekend of voters around the country, and the question described the Great Depression of the 1930s, which a lot of Americans are not old enough to remember.</p><p>The question said, \"In the '30s, the U.S. went through a depression in which roughly one of American workers were unemployed, banks failed, and millions of people were temporarily homeless or unable to feed their families. How likely is it that something like this could happen again now?\"</p><p>A solid 59 percent of Americans thought it was very likely or somewhat likely that what we are headed for in this country is another Great Depression. That is a very frightening number. Just 42 percent believe that it is not likely. So nearly 60 percent think another Great Depression is likely. How do they feel about economic conditions in the country today? Just 16 percent describe economic conditions as good, 84 percent says those conditions are, in fact, poor.</p><p>How will this affect you, the ordinary American? Thirty-six percent say they expect this economic crisis to affect them immediately. Another 19 percent say within the year. So that's a majority of Americans expect to feel the impact of this economic crisis within the next year.</p><p>There's a lot of concern, a lot of anxiety around the country right now. And this interviewing was done over the weekend, before today's news -- T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: Well, we hate to see those numbers after today's news. And 16 percent in those numbers say the conditions are good. A lot of people probably wondering, where in the world are those 16 percent, because this economy is affecting everybody.</p><p>Bill Schneider, thank you so much there in Nashville, where the debate will take place tomorrow night.</p><p>And, of course, the presidential candidates, it's their second of three debates. Tuesday night, make sure you watch it right here, CNN, with the best political team on television.</p><p>We will turn back now -- keeping an eye on the financial markets. We've been keeping an eye on the Dow this morning, keeping an eye on that index. Well, the Nasdaq not faring so well either.</p><p>Poppy Harlow, I will come to you. It's not a matter of asking how are things there, it's just a matter of asking how bad are they.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM: Yes. Well, at the Nasdaq, they're the worst for the all the major averages. Worse than the Dow, worse than the S&amp;P. The Nasdaq is down 5.5 percent right now. Want to talk about why that is.</p><p>There's a lot of big tech companies traded here -- Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco. Some companies all of you out there might be invested in. They're getting beaten up because when financial institutions fail, when there's a crisis on Wall Street, it affects their business in a big way. Lehman Brothers, those names, are some of their biggest clients.</p><p>Also, you might know this, though. A lot of regional banks are traded on the Nasdaq, names like Zions. That might be your bank. Or names like Fifth Third Bank Corp.</p><p>Zions is down 5 percent. That's a big bank in Utah and across the Southwest. Fifth Third Bank Corp. down 9 percent. That's big in Indiana and in Michigan.</p><p>This is not just a Wall Street problem. This is a Main Street problem. This is affecting these small banks as well. That's why you're seeing this index down so much. And the Nasdaq is down more than 30 percent, T.J., so far this year.</p><p>I want to also turn to something else. That's called the Volatility Index. It's the VIX.</p><p>I have it on the board behind me. It is down. Take a look at it there.</p><p>It's up 19 percent in a single day. It is over 50 points right now. In September, it was about 20 points. That is a huge change.</p><p>What the Volatility Index does is it really measures how much people think there is going to be a swing in the markets. There are massive bets being placed on big swings in the market right now, mostly to the downside.</p><p>The reading we're seeing on the VIX today, the highest since, get this, 1989. People are incredibly worried. It's a massive, massive jump for that index, T.J. So that's playing into things a lot. And it's interesting to see the Nasdaq, these tech companies, these regional banks, feeling the pressure even more than the Dow right now -- T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: All right. And we know, Poppy -- you stand by there with us. We know you talked to some traders there today as well. Certainly want to hear what they're talking about.</p><p>We want to let our viewers know we're standing by here. We're waiting to hear from <person><nameText>President Bush.</nameText></person></p><p><person><nameText>President Bush </nameText></person>made some comments today about the economy, certainly talking about that financial package that was put into place just last week by the Congress and signed by the president, a $700 billion package. Well, it hasn't really made people feel better about the markets. We still see a drop in all those indices, but here's the president here in Texas about to make comments here about this.</p><p>We're just getting this in. So let's go ahead here and listen in to the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>GEORGE. W. BUSH</nameText></person>, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A very illuminating conversation with small business owners here. We have a car dealer, an automobile repair shop, a restaurateur, two restaurateurs. And it's clear that these small business owners are dealing with the effects of a credit crunch.</p><p>And by that, I mean they're having trouble getting money to be able to continue to either expand their business or to be able to -- for money to help their consumers be able to buy their products. And it's -- and I told them one of the reasons why I was so strongly for this rescue package was, inherent in the strategy of the rescue package is to free up credit, just to get money moving. And it's going to take a while. I signed the bill on -- last week, but it's going to take a while to get in place a program that, one, is effective, and, two, that doesn't waste taxpayers' money. We don't want to rush into this situation and not have the program be effective.</p><p>It's going to take a while to restore confidence in the financial system. But one thing people can be certain of is that the bill I signed is a big step toward solving this problem.</p><p>A lot of the people here in Texas and around the country are not pleased with the government having to take the steps they took. Their question is, I pay my bills, I pay my mortgage, why are you helping Wall Street?</p><p>And the answer is because had we not done anything, people like the folks behind me would be a lot worse off. We'll make sure as time goes on this doesn't happen again. In the meantime, we've got to solve the problem. And that's why people sent me to Washington, D.C. When you see a problem, put a team together and solve it.</p><p>And I want to thank you all for your time. I'm glad to be back here in Texas. I miss my friends in Texas.</p><p>I am -- people say, \"You looking forward to coming home?\" Yes, I'm looking forward to living here, but in the meantime, it looks like I'm going to have a lot of work to do between today and when the new president takes office. But Laura and I are glad to be with our friends.</p><p>And thank you for your time. Thank you all very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: The president saying there he's not going to be able to vacation his way out of his job. He has work to do in Washington, certainly with this financial mess.</p><p>Listening to the president there talking about -- really echoing some of those sentiments, a lot of things we heard leading up to that whole $700 billion package. It's bad now, but you can imagine, it's going to worse if we don't have this package. Also talking about it's going to take a while, don't want to rush into things, going to take a while to restore confidence.</p><p>Well, Kathleen Koch standing by for us at the White House now.</p><p>Kathleen, I don't know. A lot of the people were saying, why do we have to rush into getting this bill passed? Lawmakers said we needed to. Now that it's passed, the president saying we need to take our time here and do it right.</p><p>I guess is that the new theme now, now we need to slow things down?</p><p>KATHLEEN KOCH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, T.J., the White House clearly -- though they now have the authority, the administration has the authority to buy these bad mortgages and other failed assets from these banks, clearly they have to set up a system to make it happen. And the President is -- and the treasury secretary have been very clear on that point, that it is -- it's not the kind of thing that happens overnight.</p><p>They've never done this sort of thing before. And again, you want to do it right, you want to do it with proper oversight. So I don't think any in Congress either would take issue with that, with the president saying we are going to take some time.</p><p>I think a lot of people have some questions about, well, hey, what's happening with the market now? We thought we passed this bailout package on -- this rescue plan on Friday, and this would bring calm and stability to the markets. And certainly that was something that the administration had hoped would occur as well.</p><p>When I reached out to the deputy press secretary, Tony Fratto, to see what the administration thought about the plunge in U.S. markets, and obviously also the plunge overseas, he said that they don't comment on daily market activity. But commenting on what's happening overseas, Fratto did point out that -- he said the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, other government agencies, are working with their counterparts overseas to try to bring some stability to the global financial crisis. And he said that the administration is \"confident\" that sustained attention to the root causes of the crisis will eventually bring that stability and confidence.</p><p>But right now, T.J., it appears there's not a lot that anyone can do to stop the markets from doing what they want. And right now it's plunged.</p><p>HOLMES: And that is what they're doing, some 477 points down now.</p><p>Kathleen Koch for us at the White House.</p><p>Kathleen, thank you so much.</p><p>KOCH: You bet.</p><p>HOLMES: We'll also be looking into -- the Supreme Court coming up next. They are back in session today. What will the impact of the election have on that court? We'll ask our senior legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin. He's coming up next.</p><p>HOLMES: Well, it is issue #1 right there on the campaign trail. And right there what you're seeing, 472 points down, the Dow. The Nasdaq also down some 5 percent today. World markets tanked overnight. We're just seeing a lack of confidence right now in the markets despite that $700 billion bailout package that is in place now here in the U.S.</p><p>We are keeping an eye on all things economy related for you today.</p><p>Also want to turn now back to something else going on. The Supreme Court, they're back in session today. And certainly some major news being made out of there. One in particular about the case of Troy Davis. You may remember this name. He was on death row for a long time here in the state of Georgia, actually.</p><p>Kelli Arena is there at the Supreme Court.</p><p>What has been the movement, or what is the news on this particular case?</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, as you said, Troy Davis has been on death row there in Georgia since 1993. He was convicted of killing an off-duty police officer there in Savannah.</p><p>There have been some questions regarding that case of whether or not witness testimony was indeed reliable. After several witnesses had testified that he was indeed the person who shot and killed that police officer, they recanted that testimony. Of course, Mr. Davis has claimed that he was innocent all along, and so there's been a large spotlight on that case.</p><p>What the Supreme Court decided -- was supposed to decide on that case today, whether or not they were going to consider that appeal or not. Earlier, our guidance was that they had passed on that. But I want to clarify and make sure that we get this correct.</p><p>What the Supreme Court has done is nothing yet. What they're going to take this up on Friday instead. So Troy Davis still has a chance that his case could be heard before the Supreme Court.</p><p>He was supposed to be executed just a couple of weeks ago. That execution was stayed, obviously, while both sides are waiting for the courts to decide. So we should get a definitive answer on whether or not the Supreme Court justices will hear his appeal on Friday. And we did not get proper guidance earlier. I want to make sure our viewers know, Friday is the day.</p><p>HOLMES: Friday is the day, so he still has a chance for the Supreme Court to take..</p><p>ARENA: He still has a chance, absolutely.</p><p>HOLMES: ... up his case.</p><p>ARENA: A very controversial case.</p><p>HOLMES: OK. OK. Friday is the day.</p><p>Kelli Arena, thank you so much for that.</p><p>ARENA: You're welcome.</p><p>HOLMES: And of course the first Monday in October, we see the Supreme Court beginning that new term today. Well, the biggest decision of the year though may come Election Day.</p><p>Our senior legal correspondent, Jeffrey Toobin, the author of the book \"The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court,\" so he knows a little bit about what's happening up there.</p><p>Jeff joins me now from New York.</p><p>Jeff, a lot of things going on out there on the campaign trail. You know, usually, the Supreme Court is at least a part of the back and forth in a debate during an election time. Well, here we are, they're back in the news. They're starting their session today.</p><p>So will voters now stop and think, wait a minute, how could this change the makeup of this court? And that's going to be an issue now on the campaign trail for the last month?</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SR. LEGAL ANALYST: Well, perhaps they should, but every indication I've seen is that the Supreme Court, yet again, will not be a major issue in this campaign. The economy has just swamped everything. But if people want to think about what the impact of the next president is going to be, the Supreme Court almost certainly will be the 44th president's perhaps most important legacy.</p><p>The court now is divided -- four very conservative justices, four liberal justices, Anthony Kennedy in the middle -- deciding case after case. Three of those liberals are likely to resign in the next few years, so the next president may have the opportunity to move the court way to the right or keep it more or less the way it is.</p><p>HOLMES: OK. Well, again, you say you never see this. I guess, what would it take? I guess -- and what do they have, I guess, on their schedule for this particular session? Is there any particular case that will certainly jump out at people? And then, again, like you say, voters are really not going to make this that big of a deal. But still, what could possibly get voter's attention.</p><p>TOOBIN: Well, certainly the Troy Davis case is the big case at the moment. And there's a very interesting legal issue in that case. You'd think it would have been resolved by now, but here it is. Is it constitutional to execute an innocent person? The Supreme Court has never answered that question. And this case may present it if they decide to take it up.</p><p>Another, not so important but actually interesting kind of case, is the Federal Communications Commission has levied fines against television (ph) networks for stray expletives. Remember, Cher said some things she shouldn't have said. And Bono said some things. Can you fine a network for expletives that they didn't plan or know was going to happen.</p><p>Certainly there are going to be more cases about Guantanamo Bay. That issue has been a constant throughout the Bush years. And always, in the background, abortion and affirmative action likely to come up. If not this year, very soon. HOLMES: And again, the likelihood, like you said, possible that three of the liberal judges could be stepping down in the next several years. None of the conservatives, we're going to lose them any time soon.</p><p>TOOBIN: Doesn't look that way, although, you know, you never know how people's health is going to go, but you've got -- the older justices on the liberal side and that tends to be the people who leave first.</p><p>HOLMES: There it is. All right, Jeff Toobin.</p><p>Sir, thank you so much. Good to see you this morning.</p><p>TOOBIN: See you, T.J.</p><p>HOLMES: Oil prices continue to fall. That would, you know, normally be good news to people. But the reason the oil prices are falling is anything but good. CNN.com's Poppy Harlow on our Energy Fix today from New York, from the Nasdaq.</p><p>You've been covering all kind of stuff for us. So what's the word on these oil prices?</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, we're here at the Nasdaq because of the volatility in the stock market, but there's a lot of volatility in the oil market, which you would see right downtown from here at the NYMEX. The New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil is down more than $4 right now. It is right now below $90 a barrel. We haven't seen that since February.</p><p>This would be welcome news, but the reason behind it is not welcoming at all. We are hugely off of that record high we saw of over $147 a barrel back in July. That has to do with the fundamental of supply and demand. Traders selling off their oil contracts because they are concerned that around the world the demand for oil and the products that use oil is not going to be anywhere near where it was this summer.</p><p>What that means for you, your gas prices are down for a 19th straight day, $3.50 a gallon right now according to AAA. But again, it all has to do with that sinking global economy. It's not just how many cars will run on gasoline, it's the demand for the products that take petroleum, that take oil to make them, T.J.</p><p>So some bad news today. Oil down again. I guess good news if you have to heat your home and fill your take. But otherwise, bad fundamentals behind it.</p><p>HOLMES: The fundamentals. And, I guess, it's common supply and demand and people -- it's, you know.</p><p>Poppy Harlow for us there at the Nasdaq. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. Keeping an eye on all that stuff for us.</p><p>We want to turn now back to that $700 billion bailout package. It passed Congress. No immediate silver bullet, however, as we've been seeing for borrowers. We will explain why straight ahead. Stay with us.</p><p>HOLMES: The Dow Jones Industrial average about 500 points down today. Ten thousand below that number for the first time in four years. It's sitting there at about 9,800. Our Susan Lisovicz, Ali Velshi both keeping an eye on the markets for us today. There they both are. Good to see you both.</p><p>Susan, I am going to start with you.</p><p>We've still got another three and a half hours to watch this board. What are we going to be seeing?</p><p>LISOVICZ: Well, you know, it's very volatile. I know Poppy was talking to you earlier about this index. The fear index. The volatility index. It's called the VIX. And it's at very, very high levels. It might be at an all-time high.</p><p>So things are volatile. A lot of the investors are afraid. And you can't predict when you have emotions running the market. But we have seen the market selling off now for a period of time. We are well into a bear market.</p><p>And the headlines today are clearly showing that the distress we're seeing in the U.S. financial market is not limited to this market. We've seen extraordinary measures occurring today and over the weekend to bolster banking systems overseas. The German government agreed on a nearly $70 billion bailout of a lender there. A French bank, BNP Paribas, agreed to acquire a big stake in a Belgian bank. And also, a number of governments, like Germany, Ireland, Iceland, guaranteeing bank deposits.</p><p>You know, a few years ago all you had to do was breath and you could get a loan. Now you have companies like GE, with a AAA credit rating, that strike a deal with Warren Buffett to inject some cash into the company. And at very favorable rates, I might add, for Warren Buffett. So credit is just basically frozen.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is doubling its auctions of cash to banks. That was announced today. And I saw an interesting quote, T.J. that -- from one analyst who says, it's pretty much all out war. They're pulling out all the stops to try and get borrowers and lenders to meet and do transactions once again. To do what they used to do maybe a year ago. Once we start to see the credit bubble really burst, these are different times we're living in.</p><p>In any case, I know Poppy mentioned oil. Oil is falling. And you're seeing safe havens. A real attraction today. Gold is up about 3.5 percent. As for stocks, 3,000 of them are trading to the downside here, T.J. A hundred of them are higher. So let's end it on a bright note.</p><p>Hartford Financial Services. Let's hear it for an insurance company. Its shares are up 11.5 percent because a German firm, Allianz, is injecting $2.5 billion into Hartford. So Hartford, right now, is one of those 100 stocks that are moving higher today.</p><p>HOLMES: All right. Susan Lisovicz there for us at the New York Stock Exchange. All you had to do was breathe and you could get a loan. That's a heck of a way to put it. You certainly have to do more than that right now.</p><p>We will turn now to -- actually we're going to have our Ali Velshi stand by. We're going to listen in to Richard Fuld. He's the CEO of Lehman Brothers. There testifying at a committee on Capitol Hill. Let's listen in to his opening statement.</p><p>RICHARD FULD, LEHMAN BROTHERS CEO: Today, there is unprecedented turmoil in our capital markets. Nobody, including me, anticipated how the problems that started in the mortgage markets would spread to our credit markets and our banking system and now threaten our entire financial system and our country. Like many other financial institutions, Lehman Brothers got caught in this financial tsunami.</p><p>But I want to be very clear. I take full responsibility for the decisions that I made and for the actions that I took. Based on the information that we had at the time, I believed that these decisions and actions were both prudent and appropriate. None of us ever gets the opportunity to turn back the clock. But with the benefit of hindsight, would I have done things differently? Yes, I would have.</p><p>As painful as this is for all of the people affected by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, this is not just about Lehman Brothers. These problems are not limited to Wall Street or even main street. This is a crisis for the global economy.</p><p>We live in a world where large investment, large independent U.S. investment banks are now extinct. Where AIG and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are under government control. And where major institutions are being rescued. And where regulators are engaged in a daily struggle to stabilize the financial system.</p><p>In this environment, it's not surprising that the media coverage of Lehman's demise has been right with rumors and inaccuracies. I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight for this committee and to be as helpful as possible in explaining why we ultimately could not prevent a bankruptcy filing. And then I want to respond to your questions.</p><p>I'm a Lehman lifer. I joined as an intern in 1966 and got a full-time job as a commercial paper trader while earning my business degree at night. In 1994, when Lehman Brothers was spun out of American Express as a separate company and I became the CEO, we were a small, domestic bond firm. By 2007, we had built Lehman into a diversified global firm with 28,000 employees.</p><p>I feel a deep, personal connection to those 28,000 great people. Many of whom have dedicated their entire careers to Lehman Brothers. I feel horrible about what has happened to the company and its effects on so many. My colleagues, my shareholders, creditors and my clients. As CEO, I was a significant shareholder and my long-term financial interests were completely aligned with those of all the other shareholders. No one had more incentive to see Lehman Brothers succeed. And because I believed so deeply in the company, I never sold the vast majority of my Lehman Brothers stocks and still owned 10 million when we filed for bankruptcy.</p><p>As I said following the spin off of Lehman Brothers from American Express, our business was almost exclusively in fixed income. We recognized the need for diversification. And over the subsequent 14 years, we built and required significant equity in asset management businesses. We established a presence in 28 countries. We also continually strengthened our risk management infrastructure.</p><p>Lehman Brothers did have a significant presence in the mortgage market. This should not be surprising though. U.S. residential mortgages are an $11 trillion market. More than twice the size of the U.S. Treasury market. And a serious participant in the fixed income businesses had a significant presence in the mortgage market.</p><p>As the environment changed, we took numerous actions to reduce our risk. We strengthened our balance sheet, reduced leverage, improved liquidity, closed our mortgage origination businesses and reduced our exposure to troubled assets. We also raised over $10 billion in new capital.</p><p>We explored converting into a bank holding company. We looked at a wide range of strategic alternatives, including spinning off our commercial real estate assets to our shareholders. We also considered selling part or all of the company. We approached many potential investors, but in a market paralyzed by a crisis in confidence, none of these decisions came to fruition. Indeed, contrary to what you may have read, I never turned down an offer to buy Lehman Brothers.</p><p>Throughout 2008, the SEC and the Federal Reserve conducted regular, and at times daily oversight of our business and our balance sheet. They saw what we saw in realtime as they reviewed our liquidity and our funding, our capital, risk management and our mark to market process.</p><p>As the crisis in confidence spread throughout the capital markets, naked short sellers targeted financial institutions and spread rumors and false information. The impact of this market manipulation became self-fulfilling as short sellers drove down the stock prices of financial firms. The rating agencies lowered their ratings because lower stock prices made it harder to raise capital and reduce financial flexibility. The downgrades in turn caused lenders and counter parties to reduce credit lines and then demand more collateral which increased liquidity pressures.</p><p>At Lehman Brothers, the crisis in confidence that permeated the markets led to an extraordinary run on the bank. In the end, despite all of our efforts, we were overwhelmed. However, what happened to Lehman Brothers could have happened to any financial institution and almost did happen to others. Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch all were trapped in this vicious cycle. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs also came under attack. Lehman's demise was brought on by many destabilizing factors. The collapse of the real estate market, naked short attacks, false rumors, widening spreads on credit default swaps, rating agency downgrades, a loss of confidence by clients and counter parties and buyers sitting on the sidelines waiting for an assisted deal.</p><p>Again, this is not just a Lehman Brothers story, it's now an all too familiar tale. It is too late for Lehman Brothers, but the government has now been forced to dramatically change the rules and provide substantial support to other institutions.</p><p>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. And if I can be helpful to this committee in any way to understand how we got here and what our country can do to move forward, I am happy to do so.</p><p>Thank you, sir.</p><p>REP. HENRY WAXMAN, (D) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Fuld.</p><p>Without objection, the chair and the ranking member will control 10 minutes, which they can use or reserve and use at a subsequent time. And hearing no objection, that will be the order.</p><p>The chair will recognize himself.</p><p>Mr. Fuld, the committee -- our economy requested all the documents relating to your salary, bonuses and stock sales. The committee staff put together a chart, which I hope will come up on the screen. This chart will show your compensation for the last eight years. It shows your base salary, your cash bonuses and your stock sales. In 2000, you received over $52 million. In 2001, that increased to $98 million. It dipped for a few years and then, in 2005, you took home $89 million. In 2006, you made a huge stock sale and you received over $100 million in that year alone. Are these figures basically accurate?</p><p>FULD: Sir, if those are the documents that we provided to you, I would assume they are.</p><p>WAXMAN: OK.</p><p>The bottom line is that since 2000, you've taken home more than $480 million. That's almost half a billion dollars. And that's difficult to comprehend for a lot of people. Your company is now bankrupt, our economy is in a state of crisis, but you get to keep $480 million. I have a very basic question for you. Is this fair?</p><p>FULD: Mr. Chairman, your first question was about this slide, are those numbers accurate. They are accurate the way you have put them up on that slide. But I believe your number of cash and salary bonuses are accurate. The option exercises the way you have them portrayed here I believe represent a full option without the strike price. And the only reason I exercised those options was because they came due at maturity. If I had not exercised those, I would have lost them. There was that stock sale.</p><p>WAXMAN: Well, I'll leave the record open for you to give me any changes in that list, but basically, didn't you take home around $400 million to $500 million as the head of Lehman Brothers for the last -- since 2000 to now?</p><p>FULD: The majority of my stock, sir, came -- excuse me, the majority of my compensation came as stock. The vast majority of the stock that I got, I still owned at the point of our filing.</p><p>WAXMAN: the stock is in addition to the numbers that I've indicated because those were your salary and your bonuses. Now, you had bonuses and, in addition to that, you had some stock sales. You've lost some money of the stock that you've received as compensation, which you received as compensation on top of these other figures. So you've been able to pocket close to half a million dollars. And my question to you is, a lot of people ask, is that fair for the CEO of a company that's now bankrupt to have made that kind of money? It's just unimaginable to so many people.</p><p>FULD: I would say to you the 500 number is not accurate. I would say to you that although it's still a large number, I think for the years that you're talking about here, I believe my cash compensation was close to 60 million, which you have indicated here. And I believe the amount that I took out of the company over and above that was, I believe, a little bit less than 250 million. Still a large number though.</p><p>WAXMAN: Still a large amount of money.. You have a $14 million ocean front home in Florida. You have a summer vacation home in Sun Valley, Idaho. Yet you and your wife have an art collection filled with million dollar paintings. Your former president, Joe Gregory (ph), used to travel to work in his own private helicopter.</p><p>I guess people wonder, if you made all this money by taking risks with other people's money, you could have done other things. You had high leverage. Thirty to one and higher. You didn't pay out billions of dollars in dividends and you didn't have to pay out these millions of dollars in dividends and bonuses. You could have saved some of these funds for the lean times, but you didn't.</p><p>Do you think it's fair and do you have any recommendations on fundamental reforms that would bring a new approach to executive compensation, because it seems that the system worked for you, but it didn't seem to work for the rest of the country and the taxpayers who now have to pay up to $700 billion to bail out our economy. We can't continue to have a system where Wall Street executives privatize all the gains and then socialize the losses. Accountability needs to be a two-way street.</p><p>Do you disagree with that? And do you have any recommendations what we ought to be doing in this area? FULD: Mr. Chairman, we had a compensation committee that spent a tremendous amount of time making sure that the interests of the executives and the employees were aligned with shareholders. My employees owned close to 30 percent of our company. And that was because we wanted them to think, act and behave like shareholders. When the company did well, we did well. When the company did not do well, sir, we did not do well.</p><p>WAXMAN: Well, Mr. Fuld, there's seems to be a break down because you did very well when the company was doing well and you did very well when the company wasn't doing well. And now your shareholders, who owned your company, have nothing. I'm going to reserve the balance of my time and we're going to go on to other members.</p><p>Mr. Shays.</p><p>REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS, (R) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: If you'd yield me two minutes.</p><p>Gentlemen, Mr. Fuld, I'd like to ask you first, who appoints the compensation committee?</p><p>FULD: The compensation committee is now appointed by the corporate governance committee of the board.</p><p>SHAYS: But did you have a major role in appointing the compensation committee?</p><p>FULD: I believe I had more of the role in the early or mid-90s. Clearly less of a role these last number of years.</p><p>SHAYS: And then, finally, of the 10 million shares that you had in the company, that's what you have right now, 10 million shares?</p><p>FULD: No. I don't have the exact amount. I think it's closer to 8 million shares. And that does not include the options that expired worthless. Well, actually, they haven't expired. That are still there, with a longer term vesting, but with a much higher strike price than, obviously, where the stock is today.</p><p>SHAYS: Thank you.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Shays.</p><p>I want to recognize Miss Maloney for five minutes.</p><p>REP. CAROLYN MALONEY, (D) OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>We are in a financial crisis and we lost four major investment banks in a week and taxpayers have been called upon to assume a potential $1.7 billion in taxpayer liability to backstop our financial institutions. During this hearing today, we've seen a long list of examples of deregulation and we've heard about the net capital rule, which was eliminated so that Lehman and other investment banks could ramp up their leverage to very dangerous, high levels, putting their institutions at risk. And for almost 30 years, this rule kept investment banks from taking on debt more than 12 times the value of the banks investments. Firms were required to stop trading if their debt exceeded that ratio.</p><p>As a result, most investment banks did not take on excessive debt. Yet this report in \"The New York Times,\" and I'd like permission to have it referenced or put in the record . . .</p><p>WAXMAN: Without objection.</p><p>MALONEY: Last Friday called the agency 04 (ph) rule let banks pile up new debt. And many people feel that this was a major cause of the crisis. And they reference a meeting in April of 2004.</p><p>And I'd like to ask you, where you at that meeting? Did you lobby for this change? Why did Lehman want to increase its leverage? And, in hindsight, do you think the SEC rule -- that changing this SEC rule was appropriate for protecting safety and soundness, the stability of our markets and taxpayers' money?</p><p>FULD: Congresswoman, I was not at that meeting, I believe, in 2004. And I do not recall if any other of my people were there.</p><p>I had a chance to, while I was sitting in the waiting room, I saw, I would assume, almost all of the first panel (ph). The information about leverage, I think, has been grossly misunderstood. There are two numbers. One is gross leverage and one is net leverage.</p><p>Gross leverage includes, and excuse me if I get technical. If I get to technical, please stop me. Close to half of our balance sheet, if not more, was what we called the matched book. The matched book was predominantly government securities and agencies that we took on our balance sheet to finance for our clients.</p><p>We were one of the top U.S. Treasury government traders and financiers, meaning financing the U.S. government debt, and we supplied a tremendous amount of liquidity to institutional investors that owned U.S. government debt and agencies. At times, that was as high as 300 to probably more, $300 billion. I heard some of the earlier remarks about, if you lost 3 percent or 4 percent of that, for the match book, those are government securities. So the real number, the effective number is net leverage.</p><p>MALONEY: So did you lobby for this capital rule change? And do you think it contributed to the financial instability and loss of safety and soundness in financial institutions such as your own that allowed this increased leverage?</p><p>FULD: I, myself, did not lobby for the increased leverage.</p><p>MALONEY: Did Lehman Brothers lobby for it?</p><p>FULD: I'm not aware of that. MALONEY: I would like to ask you, now that we have the opportunity of looking back, and we want to look forward on what needs to be done, if you had to give government advice on how we could strengthen the safety and soundness of our institutions and the accountability and transparency that all of us want, what would you recommend? To change the system?</p><p>FULD: In my written testimony, I spoke about the need for additional regulation and new regulation, because when the original regulations were written, it was a very different environment. I believe there were 10 million shares a day traded, and today there are close to 5 billion shares traded.</p><p>The electronic connectivity today, not only within this country, but country to country. Investors today, given that electronic activity, have the right to move their money to the highest-returning asset. And money moves very quickly and freely. So it's not just about regulation within the U.S. I believe this also more of the matrix regulation that is more global in nature.</p><p>I would focus also, on capitol requirements. Capital requirements meaning more capital for less liquid assets, and a more robust understanding of mark to market, which I believe is one of the pillars of the new plan. Mark to market during periods of stress create one set of numbers and, obviously, in a functioning non-credit crisis environment, produce another set of numbers.</p><p>WAXMAN: Your prepared statement, which has these recommendations, are in the record. And we want to move on to other questions. Did you want to add one last point?</p><p>FULD: Yes, please. And the other is something I strongly believe in, is the creation of what I call a master netting system, where all capital market counterparties download, each night, all their transactions to one local spot, first in the U.S., and then eventually, hopefully, make that global. That's about all transactions and trades. It's about positions. It's about capital. It's about leverage -- excuse me.</p><p>And it would give whatever regulators, then in control of that master netting system, a complete view of the financial landscape, the available capital to each and every asset class, flexibility within those asset classes, and vulnerability within those asset classes, and vulnerability of one institution versus the next.</p><p>What I am proposing is clearly expensive, costly, but by comparison to the unprecedented regulation this Congress just passed, it is a fraction and, I believe, money well spent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. Mr. Mica. Five minutes.</p><p>REP. JOHN MICA (R-FL), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>And looking at, first, your comment on Lehman Brothers primarily dealing in some -- for most of its history. FULD: Sir, I apologize. I cannot hear you. I'm sorry.</p><p>MICA: Can you hear me now?</p><p>FULD: Yes, thank you.</p><p>MICA: Again, you -- when you opened your statement, you said that Lehman Brothers was around for, what, 150 years, dealt in some pretty hard assets and some secure investments. You've been around a while. What -- what turned the corner for you to get into some more speculative ventures like subprime and some of the other, again, riskier investments?</p><p>FULD: As I said in my verbal testimony, our participation in the mortgage-related businesses was clearly a natural for us, given our dominance in fixed income. That was something that went back a number of years.</p><p>Even as I listened, as I say, to the panel before me, they correctly pointed out that this was a goal of the government: to provide funding and mortgages to a number of people that typically would not or could not have received a mortgage.</p><p>MICA: One of your big -- well, one of the big package or yours, or the competitor, so to speak, was Fannie Mae, which was deep into this. And you were -- you were dealing in some of the paper, I think, for secondary markets and other securitized mortgage paper to basically package it and make money off it. Is that right?</p><p>FULD: Yes, sir.</p><p>MICA: What was Lehman Brothers' exposure to the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? And what role did their collapse play in precipitating some of your financial troubles? Did it matter?</p><p>FULD: Our exposure to both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was de minimis, sir.</p><p>MICA: OK. But their collapse, did that help precipitate any problems with your firm?</p><p>FULD: It certainly set the stage for an environment, as I talked about loss of confidence and credit-crisis mentality that permeated our market, clearly set -- set the stage for investors losing confidence, counterparties asking for additional collateral. And clearly an environment that lost liquidity, which is the life blood of the capitol market system.</p><p>MICA: I notice -- I notice some questions were asked about your political participation. I pulled Lehman Brothers' contributions -- contributions to federal candidates for the last ten years. Fortunately, I didn't find my name there, but -- not like some of the other members of Congress.</p><p>I added some of this up. It's about $300,000 that you gave to influence members of Congress. I also got your personal, which wasn't much. You probably bet a bit too much on Hillary, too. But this is -- this is pretty much the extent of your financial contributions? Members of Congress to lobby...</p><p>FULD: I -- I believe that that was a result of Lehmans' PAC...</p><p>MICA: Right.</p><p>FULD: ... which was not corporate moneys.</p><p>MICA: Right, right. I'm just telling you. Wait till you hear this one. If you haven't discovered your role, you're the villain today, so you've got to act like the villain here.</p><p>But guess what Fannie Mae did in the same period of time? A hundred and seventy-five million dollars in lobbying contracts over ten years. Does that surprise you? You were out-lobbied. It sounds like, rather than just some greed on Wall Street, we had a little greed in Washington. What would you say to that?</p><p>FULD: I think that's more of a matter for your committee, sir.</p><p>WAXMAN: Gentleman's time has expired.</p><p>MICA: Thank you.</p><p>WAXMAN: We now go to Mr. Cummings.</p><p>REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-MD), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Mr. Fuld, I really appreciate that you began your testimony by taking full responsibility for the company's downfall which occurred on your watch, but there are some concerns that I want to get to.</p><p>As you know, the American taxpayer, many of them, our constituents, just -- we just passed legislation giving $700 billion to rescue Wall Street. One complaint that I've heard over and over again from my constituents is that there seems to be a complete lack of accountability. They see Wall Street executives like you walking away with millions of dollars.</p><p>It was very interesting. When you were talking about the chart that Mr. Waxman was -- showed you on the board, you said that it was inaccurate. But I'm going to discount it for you. And sort of $448 million over eight years. Let's say 350. How about that, 350? Is that OK? Can we discount it a little bit? You said it was not accurate. What would you say is accurate?</p><p>FULD: I'd say that's closer, sir.</p><p>CUMMINGS: OK. I want to ask you about one of the e-mails obtained by the committee. On June 9, 2008, a former top Lehman executive -- can you hear me OK?</p><p>FULD: Yes, sir. CUMMINGS: Benoit Gangelon (ph) sent an e-mail to Hugh McGee, who was the global head of investment banking at Lehman. The e-mail says that many bankers has been calling in the last few days, and the mood has become truly awful. It warns that, and I -- quote -- \"all of the hard work we have put in could unravel very quickly,\" end of quote.</p><p>And it offers the following advice. It says, \"Some senior managers have to be much less arrogant and internally admit that major mistakes have been made. We can't continue to say we are great and the market doesn't understand.\" End of quote.</p><p>Mr. McGee forwarded this e-mail to you on the same day and explained that it was representative -- representative of many others. When you read the e-mail -- and this is interesting -- what was your action -- reaction? I'm just curious.</p><p>FULD: Sorry, sir. What was the date? I'm sorry.</p><p>CUMMINGS: That would be June 9, 2008. You remember that e-mail?</p><p>FULD: I do not. I do not recount.</p><p>CUMMINGS: Well, let me -- let me try to refresh your recollection a little bit. Let me tell you what you did, since you don't remember the e-mail. Here's what happened.</p><p>You didn't take any personal responsibility. Instead, three days later, Mr. Fuld, on June 12, you fired Erin Allen [SIC], your chief financial officer, and Joseph Gregory, your chief operating officer. But you know, you stayed on and admitted no mistakes. You were CEO. Why didn't you take responsibility? Like today, you said you took full responsibility. Why didn't you take responsibility for Lehmans' mistakes? Why did you continue to say, quote, \"We are great and the market doesn't understand\"?</p><p>In your testimony today, right here, right now, you continued to deflect personal responsibility. You cite what you call a litany of reasons for Lehmans' bankruptcy. Mr. Fuld, I want you to -- I want to ask you about your personal responsibility, since you've taken it. Do you agree that Lehman took on excessive leverage under your leadership? Please answer yes or no.</p><p>FULD: It's not that easy. I would say to you our leverage at times was higher, but as we entered this difficult market over this last year, we continued to bring our leverage down so that, even at the point, Congressman, on September 10, when we announced our third- quarter results, we had grossly reduced our balance sheet by close to 200 billion, specifically around residential mortgages and commercial real estate and leverage loans.</p><p>CUMMINGS: Mr. Fuld -- Mr. Fuld, I've only got -- I've got about less than a minute. I've got to get this question in. I assume your answer is no? I'm just giving you the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>FULD: At the end of the day, we worked hard. Our leverage was way down. One of the best... CUMMINGS: All right. Let me ask you...</p><p>FULD: Sorry, sir. One of the best leverage ratios on the street, and our Tier 1 capital was one of the highest.</p><p>CUMMINGS: So you feel -- you feel comfortable with that, what you did? Is that right? That's not one of the things that you said your...</p><p>FULD: Yes, sir.</p><p>CUMMINGS: OK, fine. Do you regret spending $10 billion in Lehmans' cash reserves on bonuses, stock dividends and stock buybacks as your firm faced a liquidity crisis? Do you regret that now?</p><p>FULD: I heard some of that while I was in the other room. I think that is a misunderstanding, which I'd like to clear up.</p><p>CUMMINGS: Well, let me go back to -- go ahead. You go ahead. I'm sorry.</p><p>FULD: Because it's important that this committee understands exactly what that was. When I talked about my employees owning close to 30 percent, what's typical of Wall Street is you take a percentage of your revenues, and you pay your people. We asked our employees to take a big percentage of their compensation in stock.</p><p>And so what that 10 billion was -- we had close to 19 billion of revenues -- what most of that 10 billion was, was compensation to our employees that they received in stock with a five-year forward vest. So they didn't get that stock until five years, which aligned our interests, our employees, with the interests of shareholders.</p><p>To avoid dilution, because we took that 10 billion, gave it to the employees in stock, we had to take the 10 billion that they didn't get and go back into the open marketplace and buy back that stock so that we did not dilute our shareholders. And we did it each and every year. From where you sit, it just looks like we spent an extra 10 billion. That is not sir, what we did.</p><p>CUMMINGS: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>WAXMAN: Sounds like, though, to yield myself time here, that you were trying to -- not to dilute the payment to those employees while you were in a liquidity crisis. Wouldn't it have made more sense to use that money to pay off the debts that you were -- that were heavily on your shoulders at that point, and you knew that you were in a difficult situation?</p><p>FULD: At that time, at the end of the year, last year, I didn't believe that we had that problem.</p><p>WAXMAN: You didn't believe that you had a liquidity problem?</p><p>FULD: And we did not have a liquidity problem at the end of last year. We had just completed a record year, none of which, by the way, came from mortgages. We paid our people fairly and what we thought was competitive with the rest of the street.</p><p>WAXMAN: OK. I accept your answer. You didn't think you had a liquidity problem, so you were trying to make sure your employees were fully compensated.</p><p>FULD: Yes, sir.</p><p>WAXMAN: OK, thanks. Mr. Tierney (ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2008100604CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4TM9-B770-TWD3-105Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"10865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved. </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>October 6, 2008 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002HGB</classCode><className>LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp; SECURITIES DEALING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp; FLOTATION COMPANIES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Barack Obama</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John McCain</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George W.

The last small music publisher left in the Brill Building, which served as the hit factory for American pop songs in the early sixties, St. Nicholas had to go: it was moving to the Studio 54 building, a few blocks uptown. The building's new owners are clearing old tenants out, and the small warrens where songwriting teams such as Pomus and Shuman, and Leiber and Stoller, once banged out songs are being razed, in the hope that open floors will attract a big tech company.</p><p>At seventy-three, Williams, a lyricist on a handful of hits in the seventies ( Rainy Days and Mondays  may be his masterpiece), is enjoying an improbable renaissance as a songwriter: he shared the 2014 Grammy for Album of the Year with Daft Punk for  Random Access Memories.  Sure, the French electronic wizards were mainly responsible for the album, but they invited Williams to contribute, and in making the acceptance speech he became the face of the faceless duo. And what a face a cross between Ezra Pound and Burl Ives, in rose-tinted specs. To anyone who remembers the corduroyed munchkin who used to pop up regularly on the  Tonight Show  with Johnny Carson, it's some transformation.</p><p>Since 2009, ASCAP has been one of Williams's main gigs. At the Brill Building, he noted that St. Nicholas Music was the living embodiment of ASCAP's mission: to insure that its members are fairly paid when their work is used commercially, whether on the radio or in a restaurant or at a basketball game. St. Nicholas owns the copyrights to four classic Christmas songs written by the late Johnny Marks:  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,   Silver and Gold,   A Holly Jolly Christmas,  and  Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.  Marks died in 1985, but song copyrights live on for decades after the writer's death. ASCAP has sent plenty of whopping performance royalty checks through the mail slot of this door.  Rudolph  is the second-best-selling Christmas single of all time, after  White Christmas. </p><p>Williams's plan had been simply to photograph the door. But all at once it opened, and a tall man with longish gray hair emerged from the gloom.</p><p> May I help you? </p><p>He was Michael Marks, the composer's last surviving child, now sixty-five. ( I was born the same year \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRudolph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was written. ) He invited Williams in.</p><p>It was like stepping through a time portal. The walls bore layers of peeling paint from different eras. From the back windows, one half expected to see Broadway Danny Rose going down Forty-ninth Street. Every chair and flat surface, including the upright piano where Johnny Marks wrote some of his tunes, groaned under sheet music, Christmas songbooks, and old trade magazines.</p><p> There it is!  Williams cried, spying Johnny Marks's ASCAP membership certificate, dated 1940, hanging on the wall.  It's as old as the Consent Decree!  (The Consent Decree regulates ASCAP's right to collect and distribute licensing fees.)</p><p> The Consent Decree is a joke!  Marks declared, with some heat. Williams allowed that it needed to be revised for the digital age, as did some other aspects of the rights organization, which is celebrating its centennial this year. Mentioning Pandora, ASCAP's principal legal adversary these days (the Internet radio service wants to pay songwriters lower rates), Williams said,  We want a future where everyone can thrive. </p><p>Marks replied,  I'm sure Pandora would happily thrive without paying a dime to songwriters if they could!  He added,  All I know is our royalties from CD sales go down every year. </p><p>Williams said that every songwriter who has ever lived, including Phil Spector and John Lennon, wanted to write a hit Christmas song, because it pays perennially.</p><p>Marks replied,  My dad was always frustrated being the Christmas-song guy. He wrote a lot of different songs.  He gestured toward the enormous piles of Rudolphiana he was sorting through in preparation for the move.

I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it has been an awful day weather wise in the Gulf and an awful day at the corner of Wall and Broad and for your 401(k) and investment statements.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are top of each development, the situation with that hurricane. And it's a doozy, Michael at a Category 4 doing. There's a lot of flooding. There's a lot of wind. There's been reports of a good deal of damage. But it could have been a whole lot worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I wish, I wish I could say the same about what happened to the investment community today</p><p>We're on top of both dramatic developments.</p><p>By the way, I do want to kick off, though, with what happened on the financial side and what could possibly bring us to session lows down better than 3 percent, the worst single-day performance in this market. You would have to go back to early February. And you would have to go back to levels in this market that we had not seen since all the way back in August.</p><p>So, do want to step back from all this. And as bad as it was, we are simply revisiting, in the cases of some stock, levels we were last seeing about four to six weeks ago. We will get into the details on that.</p><p>But let me suffice it to say that the catalyst for all of this was an improving economy. Now, I know that sounds a little weird. But a lot of this has to do with a backup in interest rates to address that improving economy, and the notion that interest rates are going to have to go back still further and higher.</p><p>What happens with the markets is, they never really know how to digest the unexpected or the unknown. And the unknown for them is, how much is too much.</p><p>Right now, a 10-year note fetches about 3.75 percent. That is the highest we have seen in about seven years. A two-year note reaching a level today that was the highest we have seen in more than a decade.</p><p>But it's what you get used to. There were times when these were double- digit events. So, in other words, when we had a 10-year note at 10 percent or better during the late 1980s, or when we had a two-year note that was routinely double what it is now, for a while triple what it is now.</p><p>But it doesn't do much good to say that was then, this is now. It's what we have been getting used to now, better than a decade of near zero percent interest rates set by a Federal Reserve that was trying to get us out of a recession and a meltdown. It did the trick.</p><p>Now the trick is unwinding all of that, again, easier said than done.</p><p>To Charles Payne at the Nasdaq that was the not-so-pleasant beneficiary of the bulk of that selling.</p><p>So, Charles, interesting enough, a lot of those tech names that led us on this parade were the ones getting the most battered, huh?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You're absolutely right, Neil.</p><p>And it's not just today. These big tech names over the last two or three weeks have been conspicuously weak, very vulnerable, some going back to earnings. Facebook collapsed on its earnings. Netflix didn't have great earnings. Twitter came down.</p><p>But then some of the more -- even the larger names. Apple two days ago got a sell rating. That's really rare with a company like that. Amazon has its issues. A lot of this revolving around regulatory concerns, as well, which have creeped into this area because of some of the practices from all of them.</p><p>But no one, to your point, was spared. And I will go back to the Dow for a moment, because what we witness now, this year, are the three biggest, largest point losses in the history of the Dow, not percentage losses, of course. Three of the four biggest losses, of course, this year all revolved -- in fact, no, four -- four of the five all revolved around the Federal Reserve.</p><p>In February, rates started to go higher. We got a jobs report that looked like it was too hot. Everyone started to panic over what the Fed may do to slow this economy down. That sort of settled down. We were able to deal with 3 percent. But now the velocity of how quickly these rates have gone up again, these yields, again spooking the market.</p><p>But I will add, Neil, there was some fundamental news. You and I talked a little bit yesterday. It's not a household name, but Pittsburgh Plate Glass is a 135-year-old company. People know the company. You probably have some of their paint on your car, OK. So they had bad numbers.</p><p>They warned of higher prices. Today, Fastenal, again, an industrial name, not a household name, but it led the industrials lower. That was the second-worst performing sector. It was the worst-performing stock in that sector.</p><p>So some of this is interest-rate related. Some of this is higher prices. Some of is just speculation that things have been great. Can they continue?</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Charles, thank you very, very much, Charles Payne.</p><p>Again, all Dow 30 stocks were down. That is a rarity, but every single one of them down. So you don't see that often.</p><p>Also, with an 831-point in the Dow -- if we can go back to showing the Dow, guys -- that 831-point hit represents about a little more than 3 percent in the value of the Dow Jones industrials shredded today.</p><p>Now, I should hasten to add, in percentage terms, that -- that's a lot, but it's not what it was in 1987. You might recall, October 19, 1987, October, yes, it tends to be a scary time, we lost a quarter of the Dow's value in one single session, even though it represented 508 points at the time.</p><p>So I hasten to add that, just to put it in perspective, not to just gloss over this, but to put it in percentage perspective here, that we are still nominally up on the year. And even though some very big names that have led us here, like an Amazon, for example, not part of the Dow, but part of the technology run-up, that is in correction territory right now.</p><p>In other words, it has fallen more than 10 percent from its highs. So you're going to hear a lot about a lot of stocks that have fallen into correction territory or 10 percent or more from their highs. vs. bear market territory, 20 percent or further from their highs.</p><p>Now, one out of five S&amp;P 500 stocks are already in that latter camp. So we're keeping an eye on it, as is this next fellow, chief market strategist for path Trading Partners, Bob Iaccino.</p><p>Bob, thank you for joining us. What's your take on this day, whether this was overdone or justified, given the alarming run-up we have seen?</p><p>BOB IACCINO, PATH TRADING PARTNERS: Good afternoon, Neil.</p><p>To me, it's a time when we need to be responsible in terms of being in the financial media reporting on these kind of things, because these are the exact kind of moves people get scared about. They're exaggerated. They're overdone. And they tend to end up being buying opportunities, maybe not today.</p><p>But specifically this kind of move prior to earnings, with the headwinds that we see with the stock markets, from tariffs, to higher rates, to the Fed being on this trajectory, the Fed put is no longer in place now, if the Fed is taking this sort of punchbowl away.</p><p>But this is a really good time to be going into earnings and get this exaggerated sell-off, if I could point out a silver lining. If we get that 20 percent earnings growth, you're going to have some sectors and some stocks respond to the upside. From the prior levels, we wouldn't necessarily get that. We would kind of get profit-taking.</p><p>So not to say this is a good thing. It's never a good thing. You never want to see people's 401(k)s drop like this. But the timing of it, I'm kind of a fan of.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, now, we have been the market leader in the world. We have been leading this parade. In fact, as things stand now, with the European markets in the doldrums and now indications it could get worse with Italy's problems -- I don't want to get on a tangent -- of course, we know what's happened in Asia. We know what has happened to the Chinese market, of course, already well into bear market territory.</p><p>Could you envision that for us, or what?</p><p>IACCINO: No, I think it's the other way around, Neil. And I think that's why you're pointing it out.</p><p>One thing we don't see all that often is stocks and bonds going in the same direction. We do see it, but it usually doesn't sustain. We're actually seeing a little bit of stabilization in the longer end of the curve as I speak to you right now, especially that 10-year-to-30-year sector.</p><p>So I think we're actually going to get some relief on the rate side, we're going to get some good earnings, and we are likely to pull the rest of the world up. Now, we do have to see the effect of tariffs in the earnings. We didn't see it in the last earnings report, the last quarter.</p><p>We might see the start of it now. But we're also going to see in the in the next quarter some of the positives of the USMCA, some of the positives of the deal with Korea, some of the positives of the deal with -- potentially with Europe. So there might be some balance there.</p><p>I think we're actually going to lead the world out of it. The economy here is strong. This sell-off is too fast, but still the timing of it, again, I have to say I'm kind of a fan of just before earnings.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, and it is October after all. Thank you very, very much, my friend.</p><p>Again, putting in October in perspective, even though it is not technically the worst month of the year for stocks -- technically, that is September -- September ended up being a pretty good month for stocks, by and large, but the fact of the matter is, whether you're talking 2008 and the financial meltdown, or 1997 and the Asian contagion, or 1987, of course, the memorable stock market crash, or 1929, and the follow-up that brought us the Depression, it has a history of spooking us.</p><p>And it does, right?</p><p>All right, let's get the latest right now from Phil Keating in Apalachicola, Florida with the very latest on how Hurricane Michael is sorting out there.</p><p>Sir.</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>This is Apalachicola, where it was ferocious for multiple hours today. But this is pretty much -- we're still getting a gust as we speak right now. You can see the wind blowing all this floodwater. Much of that is rainwater. Much of it is storm surge.</p><p>The Apalachicola River is adjacent to this street, which is Water Street. So that's very calm now, but you can actually see off into the distance. So straight down below us, this is actually a roadway, but there's no driving on this for now. That is absolutely certain.</p><p>And off to your right, the entire parking lot is still underwater. The cars for the hotel patrons here, including our vehicles, are all over there. That was the highest point of the parking lot. And it looks like most of them, at least the far row, survives. Some of them in the lower row there on your screen, I saw windshield wipers going, lights turning on and off, the computers of the cars victims of the storm surge and the flooding waters down here.</p><p>A lot of damage of these tin roofs aluminum roots here on these storage buildings. There's a shrimp processing facility down there. A lot of that frozen shrimp off-loaded into 18-wheelers yesterday anticipating everything you see over there was going to be underwater, as it is right now.</p><p>And they're actually parked not too far from here. But, of course, their generators aren't running. So all of that shrimp and fish that was frozen slowly will be thawing out, and if it's not rescued in time, it will soon be worthless.</p><p>There is a mandatory curfew for everybody in this county, in fact, all of the counties in the Big Bend and the Panhandle, from sunset to sunrise.</p><p>From here on out, what's going to be very important right now is for the sheriff's departments in every county, as well as police departments and other emergency responders, to get out and about on those shallow draft boats, their high-profile vehicles, ATVs, and try to figure out how much damage is out there, because everybody has simply hunkered down all day long, including the sheriff of this county, who texted us back saying, \"This is the worst I have ever seen.\"</p><p>It was a ferocious, ferocious storm, 155 mile-an-hour winds when it made landfall just northwest of here. Much damage undoubtedly remains to be discovered perhaps as early as tonight, but definitely throughout the day tomorrow and maybe the next day after it.</p><p>And that, of course, does include the potential loss of life, because this was absolutely a life-threatening storm and very dangerous. Everyone is under an order right now, do not leave your house. Still under that order. That went into effect at about 7:00 a.m. this morning, when things really started to deteriorate, and right around noon until about 4:00 3:00, it was really something to see, something to experience.</p><p>It was one hell of a hurricane, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Man, oh, man, it certainly looked like that. I'm glad you're safe, your crew is safe. Phil, thank you very, very much, Phil Keating in Apalachicola, Florida.</p><p>And we will be talking to that city's mayor shortly.</p><p>An update from the president of the United States.</p><p>John Roberts at the White House right now. He's been monitoring these developments very, very closely -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And, Neil, the president just taking off from the White House South Lawn a short time ago on the way to Erie, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Some shouted questions at the president about is he concerned about the drop in the markets now, over 800 points? The president didn't answer questions. But I did just get off the phone with a senior White House official, who told me that the feeling around the White House here is that this is a bull market correction. It's nothing to panic about. And, in fact, it's probably a good thing. The market might have been a little bit overheated.</p><p>There are some concerns about rising interest rates. However, this person tells me that those concerns are probably overbaked. There's also some concern among some companies that the looming tariffs against China could hurt their bottom line. But the fact is, the economy is roaring ahead. And so that argument really doesn't hold a lot of water.</p><p>So it's just -- it's a day, it would seem, according to folks I talk to at the White House here, Neil, that the market got a little bit skittish about some of the indicators that they see out there and some of the potential for some things to happen. But they believe that in the overall this is something that will pass, it's a momentary correction in the market. We are not about to enter a bear market by any stretch of the imagination, according to folks here at the White House. And we will likely see a turnaround sometime in the next few days.</p><p>So, nothing to panic about here, is what we're being told as far as the markets go -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, when it comes to the hurricane and visiting folks in that region, I think the president had said he hoped to be down in the Florida Panhandle area by Sunday or Monday?</p><p>ROBERTS: He did.</p><p>Yes, clearly, when something like this passes through as quickly as it as it does, it's not going to have the lingering effect that Hurricane Florence did. But certainly it's going to leave a lot of damage behind, it's going to leave a lot of work for first-responders to attend to.</p><p>So the president doesn't want to get in the way of that. Any time you traveled to that true, or at least to an area that's been hard-hit by a hurricane, the facilities there are already overtaxed, and you don't want to add to that by bringing the president down.</p><p>But it would seem that the Air Force base down there took the brunt of the hit here from this hurricane. So it may be that the president can get down there a little earlier and take a look at some of the damage. But when he talked about it in the Oval Office, he had either Sunday or Monday as possible times that he could get down there.</p><p>So we will see, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, John Roberts of the White House, thank you very, very much.</p><p>We will give you the latest of that storm and some of those mayors in the region directly affected by it. They're breathing a sigh of relief after it.</p><p>I don't know if investors feel the same way, but we're on top of both storms, what they mean for the region down there and what they mean for you and your portfolio and investments here.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, no pun intended, but when it rains, it pours.</p><p>Certainly, in the case of Hurricane Michael, the worst storm to hit the Panhandle area in the better part of the century, and it could have been a lot worse. That's all we can say.</p><p>And the corner of Wall and Broad, certainly the worst sell-off to hit the markets in the better part of six months.</p><p>First on the storm with Jeff Flock in Panama City Beach -- Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Damage from the sell-off yet to be known, but the damage here starting to be known.</p><p>You can see it's not exactly catastrophic, but if you're the guy that owns -- spins around, maybe you see you lose a roof, all kinds of other debris out here.</p><p>We're just kind of now assessing what we see, but get through the debris here. Maybe we take you down to the beach. I have not been down here yet. But I want to see what this water looks like.</p><p>It doesn't appear there's...</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, I apologize for our feed there and for all of his hard reporting here.</p><p>Let's dip back in, if it's OK again.</p><p>FLOCK: Got you? You still got me there? Sorry.</p><p>I know it's probably a little funky, huh, Neil?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: It is, but I'm getting you, buddy. Keep going.</p><p>FLOCK: OK.</p><p>Well, we will keep going here. We're just trying to see what the -- what the status is down on the beach.</p><p>You OK, Kyle?</p><p>As you can see, I mean, is it catastrophic damage? No, I wouldn't say so. But the damage is quite clear. And I will leave you with a shot maybe of the beach. If we walk around here, we can just see it, obviously more -- more of this kind of thing, but the...</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, I apologize for that. Certainly not his fault.</p><p>These are what you deal with when you're obviously in a situation, and digital's what you rely on.</p><p>Apalachicola, Florida, Mayor Van Johnson joins us on the phone right now.</p><p>Mayor, you must be breathing a sigh of relief. You're not entirely out of the woods here, and I'm sure you're assessing things, but it could have been worse.</p><p>VAN JOHNSON, MAYOR OF APALACHICOLA, FLORIDA: That is true.</p><p>I just had a conversation with our chief of police, who is actually out and about now. In a city like Apalachicola that would normally take 15 to 20 minutes to ride the whole town driving about 25 miles an hour, he's finding it difficult just to get from street to street because of all the down power lines and trees.</p><p>So, he's out assessing the situation. And it's just -- we're going to have a lot of cleanup to do in the aftermath of this storm.</p><p>CAVUTO: Mayor, there was a call on the part of the governor for people to voluntarily evacuate on their own.</p><p>We're told, throughout the Panhandle area, about 50 percent took him up on that. What were the percentages in your town?</p><p>JOHNSON: It was about 40 percent in my community leading up.</p><p>In fact, I was at that press conference when the governor expressed the need to evacuate. And at that time, it was reported about 40 percent of the people from Apalachicola had heeded that call.</p><p>Now, as the storm intensified and reached a Category 4 classification, a lot more people took it seriously and started to leave. But I believe about 20 percent just decided to hunker down.</p><p>CAVUTO: Any rescues that need being done now?</p><p>JOHNSON: None reported. Of course, the call went out that if you decided to stay in your house, don't be roaming out in the streets, to minimize any injury to yourself or the rescue workers or the people that was out there.</p><p>So I haven't heard of any calls for rescue, and I thank God for that. I haven't heard whether we had any loss of life yet, and I thank God for that as well.</p><p>CAVUTO: Mayor, one of the things that you keep hearing about this storm is that it moved fast. And the good about that is that it didn't have time to hang around and do still more damage.</p><p>What was it like by you?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I'm actually -- I actually evacuated.</p><p>I took the governor's call, and I took the heed, my own memo that I sent out. And I evacuated to Destin, which is about 120 miles east of Apalachicola.</p><p>But from what I'm understanding, that we had flooding, downed power lines, trees. We had some road closures. In fact, the major thoroughfare out of Apalachicola, Highway 98, is actually washed in two between Eastpoint and Carrabelle.</p><p>CAVUTO: What about power outages? We heard a couple hundred thousand people in the area were without power. And that could exponentially grow. I'm sure it will. What is the latest in your area?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, just about all of Franklin County is out of -- without power.</p><p>CAVUTO: Hmm.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: And any indication what you're getting from folks and when it will be returned? I know, in the case of most storms, Florence included, they waited weeks.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I know the governor spoke during his press conference that he had been in contact with Duke Energy, and that they had about 1,900 trucks waiting for when the storm passed to come back into the area and restore power.</p><p>I don't know if that has taken place as yet, but it was certainly part of the recovery plan.</p><p>CAVUTO: Mayor, I'm glad you're well. I'm glad it appears your folks are well and those around you are well. You dodged a bullet, as they say.</p><p>But be well, sir. Thank you.</p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>Not so many investors who might have been getting used to the fact that what goes up, up, up, up can sometimes go down and sometimes go down with a thud.</p><p>We should hasten to add here, with this 831-point falloff in the Dow today, it might seem like an eye-popping number. And I don't want to minimize it. It is. But a little bit north of 3 present in value, compare that to what happened on October 19, 1987, when a quarter of the Dow's value was wiped out, it is very, very different.</p><p>Having said all of that, though, these are one-day hits to technology stocks that have led this parade. You heard a great deal about the so- called FANG stocks, those that were the largely the technology issues, the Facebooks, the Amazon, the Netflix, the Google Alphabets, that had led a parade that produced disproportionate returns.</p><p>If not for those issues, the Nasdaq, for example, wouldn't look nearly as impressive. And today it didn't. From its highs, it's down now about 6.5 to 7 percent. So that's not even correction territory.</p><p>However, Amazon is effectively in correction territory, and then some, down 10 percent or more from its highs. But this is an issue that has surged 50 percent over this year. So put that in perspective as well, as does market watcher Melissa Armo.</p><p>So, Melissa, your take on today. Is there more of this to come? What do you think?</p><p>MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH: I definitely think we could possibly be lower tomorrow, just because of the huge sell-off today.</p><p>But here's the lesson of today, Neil. Don't buy the dip. I was watching yesterday. Everyone says, oh, buy the dip, buy the dip. We fell off last weekend to Monday, and people were buying yesterday. I wasn't surprised at all this morning. I could tell right into the open this morning, five minutes into the open, that we were going to sell off.</p><p>And it was straight selling, all down today, because people bought yesterday. When something's falling, when you have a falling knife with, like you said, a thud, you don't buy it because you don't know where it's going to land. Buy strength. Short weakness in the market. That's how you make money, that's how you make profit.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, I'm not a market technician. I think a lot of this stuff that a lot of those fine-tune market folks use is akin to reading chicken entrails and tea leaves.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Having said that, they say it's generally not a healthy ending to be at your session lows at the ending, that there's a washout period to come.</p><p>You alluded to that on your comments earlier. What do you envision tomorrow morning?</p><p>ARMO: Tomorrow morning, I think if we open neutral, we drop. If we gap down in the morning, I think we can fall in and hold.</p><p>The only way we -- you could buy the market tomorrow is if we had a huge, massive gap up, and I don't think that's going to happen. I think it's a washout until, when, Friday. Friday morning, it's critical for the market.</p><p>And here's why. J.P. Morgan Chase reports before the open, Citibank and Wells Fargo. J.P. Morgan Chase is the one you want to watch. If those banks report well, which I don't know, on Friday morning, then we could have a turnaround. Then the market could look a lot different to close the week that it does at the close of today.</p><p>Market can change tune here. Remember, we just made brand-new all-time highs again on the Dow. I wouldn't panic. Now, if you're in retirement, you might be panicking because of this big sell-off.</p><p>But if you have a long way to retirement -- I'm talking three years, five years, 10 years or more, stay long in the market. i don't think we're anywhere near changing trend. I do think that market is strong. And I said this earlier. I believe the market closes very strong into December, just like we started the year.</p><p>We're going into earnings season. I would say be worried if we weren't going into earnings season. But because we are, a lot of these stocks that don't look so good today, all the tech, and even the banks too, could be completely 100 percent different after they report.</p><p>CAVUTO: You might be right.</p><p>I know they say that history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure can rhyme. And what rhymes here to me is some of what was going on in 1987 the week before the crash, when the Dow was sort of dropping off the days before, and there were hints of trouble to come.</p><p>Do you see any hints of trouble? Now, back then, the foundation, as President Ronald Reagan was saying at the time, was sound. This president says the same, it's sound. No one could argue then, no one can argue now both presidents were right.</p><p>But markets follow their own kind of weird verbs. Do you see anything that worries you right now?</p><p>ARMO: The only concern is the same concern really, Neil, that we have had all year. It's China, China. Nobody knows what's going to happen with China.</p><p>They just came out today. This is part of the reason why for the sell-off too. The administration announced they're going to review, the CFIUS Committee is going to review some of these investments, these foreign investments in the U.S.</p><p>And that's a bugaboo for China. And that's problematic. China is playing hardball.</p><p>CAVUTO: And, by the way, China is officially in a bear market.</p><p>ARMO: Oh, they have been. Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Its market -- it's well into a bear market. We are not. We are not.</p><p>In fact, we're up on the year. But the fact of the matter is, that's a worry. The notion is that we could be the stand-alone market, the standout market, which we are, and the stand-alone standout economy, which we are, but can we keep going it alone, if there are all these other headwinds from China, from Italy now barely able to make a budget and concern that it's going to go into a freefall?</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>ARMO: I think we could. Of course we could. We're the United States of America. And that's the great thing about being here, living here, participating in the market.</p><p>Trump is in charge. We will see what he's going to do. I will say one thing. Today's drop-off might stave off the Fed from raising interest rates one more time before the end of the year, when it looked like they might raise them again, which was in question if they would do one more before the end of the year.</p><p>This drop-off might stave them off a little bit, which is a good thing for consumers and a good thing for market participants.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you very, very much, Melissa.</p><p>The Fed, to which she was alluding, the Federal Reserve, of course, expected to raise rates and four more times before the end of this year and three more times next year.</p><p>All of that in response, I must stress, to good economic news. The economy is doing quite well, in fact, generationally, record-level well, but it is that strong economy that is perplexing traders. They realize that interest rates were going to go up, and that was baked into the cake, so to speak.</p><p>They didn't realize they would go backing up to the degree they already have, a 10-year note slipping back, a two-year note slipping back. And a lot of people wondering, we don't know where this goes. There's an old saw on Wall Street here. In uncertainty, you sell. You ask questions later.</p><p>They're selling. They will deal with the other stuff later.</p><p>Right now, the immediate concern in the Panhandle is this storm and Hurricane Michael and how the region dodged a bullet. But it's a very pricey bullet and a very nasty one.</p><p>It could have been even nastier -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>We are getting word that as many as 320,000 Floridians decided to ride out the storm and never evacuated. We do not know their status.</p><p>We also know that millions of Americans were caught in their sell-off. We do know theirs.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, let's get the latest on Michael.</p><p>Could have been and probably should have been worse. It is still pretty bad, though.</p><p>Rick Leventhal in Panama City with the latest -- Rick.</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>And, Neil, I apologize for the camera issues. It's gotten fogged up, and it's been getting rained on. We have been getting rained on for hours now.</p><p>The rain has slowed down pretty considerably. But the wind is still blowing. And we just got word that there's a rescue mission under way here in Panama City. Panama City Fire and Rescue heading out to try and save someone from some sort of situation.</p><p>They had told us that they had encouraged 120,000 people to evacuate before the storm, and that didn't happen. About half the people actually evacuated. The other half stayed. And apparently at least one of those people needs to be rescued.</p><p>Neil, this is the kind of stuff, if you can see it, that's flying around out here, or was. It's a piece from the -- from the building next to us, some kind of siding. And it's sort of a tile material. And it's pretty heavy.</p><p>And I want to show you one other thing. The damages aren't extensive where we are, but you can see one of the utility poles that basically snapped in half. There is a transformer at the end of that pole. The power is out here and probably will be for sometime.</p><p>Damage is not as extensive as some had feared they might be, but a lot of them are still being assessed, Neil, because it's just now starting to clear up.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Rick, be safe, and your crew as well, Rick Leventhal.</p><p>Let's go to WeatherBELL's Joe Bastardi on what he makes of all of this -- Joseph.</p><p>JOE BASTARDI, WEATHERBELL CHIEF FORECASTER: Well, Port St. Joe is on the other side of the eye. The eye went ashore southeast of Rick.</p><p>And I think that that area is probably going to be devastated. It'll be interesting to see. And hopefully people got out of that area. This came ashore stronger than any hurricane that we have recorded in this area.</p><p>The barometric pressure was down at 920 millibars, which was very close to what Andrew hit Miami at. And I'm sure, when the damage is totaled up in those areas, again, the western side of the eyewall was in Panama City.</p><p>So the wind blew out toward the Gulf of Mexico, didn't come in from the Gulf of Mexico, and that's going to be a big deal. But this is now into Southwest Georgia. And it's just raising havoc as it goes inland, because it's so very powerful.</p><p>You're not going to see storms that get into Georgia with 100-mile-an-hour winds, 120. It's coming -- it's coming down quite a bit. The future path of the storm takes it near Macon tonight around 2:00 in the morning, where winds should gust between 80 and 90, perhaps 100 miles an hour, Augusta tomorrow morning 60, 80 miles an hour.</p><p>Go just southeast to Columbia, tomorrow, during the afternoon, tomorrow night, be midway between Fayetteville and Raleigh, and then reach the North Carolina coast near Elizabeth city, it looks, like probably 2:00 a.m. in the morning Friday.</p><p>When that happens, what will happen, Neil, is the frictional effects of the storm will diminish, so that the storm will wind back up again. You folks in Virginia Beach -- I have seen his before -- don't be surprised if you have a three- to six-hour period where the winds out of the north gusting to 60, 70 miles an hour, even though the storm will be reported to have less winds.</p><p>And they sort of play possum over land, but as soon as they get near the water, they rev back up again. As far as rainfall, widespread three to six locally, 12-inch amounts from where the storm is now all the way into Southeast Virginia. And that includes the area that was devastated by Florence.</p><p>That may aggravate the situation in there. There's going to be more power outages with this because it's going to continue to have strong winds inland. And to the east of that track I gave you, there's going to be tornadic activity breaking out tonight into tomorrow.</p><p>And that's going to be another problem with this storm. So even though it's weakened and it's inland, we will see what the damage was right where this went ashore. I fear that it's going to look like this storm bulldozed some areas when they get in there.</p><p>But we will see. The pressure where this came ashore at 920 millibars is the strongest by far ever in that area between Mobile and Tampa. So this is strongest storm, barometric pressure, likely wind, that we have recorded since back in 1851.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>I do also know, as you mentioned at the outset, the flooding possibilities, nine rivers that were already surging and had been surged a good deal, I think at least seven of them from Florence, resurge all over again. So that just compounds the problem for the Carolinas, Georgia, et cetera. Right?</p><p>BASTARDI: Yes, it does, Neil.</p><p>And I will tell you this, folks. I believe the last time we were on, Neil, back in September, I said you will probably see me showing up again in October. You won't see me again with hurricanes when this one's done. You will see me for winter storms. But I believe this is going to be the last impact storm on the United States this season.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Let's hope you're right on that.</p><p>Joe Bastardi, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Just a couple of things. The president, of course, has already said earlier in the day that FEMA and anyone else, also meeting with his historical secretary, would provide any emergency help that was necessary. He is going to be heading off to a campaign event tonight in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Friday to Lebanon, Ohio, on Saturday to Richmond, Kentucky.</p><p>We are told that he wants to at least get a firsthand view of what's happening the Panhandle probably sometime Sunday, could be Monday. Wants to be as the least disruptive way possible. Easier said than done when any president of the United States visits a region, but he wants to come when it is a good time to come. And he hopes to make that Sunday or Monday.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the latest on Michael now, no longer a Category 4 storm. But it is going to pack serious winds now as it makes its way north into Georgia and the Carolinas.</p><p>FOX News Channel's chief meteorologist, Rick Reichmuth, on its path now -- Rick.</p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: Neil, yes, obviously the stronger the storm when it comes offshore, the worse damage on the shore.</p><p>But that also means that it's going to take a longer time for those strong winds to go down. So you see it made landfall. We have had recorded wind gusts at 130 miles an hour. Keep in mind we don't have wind meters in every place, and a lot of them get blown offline.</p><p>But they had verified at 155 mile-an-hour winds when that was coming right onshore there. Now, you take a look at it, starting to weaken a little bit there. But we're all up in across the northeastern area of Alabama moving in towards Georgia right now.</p><p>Still with that well-defined center, and that means those hurricane-force winds now are extending very, very far off towards the north. Radar picture shows the same thing behind it, still some more bands. Likely right along the coast, we're going to calm down a little bit, especially across the western side of this.</p><p>On the eastern side, we will still see more moisture that is going to continue to be pulled up onshore. How does this rank compared to other storms? Take a look at this. When you think of all of the big storms we have had in our country over the years, wind wise, this is right below Andrew.</p><p>And as far as that central pressure goes, how low the pressure in the center of the storm went, take a look at that. That is the third strongest storm, the third lowest pressure we have ever recorded of a landfalling storm here across the U.S.</p><p>This is where we are now, still technically 140-mile-an-hour winds sustained. That will come down, I'm sure, a little bit as we get to that 5:00 advisory that is going to come out shortly.</p><p>And it will remain a hurricane for a little bit longer, go in towards tomorrow morning. We still have a tropical storm getting, moving in towards South Carolina. And we're going to very gusty conditions there across the Carolinas. Keep in mind a lot of areas likely have some weakened trees from all of the flooding that was there.</p><p>Some of that water is gone. But all of those root systems now are going to be very, very weakened here across the Carolinas. So won't take much to cause more wind to go over and knock some more of those trees out.</p><p>Likely strengthening a little bit here once it moves ashore, but we got a couple more days before we're fully done with this storm -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Rick, I didn't realize it got very close to Category 5, didn't it?</p><p>REICHMUTH: One mile an hour away from the Cat 5, yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Incredible. Wow.</p><p>Rick, thank you very, very much. Rick Reichmuth.</p><p>REICHMUTH: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, this is also Oil Rig Alley, they call it, along the Gulf, when you have so many oil rigs and other facilities set up -- 40 percent of our overall oil output is in this region. So you would think that, immediately, prices would be spiking when it shut down. Just the opposite.</p><p>That was a little weird. But a guy who specializes in things that don't make sense, because he quickly make sense of them, is our energy trader and energy watcher, Phil Flynn.</p><p>Phil Flynn, why did we go down on oil prices?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP: Well, a couple of reasons.</p><p>The main reason is where the storm actually hit. The track of the storm miss some of the major installations. So all that production that you were talking about that was shut in can be brought online very quickly once the storm passes.</p><p>And now the storm has gone away from worrying about how much oil supplies and natural gas supplies we might lose to how much demand we might lose because of the track of the storm. If you take a look at that scary map, when we're going right through Florida into all of those different states, Virginia, Georgia, you name it, a lot of those people, of course, are going to be without power.</p><p>They're not going to be able to drive. And so the demand that would usually occur for oil in a normal everyday situation is not going to happen. So now the concern has gone away from, oh, my gosh, we won't have oil to supply the market to, we won't have demand to use it.</p><p>Now, the one thing I want to caution everybody is, is that this is called demand destruction when we have a storm like this. It's usually a very short-term phenomena, because I'm afraid that the damage that we're potentially going to see, Neil, from this storm is going to require a lot of energy in the future to rebuild.</p><p>So right now, the market is not as concerned about the loss of supply, but a couple of weeks down the road, when we start to rebuild, that oil demand is going to be back, and in a big way.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you, my friend, very much, Phil Flynn.</p><p>A couple of developments. There apparently is a tornado watch in effect for locations that in Florida directly affected by this along the Panhandle. That is not unusual after something like this, flash flood warnings given not only from the Panhandle area, but right straight through the Carolinas.</p><p>As you can see, that is the trajectory. For those of you listening on radio, this trajectory takes it through Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, before it goes back out to sea sometime this weekend. But it's going to be around for a while.</p><p>Also, Hurricane Michael has forced at least eight cruises to reroute and up to 1,000 flights to and from airports in the area to be outright canceled or reschedule. Airlines affected have dropped all booking fees as a result of changing your plans, as if you had a choice.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, after the storm, there's the power that goes invariably during and after the storm. And it usually increases in the hours afterwards.</p><p>We're already seeing that now, better than 200,000, we are told, without power now in the region. That could add as the night ensues here.</p><p>Catherine Stempien and is with Duke Energy. In fact, she's the Florida president.</p><p>Very good to have you with us, Catherine. And thank you for taking the time.</p><p>What is the situation there power wise for folks?</p><p>CATHERINE STEMPIEN, DUKE ENERGY: So, we're already seeing significant outages all across our system up on the Panhandle. We're predicting about 100,000 to 200,000 households and businesses that are customers of Duke Energy Florida will be losing their power as a result of this system.</p><p>Additionally, we expect maybe an additional 100,000 customers from the local electric cooperative, the municipalities who receive their electricity from Duke Energy will also be affected, because we're anticipating significant damage to our transmission system in the area.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, I know it's hard to compare Florence with this and different storms. Florence hung around a while, less so with Michael.</p><p>How does that factor into when you get things back up and running?</p><p>STEMPIEN: Well, we're currently anticipating it could take days or maybe even more than a week for us to really get customers back online.</p><p>This system, with the winds of over 150,000 -- 150 miles per hour, in addition to significant storm surge and flooding, is really impacting, submerging our systems, damaging equipment that are powering entire communities,. We really see that, in some areas, we're going to have to rebuild our entire electrical system. And that's going to take some time.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, and that's that's a long-haul effort, as you said here.</p><p>I'm wondering, too, given the fact that fewer than half those in the affected areas -- or affected areas decided to evacuate, as the governor had urged, does that complicate things for you?</p><p>STEMPIEN: Well, it certainly does.</p><p>And I would like to thank Governor Scott for his leadership here in declaring a state of emergency for storm-impacted areas. And we're working very closely with the governor and his team to prioritize critical facilities and also working closely with the Department of Transportation to coordinate on road clearing.</p><p>But our ability to access some of those areas is really going to depend -- it's really going to hamper our ability to recover and to rebuild the system.</p><p>CAVUTO: Having said all of that, Catherine, you can't minimize the work that's ahead of you and your folks and the region.</p><p>Are you breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief? It was envisioned to be, certainly when it came in, much worse.</p><p>STEMPIEN: Well, we're still seeing impacts of the storm, so I don't think we are through this storm yet. And, of course, it's going to continue to impact areas of Georgia and up through the Carolinas, many of which are the same communities that were just impacted by Hurricane Florence.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>STEMPIEN: So I don't feel like we're out of the woods yet.</p><p>I would like to make sure to encourage people who were in Florida to be safe, to call 911 if they need any critical assistance, and to be communicating with their local EOCs, which they can find information about on FloridaDisaster.org for more information.</p><p>CAVUTO: Catherine Stempien, thank you. Wise words, all. We appreciate it.</p><p>I'm sure your customers appreciate it.</p><p>All right, so about 100,000 to 200,000 without power now. Whether that escalates, some say it will -- you don't know who's right on this. I know, with Florence, it exponentially went on, as the night and the storm went on. That was a slow mover. This is more serious, but faster. So you take your bets.</p><p>All right, Hurricane Michael, though, is still barrelling through Florida. And now Georgia is next in its sights. And as a number of folks were warning at FEMA and beyond, do not take this lightly in Georgia, and do not take it lightly if you're well inland. It is still packing a punch -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it looks like Michael has Georgia on its mine.</p><p>Steve Harrigan is in Macon, Georgia, with the latest.</p><p>Hey, Steve.</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, the storm may have made landfall in Florida about 200 miles away from here, but it's really just beginning in the state of Florida.</p><p>It intends to enter the state of Florida as a Category 2 hurricane, then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane, before weakening further to a tropical storm.</p><p>That means, across the state of Georgia, we're going to see major structural damage, damage to roofs, buildings, houses, power lines down, electricity out, and perhaps part of the agriculture here devastated, especially that peanut crop.</p><p>So they were really taken by surprise a little bit here, because this storm got more powerful very quickly over the Gulf of Mexico. We heard the FEMA administrator say this morning Georgia has to wake up to the danger ahead. It is waking up quickly to that danger. While there are no mandatory evacuations planned, a state of emergency has been declared, and the National Guard has been mobilized -- Neil, back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Steve Harrigan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Of course, Steve will be watching that as it moves its way into Georgia.</p><p>So this thing isn't over. And neither is this sell-off at the corner of Wall and Broad. It was a big one today.</p><p>Let's look at where this stacks up against other big hits in the Dow. This is just in point terms, that today's would rank third, but between what happened back in the early days of this year, when we were going through the same sort of conundrum here and were worried about interest rates.</p><p>I should add that, in percentage terms, about -- the 3 percent falloff today wouldn't even crack the top 10, dare I say the top 15 of hits to the Dow.</p><p>But it is real, it is nasty and it is built on the idea interest rates are going up because the economy keeps moving up. That would normally be a good thing, but not so right now, when people worry about, how high is high?</p><p>Tough to get a home loan. Tougher to get a mortgage loan. Tough to get any sort of loan. And, in that environment, they sell.</p><p>We will see tonight with futures and foreign trading.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

I'm Neil Cavuto.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it has been an awful day weather wise in the Gulf and an awful day at  the corner of Wall and Broad and for your 401(k) and investment statements.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are top of each development, the situation with that hurricane.  And  it's a doozy, Michael at a Category 4 doing.  There's a lot of flooding.   There's a lot of wind.  There's been reports of a good deal of damage.  But  it could have been a whole lot worse.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I wish, I wish I could say the same about what happened to the investment  community today</p><p>We're on top of both dramatic developments.  </p><p>By the way, I do want to kick off, though, with what happened on the  financial side and what could possibly bring us to session lows down better  than 3 percent, the worst single-day performance in this market.  You would  have to go back to early February.  And you would have to go back to levels  in this market that we had not seen since all the way back in August.  </p><p>So, do want to step back from all this.  And as bad as it was, we are  simply revisiting, in the cases of some stock, levels we were last seeing  about four to six weeks ago.  We will get into the details on that.  </p><p>But let me suffice it to say that the catalyst for all of this was an  improving economy.  Now, I know that sounds a little weird.  But a lot of  this has to do with a backup in interest rates to address that improving  economy, and the notion that interest rates are going to have to go back  still further and higher.  </p><p>What happens with the markets is, they never really know how to digest the  unexpected or the unknown.  And the unknown for them is, how much is too  much.</p><p>Right now, a 10-year note fetches about 3.75 percent.  That is the highest  we have seen in about seven years.  A two-year note reaching a level today  that was the highest we have seen in more than a decade.  </p><p>But it's what you get used to.  There were times when these were double- digit events.  So, in other words, when we had a 10-year note at 10 percent  or better during the late 1980s, or when we had a two-year note that was  routinely double what it is now, for a while triple what it is now.</p><p>But it doesn't do much good to say that was then, this is now.  It's what  we have been getting used to now, better than a decade of near zero percent  interest rates set by a Federal Reserve that was trying to get us out of a  recession and a meltdown.  It did the trick.</p><p>Now the trick is unwinding all of that, again, easier said than done.</p><p>To Charles Payne at the Nasdaq that was the not-so-pleasant beneficiary of  the bulk of that selling.</p><p>So, Charles, interesting enough, a lot of those tech names that led us on  this parade were the ones getting the most battered, huh?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  You're absolutely right, Neil.  </p><p>And it's not just today.  These big tech names over the last two or three  weeks have been conspicuously weak, very vulnerable, some going back to  earnings.  Facebook collapsed on its earnings.  Netflix didn't have great  earnings.  Twitter came down.</p><p>But then some of the more -- even the larger names.  Apple two days ago got  a sell rating.  That's really rare with a company like that.  Amazon has  its issues.  A lot of this revolving around regulatory concerns, as well,  which have creeped into this area because of some of the practices from all  of them.</p><p>But no one, to your point, was spared.  And I will go back to the Dow for a  moment, because what we witness now, this year, are the three biggest,  largest point losses in the history of the Dow, not percentage losses, of  course.  Three of the four biggest losses, of course, this year all  revolved -- in fact, no, four -- four of the five all revolved around the  Federal Reserve.</p><p>In February, rates started to go higher.  We got a jobs report that looked  like it was too hot.  Everyone started to panic over what the Fed may do to  slow this economy down.  That sort of settled down.  We were able to deal  with 3 percent.  But now the velocity of how quickly these rates have gone  up again, these yields, again spooking the market.</p><p>But I will add, Neil, there was some fundamental news.  You and I talked a  little bit yesterday.  It's not a household name, but Pittsburgh Plate  Glass is a 135-year-old company.  People know the company.  You probably  have some of their paint on your car, OK.  So they had bad numbers.</p><p>They warned of higher prices.  Today, Fastenal, again, an industrial name,  not a household name, but it led the industrials lower.  That was the  second-worst performing sector.  It was the worst-performing stock in that  sector.</p><p>So some of this is interest-rate related.  Some of this is higher prices.   Some of is just speculation that things have been great.  Can they  continue?</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very, very much, Charles Payne.</p><p>Again, all Dow 30 stocks were down.  That is a rarity, but every single one  of them down.  So you don't see that often.</p><p>Also, with an 831-point in the Dow -- if we can go back to showing the Dow,  guys -- that 831-point hit represents about a little more than 3 percent in  the value of the Dow Jones industrials shredded today.</p><p>Now, I should hasten to add, in percentage terms, that -- that's a lot, but  it's not what it was in 1987.  You might recall, October 19, 1987, October,  yes, it tends to be a scary time, we lost a quarter of the Dow's value in  one single session, even though it represented 508 points at the time.</p><p>So I hasten to add that, just to put it in perspective, not to just gloss  over this, but to put it in percentage perspective here, that we are still  nominally up on the year.  And even though some very big names that have  led us here, like an Amazon, for example, not part of the Dow, but part of  the technology run-up, that is in correction territory right now.  </p><p>In other words, it has fallen more than 10 percent from its highs.  So  you're going to hear a lot about a lot of stocks that have fallen into  correction territory or 10 percent or more from their highs. vs. bear  market territory, 20 percent or further from their highs.</p><p>Now, one out of five S&amp;P 500 stocks are already in that latter camp.  So  we're keeping an eye on it, as is this next fellow, chief market strategist  for path Trading Partners, Bob Iaccino.  </p><p>Bob, thank you for joining us.  What's your take on this day, whether this  was overdone or justified, given the alarming run-up we have seen?</p><p>BOB IACCINO, PATH TRADING PARTNERS:  Good afternoon, Neil.  </p><p>To me, it's a time when we need to be responsible in terms of being in the  financial media reporting on these kind of things, because these are the  exact kind of moves people get scared about.  They're exaggerated.  They're  overdone.  And they tend to end up being buying opportunities, maybe not  today.</p><p>But specifically this kind of move prior to earnings, with the headwinds  that we see with the stock markets, from tariffs, to higher rates, to the  Fed being on this trajectory, the Fed put is no longer in place now, if the  Fed is taking this sort of punchbowl away.  </p><p>But this is a really good time to be going into earnings and get this  exaggerated sell-off, if I could point out a silver lining.  If we get that  20 percent earnings growth, you're going to have some sectors and some  stocks respond to the upside.  From the prior levels, we wouldn't  necessarily get that.  We would kind of get profit-taking.  </p><p>So not to say this is a good thing.  It's never a good thing.  You never  want to see people's 401(k)s drop like this.  But the timing of it, I'm  kind of a fan of.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, now, we have been the market leader in the world.  We  have been leading this parade.  In fact, as things stand now, with the  European markets in the doldrums and now indications it could get worse  with Italy's problems -- I don't want to get on a tangent -- of course, we  know what's happened in Asia.  We know what has happened to the Chinese  market, of course, already well into bear market territory.  </p><p>Could you envision that for us, or what?  </p><p>IACCINO:  No, I think it's the other way around, Neil.  And I think that's  why you're pointing it out.  </p><p>One thing we don't see all that often is stocks and bonds going in the same  direction.  We do see it, but it usually doesn't sustain.  We're actually  seeing a little bit of stabilization in the longer end of the curve as I  speak to you right now, especially that 10-year-to-30-year sector.  </p><p>So I think we're actually going to get some relief on the rate side, we're  going to get some good earnings, and we are likely to pull the rest of the  world up.  Now, we do have to see the effect of tariffs in the earnings.   We didn't see it in the last earnings report, the last quarter.</p><p>We might see the start of it now.  But we're also going to see in the in  the next quarter some of the positives of the USMCA, some of the positives  of the deal with Korea, some of the positives of the deal with --  potentially with Europe.  So there might be some balance there.  </p><p>I think we're actually going to lead the world out of it.  The economy here  is strong.  This sell-off is too fast, but still the timing of it, again, I  have to say I'm kind of a fan of just before earnings.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, and it is October after all.  Thank you very, very  much, my friend.  </p><p>Again, putting in October in perspective, even though it is not technically  the worst month of the year for stocks -- technically, that is September --  September ended up being a pretty good month for stocks, by and large, but  the fact of the matter is, whether you're talking 2008 and the financial  meltdown, or 1997 and the Asian contagion, or 1987, of course, the  memorable stock market crash, or 1929, and the follow-up that brought us  the Depression, it has a history of spooking us.</p><p>And it does, right?</p><p>All right, let's get the latest right now from Phil Keating in  Apalachicola, Florida with the very latest on how Hurricane Michael is  sorting out there.  </p><p>Sir.</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p>This is Apalachicola, where it was ferocious for multiple hours today.  But  this is pretty much -- we're still getting a gust as we speak right now.   You can see the wind blowing all this floodwater.  Much of that is  rainwater.  Much of it is storm surge.  </p><p>The Apalachicola River is adjacent to this street, which is Water Street.   So that's very calm now, but you can actually see off into the distance.   So straight down below us, this is actually a roadway, but there's no  driving on this for now.  That is absolutely certain.  </p><p>And off to your right, the entire parking lot is still underwater.  The  cars for the hotel patrons here, including our vehicles, are all over  there.  That was the highest point of the parking lot.  And it looks like  most of them, at least the far row, survives.  Some of them in the lower  row there on your screen, I saw windshield wipers going, lights turning on  and off, the computers of the cars victims of the storm surge and the  flooding waters down here.  </p><p>A lot of damage of these tin roofs  aluminum roots here on these storage  buildings.  There's a shrimp processing facility down there.  A lot of that  frozen shrimp off-loaded into 18-wheelers yesterday anticipating everything  you see over there was going to be underwater, as it is right now.  </p><p>And they're actually parked not too far from here.  But, of course, their  generators aren't running.  So all of that shrimp and fish that was frozen  slowly will be thawing out, and if it's not rescued in time, it will soon  be worthless.  </p><p>There is a mandatory curfew for everybody in this county, in fact, all of  the counties in the Big Bend and the Panhandle, from sunset to sunrise.</p><p>From here on out, what's going to be very important right now is for the  sheriff's departments in every county, as well as police departments and  other emergency responders, to get out and about on those shallow draft  boats, their high-profile vehicles, ATVs, and try to figure out how much  damage is out there, because everybody has simply hunkered down all day  long, including the sheriff of this county, who texted us back saying,  \"This is the worst I have ever seen.\"</p><p>It was a ferocious, ferocious storm, 155 mile-an-hour winds when it made  landfall just northwest of here.  Much damage undoubtedly remains to be  discovered perhaps as early as tonight, but definitely throughout the day  tomorrow and maybe the next day after it.</p><p>And that, of course, does include the potential loss of life, because this  was absolutely a life-threatening storm and very dangerous.  Everyone is  under an order right now, do not leave your house.  Still under that order.   That went into effect at about 7:00 a.m. this morning, when things really  started to deteriorate, and right around noon until about 4:00 3:00, it was  really something to see, something to experience.</p><p>It was one hell of a hurricane, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Man, oh, man, it certainly looked like that.  I'm glad you're  safe, your crew is safe.  Phil, thank you very, very much, Phil Keating in  Apalachicola, Florida.</p><p>And we will be talking to that city's mayor shortly.</p><p>An update from the president of the United States.</p><p>John Roberts at the White House right now.  He's been monitoring these  developments very, very closely -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  And, Neil, the  president just taking off from the White House South Lawn a short time ago  on the way to Erie, Pennsylvania.  </p><p>Some shouted questions at the president about is he concerned about the  drop in the markets now, over 800 points?  The president didn't answer  questions.  But I did just get off the phone with a senior White House  official, who told me that the feeling around the White House here is that  this is a bull market correction.  It's nothing to panic about.  And, in  fact, it's probably a good thing.  The market might have been a little bit  overheated.  </p><p>There are some concerns about rising interest rates.  However, this person  tells me that those concerns are probably overbaked.  There's also some  concern among some companies that the looming tariffs against China could  hurt their bottom line.  But the fact is, the economy is roaring ahead.   And so that argument really doesn't hold a lot of water.  </p><p>So it's just -- it's a day, it would seem, according to folks I talk to at  the White House here, Neil, that the market got a little bit skittish about  some of the indicators that they see out there and some of the potential  for some things to happen.  But they believe that in the overall this is  something that will pass, it's a momentary correction in the market.  We  are not about to enter a bear market by any stretch of the imagination,  according to folks here at the White House.  And we will likely see a  turnaround sometime in the next few days.  </p><p>So, nothing to panic about here, is what we're being told as far as the  markets go -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, when it comes to the hurricane and visiting folks in that  region, I think the president had said he hoped to be down in the Florida  Panhandle area by Sunday or Monday?</p><p>ROBERTS:  He did.</p><p>Yes, clearly, when something like this passes through as quickly as it as  it does, it's not going to have the lingering effect that Hurricane  Florence did.  But certainly it's going to leave a lot of damage behind,  it's going to leave a lot of work for first-responders to attend to.  </p><p>So the president doesn't want to get in the way of that.  Any time you  traveled to that true, or at least to an area that's been hard-hit by a  hurricane, the facilities there are already overtaxed, and you don't want  to add to that by bringing the president down.  </p><p>But it would seem that the Air Force base down there took the brunt of the  hit here from this hurricane.  So it may be that the president can get down  there a little earlier and take a look at some of the damage.  But when he  talked about it in the Oval Office, he had either Sunday or Monday as  possible times that he could get down there.  </p><p>So we will see, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, John Roberts of the White House, thank you very, very  much.</p><p>We will give you the latest of that storm and some of those mayors in the  region directly affected by it.  They're breathing a sigh of relief after  it.  </p><p>I don't know if investors feel the same way, but we're on top of both  storms, what they mean for the region down there and what they mean for you  and your portfolio and investments here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, no pun intended, but when it rains, it pours.</p><p>Certainly, in the case of Hurricane Michael, the worst storm to hit the  Panhandle area in the better part of the century, and it could have been a  lot worse.  That's all we can say.</p><p>And the corner of Wall and Broad, certainly the worst sell-off to hit the  markets in the better part of six months.</p><p>First on the storm with Jeff Flock in Panama City Beach -- Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Damage from the sell-off  yet to be known, but the damage here starting to be known.</p><p>You can see it's not exactly catastrophic, but if you're the guy that owns  -- spins around, maybe you see you lose a roof, all kinds of other debris  out here.</p><p>We're just kind of now assessing what we see, but get through the debris  here.  Maybe we take you down to the beach.  I have not been down here yet.   But I want to see what this water looks like.</p><p>It doesn't appear there's...</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, I apologize for our feed there and for all of his hard  reporting here.</p><p>Let's dip back in, if it's OK again.</p><p>FLOCK:  Got you?  You still got me there?  Sorry.</p><p>I know it's probably a little funky, huh, Neil?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  It is, but I'm getting you, buddy.  Keep going.</p><p>FLOCK:  OK.</p><p>Well, we will keep going here.  We're just trying to see what the -- what  the status is down on the beach.  </p><p>You OK, Kyle? </p><p>As you can see, I mean, is it catastrophic damage?  No, I wouldn't say so.   But the damage is quite clear.  And I will leave you with a shot maybe of  the beach.  If we walk around here, we can just see it, obviously more --  more of this kind of thing, but the...</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, I apologize for that.  Certainly not his fault.</p><p>These are what you deal with when you're obviously in a situation, and  digital's what you rely on.</p><p>Apalachicola, Florida, Mayor Van Johnson joins us on the phone right now.  </p><p>Mayor, you must be breathing a sigh of relief.  You're not entirely out of  the woods here, and I'm sure you're assessing things, but it could have  been worse.</p><p>VAN JOHNSON, MAYOR OF APALACHICOLA, FLORIDA:  That is true.</p><p>I just had a conversation with our chief of police, who is actually out and  about now.  In a city like Apalachicola that would normally take 15 to 20  minutes to ride the whole town driving about 25 miles an hour, he's finding  it difficult just to get from street to street because of all the down  power lines and trees.</p><p>So, he's out assessing the situation.  And it's just -- we're going to have  a lot of cleanup to do in the aftermath of this storm. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Mayor, there was a call on the part of the governor for people to  voluntarily evacuate on their own.</p><p>We're told, throughout the Panhandle area, about 50 percent took him up on  that.  What were the percentages in your town?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  It was about 40 percent in my community leading up.</p><p>In fact, I was at that press conference when the governor expressed the  need to evacuate.  And at that time, it was reported about 40 percent of  the people from Apalachicola had heeded that call.  </p><p>Now, as the storm intensified and reached a Category 4 classification, a  lot more people took it seriously and started to leave.  But I believe  about 20 percent just decided to hunker down.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Any rescues that need being done now?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  None reported.  Of course, the call went out that if you decided  to stay in your house, don't be roaming out in the streets, to minimize any  injury to yourself or the rescue workers or the people that was out there.  </p><p>So I haven't heard of any calls for rescue, and I thank God for that.  I  haven't heard whether we had any loss of life yet, and I thank God for that  as well.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Mayor, one of the things that you keep hearing about this storm is  that it moved fast.  And the good about that is that it didn't have time to  hang around and do still more damage.  </p><p>What was it like by you?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, I'm actually -- I actually evacuated.</p><p>I took the governor's call, and I took the heed, my own memo that I sent  out.  And I evacuated to Destin, which is about 120 miles east of  Apalachicola.  </p><p>But from what I'm understanding, that we had flooding, downed power lines,  trees.  We had some road closures.  In fact, the major thoroughfare out of  Apalachicola, Highway 98, is actually washed in two between Eastpoint and  Carrabelle.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  What about power outages?  We heard a couple hundred thousand  people in the area were without power.  And that could exponentially grow.   I'm sure it will.  What is the latest in your area?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, just about all of Franklin County is out of -- without  power.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Hmm.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And any indication what you're getting from folks and when it will  be returned?  I know, in the case of most storms, Florence included, they  waited weeks.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, I know the governor spoke during his press conference that  he had been in contact with Duke Energy, and that they had about 1,900  trucks waiting for when the storm passed to come back into the area and  restore power.  </p><p>I don't know if that has taken place as yet, but it was certainly part of  the recovery plan.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Mayor, I'm glad you're well.  I'm glad it appears your folks are  well and those around you are well.  You dodged a bullet, as they say.  </p><p>But be well, sir.  Thank you.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Thank you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Not so many investors who might have been getting used to the fact that  what goes up, up, up, up can sometimes go down and sometimes go down with a  thud. </p><p>We should hasten to add here, with this 831-point falloff in the Dow today,  it might seem like an eye-popping number.  And I don't want to minimize it.   It is.  But a little bit north of 3 present in value, compare that to what  happened on October 19, 1987, when a quarter of the Dow's value was wiped  out, it is very, very different.</p><p>Having said all of that, though, these are one-day hits to technology  stocks that have led this parade.  You heard a great deal about the so- called FANG stocks, those that were the largely the technology issues, the  Facebooks, the Amazon, the Netflix, the Google Alphabets, that had led a  parade that produced disproportionate returns.</p><p>If not for those issues, the Nasdaq, for example, wouldn't look nearly as  impressive.  And today it didn't.  From its highs, it's down now about 6.5  to 7 percent.  So that's not even correction territory.</p><p>However, Amazon is effectively in correction territory, and then some, down  10 percent or more from its highs.  But this is an issue that has surged 50  percent over this year.  So put that in perspective as well, as does market  watcher Melissa Armo.</p><p>So, Melissa, your take on today.  Is there more of this to come?  What do  you think?</p><p>MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH:  I definitely think we could possibly be  lower tomorrow, just because of the huge sell-off today.</p><p>But here's the lesson of today, Neil.  Don't buy the dip.  I was watching  yesterday.  Everyone says, oh, buy the dip, buy the dip.  We fell off last  weekend to Monday, and people were buying yesterday.  I wasn't surprised at  all this morning.  I could tell right into the open this morning, five  minutes into the open, that we were going to sell off.</p><p>And it was straight selling, all down today, because people bought  yesterday.  When something's falling, when you have a falling knife with,  like you said, a thud, you don't buy it because you don't know where it's  going to land.  Buy strength.  Short weakness in the market.  That's how  you make money, that's how you make profit.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, I'm not a market technician.  I think a lot of this stuff  that a lot of those fine-tune market folks use is akin to reading chicken  entrails and tea leaves.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Having said that, they say it's generally not a healthy ending to  be at your session lows at the ending, that there's a washout period to  come.</p><p>You alluded to that on your comments earlier.  What do you envision  tomorrow morning?</p><p>ARMO:  Tomorrow morning, I think if we open neutral, we drop.  If we gap  down in the morning, I think we can fall in and hold.</p><p>The only way we -- you could buy the market tomorrow is if we had a huge,  massive gap up, and I don't think that's going to happen.  I think it's a  washout until, when, Friday.  Friday morning, it's critical for the market.</p><p>And here's why.  J.P. Morgan Chase reports before the open, Citibank and  Wells Fargo.  J.P. Morgan Chase is the one you want to watch.  If those  banks report well, which I don't know, on Friday morning, then we could  have a turnaround.  Then the market could look a lot different to close the  week that it does at the close of today.</p><p>Market can change tune here.  Remember, we just made brand-new all-time  highs again on the Dow.  I wouldn't panic.  Now, if you're in retirement,  you might be panicking because of this big sell-off.  </p><p>But if you have a long way to retirement -- I'm talking three years, five  years, 10 years or more, stay long in the market.  i don't think we're  anywhere near changing trend.  I do think that market is strong.  And I  said this earlier.  I believe the market closes very strong into December,  just like we started the year.</p><p>We're going into earnings season.  I would say be worried if we weren't  going into earnings season.  But because we are, a lot of these stocks that  don't look so good today, all the tech, and even the banks too, could be  completely 100 percent different after they report.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You might be right.</p><p>I know they say that history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure can rhyme.   And what rhymes here to me is some of what was going on in 1987 the week  before the crash, when the Dow was sort of dropping off the days before,  and there were hints of trouble to come.</p><p>Do you see any hints of trouble?  Now, back then, the foundation, as  President Ronald Reagan was saying at the time, was sound.  This president  says the same, it's sound.  No one could argue then, no one can argue now  both presidents were right.</p><p>But markets follow their own kind of weird verbs.  Do you see anything that  worries you right now?</p><p>ARMO:  The only concern is the same concern really, Neil, that we have had  all year.  It's China, China.  Nobody knows what's going to happen with  China.</p><p>They just came out today.  This is part of the reason why for the sell-off  too.  The administration announced they're going to review, the CFIUS  Committee is going to review some of these investments, these foreign  investments in the U.S.</p><p>And that's a bugaboo for China.  And that's problematic.  China is playing  hardball.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And, by the way, China is officially in a bear market.</p><p>ARMO:  Oh, they have been.  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Its market -- it's well into a bear market.  We are not.  We are  not.</p><p>In fact, we're up on the year.  But the fact of the matter is, that's a  worry.  The notion is that we could be the stand-alone market, the standout  market, which we are, and the stand-alone standout economy, which we are,  but can we keep going it alone, if there are all these other headwinds from  China, from Italy now barely able to make a budget and concern that it's  going to go into a freefall?</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>ARMO:  I think we could.  Of course we could.  We're the United States of  America.  And that's the great thing about being here, living here,  participating in the market.</p><p>Trump is in charge.  We will see what he's going to do.  I will say one  thing.  Today's drop-off might stave off the Fed from raising interest  rates one more time before the end of the year, when it looked like they  might raise them again, which was in question if they would do one more  before the end of the year.</p><p>This drop-off might stave them off a little bit, which is a good thing for  consumers and a good thing for market participants.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very, very much, Melissa.  </p><p>The Fed, to which she was alluding, the Federal Reserve, of course,  expected to raise rates and four more times before the end of this year and  three more times next year.  </p><p>All of that in response, I must stress, to good economic news.  The economy  is doing quite well, in fact, generationally, record-level well, but it is  that strong economy that is perplexing traders.  They realize that interest  rates were going to go up, and that was baked into the cake, so to speak.</p><p>They didn't realize they would go backing up to the degree they already  have, a 10-year note slipping back, a two-year note slipping back.  And a  lot of people wondering, we don't know where this goes.  There's an old saw  on Wall Street here.  In uncertainty, you sell.  You ask questions later.</p><p>They're selling.  They will deal with the other stuff later.  </p><p>Right now, the immediate concern in the Panhandle is this storm and  Hurricane Michael and how the region dodged a bullet.  But it's a very  pricey bullet and a very nasty one.  </p><p>It could have been even nastier -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>We are getting word that as many as 320,000 Floridians decided to ride out  the storm and never evacuated.  We do not know their status.  </p><p>We also know that millions of Americans were caught in their sell-off.  We  do know theirs.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, let's get the latest on Michael.</p><p>Could have been and probably should have been worse.  It is still pretty  bad, though.</p><p>Rick Leventhal in Panama City with the latest -- Rick.</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>And, Neil, I apologize for the camera issues.  It's gotten fogged up, and  it's been getting rained on.  We have been getting rained on for hours now.</p><p>The rain has slowed down pretty considerably.  But the wind is still  blowing.  And we just got word that there's a rescue mission under way here  in Panama City.  Panama City Fire and Rescue heading out to try and save  someone from some sort of situation.</p><p>They had told us that they had encouraged 120,000 people to evacuate before  the storm, and that didn't happen.  About half the people actually  evacuated.  The other half stayed.  And apparently at least one of those  people needs to be rescued.</p><p>Neil, this is the kind of stuff, if you can see it, that's flying around  out here, or was.  It's a piece from the -- from the building next to us,  some kind of siding.  And it's sort of a tile material.  And it's pretty  heavy.</p><p>And I want to show you one other thing.  The damages aren't extensive where  we are, but you can see one of the utility poles that basically snapped in  half.  There is a transformer at the end of that pole.  The power is out  here and probably will be for sometime.</p><p>Damage is not as extensive as some had feared they might be, but a lot of  them are still being assessed, Neil, because it's just now starting to  clear up.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Rick, be safe, and your crew as well, Rick Leventhal.</p><p>Let's go to WeatherBELL's Joe Bastardi on what he makes of all of this --  Joseph.</p><p>JOE BASTARDI, WEATHERBELL CHIEF FORECASTER:  Well, Port St. Joe is on the  other side of the eye.  The eye went ashore southeast of Rick.</p><p>And I think that that area is probably going to be devastated.  It'll be  interesting to see.  And hopefully people got out of that area.  This came  ashore stronger than any hurricane that we have recorded in this area.  </p><p>The barometric pressure was down at 920 millibars, which was very close to  what Andrew hit Miami at.  And I'm sure, when the damage is totaled up in  those areas, again, the western side of the eyewall was in Panama City.  </p><p>So the wind blew out toward the Gulf of Mexico, didn't come in from the  Gulf of Mexico, and that's going to be a big deal.  But this is now into  Southwest Georgia.  And it's just raising havoc as it goes inland, because  it's so very powerful.  </p><p>You're not going to see storms that get into Georgia with 100-mile-an-hour  winds, 120.  It's coming -- it's coming down quite a bit.  The future path  of the storm takes it near Macon tonight around 2:00 in the morning, where  winds should gust between 80 and 90, perhaps 100 miles an hour, Augusta  tomorrow morning 60, 80 miles an hour.</p><p>Go just southeast to Columbia, tomorrow, during the afternoon, tomorrow  night, be midway between Fayetteville and Raleigh, and then reach the North  Carolina coast near Elizabeth city, it looks, like probably 2:00 a.m. in  the morning Friday.</p><p>When that happens, what will happen, Neil, is the frictional effects of the  storm will diminish, so that the storm will wind back up again.  You folks  in Virginia Beach -- I have seen his before -- don't be surprised if you  have a three- to six-hour period where the winds out of the north gusting  to 60, 70 miles an hour, even though the storm will be reported to have  less winds.</p><p>And they sort of play possum over land, but as soon as they get near the  water, they rev back up again.  As far as rainfall, widespread three to six  locally, 12-inch amounts from where the storm is now all the way into  Southeast Virginia.  And that includes the area that was devastated by  Florence.</p><p>That may aggravate the situation in there.  There's going to be more power  outages with this because it's going to continue to have strong winds  inland.  And to the east of that track I gave you, there's going to be  tornadic activity breaking out tonight into tomorrow.</p><p>And that's going to be another problem with this storm.  So even though  it's weakened and it's inland, we will see what the damage was right where  this went ashore.  I fear that it's going to look like this storm bulldozed  some areas when they get in there.</p><p>But we will see.  The pressure where this came ashore at 920 millibars is  the strongest by far ever in that area between Mobile and Tampa.  So this  is strongest storm, barometric pressure, likely wind, that we have recorded  since back in 1851.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>I do also know, as you mentioned at the outset, the flooding possibilities,  nine rivers that were already surging and had been surged a good deal, I  think at least seven of them from Florence, resurge all over again.  So  that just compounds the problem for the Carolinas, Georgia, et cetera.   Right?  </p><p>BASTARDI:  Yes, it does, Neil.  </p><p>And I will tell you this, folks.  I believe the last time we were on, Neil,  back in September, I said you will probably see me showing up again in  October.  You won't see me again with hurricanes when this one's done.  You  will see me for winter storms.  But I believe this is going to be the last  impact storm on the United States this season.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Let's hope you're right on that.  </p><p>Joe Bastardi, thank you very, very much.  </p><p>Just a couple of things.  The president, of course, has already said  earlier in the day that FEMA and anyone else, also meeting with his  historical secretary, would provide any emergency help that was necessary.   He is going to be heading off to a campaign event tonight in Erie,  Pennsylvania, on Friday to Lebanon, Ohio, on Saturday to Richmond,  Kentucky.  </p><p>We are told that he wants to at least get a firsthand view of what's  happening the Panhandle probably sometime Sunday, could be Monday.  Wants  to be as the least disruptive way possible.  Easier said than done when any  president of the United States visits a region, but he wants to come when  it is a good time to come.  And he hopes to make that Sunday or Monday.  </p><p>We will have more after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, the latest on Michael now, no longer a Category 4  storm.  But it is going to pack serious winds now as it makes its way north  into Georgia and the Carolinas.  </p><p>FOX News Channel's chief meteorologist, Rick Reichmuth, on its path now --  Rick.  </p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST:  Neil, yes, obviously the  stronger the storm when it comes offshore, the worse damage on the shore.  </p><p>But that also means that it's going to take a longer time for those strong  winds to go down.  So you see it made landfall.  We have had recorded wind  gusts at 130 miles an hour.  Keep in mind we don't have wind meters in  every place, and a lot of them get blown offline.  </p><p>But they had verified at 155 mile-an-hour winds when that was coming right  onshore there.  Now, you take a look at it, starting to weaken a little bit  there.  But we're all up in across the northeastern area of Alabama moving  in towards Georgia right now.  </p><p>Still with that well-defined center, and that means those hurricane-force  winds now are extending very, very far off towards the north.  Radar  picture shows the same thing behind it, still some more bands.  Likely  right along the coast, we're going to calm down a little bit, especially  across the western side of this.</p><p>On the eastern side, we will still see more moisture that is going to  continue to be pulled up onshore.  How does this rank compared to other  storms?  Take a look at this.  When you think of all of the big storms we  have had in our country over the years, wind wise, this is right below  Andrew.</p><p>And as far as that central pressure goes, how low the pressure in the  center of the storm went, take a look at that.  That is the third strongest  storm, the third lowest pressure we have ever recorded of a landfalling  storm here across the U.S. </p><p>This is where we are now, still technically 140-mile-an-hour winds  sustained.  That will come down, I'm sure, a little bit as we get to that  5:00 advisory that is going to come out shortly.</p><p>And it will remain a hurricane for a little bit longer, go in towards  tomorrow morning.  We still have a tropical storm getting, moving in  towards South Carolina.  And we're going to very gusty conditions there  across the Carolinas.  Keep in mind a lot of areas likely have some  weakened trees from all of the flooding that was there.</p><p>Some of that water is gone.  But all of those root systems now are going to  be very, very weakened here across the Carolinas.  So won't take much to  cause more wind to go over and knock some more of those trees out.  </p><p>Likely strengthening a little bit here once it moves ashore, but we got a  couple more days before we're fully done with this storm -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, Rick, I didn't realize it got very close to Category 5,  didn't it?</p><p>REICHMUTH:  One mile an hour away from the Cat 5, yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Incredible.  Wow.  </p><p>Rick, thank you very, very much.  Rick Reichmuth.  </p><p>REICHMUTH:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, this is also Oil Rig Alley, they call it, along the Gulf,  when you have so many oil rigs and other facilities set up -- 40 percent of  our overall oil output is in this region.  So you would think that,  immediately, prices would be spiking when it shut down.  Just the opposite.  </p><p>That was a little weird.  But a guy who specializes in things that don't  make sense, because he quickly make sense of them, is our energy trader and  energy watcher, Phil Flynn. </p><p>Phil Flynn, why did we go down on oil prices?  </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP:  Well, a couple of reasons.  </p><p>The main reason is where the storm actually hit.  The track of the storm  miss some of the major installations.  So all that production that you were  talking about that was shut in can be brought online very quickly once the  storm passes.  </p><p>And now the storm has gone away from worrying about how much oil supplies  and natural gas supplies we might lose to how much demand we might lose  because of the track of the storm.  If you take a look at that scary map,  when we're going right through Florida into all of those different states,  Virginia, Georgia, you name it, a lot of those people, of course, are going  to be without power.</p><p>They're not going to be able to drive.  And so the demand that would  usually occur for oil in a normal everyday situation is not going to  happen.  So now the concern has gone away from, oh, my gosh, we won't have  oil to supply the market to, we won't have demand to use it.  </p><p>Now, the one thing I want to caution everybody is, is that this is called  demand destruction when we have a storm like this.  It's usually a very  short-term phenomena, because I'm afraid that the damage that we're  potentially going to see, Neil, from this storm is going to require a lot  of energy in the future to rebuild.  </p><p>So right now, the market is not as concerned about the loss of supply, but  a couple of weeks down the road, when we start to rebuild, that oil demand  is going to be back, and in a big way.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you, my friend, very much, Phil Flynn.</p><p>A couple of developments.  There apparently is a tornado watch in effect  for locations that in Florida directly affected by this along the  Panhandle.  That is not unusual after something like this, flash flood  warnings given not only from the Panhandle area, but right straight through  the Carolinas.  </p><p>As you can see, that is the trajectory.  For those of you listening on  radio, this trajectory takes it through Georgia, South Carolina, North  Carolina, before it goes back out to sea sometime this weekend.  But it's  going to be around for a while.  </p><p>Also, Hurricane Michael has forced at least eight cruises to reroute and up  to 1,000 flights to and from airports in the area to be outright canceled  or reschedule.  Airlines affected have dropped all booking fees as a result  of changing your plans, as if you had a choice.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, after the storm, there's the power that goes invariably  during and after the storm.  And it usually increases in the hours  afterwards.  </p><p>We're already seeing that now, better than 200,000, we are told, without  power now in the region.  That could add as the night ensues here.</p><p>Catherine Stempien and is with Duke Energy.  In fact, she's the Florida  president.</p><p>Very good to have you with us, Catherine.  And thank you for taking the  time.</p><p>What is the situation there power wise for folks?  </p><p>CATHERINE STEMPIEN, DUKE ENERGY:  So, we're already seeing significant  outages all across our system up on the Panhandle.  We're predicting about  100,000 to 200,000 households and businesses that are customers of Duke  Energy Florida will be losing their power as a result of this system.  </p><p>Additionally, we expect maybe an additional 100,000 customers from the  local electric cooperative, the municipalities who receive their  electricity from Duke Energy will also be affected, because we're  anticipating significant damage to our transmission system in the area.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, I know it's hard to compare Florence with this and different  storms.  Florence hung around a while, less so with Michael.  </p><p>How does that factor into when you get things back up and running?  </p><p>STEMPIEN:  Well, we're currently anticipating it could take days or maybe  even more than a week for us to really get customers back online.  </p><p>This system, with the winds of over 150,000 -- 150 miles per hour, in  addition to significant storm surge and flooding, is really impacting,  submerging our systems, damaging equipment that are powering entire  communities,.  We really see that, in some areas, we're going to have to  rebuild our entire electrical system.  And that's going to take some time.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, and that's that's a long-haul effort, as you said here.</p><p>I'm wondering, too, given the fact that fewer than half those in the  affected areas -- or affected areas decided to evacuate, as the governor  had urged, does that complicate things for you?  </p><p>STEMPIEN:  Well, it certainly does.  </p><p>And I would like to thank Governor Scott for his leadership here in  declaring a state of emergency for storm-impacted areas.  And we're working  very closely with the governor and his team to prioritize critical  facilities and also working closely with the Department of Transportation  to coordinate on road clearing.  </p><p>But our ability to access some of those areas is really going to depend --  it's really going to hamper our ability to recover and to rebuild the  system.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Having said all of that, Catherine, you can't minimize the work  that's ahead of you and your folks and the region.</p><p>Are you breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief?  It was envisioned to be,  certainly when it came in, much worse.</p><p>STEMPIEN:  Well, we're still seeing impacts of the storm, so I don't think  we are through this storm yet.  And, of course, it's going to continue to  impact areas of Georgia and up through the Carolinas, many of which are the  same communities that were just impacted by Hurricane Florence.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>STEMPIEN:  So I don't feel like we're out of the woods yet.</p><p>I would like to make sure to encourage people who were in Florida to be  safe, to call 911 if they need any critical assistance, and to be  communicating with their local EOCs, which they can find information about  on FloridaDisaster.org for more information.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Catherine Stempien, thank you.  Wise words, all.  We appreciate  it.  </p><p>I'm sure your customers appreciate it.  </p><p>All right, so about 100,000 to 200,000 without power now.  Whether that  escalates, some say it will -- you don't know who's right on this.  I know,  with Florence, it exponentially went on, as the night and the storm went  on.  That was a slow mover.  This is more serious, but faster.  So you take  your bets.</p><p>All right, Hurricane Michael, though, is still barrelling through Florida.   And now Georgia is next in its sights.  And as a number of folks were  warning at FEMA and beyond, do not take this lightly in Georgia, and do not  take it lightly if you're well inland.  It is still packing a punch --  after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it looks like Michael has Georgia on its mine.  </p><p>Steve Harrigan is in Macon, Georgia, with the latest.  </p><p>Hey, Steve.</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, the storm may have made  landfall in Florida about 200 miles away from here, but it's really just  beginning in the state of Florida.</p><p>It intends to enter the state of Florida as a Category 2 hurricane, then  weakened to a Category 1 hurricane, before weakening further to a tropical  storm.  </p><p>That means, across the state of Georgia, we're going to see major  structural damage, damage to roofs, buildings, houses, power lines down,  electricity out, and perhaps part of the agriculture here devastated,  especially that peanut crop.</p><p>So they were really taken by surprise a little bit here, because this storm  got more powerful very quickly over the Gulf of Mexico.  We heard the FEMA  administrator say this morning Georgia has to wake up to the danger ahead.   It is waking up quickly to that danger.  While there are no mandatory  evacuations planned, a state of emergency has been declared, and the  National Guard has been mobilized -- Neil, back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Steve Harrigan, thank you very, very much. </p><p>Of course, Steve will be watching that as it moves its way into Georgia.  </p><p>So this thing isn't over.  And neither is this sell-off at the corner of  Wall and Broad.  It was a big one today.</p><p>Let's look at where this stacks up against other big hits in the Dow.  This  is just in point terms, that today's would rank third, but between what  happened back in the early days of this year, when we were going through  the same sort of conundrum here and were worried about interest rates.  </p><p>I should add that, in percentage terms, about -- the 3 percent falloff  today wouldn't even crack the top 10, dare I say the top 15 of hits to the  Dow.  </p><p>But it is real, it is nasty and it is built on the idea interest rates are  going up because the economy keeps moving up.  That would normally be a  good thing, but not so right now, when people worry about, how high is  high?</p><p>Tough to get a home loan.  Tougher to get a mortgage loan.  Tough to get  any sort of loan.  And, in that environment, they sell.  </p><p>We will see tonight with futures and foreign trading.  </p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

I'm Neil Cavuto.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it has been an awful day weather wise in the Gulf and an awful day at  the corner of Wall and Broad and for your 401(k) and investment statements.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are top of each development, the situation with that hurricane.  And  it's a doozy, Michael at a Category 4 doing.  There's a lot of flooding.   There's a lot of wind.  There's been reports of a good deal of damage.  But  it could have been a whole lot worse.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I wish, I wish I could say the same about what happened to the investment  community today</p><p>We're on top of both dramatic developments.  </p><p>By the way, I do want to kick off, though, with what happened on the  financial side and what could possibly bring us to session lows down better  than 3 percent, the worst single-day performance in this market.  You would  have to go back to early February.  And you would have to go back to levels  in this market that we had not seen since all the way back in August.  </p><p>So, do want to step back from all this.  And as bad as it was, we are  simply revisiting, in the cases of some stock, levels we were last seeing  about four to six weeks ago.  We will get into the details on that.  </p><p>But let me suffice it to say that the catalyst for all of this was an  improving economy.  Now, I know that sounds a little weird.  But a lot of  this has to do with a backup in interest rates to address that improving  economy, and the notion that interest rates are going to have to go back  still further and higher.  </p><p>What happens with the markets is, they never really know how to digest the  unexpected or the unknown.  And the unknown for them is, how much is too  much.</p><p>Right now, a 10-year note fetches about 3.75 percent.  That is the highest  we have seen in about seven years.  A two-year note reaching a level today  that was the highest we have seen in more than a decade.  </p><p>But it's what you get used to.  There were times when these were double- digit events.  So, in other words, when we had a 10-year note at 10 percent  or better during the late 1980s, or when we had a two-year note that was  routinely double what it is now, for a while triple what it is now.</p><p>But it doesn't do much good to say that was then, this is now.  It's what  we have been getting used to now, better than a decade of near zero percent  interest rates set by a Federal Reserve that was trying to get us out of a  recession and a meltdown.  It did the trick.</p><p>Now the trick is unwinding all of that, again, easier said than done.</p><p>To Charles Payne at the Nasdaq that was the not-so-pleasant beneficiary of  the bulk of that selling.</p><p>So, Charles, interesting enough, a lot of those tech names that led us on  this parade were the ones getting the most battered, huh?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  You're absolutely right, Neil.  </p><p>And it's not just today.  These big tech names over the last two or three  weeks have been conspicuously weak, very vulnerable, some going back to  earnings.  Facebook collapsed on its earnings.  Netflix didn't have great  earnings.  Twitter came down.</p><p>But then some of the more -- even the larger names.  Apple two days ago got  a sell rating.  That's really rare with a company like that.  Amazon has  its issues.  A lot of this revolving around regulatory concerns, as well,  which have creeped into this area because of some of the practices from all  of them.</p><p>But no one, to your point, was spared.  And I will go back to the Dow for a  moment, because what we witness now, this year, are the three biggest,  largest point losses in the history of the Dow, not percentage losses, of  course.  Three of the four biggest losses, of course, this year all  revolved -- in fact, no, four -- four of the five all revolved around the  Federal Reserve.</p><p>In February, rates started to go higher.  We got a jobs report that looked  like it was too hot.  Everyone started to panic over what the Fed may do to  slow this economy down.  That sort of settled down.  We were able to deal  with 3 percent.  But now the velocity of how quickly these rates have gone  up again, these yields, again spooking the market.</p><p>But I will add, Neil, there was some fundamental news.  You and I talked a  little bit yesterday.  It's not a household name, but Pittsburgh Plate  Glass is a 135-year-old company.  People know the company.  You probably  have some of their paint on your car, OK.  So they had bad numbers.</p><p>They warned of higher prices.  Today, Fastenal, again, an industrial name,  not a household name, but it led the industrials lower.  That was the  second-worst performing sector.  It was the worst-performing stock in that  sector.</p><p>So some of this is interest-rate related.  Some of this is higher prices.   Some of is just speculation that things have been great.  Can they  continue?</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very, very much, Charles Payne.</p><p>Again, all Dow 30 stocks were down.  That is a rarity, but every single one  of them down.  So you don't see that often.</p><p>Also, with an 831-point in the Dow -- if we can go back to showing the Dow,  guys -- that 831-point hit represents about a little more than 3 percent in  the value of the Dow Jones industrials shredded today.</p><p>Now, I should hasten to add, in percentage terms, that -- that's a lot, but  it's not what it was in 1987.  You might recall, October 19, 1987, October,  yes, it tends to be a scary time, we lost a quarter of the Dow's value in  one single session, even though it represented 508 points at the time.</p><p>So I hasten to add that, just to put it in perspective, not to just gloss  over this, but to put it in percentage perspective here, that we are still  nominally up on the year.  And even though some very big names that have  led us here, like an Amazon, for example, not part of the Dow, but part of  the technology run-up, that is in correction territory right now.  </p><p>In other words, it has fallen more than 10 percent from its highs.  So  you're going to hear a lot about a lot of stocks that have fallen into  correction territory or 10 percent or more from their highs. vs. bear  market territory, 20 percent or further from their highs.</p><p>Now, one out of five S&amp;P 500 stocks are already in that latter camp.  So  we're keeping an eye on it, as is this next fellow, chief market strategist  for path Trading Partners, Bob Iaccino.  </p><p>Bob, thank you for joining us.  What's your take on this day, whether this  was overdone or justified, given the alarming run-up we have seen?</p><p>BOB IACCINO, PATH TRADING PARTNERS:  Good afternoon, Neil.  </p><p>To me, it's a time when we need to be responsible in terms of being in the  financial media reporting on these kind of things, because these are the  exact kind of moves people get scared about.  They're exaggerated.  They're  overdone.  And they tend to end up being buying opportunities, maybe not  today.</p><p>But specifically this kind of move prior to earnings, with the headwinds  that we see with the stock markets, from tariffs, to higher rates, to the  Fed being on this trajectory, the Fed put is no longer in place now, if the  Fed is taking this sort of punchbowl away.  </p><p>But this is a really good time to be going into earnings and get this  exaggerated sell-off, if I could point out a silver lining.  If we get that  20 percent earnings growth, you're going to have some sectors and some  stocks respond to the upside.  From the prior levels, we wouldn't  necessarily get that.  We would kind of get profit-taking.  </p><p>So not to say this is a good thing.  It's never a good thing.  You never  want to see people's 401(k)s drop like this.  But the timing of it, I'm  kind of a fan of.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, now, we have been the market leader in the world.  We  have been leading this parade.  In fact, as things stand now, with the  European markets in the doldrums and now indications it could get worse  with Italy's problems -- I don't want to get on a tangent -- of course, we  know what's happened in Asia.  We know what has happened to the Chinese  market, of course, already well into bear market territory.  </p><p>Could you envision that for us, or what?  </p><p>IACCINO:  No, I think it's the other way around, Neil.  And I think that's  why you're pointing it out.  </p><p>One thing we don't see all that often is stocks and bonds going in the same  direction.  We do see it, but it usually doesn't sustain.  We're actually  seeing a little bit of stabilization in the longer end of the curve as I  speak to you right now, especially that 10-year-to-30-year sector.  </p><p>So I think we're actually going to get some relief on the rate side, we're  going to get some good earnings, and we are likely to pull the rest of the  world up.  Now, we do have to see the effect of tariffs in the earnings.   We didn't see it in the last earnings report, the last quarter.</p><p>We might see the start of it now.  But we're also going to see in the in  the next quarter some of the positives of the USMCA, some of the positives  of the deal with Korea, some of the positives of the deal with --  potentially with Europe.  So there might be some balance there.  </p><p>I think we're actually going to lead the world out of it.  The economy here  is strong.  This sell-off is too fast, but still the timing of it, again, I  have to say I'm kind of a fan of just before earnings.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, and it is October after all.  Thank you very, very  much, my friend.  </p><p>Again, putting in October in perspective, even though it is not technically  the worst month of the year for stocks -- technically, that is September --  September ended up being a pretty good month for stocks, by and large, but  the fact of the matter is, whether you're talking 2008 and the financial  meltdown, or 1997 and the Asian contagion, or 1987, of course, the  memorable stock market crash, or 1929, and the follow-up that brought us  the Depression, it has a history of spooking us.</p><p>And it does, right?</p><p>All right, let's get the latest right now from Phil Keating in  Apalachicola, Florida with the very latest on how Hurricane Michael is  sorting out there.  </p><p>Sir.</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.  </p><p>This is Apalachicola, where it was ferocious for multiple hours today.  But  this is pretty much -- we're still getting a gust as we speak right now.   You can see the wind blowing all this floodwater.  Much of that is  rainwater.  Much of it is storm surge.  </p><p>The Apalachicola River is adjacent to this street, which is Water Street.   So that's very calm now, but you can actually see off into the distance.   So straight down below us, this is actually a roadway, but there's no  driving on this for now.  That is absolutely certain.  </p><p>And off to your right, the entire parking lot is still underwater.  The  cars for the hotel patrons here, including our vehicles, are all over  there.  That was the highest point of the parking lot.  And it looks like  most of them, at least the far row, survives.  Some of them in the lower  row there on your screen, I saw windshield wipers going, lights turning on  and off, the computers of the cars victims of the storm surge and the  flooding waters down here.  </p><p>A lot of damage of these tin roofs  aluminum roots here on these storage  buildings.  There's a shrimp processing facility down there.  A lot of that  frozen shrimp off-loaded into 18-wheelers yesterday anticipating everything  you see over there was going to be underwater, as it is right now.  </p><p>And they're actually parked not too far from here.  But, of course, their  generators aren't running.  So all of that shrimp and fish that was frozen  slowly will be thawing out, and if it's not rescued in time, it will soon  be worthless.  </p><p>There is a mandatory curfew for everybody in this county, in fact, all of  the counties in the Big Bend and the Panhandle, from sunset to sunrise.</p><p>From here on out, what's going to be very important right now is for the  sheriff's departments in every county, as well as police departments and  other emergency responders, to get out and about on those shallow draft  boats, their high-profile vehicles, ATVs, and try to figure out how much  damage is out there, because everybody has simply hunkered down all day  long, including the sheriff of this county, who texted us back saying,  \"This is the worst I have ever seen.\"</p><p>It was a ferocious, ferocious storm, 155 mile-an-hour winds when it made  landfall just northwest of here.  Much damage undoubtedly remains to be  discovered perhaps as early as tonight, but definitely throughout the day  tomorrow and maybe the next day after it.</p><p>And that, of course, does include the potential loss of life, because this  was absolutely a life-threatening storm and very dangerous.  Everyone is  under an order right now, do not leave your house.  Still under that order.   That went into effect at about 7:00 a.m. this morning, when things really  started to deteriorate, and right around noon until about 4:00 3:00, it was  really something to see, something to experience.</p><p>It was one hell of a hurricane, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Man, oh, man, it certainly looked like that.  I'm glad you're  safe, your crew is safe.  Phil, thank you very, very much, Phil Keating in  Apalachicola, Florida.</p><p>And we will be talking to that city's mayor shortly.</p><p>An update from the president of the United States.</p><p>John Roberts at the White House right now.  He's been monitoring these  developments very, very closely -- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  And, Neil, the  president just taking off from the White House South Lawn a short time ago  on the way to Erie, Pennsylvania.  </p><p>Some shouted questions at the president about is he concerned about the  drop in the markets now, over 800 points?  The president didn't answer  questions.  But I did just get off the phone with a senior White House  official, who told me that the feeling around the White House here is that  this is a bull market correction.  It's nothing to panic about.  And, in  fact, it's probably a good thing.  The market might have been a little bit  overheated.  </p><p>There are some concerns about rising interest rates.  However, this person  tells me that those concerns are probably overbaked.  There's also some  concern among some companies that the looming tariffs against China could  hurt their bottom line.  But the fact is, the economy is roaring ahead.   And so that argument really doesn't hold a lot of water.  </p><p>So it's just -- it's a day, it would seem, according to folks I talk to at  the White House here, Neil, that the market got a little bit skittish about  some of the indicators that they see out there and some of the potential  for some things to happen.  But they believe that in the overall this is  something that will pass, it's a momentary correction in the market.  We  are not about to enter a bear market by any stretch of the imagination,  according to folks here at the White House.  And we will likely see a  turnaround sometime in the next few days.  </p><p>So, nothing to panic about here, is what we're being told as far as the  markets go -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, when it comes to the hurricane and visiting folks in that  region, I think the president had said he hoped to be down in the Florida  Panhandle area by Sunday or Monday?</p><p>ROBERTS:  He did.</p><p>Yes, clearly, when something like this passes through as quickly as it as  it does, it's not going to have the lingering effect that Hurricane  Florence did.  But certainly it's going to leave a lot of damage behind,  it's going to leave a lot of work for first-responders to attend to.  </p><p>So the president doesn't want to get in the way of that.  Any time you  traveled to that true, or at least to an area that's been hard-hit by a  hurricane, the facilities there are already overtaxed, and you don't want  to add to that by bringing the president down.  </p><p>But it would seem that the Air Force base down there took the brunt of the  hit here from this hurricane.  So it may be that the president can get down  there a little earlier and take a look at some of the damage.  But when he  talked about it in the Oval Office, he had either Sunday or Monday as  possible times that he could get down there.  </p><p>So we will see, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, John Roberts of the White House, thank you very, very  much.</p><p>We will give you the latest of that storm and some of those mayors in the  region directly affected by it.  They're breathing a sigh of relief after  it.  </p><p>I don't know if investors feel the same way, but we're on top of both  storms, what they mean for the region down there and what they mean for you  and your portfolio and investments here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, no pun intended, but when it rains, it pours.</p><p>Certainly, in the case of Hurricane Michael, the worst storm to hit the  Panhandle area in the better part of the century, and it could have been a  lot worse.  That's all we can say.</p><p>And the corner of Wall and Broad, certainly the worst sell-off to hit the  markets in the better part of six months.</p><p>First on the storm with Jeff Flock in Panama City Beach -- Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Damage from the sell-off  yet to be known, but the damage here starting to be known.</p><p>You can see it's not exactly catastrophic, but if you're the guy that owns  -- spins around, maybe you see you lose a roof, all kinds of other debris  out here.</p><p>We're just kind of now assessing what we see, but get through the debris  here.  Maybe we take you down to the beach.  I have not been down here yet.   But I want to see what this water looks like.</p><p>It doesn't appear there's...</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, I apologize for our feed there and for all of his hard  reporting here.</p><p>Let's dip back in, if it's OK again.</p><p>FLOCK:  Got you?  You still got me there?  Sorry.</p><p>I know it's probably a little funky, huh, Neil?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  It is, but I'm getting you, buddy.  Keep going.</p><p>FLOCK:  OK.</p><p>Well, we will keep going here.  We're just trying to see what the -- what  the status is down on the beach.  </p><p>You OK, Kyle? </p><p>As you can see, I mean, is it catastrophic damage?  No, I wouldn't say so.   But the damage is quite clear.  And I will leave you with a shot maybe of  the beach.  If we walk around here, we can just see it, obviously more --  more of this kind of thing, but the...</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, I apologize for that.  Certainly not his fault.</p><p>These are what you deal with when you're obviously in a situation, and  digital's what you rely on.</p><p>Apalachicola, Florida, Mayor Van Johnson joins us on the phone right now.  </p><p>Mayor, you must be breathing a sigh of relief.  You're not entirely out of  the woods here, and I'm sure you're assessing things, but it could have  been worse.</p><p>VAN JOHNSON, MAYOR OF APALACHICOLA, FLORIDA:  That is true.</p><p>I just had a conversation with our chief of police, who is actually out and  about now.  In a city like Apalachicola that would normally take 15 to 20  minutes to ride the whole town driving about 25 miles an hour, he's finding  it difficult just to get from street to street because of all the down  power lines and trees.</p><p>So, he's out assessing the situation.  And it's just -- we're going to have  a lot of cleanup to do in the aftermath of this storm. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Mayor, there was a call on the part of the governor for people to  voluntarily evacuate on their own.</p><p>We're told, throughout the Panhandle area, about 50 percent took him up on  that.  What were the percentages in your town?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  It was about 40 percent in my community leading up.</p><p>In fact, I was at that press conference when the governor expressed the  need to evacuate.  And at that time, it was reported about 40 percent of  the people from Apalachicola had heeded that call.  </p><p>Now, as the storm intensified and reached a Category 4 classification, a  lot more people took it seriously and started to leave.  But I believe  about 20 percent just decided to hunker down.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Any rescues that need being done now?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  None reported.  Of course, the call went out that if you decided  to stay in your house, don't be roaming out in the streets, to minimize any  injury to yourself or the rescue workers or the people that was out there.  </p><p>So I haven't heard of any calls for rescue, and I thank God for that.  I  haven't heard whether we had any loss of life yet, and I thank God for that  as well.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Mayor, one of the things that you keep hearing about this storm is  that it moved fast.  And the good about that is that it didn't have time to  hang around and do still more damage.  </p><p>What was it like by you?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, I'm actually -- I actually evacuated.</p><p>I took the governor's call, and I took the heed, my own memo that I sent  out.  And I evacuated to Destin, which is about 120 miles east of  Apalachicola.  </p><p>But from what I'm understanding, that we had flooding, downed power lines,  trees.  We had some road closures.  In fact, the major thoroughfare out of  Apalachicola, Highway 98, is actually washed in two between Eastpoint and  Carrabelle.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  What about power outages?  We heard a couple hundred thousand  people in the area were without power.  And that could exponentially grow.   I'm sure it will.  What is the latest in your area?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, just about all of Franklin County is out of -- without  power.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Hmm.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And any indication what you're getting from folks and when it will  be returned?  I know, in the case of most storms, Florence included, they  waited weeks.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, I know the governor spoke during his press conference that  he had been in contact with Duke Energy, and that they had about 1,900  trucks waiting for when the storm passed to come back into the area and  restore power.  </p><p>I don't know if that has taken place as yet, but it was certainly part of  the recovery plan.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Mayor, I'm glad you're well.  I'm glad it appears your folks are  well and those around you are well.  You dodged a bullet, as they say.  </p><p>But be well, sir.  Thank you.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Thank you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Not so many investors who might have been getting used to the fact that  what goes up, up, up, up can sometimes go down and sometimes go down with a  thud. </p><p>We should hasten to add here, with this 831-point falloff in the Dow today,  it might seem like an eye-popping number.  And I don't want to minimize it.   It is.  But a little bit north of 3 present in value, compare that to what  happened on October 19, 1987, when a quarter of the Dow's value was wiped  out, it is very, very different.</p><p>Having said all of that, though, these are one-day hits to technology  stocks that have led this parade.  You heard a great deal about the so- called FANG stocks, those that were the largely the technology issues, the  Facebooks, the Amazon, the Netflix, the Google Alphabets, that had led a  parade that produced disproportionate returns.</p><p>If not for those issues, the Nasdaq, for example, wouldn't look nearly as  impressive.  And today it didn't.  From its highs, it's down now about 6.5  to 7 percent.  So that's not even correction territory.</p><p>However, Amazon is effectively in correction territory, and then some, down  10 percent or more from its highs.  But this is an issue that has surged 50  percent over this year.  So put that in perspective as well, as does market  watcher Melissa Armo.</p><p>So, Melissa, your take on today.  Is there more of this to come?  What do  you think?</p><p>MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH:  I definitely think we could possibly be  lower tomorrow, just because of the huge sell-off today.</p><p>But here's the lesson of today, Neil.  Don't buy the dip.  I was watching  yesterday.  Everyone says, oh, buy the dip, buy the dip.  We fell off last  weekend to Monday, and people were buying yesterday.  I wasn't surprised at  all this morning.  I could tell right into the open this morning, five  minutes into the open, that we were going to sell off.</p><p>And it was straight selling, all down today, because people bought  yesterday.  When something's falling, when you have a falling knife with,  like you said, a thud, you don't buy it because you don't know where it's  going to land.  Buy strength.  Short weakness in the market.  That's how  you make money, that's how you make profit.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, I'm not a market technician.  I think a lot of this stuff  that a lot of those fine-tune market folks use is akin to reading chicken  entrails and tea leaves.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Having said that, they say it's generally not a healthy ending to  be at your session lows at the ending, that there's a washout period to  come.</p><p>You alluded to that on your comments earlier.  What do you envision  tomorrow morning?</p><p>ARMO:  Tomorrow morning, I think if we open neutral, we drop.  If we gap  down in the morning, I think we can fall in and hold.</p><p>The only way we -- you could buy the market tomorrow is if we had a huge,  massive gap up, and I don't think that's going to happen.  I think it's a  washout until, when, Friday.  Friday morning, it's critical for the market.</p><p>And here's why.  J.P. Morgan Chase reports before the open, Citibank and  Wells Fargo.  J.P. Morgan Chase is the one you want to watch.  If those  banks report well, which I don't know, on Friday morning, then we could  have a turnaround.  Then the market could look a lot different to close the  week that it does at the close of today.</p><p>Market can change tune here.  Remember, we just made brand-new all-time  highs again on the Dow.  I wouldn't panic.  Now, if you're in retirement,  you might be panicking because of this big sell-off.  </p><p>But if you have a long way to retirement -- I'm talking three years, five  years, 10 years or more, stay long in the market.  i don't think we're  anywhere near changing trend.  I do think that market is strong.  And I  said this earlier.  I believe the market closes very strong into December,  just like we started the year.</p><p>We're going into earnings season.  I would say be worried if we weren't  going into earnings season.  But because we are, a lot of these stocks that  don't look so good today, all the tech, and even the banks too, could be  completely 100 percent different after they report.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You might be right.</p><p>I know they say that history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure can rhyme.   And what rhymes here to me is some of what was going on in 1987 the week  before the crash, when the Dow was sort of dropping off the days before,  and there were hints of trouble to come.</p><p>Do you see any hints of trouble?  Now, back then, the foundation, as  President Ronald Reagan was saying at the time, was sound.  This president  says the same, it's sound.  No one could argue then, no one can argue now  both presidents were right.</p><p>But markets follow their own kind of weird verbs.  Do you see anything that  worries you right now?</p><p>ARMO:  The only concern is the same concern really, Neil, that we have had  all year.  It's China, China.  Nobody knows what's going to happen with  China.</p><p>They just came out today.  This is part of the reason why for the sell-off  too.  The administration announced they're going to review, the CFIUS  Committee is going to review some of these investments, these foreign  investments in the U.S.</p><p>And that's a bugaboo for China.  And that's problematic.  China is playing  hardball.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And, by the way, China is officially in a bear market.</p><p>ARMO:  Oh, they have been.  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Its market -- it's well into a bear market.  We are not.  We are  not.</p><p>In fact, we're up on the year.  But the fact of the matter is, that's a  worry.  The notion is that we could be the stand-alone market, the standout  market, which we are, and the stand-alone standout economy, which we are,  but can we keep going it alone, if there are all these other headwinds from  China, from Italy now barely able to make a budget and concern that it's  going to go into a freefall?</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>ARMO:  I think we could.  Of course we could.  We're the United States of  America.  And that's the great thing about being here, living here,  participating in the market.</p><p>Trump is in charge.  We will see what he's going to do.  I will say one  thing.  Today's drop-off might stave off the Fed from raising interest  rates one more time before the end of the year, when it looked like they  might raise them again, which was in question if they would do one more  before the end of the year.</p><p>This drop-off might stave them off a little bit, which is a good thing for  consumers and a good thing for market participants.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you very, very much, Melissa.  </p><p>The Fed, to which she was alluding, the Federal Reserve, of course,  expected to raise rates and four more times before the end of this year and  three more times next year.  </p><p>All of that in response, I must stress, to good economic news.  The economy  is doing quite well, in fact, generationally, record-level well, but it is  that strong economy that is perplexing traders.  They realize that interest  rates were going to go up, and that was baked into the cake, so to speak.</p><p>They didn't realize they would go backing up to the degree they already  have, a 10-year note slipping back, a two-year note slipping back.  And a  lot of people wondering, we don't know where this goes.  There's an old saw  on Wall Street here.  In uncertainty, you sell.  You ask questions later.</p><p>They're selling.  They will deal with the other stuff later.  </p><p>Right now, the immediate concern in the Panhandle is this storm and  Hurricane Michael and how the region dodged a bullet.  But it's a very  pricey bullet and a very nasty one.  </p><p>It could have been even nastier -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>We are getting word that as many as 320,000 Floridians decided to ride out  the storm and never evacuated.  We do not know their status.  </p><p>We also know that millions of Americans were caught in their sell-off.  We  do know theirs.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, let's get the latest on Michael.</p><p>Could have been and probably should have been worse.  It is still pretty  bad, though.</p><p>Rick Leventhal in Panama City with the latest -- Rick.</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.</p><p>And, Neil, I apologize for the camera issues.  It's gotten fogged up, and  it's been getting rained on.  We have been getting rained on for hours now.</p><p>The rain has slowed down pretty considerably.  But the wind is still  blowing.  And we just got word that there's a rescue mission under way here  in Panama City.  Panama City Fire and Rescue heading out to try and save  someone from some sort of situation.</p><p>They had told us that they had encouraged 120,000 people to evacuate before  the storm, and that didn't happen.  About half the people actually  evacuated.  The other half stayed.  And apparently at least one of those  people needs to be rescued.</p><p>Neil, this is the kind of stuff, if you can see it, that's flying around  out here, or was.  It's a piece from the -- from the building next to us,  some kind of siding.  And it's sort of a tile material.  And it's pretty  heavy.</p><p>And I want to show you one other thing.  The damages aren't extensive where  we are, but you can see one of the utility poles that basically snapped in  half.  There is a transformer at the end of that pole.  The power is out  here and probably will be for sometime.</p><p>Damage is not as extensive as some had feared they might be, but a lot of  them are still being assessed, Neil, because it's just now starting to  clear up.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Rick, be safe, and your crew as well, Rick Leventhal.</p><p>Let's go to WeatherBELL's Joe Bastardi on what he makes of all of this --  Joseph.</p><p>JOE BASTARDI, WEATHERBELL CHIEF FORECASTER:  Well, Port St. Joe is on the  other side of the eye.  The eye went ashore southeast of Rick.</p><p>And I think that that area is probably going to be devastated.  It'll be  interesting to see.  And hopefully people got out of that area.  This came  ashore stronger than any hurricane that we have recorded in this area.  </p><p>The barometric pressure was down at 920 millibars, which was very close to  what Andrew hit Miami at.  And I'm sure, when the damage is totaled up in  those areas, again, the western side of the eyewall was in Panama City.  </p><p>So the wind blew out toward the Gulf of Mexico, didn't come in from the  Gulf of Mexico, and that's going to be a big deal.  But this is now into  Southwest Georgia.  And it's just raising havoc as it goes inland, because  it's so very powerful.  </p><p>You're not going to see storms that get into Georgia with 100-mile-an-hour  winds, 120.  It's coming -- it's coming down quite a bit.  The future path  of the storm takes it near Macon tonight around 2:00 in the morning, where  winds should gust between 80 and 90, perhaps 100 miles an hour, Augusta  tomorrow morning 60, 80 miles an hour.</p><p>Go just southeast to Columbia, tomorrow, during the afternoon, tomorrow  night, be midway between Fayetteville and Raleigh, and then reach the North  Carolina coast near Elizabeth city, it looks, like probably 2:00 a.m. in  the morning Friday.</p><p>When that happens, what will happen, Neil, is the frictional effects of the  storm will diminish, so that the storm will wind back up again.  You folks  in Virginia Beach -- I have seen his before -- don't be surprised if you  have a three- to six-hour period where the winds out of the north gusting  to 60, 70 miles an hour, even though the storm will be reported to have  less winds.</p><p>And they sort of play possum over land, but as soon as they get near the  water, they rev back up again.  As far as rainfall, widespread three to six  locally, 12-inch amounts from where the storm is now all the way into  Southeast Virginia.  And that includes the area that was devastated by  Florence.</p><p>That may aggravate the situation in there.  There's going to be more power  outages with this because it's going to continue to have strong winds  inland.  And to the east of that track I gave you, there's going to be  tornadic activity breaking out tonight into tomorrow.</p><p>And that's going to be another problem with this storm.  So even though  it's weakened and it's inland, we will see what the damage was right where  this went ashore.  I fear that it's going to look like this storm bulldozed  some areas when they get in there.</p><p>But we will see.  The pressure where this came ashore at 920 millibars is  the strongest by far ever in that area between Mobile and Tampa.  So this  is strongest storm, barometric pressure, likely wind, that we have recorded  since back in 1851.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>I do also know, as you mentioned at the outset, the flooding possibilities,  nine rivers that were already surging and had been surged a good deal, I  think at least seven of them from Florence, resurge all over again.  So  that just compounds the problem for the Carolinas, Georgia, et cetera.   Right?  </p><p>BASTARDI:  Yes, it does, Neil.  </p><p>And I will tell you this, folks.  I believe the last time we were on, Neil,  back in September, I said you will probably see me showing up again in  October.  You won't see me again with hurricanes when this one's done.  You  will see me for winter storms.  But I believe this is going to be the last  impact storm on the United States this season.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Let's hope you're right on that.  </p><p>Joe Bastardi, thank you very, very much.  </p><p>Just a couple of things.  The president, of course, has already said  earlier in the day that FEMA and anyone else, also meeting with his  historical secretary, would provide any emergency help that was necessary.   He is going to be heading off to a campaign event tonight in Erie,  Pennsylvania, on Friday to Lebanon, Ohio, on Saturday to Richmond,  Kentucky.  </p><p>We are told that he wants to at least get a firsthand view of what's  happening the Panhandle probably sometime Sunday, could be Monday.  Wants  to be as the least disruptive way possible.  Easier said than done when any  president of the United States visits a region, but he wants to come when  it is a good time to come.  And he hopes to make that Sunday or Monday.  </p><p>We will have more after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, the latest on Michael now, no longer a Category 4  storm.  But it is going to pack serious winds now as it makes its way north  into Georgia and the Carolinas.  </p><p>FOX News Channel's chief meteorologist, Rick Reichmuth, on its path now --  Rick.  </p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST:  Neil, yes, obviously the  stronger the storm when it comes offshore, the worse damage on the shore.  </p><p>But that also means that it's going to take a longer time for those strong  winds to go down.  So you see it made landfall.  We have had recorded wind  gusts at 130 miles an hour.  Keep in mind we don't have wind meters in  every place, and a lot of them get blown offline.  </p><p>But they had verified at 155 mile-an-hour winds when that was coming right  onshore there.  Now, you take a look at it, starting to weaken a little bit  there.  But we're all up in across the northeastern area of Alabama moving  in towards Georgia right now.  </p><p>Still with that well-defined center, and that means those hurricane-force  winds now are extending very, very far off towards the north.  Radar  picture shows the same thing behind it, still some more bands.  Likely  right along the coast, we're going to calm down a little bit, especially  across the western side of this.</p><p>On the eastern side, we will still see more moisture that is going to  continue to be pulled up onshore.  How does this rank compared to other  storms?  Take a look at this.  When you think of all of the big storms we  have had in our country over the years, wind wise, this is right below  Andrew.</p><p>And as far as that central pressure goes, how low the pressure in the  center of the storm went, take a look at that.  That is the third strongest  storm, the third lowest pressure we have ever recorded of a landfalling  storm here across the U.S. </p><p>This is where we are now, still technically 140-mile-an-hour winds  sustained.  That will come down, I'm sure, a little bit as we get to that  5:00 advisory that is going to come out shortly.</p><p>And it will remain a hurricane for a little bit longer, go in towards  tomorrow morning.  We still have a tropical storm getting, moving in  towards South Carolina.  And we're going to very gusty conditions there  across the Carolinas.  Keep in mind a lot of areas likely have some  weakened trees from all of the flooding that was there.</p><p>Some of that water is gone.  But all of those root systems now are going to  be very, very weakened here across the Carolinas.  So won't take much to  cause more wind to go over and knock some more of those trees out.  </p><p>Likely strengthening a little bit here once it moves ashore, but we got a  couple more days before we're fully done with this storm -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, Rick, I didn't realize it got very close to Category 5,  didn't it?</p><p>REICHMUTH:  One mile an hour away from the Cat 5, yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Incredible.  Wow.  </p><p>Rick, thank you very, very much.  Rick Reichmuth.  </p><p>REICHMUTH:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, this is also Oil Rig Alley, they call it, along the Gulf,  when you have so many oil rigs and other facilities set up -- 40 percent of  our overall oil output is in this region.  So you would think that,  immediately, prices would be spiking when it shut down.  Just the opposite.  </p><p>That was a little weird.  But a guy who specializes in things that don't  make sense, because he quickly make sense of them, is our energy trader and  energy watcher, Phil Flynn. </p><p>Phil Flynn, why did we go down on oil prices?  </p><p>PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP:  Well, a couple of reasons.  </p><p>The main reason is where the storm actually hit.  The track of the storm  miss some of the major installations.  So all that production that you were  talking about that was shut in can be brought online very quickly once the  storm passes.  </p><p>And now the storm has gone away from worrying about how much oil supplies  and natural gas supplies we might lose to how much demand we might lose  because of the track of the storm.  If you take a look at that scary map,  when we're going right through Florida into all of those different states,  Virginia, Georgia, you name it, a lot of those people, of course, are going  to be without power.</p><p>They're not going to be able to drive.  And so the demand that would  usually occur for oil in a normal everyday situation is not going to  happen.  So now the concern has gone away from, oh, my gosh, we won't have  oil to supply the market to, we won't have demand to use it.  </p><p>Now, the one thing I want to caution everybody is, is that this is called  demand destruction when we have a storm like this.  It's usually a very  short-term phenomena, because I'm afraid that the damage that we're  potentially going to see, Neil, from this storm is going to require a lot  of energy in the future to rebuild.  </p><p>So right now, the market is not as concerned about the loss of supply, but  a couple of weeks down the road, when we start to rebuild, that oil demand  is going to be back, and in a big way.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, thank you, my friend, very much, Phil Flynn.</p><p>A couple of developments.  There apparently is a tornado watch in effect  for locations that in Florida directly affected by this along the  Panhandle.  That is not unusual after something like this, flash flood  warnings given not only from the Panhandle area, but right straight through  the Carolinas.  </p><p>As you can see, that is the trajectory.  For those of you listening on  radio, this trajectory takes it through Georgia, South Carolina, North  Carolina, before it goes back out to sea sometime this weekend.  But it's  going to be around for a while.  </p><p>Also, Hurricane Michael has forced at least eight cruises to reroute and up  to 1,000 flights to and from airports in the area to be outright canceled  or reschedule.  Airlines affected have dropped all booking fees as a result  of changing your plans, as if you had a choice.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, after the storm, there's the power that goes invariably  during and after the storm.  And it usually increases in the hours  afterwards.  </p><p>We're already seeing that now, better than 200,000, we are told, without  power now in the region.  That could add as the night ensues here.</p><p>Catherine Stempien and is with Duke Energy.  In fact, she's the Florida  president.</p><p>Very good to have you with us, Catherine.  And thank you for taking the  time.</p><p>What is the situation there power wise for folks?  </p><p>CATHERINE STEMPIEN, DUKE ENERGY:  So, we're already seeing significant  outages all across our system up on the Panhandle.  We're predicting about  100,000 to 200,000 households and businesses that are customers of Duke  Energy Florida will be losing their power as a result of this system.  </p><p>Additionally, we expect maybe an additional 100,000 customers from the  local electric cooperative, the municipalities who receive their  electricity from Duke Energy will also be affected, because we're  anticipating significant damage to our transmission system in the area.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, I know it's hard to compare Florence with this and different  storms.  Florence hung around a while, less so with Michael.  </p><p>How does that factor into when you get things back up and running?  </p><p>STEMPIEN:  Well, we're currently anticipating it could take days or maybe  even more than a week for us to really get customers back online.  </p><p>This system, with the winds of over 150,000 -- 150 miles per hour, in  addition to significant storm surge and flooding, is really impacting,  submerging our systems, damaging equipment that are powering entire  communities,.  We really see that, in some areas, we're going to have to  rebuild our entire electrical system.  And that's going to take some time.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, and that's that's a long-haul effort, as you said here.</p><p>I'm wondering, too, given the fact that fewer than half those in the  affected areas -- or affected areas decided to evacuate, as the governor  had urged, does that complicate things for you?  </p><p>STEMPIEN:  Well, it certainly does.  </p><p>And I would like to thank Governor Scott for his leadership here in  declaring a state of emergency for storm-impacted areas.  And we're working  very closely with the governor and his team to prioritize critical  facilities and also working closely with the Department of Transportation  to coordinate on road clearing.  </p><p>But our ability to access some of those areas is really going to depend --  it's really going to hamper our ability to recover and to rebuild the  system.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Having said all of that, Catherine, you can't minimize the work  that's ahead of you and your folks and the region.</p><p>Are you breathing somewhat of a sigh of relief?  It was envisioned to be,  certainly when it came in, much worse.</p><p>STEMPIEN:  Well, we're still seeing impacts of the storm, so I don't think  we are through this storm yet.  And, of course, it's going to continue to  impact areas of Georgia and up through the Carolinas, many of which are the  same communities that were just impacted by Hurricane Florence.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>STEMPIEN:  So I don't feel like we're out of the woods yet.</p><p>I would like to make sure to encourage people who were in Florida to be  safe, to call 911 if they need any critical assistance, and to be  communicating with their local EOCs, which they can find information about  on FloridaDisaster.org for more information.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Catherine Stempien, thank you.  Wise words, all.  We appreciate  it.  </p><p>I'm sure your customers appreciate it.  </p><p>All right, so about 100,000 to 200,000 without power now.  Whether that  escalates, some say it will -- you don't know who's right on this.  I know,  with Florence, it exponentially went on, as the night and the storm went  on.  That was a slow mover.  This is more serious, but faster.  So you take  your bets.</p><p>All right, Hurricane Michael, though, is still barrelling through Florida.   And now Georgia is next in its sights.  And as a number of folks were  warning at FEMA and beyond, do not take this lightly in Georgia, and do not  take it lightly if you're well inland.  It is still packing a punch --  after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it looks like Michael has Georgia on its mine.  </p><p>Steve Harrigan is in Macon, Georgia, with the latest.  </p><p>Hey, Steve.</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, the storm may have made  landfall in Florida about 200 miles away from here, but it's really just  beginning in the state of Florida.</p><p>It intends to enter the state of Florida as a Category 2 hurricane, then  weakened to a Category 1 hurricane, before weakening further to a tropical  storm.  </p><p>That means, across the state of Georgia, we're going to see major  structural damage, damage to roofs, buildings, houses, power lines down,  electricity out, and perhaps part of the agriculture here devastated,  especially that peanut crop.</p><p>So they were really taken by surprise a little bit here, because this storm  got more powerful very quickly over the Gulf of Mexico.  We heard the FEMA  administrator say this morning Georgia has to wake up to the danger ahead.   It is waking up quickly to that danger.  While there are no mandatory  evacuations planned, a state of emergency has been declared, and the  National Guard has been mobilized -- Neil, back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Steve Harrigan, thank you very, very much. </p><p>Of course, Steve will be watching that as it moves its way into Georgia.  </p><p>So this thing isn't over.  And neither is this sell-off at the corner of  Wall and Broad.  It was a big one today.</p><p>Let's look at where this stacks up against other big hits in the Dow.  This  is just in point terms, that today's would rank third, but between what  happened back in the early days of this year, when we were going through  the same sort of conundrum here and were worried about interest rates.  </p><p>I should add that, in percentage terms, about -- the 3 percent falloff  today wouldn't even crack the top 10, dare I say the top 15 of hits to the  Dow.  </p><p>But it is real, it is nasty and it is built on the idea interest rates are  going up because the economy keeps moving up.  That would normally be a  good thing, but not so right now, when people worry about, how high is  high?</p><p>Tough to get a home loan.  Tougher to get a mortgage loan.  Tough to get  any sort of loan.  And, in that environment, they sell.  </p><p>We will see tonight with futures and foreign trading.  </p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

The Nasdaq had climbed above 12,000 points for the first time in history Wednesday. So what's happening? Well for one, the the other two major stock indexes -- the Dow (INDU) and the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) -- for months, so investors might just be taking making some adjustments after Wednesday's record highs. The Nasdaq remains up nearly 30% in 2020, far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow fell 2.6% mid-morning, while the S&amp;P was down 3.4%. But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs. \"The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,\" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. Stocks in cyclical sectors are also expected to perform better as the economy is recovering. The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42991556911</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RW-YMG1-F07F-8145-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"294\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

Wasn't the bailout supposed to fix this? You know, that bailout, the one that includes money for rum- makers, wooden arrows, and Alaskan fishermen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, as the economy tanks, guess what these guys are talking about? <person><nameText>Palin and McCain </nameText></person>hammer Obama over something that happened when he was eight years old.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>GOV.

We're not going to let him hoodwink you.</p><p>SANCHEZ: And Obama points out McCain's Keating Five missteps from almost 20 years ago, this while Americans scream with one voice, it's the economy, stupid.</p><p>What you're telling us, your comments, unfiltered on Twitter, Facebook, and more, like nowhere else. Your newscast starts now.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Hello again, everybody. I'm Rick Sanchez.</p><p>Boy, before we do anything else, let's take you right to the latest numbers that are coming across on the Dow. Claude (ph), go ahead and take those numbers, if we can. Let's see where this thing stands. This has suddenly become the most important theme of this newscast, no doubt.</p><p>It's been really a slow and steady decrease throughout the course of the day, like drip, drip, drip. And there's another part of this. It's what you have been saying.</p><p>In fact, let's go to our Twitter board if we can as we start this hour, as we often do. This is men and women all over the country by the thousands who have been sending me their notes and comments and responses.</p><p>Look at this one. She just sent me this. This is littleworks. She said: \"Rick, I am waiting for my monthly statement and scared to death.\"</p><p>That's because of what's going on with the market. Ali Velshi is going to be joining us in just a little bit to talk exclusively about why the market is doing this. Obviously, we're going to keep that picture up.</p><p>Remember, earlier in the day, there was talk that if this thing hit the 10 percent point, they would actually have to slow it down or even stop the market entirely. We're way beyond that now. But what is it? It's two minutes after the hour. For the next 58 minutes, we are going to be taking you through this and bringing in all of the folks who are going to give us the proper information.</p><p>While we have been watching this, by the way, here's what's interesting about this. There are some CEOs, one specifically with Lehman Brothers, who has been grilled on Capitol Hill, grilled about the way he has dealt with some of the bonuses, knowing that this was coming down the line.</p><p>The question of greed comes up, as do many others. All right. This is Dick Fuld. He's the CEO of Lehman Brothers. I want you to watch now as he's grilled by Henry Waxman, Congressman Henry Waxman, on this committee today.</p><p>Take it, Claude.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. HENRY WAXMAN (D-CA), GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: That, since 2000, you have taken home more than $480 million. That's almost half a billion. And that's difficult to comprehend for a lot of people. Your company is now bankrupt. Our economy is in a state of crisis. But you get to keep $480 million.</p><p>I have a very basic question for you. Is this fair?</p><p>RICHARD FULD, CEO, LEHMAN BROTHERS: We had a compensation committee that spent a tremendous amount of time making sure that the interests of the executives and the employees were aligned with shareholders. My employees owned close to 30 percent of our company.</p><p>And that was because we wanted them to think, act, and behave like shareholders. When the company did well, we did well. When the company did not do well, sir, we did not do well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: But that's actually the point that's in question. That's CEO Dick Fuld today being grilled. We have got more video like that that we're going to showing you over the next hour, down now at 675, as I watch it, by the way.</p><p>And the question is this. Was Dick Fuld and others like him, were they steering money to their executives, while at the same time knowing that they were going to have liquidity problems, and actually asking for a rescue from you and from me, from the American taxpayer? That's an important issue that we're going to pick up in just a little bit.</p><p>Before we do anything else, let's bring in Ali Velshi now. Ali Velshi has been watching the market today.</p><p>Ali, you there?</p><p>ALI VELSHI, CNN SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I'm here, right here, Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Let's start with the market itself. Before we even get into Fuld and some of those CEO issues...</p><p>VELSHI: Yes.</p><p>SANCHEZ: ... here's what I think people at home would want to ask you, if they could talk to you directly. Why is it that we pass this bailout and now the market doesn't seem to be showing any signs of life despite...</p><p>VELSHI: Yes, good question. And I want to remind people, the bailout -- as I said, why we needed a bailout is because the credit markets are frozen. And the credit markets affect you by getting you loans, getting loans to people who need to buy your house, let's say, and getting loans to your company, so that they can make operating expenses, like payroll.</p><p>You will notice, in two-and-a-half weeks, I never mentioned it's going to be about stock market. The bailout is not meant to bail out the stock market. The stock market is not an independent entity of the economy. It is a measure of whether people are buying or selling companies that they're going to make money off of.</p><p>So, the stock market was never meant to be the root cause. Now, you would expect after that bailout bill was passed, we would have see a more positive reaction. But buried in all that stuff on Friday was a report that we had lost 159,000 jobs, bringing this year's total to three-quarters-of-a-million.</p><p>Now, Rick, that's the single most important thing. To your viewer who had sent you that Twitter message to say, I'm scared, I'm waiting for my statement, I mean, I'm scared to death. The scared to death doesn't help. The panic doesn't help. Don't bother being about that.</p><p>When markets are tripping, people over themselves to get in and they always get in too late. So, don't panic about this. Now, there are two good things happening here. One is that we're only off -- only off -- 642 points. We were off 800 points. We watched the market very closely in the last hour, particularly the last 15 minutes, to see how things are going.</p><p>The fact that the market is going up and down, on the downside, but it's moving, it's not consistent, tells me that this isn't people bailing out of the market. There is a buyer for everybody trying to sell a stock today. A very serious market is when you're trying to sell stocks and there are no buyers at any point. Now, at this point, the market would have to be down 2,200 points to stop trading for the rest of the day. And that is not likely to happen. So, again, this is not as disorderly as it looks. And for those of you with 401(k)s, your loss will be very reflective of the loss on the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow, about 25 to 30 percent. So, if you didn't make any bad decisions, hold on and don't panic -- Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, and I guess all we can do is just watch this thing. And that's what we're going to do, by the way.</p><p>VELSHI: Right.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Throughout the course of this newscast, we're going to have that number up and you're going to able to see it for yourself. If it stays pretty much where we are right now, it's a disappointment. If it goes much lower, then we're going to be bringing Ali back and having another discussion about this, because there is a lot of anxiety out there.</p><p>VELSHI: Right.</p><p>SANCHEZ: A second issue, that's the one about the greed, the avarice, what's been going on with folks like the CEO of Lehman Brothers.</p><p>Ali, hold on. Hopefully, we will be able to get you back. And we're going to have further discussions on that, because that's really been the buzz point today on Capitol Hill. Thanks, as usual, Ali.</p><p>So, here's a question. With this conversation that we have just had with Ali, why is it that <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>and Sarah Palin this weekend are talking about something different, not specifically addressing the economy? I will give you an example.</p><p><person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>is talking about Bill Ayers and his links to <person><nameText>Barack Obama. </nameText></person><person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>is talking about <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>and his links to the Keating Five that happened, what, 1989? It seems like a bit of a disconnect.</p><p>In fact, folks have been reaching me all day long and asking me that very question.</p><p>Let's go to our Twitter board, if we possibly can. This is what people are saying. Here it is.</p><p>This is Davenport, D. She says: \"Both are a joke. My kids' college fund is flaming. Can these guys talk about that?\"</p><p>\"I was hoping for Obama/McCain since early last year. This isn't what I had in mind. These two great men have sunk to the occasion.\"</p><p>This one, I read to you just a little bit, awhile, about somebody being scared to death.</p><p>\"Finally, the bailout package was to do was the wrong thing to do,\" somebody upset about that. \"Most people don't care about Keating and Ayers. It's the economy\" -- left out the world stupid. \"It's starting to hit home on Main Street.\"</p><p>Let's do this. Let's bring in somebody from the McCain side on this now.</p><p>Nancy Pfotenhauer is spokesperson for <person><nameText>John McCain.</nameText></person></p><p>You hear what people are asking. Why are you talking about something that someone did when <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>was 8 years old, when the economy seems to be in a meltdown?</p><p>NANCY PFOTENHAUER, MCCAIN CAMPAIGN POLICY ADVISER: Well, you know, Rick, that's not the only thing we're talking about.</p><p>In fact, if you actually listen to the entire speech or follow what Senator McCain and Governor Palin are saying, certainly, what you will find out is that most of their emphasis, probably a good 75, 80 percent of it, is on the economy, and rightfully so.</p><p>And in fact, Senator McCain showed how concerned he was by even suspending his campaign, pulling some $12 million in advertising off the air, when we were only 40 days out from the election, in order to come back to Washington and do the people's business.</p><p>SANCHEZ: But here's the...</p><p>PFOTENHAUER: So, it's a very, very high priority, Rick. And I think that that needs to come through.</p><p>SANCHEZ: But here's Sarah Palin Saturday, Sunday, and now this morning as well. In fact, she's in Clearwater, Florida. What's one of the first things she brings up in her speech? This. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PALIN: It turns out one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers.</p><p>(BOOING)</p><p>PALIN: And, according to \"The New York Times,\" he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that -- quote -- \"wants to campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: And what's interesting now is, Nancy, that <person><nameText>Barack Obama's</nameText></person> firing back with a 13-minute documentary that people can find on the Internet now talking about the Keating Five and <person><nameText>John McCain, </nameText></person>again, the opposite of what most Americans are thinking about right now.</p><p>PFOTENHAUER: Well...</p><p>SANCHEZ: Do we have a clip of that?</p><p>Let me show you a clip of that, Nancy. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fraud is the creation of trust and then its betrayal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your services were bought by Charles Keating.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Keating Five involved all the things that have brought the modern crisis. Senator McCain has not learned the lessons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: All right, I think we have seen enough of that.</p><p>If you add this up, this stuff is 60 years old.</p><p>PFOTENHAUER: Well, and, Rick, the whole point is, we have mentioned it in a couple of speeches. Obviously, it struck a chord, because <person><nameText>Barack Obama's</nameText></person> campaign came out and did a preemptive negative campaign ad, which is pretty -- pretty interesting from a tactical standpoint.</p><p>But, you know, the bottom line is, we emphasize this because it's part and parcel, his distancing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Nancy, I'm just going to interrupt you for a minute.</p><p>PFOTENHAUER: OK.</p><p>SANCHEZ: When you do that, Nancy, don't you invite -- look, I will tell you something right now. Keating and <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>have never come out of my lips during this newscast in the four or five years that I have been anchoring the news at CNN. Never. I just didn't think and many people didn't think it was an issue, because it tends to be old news.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SANCHEZ: But, when you talk about Obama's record, suddenly it becomes a documentary and now news stations are covering it. Did you invite it?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PFOTENHAUER: Rick, it's very important to draw attention to this for a couple of reasons, the most important being that <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>says whatever he needs to say in front of whatever group he happens to be in, which is why the <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>running in the general election is very, very different from the <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>running in the primary election.</p><p>And so when Mr. Ayers was useful to <person><nameText>Barack Obama, </nameText></person>then <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>hung out with him. As soon as he became a senator, he didn't. But you have got him, I mean, in meetings with him in '95, theoretically launching his political career, or at least having an early -- one of his very early meetings there.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes. Yes. No, I got it.</p><p>PFOTENHAUER: In '97, endorsing his book, serving on boards with him through 2002, exchanging voice mails and e-mails with him through 2005.</p><p>SANCHEZ: I understand.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PFOTENHAUER: So, I just think that, Rick, when you take the fact that he jettisons things over the side whenever it's inconvenient, whether it's his pledge about public financing, whether it's his past position on tax increases, the FISA bill, everything.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Pardon me for interrupting.</p><p>I think I get that. I think most people do. I think the question the American people have is, with all this going on right now, why are both men -- not just <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>-- why is <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>talking about Bill Ayers and why is <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>talking about, you know, the Keating Five, when a lot of people would consider that to me more of a relicy, sort of historic point?</p><p>But we will continue talking about it. And you defended your position well.</p><p>Nancy, thanks so much for -- Pfotenhauer -- thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>And we will continue the discussion.</p><p>By the way, on the other side, we have <person><nameText>Barack Obama's</nameText></person> reaction to that ad that we had just shown and the words by Sarah Palin. We are going to have that for you. He was on the Tom Joyner show today. He was interviewed about this by Roland Martin, in fact. And we're going to have that tape for you.</p><p>Also, who is Bill Ayers and what is the Keating Five? We're in a position now where we have to give you the proper information, so you can know. We have some independent analysts who are going to bring you that information.</p><p>Also, <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>is going to be speaking any moment now. Obviously, one of the pivotal questions here, is he going to be talking about the economy or is he going to be talking about some of the things that we were just discussing there? Meanwhile, importantly, the market, 573, good sign. It was up around 700 just about 20 minutes ago.</p><p>Stay with us. A lot going on. We will keep that up and we will be right back. I'm Rick Sanchez.</p><p>SANCHEZ: You are talking to us, and we're talking to you.</p><p>Let's start -- let's go ahead, Robert, and start over here. Go with the Twitter one right there. All right, stop on the Twitter one. \"Keating Five is directly related to the economy, Ayers not so much.\" That's one person's opinion.</p><p>Now let's go over to Facebook, on the Facebook board. Look at that one. Victoria is watching our show. And she sent me this message moments ago. She says: \"Look, financial crisis really hit home for me today when my student loans had not disbursed to my university. Can we please get over Bill Ayers and the rest and get back to the economy?\"</p><p>She doesn't want Americans, she doesn't want politicians talking about these things. But they are. And <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>was talking about it this morning when he was asked about the comments made by Sarah Palin about his relationship with Bill Ayers.</p><p>I want you to listen now to what Obama said. This is to Roland Martin this morning on the Tom Joyner show. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: I think it's unfortunate, first of all, just the facts. Mr. Ayers is somebody who lives in Chicago. He's a professor at the University of Chicago -- University of Illinois. He teaches education. And he engaged in these despicable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old. I served on a board with him. And so now they're trying to use this as guilt by association.</p><p>And, as you said, they have explicitly stated that what they want to do is to change the topic, because they don't want to talk about the economy and the failed policies of the last eight years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Here's what we want to do for you now. We are going to try and drill down on this, because if the question is out there, it's only fair for us here at CNN to try and give you as many facts as we can.</p><p>So, we want an independent observer, somebody who has been following the politics of Chicago for a long time.</p><p>She is joining us now. She is the D.C. bureau chief of \"The Chicago Sun-Times.\" Lynn Sweet is with us. Lynn, let's try and drill down on this, if we possibly can. Maybe you can just cut to the chase for us. Is there any culpability on <person><nameText>Barack Obama's</nameText></person> part in his links or association with Bill Ayers?</p><p>LYNN SWEET, \"THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES\": Well, nothing in his present political career rises to the level of the McCain campaign criticism.</p><p>Yes, they knew each other. No, Ayers was not pivotal in launching the Obama campaign.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Who is Ayers? Tell us who Bill Ayers is, for those who have no idea who we're even talking about.</p><p>SWEET: OK. I will give you the present. Then I will do the past real quickly.</p><p>Real quickly, right now, as Obama said, he is well-regarded in Chicago civic circles, including with Mayor Daley, as somebody who specializes in urban education. That's the present.</p><p>The past, he was a member of the Weather Underground, as his wife, Bernadine Dohrn, and that was a group that did advocate violence during the -- during the Vietnam War era. They were on the lam for a number of years. They surfaced, never charged with any -- they were charged, never convicted, went on to get advanced degrees, he in his doctorate in Columbia in education, and his wife went on to get a law degree. They became accepted members of Chicago civil society.</p><p>Now, you may argue with that as to how that happened, but that's their story, not Obama's story. By the time he came on the scene, their past was known to a lot of people. I certainly knew about it as a reporter working in Chicago. They were pretty well-known for their past, as well as their present.</p><p>SANCHEZ: What about Obama's relationship with him? Why does Obama even know him? How did he meet him and was it happenstance or did he seek him out?</p><p>SWEET: Well, they know him, because, if something else, Hyde Park is a very insular neighborhood, and they did live near each other, but, more important, they were on boards together.</p><p>But Bill Ayers had nothing to do with Obama being on these boards. They happened to be on boards together. And Obama got on these boards through his own connections and through other circles. But when you deal with this community within Chicago, Hyde Park, it's not unusual for people to know each other, just as in the neighborhood where you might live or I live, you run into people all the time who have overlapping circles.</p><p>So, a few things in this story, Rick, can be true at one time, but for the hard-core political implication that there is some current association that Obama has, no.</p><p>SANCHEZ: You don't see it? (CROSSTALK)</p><p>SWEET: Did he launch him on his political career? No. Was he an early supporter? Yes.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Lynn Sweet is with \"The Chicago Sun-Times.\" And she's good enough to join us to parse this out somewhat.</p><p>All right, <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>is going to be speaking in just a little bit. I want to let you know that we're going to take that in full. As soon as <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>starts speaking, we will take you there, let you hear what he has to say about the economy, about these other current stories that we're following.</p><p>We will be right back. I'm Rick Sanchez.</p><p>SANCHEZ: And we welcome you back. I'm Rick Sanchez here in the world headquarters of CNN.</p><p>Obviously, we're watching the market for you. There it is at 546. It's had a lot of people very frightened today. It's interesting, though. There is an incredible disconnect on this day that we have been trying to show you between what the candidates are saying and what the people of the United States are thinking about it, including the voters.</p><p>Let's go ahead to the Facebook board, if we possibly can. Look at this comment that just came over on Facebook: \"How can we care about the misleading rhetoric about terrorist links and about the Keating Five when the real terrorists are the CEO fat cats who are terrorizing the economy?\"</p><p>Obviously, that's what a lot of people are thinking about today, even though the politicians seem to be talking about something else.</p><p>By the way, just to be fair, program note. I just did an interview moments ago on trying to drill down on who Bill Ayers is, for the benefit of the viewers who maybe didn't know who he was and don't understand what this whole controversy is about. Tomorrow, we're going to have an independent analyst on this show during this hour who will drill down for us the Keating Five and whatever <person><nameText>John McCain's</nameText></person> association with that was or wasn't.</p><p>So, expect that here tomorrow. To be fair, we want to make sure what we do for one, we also do for the other. Speaking of <person><nameText>John McCain, </nameText></person>I do believe we have a picture of him now. Let's go ahead and put that up, see if he's started.</p><p>He's starting to speak. Let's dip into <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>and see what subject he's addressing on this day. Let's take it live. Go.</p><p>(JOINED IN PROGRESS)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>JOHN MCCAIN </nameText></person>(R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: ... the experience and the knowledge and the judgment to do that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: Friends, Washington is still on the wrong track, and we need change. The status quo is not on the ballot.</p><p>We're going to see change in Washington. The question is, in what direction do we go?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: Will our country be a better place under the leadership of the next president, a more secure, prosperous, and just society? Will you be better off in the jobs you hold now and the opportunities that you hope for?</p><p>Will your sons and daughters grow up in the kind of country you wish for them, rising in the world and finding in their own lives the best of America? And which candidate's experience in government and in life makes him a more reliable leader for our country and commander in chief for our troops? Which one?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: Who's ready to lead? In time of trouble and danger for our country, who will put our country first?</p><p>AUDIENCE: McCain!</p><p>MCCAIN: My friends, I set out on my own campaign for president many months ago. I promised at the beginning to be straight with the American people, knowing that even those who don't agree with me on everything would expect at least that much.</p><p>I didn't just show up out of nowhere.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: After all, America knows me. You know my strengths and my faults. You know my story and my convictions. And though familiarity in politics can be both helpful to a candidate or not so helpful, it does at least fill out the picture and answer the essential question. You need to know who you're putting in the White House and where the candidate came from and what he or she believes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: And you need to know before it's time to choose. In 21 months, my friends during hundreds of speeches, town halls and debates, I have kept my promise to level with you about my plans to reform Washington and get this country moving again.</p><p>As a senator, I have seen the corrupt ways of Washington and wasteful spending and other abuses of power. And, as president, I'm going to end them, whatever it takes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: I will propose and sign into law reforms to bring tax relief to the middle class and help to businesses, so they can create jobs. I will get the rising cost of food and gas under control.</p><p>I will help families keep their home and help students that are struggling to pay for college.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: I will make health care more accessible and affordable. I will impose a spending freeze on all but the most vital functions of government.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: I will review every agency of the federal government, improve those that need to be improved, and eliminate those that aren't working for the American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: I will confront the $10 trillion debt, the $10 trillion debt on you that the federal government has run up. And I will balance the federal budget by the end of my term in office.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: This is the agenda that I have set before my fellow citizens. And the same standards of clarity and candor must now be applied to my opponent.</p><p>Even at this late hour in the campaign -- there are there are essential things we don't know about Senator Obama or the record that he brings to this campaign.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: Now, we've all heard what he's said, but it's less clear what he's done or what he will do.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: What Senator Obama says today and what he's done in the past are often two different things. He's often changed his positions in this campaign. And the best way to determine where he would really take this country is to examine where he's tried to take it in the past.</p><p>My opponent has invited serious questioning by announcing a few weeks ago that he would \"take off the gloves.\" Since then, whenever I've questioned his policies or his record, he's called me a liar. Rather...</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>MCCAIN: Rather than answer his critics, Senator Obama will try to distract you from noticing that he never answers the serious and legitimate questions he's been asked.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: So let me reply in the plainest terms that I know. I don't need lessons about telling the truth to the American people. And were I ever to need any improvement in that regard, I probably wouldn't seek advice from a Chicago politician.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: You know, my opponent's touchiness every time he's questioned about his record should make us only more concerned. For a guy who's already authored two memoirs, he's not exactly an open book.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: You know, it's as if somehow the usual rules don't apply. And where other candidates have to explain themselves in their records, Senator Obama seems to think he's above all that. Whatever the question, whatever the issue, there's always a back story with Senator Obama.</p><p>All people want to know is what has this man ever actually accomplished in government.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: What does he plan for America?</p><p>In short, who is the -- who is the real <person><nameText>Barack Obama?</nameText></person></p><p>But my friends, you ask such questions and all you get in response is another angry barrage of insults.</p><p>Our current economic crisis is a good case in point.</p><p>What was his actual record in the years before the great economic crisis of our lifetimes?</p><p>This crisis started in our housing market in the form of subprime loans that were pushed on people who couldn't afford them. Bad mortgages -- bad mortgages were being backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And it was only a matter of time before a contagion of unsustainable debt began to spread.</p><p>This corruption was encouraged by Democrats in Congress and abetted by Senator Obama. Interestingly -- interestingly, Senator Obama has accused me of opposing regulation to avert this crisis. I guess he believes that if a lie is big enough and repeated often enough, it will be believed.</p><p>But the truth is I was the one who called at the time for tighter restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And it could have helped prevent this crisis from happening in the first place. Senator Obama was silent on the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And his Democratic allies in Congress opposed every effort to reign them in -- every single one. That's a matter of record.</p><p>As recently -- they did. As recently as September of last year, he said that subprime loans have been \"a good idea.\" Well, Senator Obama, that good idea has now plunged this country into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. You know, to hear him talk now -- to hear him talk now, you'd think he'd always opposed the dangerous practices at these institutions. But there is absolutely nothing in his record to suggest he did. Nothing. Zero. Zippo. Nada.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: And I want to tell you, he was surely familiar with the people who were creating the problem. Yes, he knew them. The executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have advised him and he has taken their money for his campaign. He has received more money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than any other senator in history, with the exception of the committee...</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>MCCAIN: ...with the exception of the chairman of the committee overseeing him. My friends, while he was taking that money, did he ever talk to the executives of Fannie and Freddie about these reckless loans?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SUPPORTERS: No!</p><p>MCCAIN: Did he ever discuss with them the stronger oversight I proposed?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SUPPORTERS: No!</p><p>MCCAIN: You know, if Senator Obama is such a champion of financial regulation, why didn't he support these regulations that could have prevented this crisis in the first place?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: You know -- you know, he won't -- he won't tell you, but you deserve answer.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: Even after he refused to lift a finger to prevent this crisis, when the crisis hit, he was missing in action. He didn't even start making calls to round up votes until after the rescue bill failed in the House and the markets crashed. We continue to see the price of delay today, as the markets continue to fall. Today, the Dow has fallen below 10,000. And yet members of his own party said they felt no pressure to vote for the bill.</p><p>Why didn't Senator Obama work to pass this bill from the start? Why did he let it fail and drag out this crisis for a full week before doing a thing to help pass it?</p><p>I suspended my campaign and I went back to Washington, my friends, because I was thinking about the American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN: Again, on taxes, we see a difference between what Senator Obama says today, what he said yesterday and what he's actually done. Over the course of this campaign, he's had many different plans to raise your taxes. During the Democratic primary, he promised to double taxes on every American with a dividend or an investment. He promised to raise payroll taxes. He promised higher taxes on electricity.</p><p>Now Senator Obama claims he will give 95 percent of Americans tax relief. He actually promised the same thing when he was running for Senate in Illinois, but once elected, he never introduced legislation to do so. Instead, he voted for the Democratic budget resolution that promised to raise taxes on people making just $42,000 a year.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>MCCAIN: At the time, he even said his vote was intended to get \"our nation's priorities back on track.\"</p><p>To raise your taxes?</p><p>You know, if he's such a defender of the middle class, why did he vote to raise their taxes?</p><p>Whatever happened to the tax relief he promised...</p><p>SANCHEZ: There you have <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>addressing some of the arguments going back and forth between him and his opponent, <person><nameText>Barack Obama. </nameText></person>Speaking of <person><nameText>Barack Obama, </nameText></person>let me point your attention now to something we received just moments ago here.</p><p>Clyde, come on back to me, if you could. I guess we're on now.</p><p>Robert, over my shoulder, go over here to my laptop.</p><p>I'm looking at this while I'm looking at some of the other stuff coming in.</p><p>This is a statement that came in just moments ago from the <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>campaign. I'll read it to you. You can look at it here with me: \"On a day when the markets are plunging and the credit crisis is putting millions of jobs at risk, the one truly angry candidate in this race kept up his strategy of turning the page on the economy by unleashing another frustrated tirade against <person><nameText>Barack Obama.</nameText></person>\"</p><p>I'll leave it there. We'll give it a look as we go -- continue.</p><p>Let's go to a break and we'll come back. But there you see <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>speaking live.</p><p><person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>sending us that note so that we would share with you, as to what he believes <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>is doing as he watches him, as well, on TV.</p><p>It's all in the media and it's all interactive and we bring it to you as it happens. Your comments, as well, when we come back.</p><p>A lot more to go.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>And the market, of course, 537 as we stand. We'll count it down all the way to 4:00.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Welcome back.</p><p>There you see the numbers, at least as far as the Dow is concerned. We're going to be checking some of the small caps, as well. We're going to check the NASDAQ in just a little bit.</p><p>Welcome back. I'm Rick Sanchez. We're here at the World Headquarters of CNN in Atlanta. And as the numbers come in, we share them. By the way, there are some different numbers I want to share with you now. This is interesting.</p><p>There was a recent poll taken here at CNN. It's somewhat frightening to look at these, but Americans were asked, \"Is another depression likely, based on what we're going on what's going on right now?\"</p><p>Here's how people responded. Yes, 59 percent. Almost 60 percent of the American people think we could possibly be headed for a depression. Forty-two percent said no.</p><p>But big numbers when you look at those. And we wanted to share those with you. They came in just about an hour ago. We want to make sure we turn them around and put them on the air. Obviously, we're not inferring anything other than the fact that that's what Americans are thinking right now, given the dismal state of the economy.</p><p>I want to show you something. Now, this is a very important part of our newscast today. We began by showing you the market, telling you what's going on with the candidates and what they're talking about, which is disconnected from what most Americans want to know about.</p><p>And then this. In Congress, they are putting the heat on the CEOs, in particular, Dick Fuld of Lehman Brothers. He was really getting grilled today. And before he showed up to get grilled, he was also asked some questions by our own Abbie Boudreau.</p><p>Watch this videotape of Abbi walking with him as he was coming into the hearing. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABBIE BOUDREAU, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Do you think it's fair that you made so much money when your company is actually (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>FULD: I'm sorry. I'm on my way to a...</p><p>BOUDREAU: Some of your critics have said that you have had a chance to save your company and you haven't.</p><p>Is it greed? I mean do you have anything to say to the people that are -- that are watching this right now, that are wondering, you know, why this happened?</p><p>You have nothing to say?</p><p>FULD: Are you going to be in the testimony?</p><p>BOUDREAU: Absolutely.</p><p>FULD: Good.</p><p>BOUDREAU: Why? What should be expect to see in the testimony?</p><p>FULD: Please wait until then.</p><p>BOUDREAU: Nothing else to say beyond this?</p><p>FULD: Thank you, no. Good luck to you.</p><p>BOUDREAU: How do you actually rationalize the fact that you have all of these (INAUDIBLE). We've seen pictures of your houses.</p><p>How do you rationalize that when the rest of the country is in turmoil?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ: Wow! She walked him right into the actual hearing room. Obviously, Abbi Boudreau is not going to be getting any holiday cards or greetings or gifts from the CEO of Lehman Brothers.</p><p>And Abbi Boudreau joins us now live -- Abbi, that was tough.</p><p>BOUDREAU: Yes. I mean, we had the chance right there to ask him some of the questions that a lot of the people at home really do want to know. And you couldn't really hear too well that first question that I asked him, but what I really wanted to know whether or not he thought it was fair that he was making all of this money when his company is in bankruptcy. And that's the question I think a lot of people really do want to know -- Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Well, is it the issues is whether -- I mean, look, there's nothing wrong with making money. It's a capitalistic system. But if you know that you've got some questions about liquidity with your company and you're giving bonuses to some of your officials but you know that there's a serious problem -- in fact, at the same time you're asking the government for a rescue or a bailout, therein lies the disconnect, right?</p><p>BOUDREAU: Well, I mean that's precisely the point. It's not whether or not he deserves to make a certain amount of money. It's whether or not he thinks it's fair personally -- whether he thinks it's fair that he is making a certain amount of money. And we're not talking about chump change here. We're talking about, you know, from 2000 to 2007, about $500 million, according to the Oversight Committee. One year alone, in 2006, $106 million of total income.</p><p>That's a lot of money when your own company is in bankruptcy. So that's the -- those are the kinds of questions the Oversight Committee wanted to find out. Those are the kinds of questions that we wanted to find out.</p><p>And I know you played this earlier on the show, Rick, where Congressman Waxman was asking that same question -- you know, that one basic question -- do you think it's fair?</p><p>He just would not answer the question.</p><p>SANCHEZ: I'll tell you what, though, good job. Tough reporting. A good day's work today going after him in that situation and trying to get him to answer a lot of the questions that, frankly, a lot of the American people want asked. So we'll stay on it.</p><p>Thanks again.</p><p>BOUDREAU: All right. Thank you.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Abbie Boudreau joining us there, as she follows the CEO into the hearing today.</p><p>When we come back, looking that market. We're going to take you to two parts of this story now. We're going to break it down. We've talked a lot about the political side.</p><p>Well, what about the Nasdaq, the small caps and the big stocks, as well?</p><p>We'll have it for you when we come back, as we wait and count down to the market close, which is now about 13 minutes away.</p><p>A lot more on that and pork -- yes, pork, oink, oink.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Hey, welcome back.</p><p>I'm Rick Sanchez here at the World Headquarters of CNN in Atlanta.</p><p>We're watching what really has become the big story today, the manifestation of this bailout on Wall Street.</p><p>And as you can see, the number there now is at 369. For those of you getting to us late, that's actually good, because at some points today -- in fact, just as we started this newscast, it was around 700.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz is going to be joining us on that side of the story.</p><p>Also, Poppy Harlow is going to be joining us to take a look what things are doing in the small caps on the NASDAQ, as well -- Susan, let's see what you.</p><p>Put this in perspective for us.</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're off our lows. I mean we've pared half of our losses today.</p><p>Having said that, the sentiment is still pretty lousy.</p><p>And, you know, to go back to something that you were talking about just a few minutes ago, Rick, about Dick Fuld, the ex-CEO of Lehman Brothers and talking about his executive compensation -- which, by just about anybody's standards, is huge. I think from 2000, the way it was calculated was something like nearly half a billion.</p><p>Now that is an issue. And there's no question that's a lot of money, especially for a firm that failed.</p><p>But having said that, that's not what brought Lehman Brothers down. Lehman Brothers is the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. $613 billion is the number attached to it.</p><p>And what brought Lehman down was its exposure to these incredibly risky, incredibly complex securities that were tied to subprime mortgages.</p><p>And what you're seeing happen is it play out globally. It's not just a U.S. problem. We've seen a worldwide sell-off today -- Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ: All right, let's just -- let's check the Nasdaq now.</p><p>Our Poppy Harlow has got that part of the story for us -- Poppy, what you got?</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM: Hey there, Rick.</p><p>You know, the Nasdaq is down just about 5 percent right now. It's the worst hit of the S&amp;P and the Dow. We've seen that all day. But, hey, we're off the lows of the session in a big way. The Nasdaq was down 8 percent less than an hour ago.</p><p>What you've got here are some big names and, as you said, some small caps, some big tech companies like Oracle, Microsoft, Cisco that depend on business from big financial institutions to do well.</p><p>So when a Lehman Brothers gets wiped off the map, that hurts them in a big way.</p><p>You've also got E*TRADE here, which relies on individual traders like you and me.</p><p>So a tough day here so far at the NASDAQ -- Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ: All right, thanks.</p><p>I'm glad we've got you watching it for us.</p><p>Earlier in the show, you asked that I -- you saw that I asked the question of Nancy Pfotenhauer -- she's a spokesperson for <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>-- why in the world is <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>talking about Bill Ayers with what's going on in the market?</p><p>Well, when we come back, I'm going to have an Obama spokesperson and I'm going to ask them the same question -- why in the world are you talking about the Keating Five with what's going on with the market?</p><p>See the answer, when we come back live.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Joining us now is Bill Burton. He's a spokesperson for the Obama campaign. By the way, there you see the number standing at 323 now.</p><p>You know, everybody who's been e-mailing me and Twittering me today and talking to me on Facebook and MySpace are saying, why in the world are these guys talking about Bill Ayers and why in the world is Obama talking about the Keating Five, when there's a much more pressing issue that Obama should be talking about?</p><p>Your guy -- he should be out there telling people in detail, viewers say, how he's going to be able to get them out of this mess.</p><p>BILL BURTON, OBAMA CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN: Well, Rick, I hope you saw <person><nameText>Barack Obama's</nameText></person> comments earlier today. He is talking about the economy.</p><p><person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>said -- his campaign said this morning that if they talk about the economic crisis, they lose. And so they're trying to change the subject with all sorts of different unrelated issues.</p><p>Now, what Senator Obama has been talking about today is what do we do need to do to get help to the middle class right now, how do we get a second stimulus in place so that we can get relief into the economy and help build it up.</p><p>You know, with the stock market down -- I guess it's at 360, 370 points now?</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes.</p><p>BURTON: You know, I listened to that pretty angry tirade from <person><nameText>John McCain. </nameText></person>But what was missing from there, I think, are any solutions for the middle class...</p><p>SANCHEZ: Well, what about you guys, though?</p><p>BURTON: ...any prescription for moving the country forward.</p><p>SANCHEZ: What, what, what -- forget <person><nameText>John McCain.</nameText></person></p><p>BURTON: OK.</p><p>SANCHEZ: I already gave them enough grief earlier in the show. I'm going to do the same thing to you now.</p><p>BURTON: OK.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Why are you putting out a 13-minute documentary on the life and times of the Keating Five and <person><nameText>John McCain?</nameText></person></p><p>Aren't you playing into that game? Aren't you doing the same thing?</p><p>BURTON: Well, if folks want to see the documentary, they can go to KeatingEconomics.com and see exactly how the problems that <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>was entangled with back in the S&amp;L crisis are related to the problems that we've got right now in the banking industry.</p><p><person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>has already been involved in two banking crises. The American people can't afford another one if he were to be in the White House.</p><p>Now, the problem is that even after the Keating scandal, <person><nameText>John McCain </nameText></person>still said that, fundamentally, he's a deregulator. And he worked to help deregulate the financial markets, deregulate financial institutions to point where, you know, it helped to...</p><p>SANCHEZ: So you're saying...</p><p>BURTON: ...it helped to be symptomatic of the problems we're seeing today.</p><p>SANCHEZ: You're saying the Keating Five is relevant, Bill Ayers not relevant?</p><p>That's the argument that you're making, right? And you've got to finish this in 10 seconds.</p><p>BURTON: Right. I think that if you consider the fact that <person><nameText>John McCain, </nameText></person>who was admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee...</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes.</p><p>BURTON: He was involved in a banking scandal. There's a banking crisis right now. They're directly relevant to the -- to the state that we find ourselves in right now.</p><p>SANCHEZ: All right. Listen, we'll let the viewers decide for themselves.</p><p>BURTON: OK.</p><p>SANCHEZ: We wanted to have both sides on. Hey, thanks so much, Bill Burton, for being here with us.</p><p>BURTON: Thank you, Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ: We appreciate it.</p><p>BURTON: I appreciate it.</p><p>SANCHEZ: All right, listen, what -- how's the market going to end up?</p><p>Three eleven right now. That's actually, surprisingly enough, good compared to what it was. Everything's about comparative. We'll be right back.</p><p>SANCHEZ: All right. And we welcome you back.</p><p>There's the numbers as they stand right now -- 319.</p><p>Let's go back to Susan Lisovicz, if we can, just as we start to wrap things up, before we hear the ding, ding, ding.</p><p>A welcome ding, ding, ding, I believe, right?</p><p>LISOVICZ: Well, you know, but it's starting to look a lot better. You know, Rick, it had all the makings of another historic Monday. One week after the Dow's biggest point sell-off, it looked like we could go there. In fact, the blue chips were down 800 points at one -- at one moment in the session.</p><p>And, you know, what was even more stunning is that there were fewer than a hundred stocks trading up -- 3,100 to the downside.</p><p>But now, a 300 point deficit -- not such a big deal, it seems, Rick. It's all too common here.</p><p>SANCHEZ: There were some people today talking about 1,000. No more. 316 not bad, all things considered.</p><p>Thanks so much, Susan.</p><p>LISOVICZ: You're welcome.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Let's go to Wolf Blitzer.</p><p>He's standing by now in \"THE SITUATION ROOM.\"</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks very much Rick.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Wasn't the bailout supposed to fix this?  You know, that bailout, the one that includes money for rum- makers, wooden arrows, and Alaskan fishermen.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, as the economy tanks, guess what these guys are talking about?  Palin and McCain hammer Obama over something that happened when he was eight years old.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GOV. SARAH PALIN (R-AK), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm afraid this is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to work with a former domestic terrorist.  </p><p>SEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're -- we're not going to let John McCain distract us.  We're not going to let him hoodwink you.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  And Obama points out McCain's Keating Five missteps from almost 20 years ago, this while Americans scream with one voice, it's the economy, stupid.  </p><p>What you're telling us, your comments, unfiltered on Twitter, Facebook, and more, like nowhere else.  Your newscast starts now.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Hello again, everybody.  I'm Rick Sanchez.  </p><p>Boy, before we do anything else, let's take you right to the latest numbers that are coming across on the Dow.  Claude (ph), go ahead and take those numbers, if we can.  Let's see where this thing stands.  This has suddenly become the most important theme of this newscast, no doubt.  </p><p>It's been really a slow and steady decrease throughout the course of the day, like drip, drip, drip.  And there's another part of this. It's what you have been saying.</p><p>In fact, let's go to our Twitter board if we can as we start this hour, as we often do.  This is men and women all over the country by the thousands who have been sending me their notes and comments and responses.  </p><p>Look at this one.  She just sent me this.  This is littleworks. She said: \"Rick, I am waiting for my monthly statement and scared to death.\"  </p><p>That's because of what's going on with the market.  Ali Velshi is going to be joining us in just a little bit to talk exclusively about why the market is doing this.  Obviously, we're going to keep that picture up.</p><p>Remember, earlier in the day, there was talk that if this thing hit the 10 percent point, they would actually have to slow it down or even stop the market entirely.  We're way beyond that now.  But what is it?  It's two minutes after the hour.  For the next 58 minutes, we are going to be taking you through this and bringing in all of the folks who are going to give us the proper information.  </p><p>While we have been watching this, by the way, here's what's interesting about this.  There are some CEOs, one specifically with Lehman Brothers, who has been grilled on Capitol Hill, grilled about the way he has dealt with some of the bonuses, knowing that this was coming down the line.  </p><p>The question of greed comes up, as do many others.  All right. This is Dick Fuld.  He's the CEO of Lehman Brothers.  I want you to watch now as he's grilled by Henry Waxman, Congressman Henry Waxman, on this committee today.  </p><p>Take it, Claude.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. HENRY WAXMAN (D-CA), GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: That, since 2000, you have taken home more than $480 million.  That's almost half a billion.  And that's difficult to comprehend for a lot of people.  Your company is now bankrupt.  Our economy is in a state of crisis.  But you get to keep $480 million.  </p><p>I have a very basic question for you.  Is this fair?  </p><p>RICHARD FULD, CEO, LEHMAN BROTHERS:  We had a compensation committee that spent a tremendous amount of time making sure that the interests of the executives and the employees were aligned with shareholders.  My employees owned close to 30 percent of our company.  </p><p>And that was because we wanted them to think, act, and behave like shareholders.  When the company did well, we did well.  When the company did not do well, sir, we did not do well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  But that's actually the point that's in question. That's CEO Dick Fuld today being grilled.  We have got more video like that that we're going to showing you over the next hour, down now at 675, as I watch it, by the way.</p><p>And the question is this.  Was Dick Fuld and others like him, were they steering money to their executives, while at the same time knowing that they were going to have liquidity problems, and actually asking for a rescue from you and from me, from the American taxpayer? That's an important issue that we're going to pick up in just a little bit.  </p><p>Before we do anything else, let's bring in Ali Velshi now.  Ali Velshi has been watching the market today.  </p><p>Ali, you there?  </p><p>ALI VELSHI, CNN SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I'm here, right here, Rick.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Let's start with the market itself.  Before we even get into Fuld and some of those CEO issues...</p><p>VELSHI:  Yes.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  ... here's what I think people at home would want to ask you, if they could talk to you directly.  Why is it that we pass this bailout and now the market doesn't seem to be showing any signs of life despite...  </p><p>VELSHI:  Yes, good question.  And I want to remind people, the bailout -- as I said, why we needed a bailout is because the credit markets are frozen.  And the credit markets affect you by getting you loans, getting loans to people who need to buy your house, let's say, and getting loans to your company, so that they can make operating expenses, like payroll.  </p><p>You will notice, in two-and-a-half weeks, I never mentioned it's going to be about stock market.  The bailout is not meant to bail out the stock market.  The stock market is not an independent entity of the economy.  It is a measure of whether people are buying or selling companies that they're going to make money off of.  </p><p>So, the stock market was never meant to be the root cause.  Now, you would expect after that bailout bill was passed, we would have see a more positive reaction.  But buried in all that stuff on Friday was a report that we had lost 159,000 jobs, bringing this year's total to three-quarters-of-a-million.  </p><p>Now, Rick, that's the single most important thing.  To your viewer who had sent you that Twitter message to say, I'm scared, I'm waiting for my statement, I mean, I'm scared to death.  The scared to death doesn't help.  The panic doesn't help.  Don't bother being about that.  </p><p>When markets are tripping, people over themselves to get in and they always get in too late.  So, don't panic about this.  Now, there are two good things happening here.  One is that we're only off -- only off -- 642 points.  We were off 800 points.  We watched the market very closely in the last hour, particularly the last 15 minutes, to see how things are going.  </p><p>The fact that the market is going up and down, on the downside, but it's moving, it's not consistent, tells me that this isn't people bailing out of the market.  There is a buyer for everybody trying to sell a stock today.  A very serious market is when you're trying to sell stocks and there are no buyers at any point.        Now, at this point, the market would have to be down 2,200 points to stop trading for the rest of the day.  And that is not likely to happen.  So, again, this is not as disorderly as it looks.  And for those of you with 401(k)s, your loss will be very reflective of the loss on the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow, about 25 to 30 percent.  So, if you didn't make any bad decisions, hold on and don't panic -- Rick. </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Yes, and I guess all we can do is just watch this thing.  And that's what we're going to do, by the way.</p><p>VELSHI:  Right.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Throughout the course of this newscast, we're going to have that number up and you're going to able to see it for yourself. If it stays pretty much where we are right now, it's a disappointment. If it goes much lower, then we're going to be bringing Ali back and having another discussion about this, because there is a lot of anxiety out there.  </p><p>VELSHI:  Right.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  A second issue, that's the one about the greed, the avarice, what's been going on with folks like the CEO of Lehman Brothers.  </p><p>Ali, hold on.  Hopefully, we will be able to get you back.  And we're going to have further discussions on that, because that's really been the buzz point today on Capitol Hill.  Thanks, as usual, Ali.  </p><p>So, here's a question.  With this conversation that we have just had with Ali, why is it that Barack Obama and John McCain and Sarah Palin this weekend are talking about something different, not specifically addressing the economy?  I will give you an example.  </p><p>John McCain is talking about Bill Ayers and his links to Barack Obama.  Barack Obama is talking about John McCain and his links to the Keating Five that happened, what, 1989?  It seems like a bit of a disconnect.  </p><p>In fact, folks have been reaching me all day long and asking me that very question.  </p><p>Let's go to our Twitter board, if we possibly can.  This is what people are saying.  Here it is.  </p><p>This is Davenport, D.  She says: \"Both are a joke.  My kids' college fund is flaming.  Can these guys talk about that?\"</p><p>\"I was hoping for Obama/McCain since early last year.  This isn't what I had in mind.  These two great men have sunk to the occasion.\"</p><p>This one, I read to you just a little bit, awhile, about somebody being scared to death.  </p><p>\"Finally, the bailout package was to do was the wrong thing to do,\" somebody upset about that.        \"Most people don't care about Keating and Ayers.  It's the economy\" -- left out the world stupid.  \"It's starting to hit home on Main Street.\"  </p><p>Let's do this.  Let's bring in somebody from the McCain side on this now.  </p><p>Nancy Pfotenhauer is spokesperson for John McCain.  </p><p>You hear what people are asking.  Why are you talking about something that someone did when Barack Obama was 8 years old, when the economy seems to be in a meltdown?  </p><p>NANCY PFOTENHAUER, MCCAIN CAMPAIGN POLICY ADVISER:  Well, you know, Rick, that's not the only thing we're talking about.  </p><p>In fact, if you actually listen to the entire speech or follow what Senator McCain and Governor Palin are saying, certainly, what you will find out is that most of their emphasis, probably a good 75, 80 percent of it, is on the economy, and rightfully so.  </p><p>And in fact, Senator McCain showed how concerned he was by even suspending his campaign, pulling some $12 million in advertising off the air, when we were only 40 days out from the election, in order to come back to Washington and do the people's business.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  But here's the...</p><p>PFOTENHAUER:  So, it's a very, very high priority, Rick.  And I think that that needs to come through.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  But here's Sarah Palin Saturday, Sunday, and now this morning as well.  In fact, she's in Clearwater, Florida.  What's one of the first things she brings up in her speech?  This.  Here it is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PALIN:  It turns out one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers.  </p><p>(BOOING)</p><p>PALIN:  And, according to \"The New York Times,\" he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that -- quote -- \"wants to campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  And what's interesting now is, Nancy, that Barack Obama's firing back with a 13-minute documentary that people can find on the Internet now talking about the Keating Five and John McCain, again, the opposite of what most Americans are thinking about right now.  </p><p>PFOTENHAUER:  Well... </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Do we have a clip of that?</p><p>Let me show you a clip of that, Nancy.  Here it is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Fraud is the creation of trust and then its betrayal.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your services were bought by Charles Keating.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The Keating Five involved all the things that have brought the modern crisis.  Senator McCain has not learned the lessons.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  All right, I think we have seen enough of that.  </p><p>If you add this up, this stuff is 60 years old.  </p><p>PFOTENHAUER:  Well, and, Rick, the whole point is, we have mentioned it in a couple of speeches.  Obviously, it struck a chord, because Barack Obama's campaign came out and did a preemptive negative campaign ad, which is pretty -- pretty interesting from a tactical standpoint.  </p><p>But, you know, the bottom line is, we emphasize this because it's part and parcel, his distancing... </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Nancy, I'm just going to interrupt you for a minute.</p><p>PFOTENHAUER:  OK.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  When you do that, Nancy, don't you invite -- look, I will tell you something right now.  Keating and John McCain have never come out of my lips during this newscast in the four or five years that I have been anchoring the news at CNN.  Never.  I just didn't think and many people didn't think it was an issue, because it tends to be old news.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  But, when you talk about Obama's record, suddenly it becomes a documentary and now news stations are covering it.  Did you invite it?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PFOTENHAUER:  Rick, it's very important to draw attention to this for a couple of reasons, the most important being that Barack Obama says whatever he needs to say in front of whatever group he happens to be in, which is why the Barack Obama running in the general election is very, very different from the Barack Obama running in the primary election.  </p><p>And so when Mr. Ayers was useful to Barack Obama, then Barack Obama hung out with him.  As soon as he became a senator, he didn't. But you have got him, I mean, in meetings with him in '95, theoretically launching his political career, or at least having an early -- one of his very early meetings there.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Yes.  Yes.  No, I got it.</p><p>PFOTENHAUER:  In '97, endorsing his book, serving on boards with him through 2002, exchanging voice mails and e-mails with him through 2005.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  I understand.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PFOTENHAUER:  So, I just think that, Rick, when you take the fact that he jettisons things over the side whenever it's inconvenient, whether it's his pledge about public financing, whether it's his past position on tax increases, the FISA bill, everything.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Pardon me for interrupting.</p><p>I think I get that.  I think most people do.  I think the question the American people have is, with all this going on right now, why are both men -- not just John McCain -- why is John McCain talking about Bill Ayers and why is Barack Obama talking about, you know, the Keating Five, when a lot of people would consider that to me more of a relicy, sort of historic point?</p><p>But we will continue talking about it.  And you defended your position well.  </p><p>Nancy, thanks so much for -- Pfotenhauer -- thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>And we will continue the discussion.  </p><p>By the way, on the other side, we have Barack Obama's reaction to that ad that we had just shown and the words by Sarah Palin.  We are going to have that for you.  He was on the Tom Joyner show today.  He was interviewed about this by Roland Martin, in fact.  And we're going to have that tape for you.  </p><p>Also, who is Bill Ayers and what is the Keating Five?  We're in a position now where we have to give you the proper information, so you can know.  We have some independent analysts who are going to bring you that information.  </p><p>Also, John McCain is going to be speaking any moment now. Obviously, one of the pivotal questions here, is he going to be talking about the economy or is he going to be talking about some of the things that we were just discussing there?        Meanwhile, importantly, the market, 573, good sign.  It was up around 700 just about 20 minutes ago.</p><p>Stay with us.  A lot going on.  We will keep that up and we will be right back.  I'm Rick Sanchez.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  You are talking to us, and we're talking to you.  </p><p>Let's start -- let's go ahead, Robert, and start over here.  Go with the Twitter one right there.  All right, stop on the Twitter one. \"Keating Five is directly related to the economy, Ayers not so much.\" That's one person's opinion.</p><p>Now let's go over to Facebook, on the Facebook board.  Look at that one.  Victoria is watching our show.  And she sent me this message moments ago.  She says: \"Look, financial crisis really hit home for me today when my student loans had not disbursed to my university.  Can we please get over Bill Ayers and the rest and get back to the economy?\"</p><p>She doesn't want Americans, she doesn't want politicians talking about these things.  But they are.  And Barack Obama was talking about it this morning when he was asked about the comments made by Sarah Palin about his relationship with Bill Ayers.  </p><p>I want you to listen now to what Obama said.  This is to Roland Martin this morning on the Tom Joyner show.  Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) </p><p>OBAMA:  I think it's unfortunate, first of all, just the facts. Mr. Ayers is somebody who lives in Chicago.  He's a professor at the University of Chicago -- University of Illinois.  He teaches education.  And he engaged in these despicable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old.  I served on a board with him.  And so now they're trying to use this as guilt by association.  </p><p>And, as you said, they have explicitly stated that what they want to do is to change the topic, because they don't want to talk about the economy and the failed policies of the last eight years.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Here's what we want to do for you now.  We are going to try and drill down on this, because if the question is out there, it's only fair for us here at CNN to try and give you as many facts as we can.  </p><p>So, we want an independent observer, somebody who has been following the politics of Chicago for a long time.  </p><p>She is joining us now.  She is the D.C. bureau chief of \"The Chicago Sun-Times.\"  Lynn Sweet is with us.        Lynn, let's try and drill down on this, if we possibly can. Maybe you can just cut to the chase for us.  Is there any culpability on Barack Obama's part in his links or association with Bill Ayers?  </p><p>LYNN SWEET, \"THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES\":  Well, nothing in his present political career rises to the level of the McCain campaign criticism.  </p><p>Yes, they knew each other.  No, Ayers was not pivotal in launching the Obama campaign.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Who is Ayers?  Tell us who Bill Ayers is, for those who have no idea who we're even talking about.  </p><p>SWEET:  OK.  I will give you the present.  Then I will do the past real quickly.  </p><p>Real quickly, right now, as Obama said, he is well-regarded in Chicago civic circles, including with Mayor Daley, as somebody who specializes in urban education.  That's the present.  </p><p>The past, he was a member of the Weather Underground, as his wife, Bernadine Dohrn, and that was a group that did advocate violence during the -- during the Vietnam War era.  They were on the lam for a number of years.  They surfaced, never charged with any -- they were charged, never convicted, went on to get advanced degrees, he in his doctorate in Columbia in education, and his wife went on to get a law degree.  They became accepted members of Chicago civil society.</p><p>Now, you may argue with that as to how that happened, but that's their story, not Obama's story.  By the time he came on the scene, their past was known to a lot of people.  I certainly knew about it as a reporter working in Chicago.  They were pretty well-known for their past, as well as their present.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  What about Obama's relationship with him?  Why does Obama even know him?  How did he meet him and was it happenstance or did he seek him out?  </p><p>SWEET:  Well, they know him, because, if something else, Hyde Park is a very insular neighborhood, and they did live near each other, but, more important, they were on boards together.  </p><p>But Bill Ayers had nothing to do with Obama being on these boards.  They happened to be on boards together.  And Obama got on these boards through his own connections and through other circles. But when you deal with this community within Chicago, Hyde Park, it's not unusual for people to know each other, just as in the neighborhood where you might live or I live, you run into people all the time who have overlapping circles.  </p><p>So, a few things in this story, Rick, can be true at one time, but for the hard-core political implication that there is some current association that Obama has, no.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  You don't see it?        (CROSSTALK) </p><p>SWEET:  Did he launch him on his political career?  No.  Was he an early supporter?  Yes.  </p><p>SANCHEZ:  Lynn Sweet is with \"The Chicago Sun-Times.\"  And she's good enough to join us to parse this out somewhat.</p><p>All right, John McCain is going to be speaking in just a little bit.  I want to let you know that we're going to take that in full. As soon as John McCain starts speaking, we will take you there, let you hear what he has to say about the economy, about these other current stories that we're following. </p><p>We will be right back.  I'm Rick Sanchez.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SANCHEZ:  And we welcome you back.  I'm Rick Sanchez here in the world headquarters of CNN.</p><p>Obviously, we're watching the market for you.  There it is at 546.  It's had a lot of people very frightened today.  It's interesting, though.  There is an incredible disconnect on this day that we have been trying to show you between what the candidates are saying and what the people of the United States are thinking about it, including the voters.</p><p>Let's go ahead to the Facebook board, if we possibly can.  Look at this comment that just came over on Facebook: \"How can we care about the misleading rhetoric about terrorist links and about the Keating Five when the real terrorists are the CEO fat cats who are terrorizing the economy?\"  </p><p>Obviously, that's what a lot of people are thinking about today, even though the politicians seem to be talking about something else.  </p><p>By the way, just to be fair, program note.  I just did an interview moments ago on trying to drill down on who Bill Ayers is, for the benefit of the viewers who maybe didn't know who he was and don't understand what this whole controversy is about.  Tomorrow, we're going to have an independent analyst on this show during this hour who will drill down for us the Keating Five and whatever John McCain's association with that was or wasn't.  </p><p>So, expect that here tomorrow.  To be fair, we want to make sure what we do for one, we also do for the other.  Speaking of John McCain, I do believe we have a picture of him now.  Let's go ahead and put that up, see if he's started.  </p><p>He's starting to speak.  Let's dip into John McCain and see what subject he's addressing on this day.  Let's take it live.  Go.  </p><p>(JOINED IN PROGRESS) </p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R-AZ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  ... the experience and the knowledge and the judgment to do that.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  Friends, Washington is still on the wrong track, and we need change.  The status quo is not on the ballot.  </p><p>We're going to see change in Washington.  The question is, in what direction do we go?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  Will our country be a better place under the leadership of the next president, a more secure, prosperous, and just society? Will you be better off in the jobs you hold now and the opportunities that you hope for?</p><p>Will your sons and daughters grow up in the kind of country you wish for them, rising in the world and finding in their own lives the best of America?  And which candidate's experience in government and in life makes him a more reliable leader for our country and commander in chief for our troops?  Which one?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  Who's ready to lead?  In time of trouble and danger for our country, who will put our country first?  </p><p>AUDIENCE:  McCain!  </p><p>MCCAIN:  My friends, I set out on my own campaign for president many months ago.  I promised at the beginning to be straight with the American people, knowing that even those who don't agree with me on everything would expect at least that much.  </p><p>I didn't just show up out of nowhere.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  After all, America knows me.  You know my strengths and my faults.  You know my story and my convictions.  And though familiarity in politics can be both helpful to a candidate or not so helpful, it does at least fill out the picture and answer the essential question.  You need to know who you're putting in the White House and where the candidate came from and what he or she believes.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  And you need to know before it's time to choose.  In 21 months, my friends during hundreds of speeches, town halls and debates, I have kept my promise to level with you about my plans to reform Washington and get this country moving again.  </p><p>As a senator, I have seen the corrupt ways of Washington and wasteful spending and other abuses of power.  And, as president, I'm going to end them, whatever it takes.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  I will propose and sign into law reforms to bring tax relief to the middle class and help to businesses, so they can create jobs.  I will get the rising cost of food and gas under control.  </p><p>I will help families keep their home and help students that are struggling to pay for college.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  I will make health care more accessible and affordable. I will impose a spending freeze on all but the most vital functions of government.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  I will review every agency of the federal government, improve those that need to be improved, and eliminate those that aren't working for the American people.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  I will confront the $10 trillion debt, the $10 trillion debt on you that the federal government has run up.  And I will balance the federal budget by the end of my term in office.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>MCCAIN:  This is the agenda that I have set before my fellow citizens.  And the same standards of clarity and candor must now be applied to my opponent.  </p><p>Even at this late hour in the campaign -- there are there are essential things we don't know about Senator Obama or the record that he brings to this campaign.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  Now, we've all heard what he's said, but it's less clear what he's done or what he will do.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  What Senator Obama says today and what he's done in the past are often two different things. He's often changed his positions in this campaign. And the best way to determine where he would really take this country is to examine where he's tried to take it in the past.</p><p>My opponent has invited serious questioning by announcing a few weeks ago that he would \"take off the gloves.\" Since then, whenever I've questioned his policies or his record, he's called me a liar. Rather...</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>MCCAIN:  Rather than answer his critics, Senator Obama will try to distract you from noticing that he never answers the serious and legitimate questions he's been asked.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  So let me reply in the plainest terms that I know. I don't need lessons about telling the truth to the American people. And were I ever to need any improvement in that regard, I probably wouldn't seek advice from a Chicago politician.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  You know, my opponent's touchiness every time he's questioned about his record should make us only more concerned. For a guy who's already authored two memoirs, he's not exactly an open book.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  You know, it's as if somehow the usual rules don't apply. And where other candidates have to explain themselves in their records, Senator Obama seems to think he's above all that. Whatever the question, whatever the issue, there's always a back story with Senator Obama.</p><p>All people want to know is what has this man ever actually accomplished in government.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  What does he plan for America?</p><p>In short, who is the -- who is the real Barack Obama?</p><p>But my friends, you ask such questions and all you get in response is another angry barrage of insults.</p><p>Our current economic crisis is a good case in point.</p><p>What was his actual record in the years before the great economic crisis of our lifetimes?</p><p>This crisis started in our housing market in the form of subprime loans that were pushed on people who couldn't afford them. Bad mortgages -- bad mortgages were being backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And it was only a matter of time before a contagion of unsustainable debt began to spread.</p><p>This corruption was encouraged by Democrats in Congress and abetted by Senator Obama. Interestingly -- interestingly, Senator Obama has accused me of opposing regulation to avert this crisis. I guess he believes that if a lie is big enough and repeated often enough, it will be believed.</p><p>But the truth is I was the one who called at the time for tighter restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And it could have helped prevent this crisis from happening in the first place. Senator Obama was silent on the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And his Democratic allies in Congress opposed every effort to reign them in -- every single one. That's a matter of record.</p><p>As recently -- they did. As recently as September of last year, he said that subprime loans have been \"a good idea.\" Well, Senator Obama, that good idea has now plunged this country into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. You know, to hear him talk now -- to hear him talk now, you'd think he'd always opposed the dangerous practices at these institutions. But there is absolutely nothing in his record to suggest he did. Nothing. Zero. Zippo. Nada.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  And I want to tell you, he was surely familiar with the people who were creating the problem. Yes, he knew them. The executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have advised him and he has taken their money for his campaign. He has received more money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than any other senator in history, with the exception of the committee...</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>MCCAIN:  ...with the exception of the chairman of the committee overseeing him. My friends, while he was taking that money, did he ever talk to the executives of Fannie and Freddie about these reckless loans?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SUPPORTERS:  No!</p><p>MCCAIN:  Did he ever discuss with them the stronger oversight I proposed?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SUPPORTERS:  No!</p><p>MCCAIN:  You know, if Senator Obama is such a champion of financial regulation, why didn't he support these regulations that could have prevented this crisis in the first place?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  You know -- you know, he won't -- he won't tell you, but you deserve answer.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  Even after he refused to lift a finger to prevent this crisis, when the crisis hit, he was missing in action. He didn't even start making calls to round up votes until after the rescue bill failed in the House and the markets crashed. We continue to see the price of delay today, as the markets continue to fall. Today, the Dow has fallen below 10,000. And yet members of his own party said they felt no pressure to vote for the bill.</p><p>Why didn't Senator Obama work to pass this bill from the start?      Why did he let it fail and drag out this crisis for a full week before doing a thing to help pass it?</p><p>I suspended my campaign and I went back to Washington, my friends, because I was thinking about the American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCCAIN:  Again, on taxes, we see a difference between what Senator Obama says today, what he said yesterday and what he's actually done. Over the course of this campaign, he's had many different plans to raise your taxes. During the Democratic primary, he promised to double taxes on every American with a dividend or an investment. He promised to raise payroll taxes. He promised higher taxes on electricity.</p><p>Now Senator Obama claims he will give 95 percent of Americans tax relief. He actually promised the same thing when he was running for Senate in Illinois, but once elected, he never introduced legislation to do so. Instead, he voted for the Democratic budget resolution that promised to raise taxes on people making just $42,000 a year.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>MCCAIN:  At the time, he even said his vote was intended to get \"our nation's priorities back on track.\"</p><p>To raise your taxes?</p><p>You know, if he's such a defender of the middle class, why did he vote to raise their taxes?</p><p>Whatever happened to the tax relief he promised...</p><p>SANCHEZ:  There you have John McCain addressing some of the arguments going back and forth between him and his opponent, Barack Obama. Speaking of Barack Obama, let me point your attention now to something we received just moments ago here.</p><p>Clyde, come on back to me, if you could. I guess we're on now.</p><p>Robert, over my shoulder, go over here to my laptop.</p><p>I'm looking at this while I'm looking at some of the other stuff coming in.</p><p>This is a statement that came in just moments ago from the Barack Obama campaign. I'll read it to you. You can look at it here with me: \"On a day when the markets are plunging and the credit crisis is putting millions of jobs at risk, the one truly angry candidate in this race kept up his strategy of turning the page on the economy by unleashing another frustrated tirade against Barack Obama.\"</p><p>I'll leave it there. We'll give it a look as we go -- continue.</p><p>Let's go to a break and we'll come back.      But there you see John McCain speaking live.</p><p>Barack Obama sending us that note so that we would share with you, as to what he believes John McCain is doing as he watches him, as well, on TV.</p><p>It's all in the media and it's all interactive and we bring it to you as it happens. Your comments, as well, when we come back.</p><p>A lot more to go.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>And the market, of course, 537 as we stand. We'll count it down all the way to 4:00.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Welcome back.</p><p>There you see the numbers, at least as far as the Dow is concerned. We're going to be checking some of the small caps, as well. We're going to check the NASDAQ in just a little bit.</p><p>Welcome back. I'm Rick Sanchez. We're here at the World Headquarters of CNN in Atlanta. And as the numbers come in, we share them. By the way, there are some different numbers I want to share with you now. This is interesting.</p><p>There was a recent poll taken here at CNN. It's somewhat frightening to look at these, but Americans were asked, \"Is another depression likely, based on what we're going on what's going on right now?\"</p><p>Here's how people responded. Yes, 59 percent. Almost 60 percent of the American people think we could possibly be headed for a depression. Forty-two percent said no.</p><p>But big numbers when you look at those. And we wanted to share those with you. They came in just about an hour ago. We want to make sure we turn them around and put them on the air. Obviously, we're not inferring anything other than the fact that that's what Americans are thinking right now, given the dismal state of the economy.</p><p>I want to show you something. Now, this is a very important part of our newscast today. We began by showing you the market, telling you what's going on with the candidates and what they're talking about, which is disconnected from what most Americans want to know about.</p><p>And then this. In Congress, they are putting the heat on the CEOs, in particular, Dick Fuld of Lehman Brothers. He was really getting grilled today. And before he showed up to get grilled, he was also asked some questions by our own Abbie Boudreau.</p><p>Watch this videotape of Abbi walking with him as he was coming into the hearing.      Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABBIE BOUDREAU, CNN INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT:  Do you think it's fair that you made so much money when your company is actually (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>FULD:  I'm sorry. I'm on my way to a...</p><p>BOUDREAU:  Some of your critics have said that you have had a chance to save your company and you haven't.</p><p>Is it greed? I mean do you have anything to say to the people that are -- that are watching this right now, that are wondering, you know, why this happened?</p><p>You have nothing to say?</p><p>FULD:  Are you going to be in the testimony?</p><p>BOUDREAU:  Absolutely.</p><p>FULD:  Good.</p><p>BOUDREAU:  Why? What should be expect to see in the testimony?</p><p>FULD:  Please wait until then.</p><p>BOUDREAU:  Nothing else to say beyond this?</p><p>FULD:  Thank you, no. Good luck to you.</p><p>BOUDREAU:  How do you actually rationalize the fact that you have all of these (INAUDIBLE). We've seen pictures of your houses.</p><p>How do you rationalize that when the rest of the country is in turmoil?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Wow! She walked him right into the actual hearing room. Obviously, Abbi Boudreau is not going to be getting any holiday cards or greetings or gifts from the CEO of Lehman Brothers.</p><p>And Abbi Boudreau joins us now live -- Abbi, that was tough.</p><p>BOUDREAU:  Yes. I mean, we had the chance right there to ask him some of the questions that a lot of the people at home really do want to know. And you couldn't really hear too well that first question that I asked him, but what I really wanted to know whether or not he thought it was fair that he was making all of this money when his company is in bankruptcy. And that's the question I think a lot of people really do want to know -- Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Well, is it the issues is whether -- I mean, look, there's nothing wrong with making money. It's a capitalistic system. But if you know that you've got some questions about liquidity with your company and you're giving bonuses to some of your officials but you know that there's a serious problem -- in fact, at the same time you're asking the government for a rescue or a bailout, therein lies the disconnect, right?</p><p>BOUDREAU:  Well, I mean that's precisely the point. It's not whether or not he deserves to make a certain amount of money. It's whether or not he thinks it's fair personally -- whether he thinks it's fair that he is making a certain amount of money. And we're not talking about chump change here. We're talking about, you know, from 2000 to 2007, about $500 million, according to the Oversight Committee. One year alone, in 2006, $106 million of total income.</p><p>That's a lot of money when your own company is in bankruptcy. So that's the -- those are the kinds of questions the Oversight Committee wanted to find out. Those are the kinds of questions that we wanted to find out.</p><p>And I know you played this earlier on the show, Rick, where Congressman Waxman was asking that same question -- you know, that one basic question -- do you think it's fair?</p><p>He just would not answer the question.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  I'll tell you what, though, good job. Tough reporting. A good day's work today going after him in that situation and trying to get him to answer a lot of the questions that, frankly, a lot of the American people want asked. So we'll stay on it.</p><p>Thanks again.</p><p>BOUDREAU:  All right. Thank you.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Abbie Boudreau joining us there, as she follows the CEO into the hearing today.</p><p>When we come back, looking that market. We're going to take you to two parts of this story now. We're going to break it down. We've talked a lot about the political side.</p><p>Well, what about the Nasdaq, the small caps and the big stocks, as well?</p><p>We'll have it for you when we come back, as we wait and count down to the market close, which is now about 13 minutes away.</p><p>A lot more on that and pork -- yes, pork, oink, oink.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Hey, welcome back.</p><p>I'm Rick Sanchez here at the World Headquarters of CNN in Atlanta.</p><p>We're watching what really has become the big story today, the manifestation of this bailout on Wall Street.</p><p>And as you can see, the number there now is at 369. For those of you getting to us late, that's actually good, because at some points today -- in fact, just as we started this newscast, it was around 700.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz is going to be joining us on that side of the story.</p><p>Also, Poppy Harlow is going to be joining us to take a look what things are doing in the small caps on the NASDAQ, as well -- Susan, let's see what you.</p><p>Put this in perspective for us.</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're off our lows. I mean we've pared half of our losses today.</p><p>Having said that, the sentiment is still pretty lousy.</p><p>And, you know, to go back to something that you were talking about just a few minutes ago, Rick, about Dick Fuld, the ex-CEO of Lehman Brothers and talking about his executive compensation -- which, by just about anybody's standards, is huge. I think from 2000, the way it was calculated was something like nearly half a billion.</p><p>Now that is an issue. And there's no question that's a lot of money, especially for a firm that failed.</p><p>But having said that, that's not what brought Lehman Brothers down. Lehman Brothers is the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. $613 billion is the number attached to it.</p><p>And what brought Lehman down was its exposure to these incredibly risky, incredibly complex securities that were tied to subprime mortgages.</p><p>And what you're seeing happen is it play out globally. It's not just a U.S. problem. We've seen a worldwide sell-off today -- Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  All right, let's just -- let's check the Nasdaq now.</p><p>Our Poppy Harlow has got that part of the story for us -- Poppy, what you got?</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM:  Hey there, Rick.</p><p>You know, the Nasdaq is down just about 5 percent right now. It's the worst hit of the S&amp;P and the Dow. We've seen that all day. But, hey, we're off the lows of the session in a big way. The Nasdaq was down 8 percent less than an hour ago.</p><p>What you've got here are some big names and, as you said, some small caps, some big tech companies like Oracle, Microsoft, Cisco that depend on business from big financial institutions to do well.</p><p>So when a Lehman Brothers gets wiped off the map, that hurts them in a big way.</p><p>You've also got E*TRADE here, which relies on individual traders like you and me.</p><p>So a tough day here so far at the NASDAQ -- Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  All right, thanks.</p><p>I'm glad we've got you watching it for us.</p><p>Earlier in the show, you asked that I -- you saw that I asked the question of Nancy Pfotenhauer -- she's a spokesperson for John McCain -- why in the world is John McCain talking about Bill Ayers with what's going on in the market?</p><p>Well, when we come back, I'm going to have an Obama spokesperson and I'm going to ask them the same question -- why in the world are you talking about the Keating Five with what's going on with the market?</p><p>See the answer, when we come back live.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Joining us now is Bill Burton. He's a spokesperson for the Obama campaign. By the way, there you see the number standing at 323 now.</p><p>You know, everybody who's been e-mailing me and Twittering me today and talking to me on Facebook and MySpace are saying, why in the world are these guys talking about Bill Ayers and why in the world is Obama talking about the Keating Five, when there's a much more pressing issue that Obama should be talking about?</p><p>Your guy -- he should be out there telling people in detail, viewers say, how he's going to be able to get them out of this mess.</p><p>BILL BURTON, OBAMA CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN:  Well, Rick, I hope you saw Barack Obama's comments earlier today. He is talking about the economy.</p><p>John McCain said -- his campaign said this morning that if they talk about the economic crisis, they lose. And so they're trying to change the subject with all sorts of different unrelated issues.</p><p>Now, what Senator Obama has been talking about today is what do we do need to do to get help to the middle class right now, how do we get a second stimulus in place so that we can get relief into the economy and help build it up.</p><p>You know, with the stock market down -- I guess it's at 360, 370 points now?</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Yes.</p><p>BURTON:  You know, I listened to that pretty angry tirade from John McCain. But what was missing from there, I think, are any solutions for the middle class...</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Well, what about you guys, though?</p><p>BURTON:  ...any prescription for moving the country forward.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  What, what, what -- forget John McCain.</p><p>BURTON:  OK.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  I already gave them enough grief earlier in the show. I'm going to do the same thing to you now.</p><p>BURTON:  OK.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Why are you putting out a 13-minute documentary on the life and times of the Keating Five and John McCain?</p><p>Aren't you playing into that game? Aren't you doing the same thing?</p><p>BURTON:  Well, if folks want to see the documentary, they can go to KeatingEconomics.com and see exactly how the problems that John McCain was entangled with back in the S&amp;L crisis are related to the problems that we've got right now in the banking industry.</p><p>John McCain has already been involved in two banking crises. The American people can't afford another one if he were to be in the White House.</p><p>Now, the problem is that even after the Keating scandal, John McCain still said that, fundamentally, he's a deregulator. And he worked to help deregulate the financial markets, deregulate financial institutions to point where, you know, it helped to...</p><p>SANCHEZ:  So you're saying...</p><p>BURTON:  ...it helped to be symptomatic of the problems we're seeing today.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  You're saying the Keating Five is relevant, Bill Ayers not relevant?</p><p>That's the argument that you're making, right? And you've got to finish this in 10 seconds.</p><p>BURTON:  Right. I think that if you consider the fact that John McCain, who was admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee...</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Yes.</p><p>BURTON:  He was involved in a banking scandal. There's a banking crisis right now. They're directly relevant to the -- to the state that we find ourselves in right now.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  All right. Listen, we'll let the viewers decide for themselves.</p><p>BURTON:  OK.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  We wanted to have both sides on. Hey, thanks so much, Bill Burton, for being here with us.</p><p>BURTON:  Thank you, Rick.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  We appreciate it.</p><p>BURTON:  I appreciate it.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  All right, listen, what -- how's the market going to end up?</p><p>Three eleven right now. That's actually, surprisingly enough, good compared to what it was. Everything's about comparative. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SANCHEZ:  All right. And we welcome you back.</p><p>There's the numbers as they stand right now -- 319.</p><p>Let's go back to Susan Lisovicz, if we can, just as we start to wrap things up, before we hear the ding, ding, ding.</p><p>A welcome ding, ding, ding, I believe, right?</p><p>LISOVICZ:  Well, you know, but it's starting to look a lot better. You know, Rick, it had all the makings of another historic Monday. One week after the Dow's biggest point sell-off, it looked like we could go there. In fact, the blue chips were down 800 points at one -- at one moment in the session.</p><p>And, you know, what was even more stunning is that there were fewer than a hundred stocks trading up -- 3,100 to the downside.</p><p>But now, a 300 point deficit -- not such a big deal, it seems, Rick. It's all too common here.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  There were some people today talking about 1,000. No more. 316 not bad, all things considered.</p><p>Thanks so much, Susan.</p><p>LISOVICZ:  You're welcome.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Let's go to Wolf Blitzer.</p><p>He's standing by now in \"THE SITUATION ROOM.\"</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR:  Thanks very much Rick.</p><p>[Byline: Ali Velshi, Rick Sanchez, Abbie Boudreau, Susan Lisovicz, Poppy Harlow, Wolf Blitzer] [Guest: Lynn Sweet, Nancy Pfotenhauer, Bill Burton] [High: The Dow Jones industrial average plunges.

All eyes on the financial markets. Take a look right now at the big board. Stocks again in freefall. At one point the Dow dropping more than 800 points, wiping out much of the gains for the year. Right now, it's down 723 points. It's been hovering between that and 600. Alison Kosik join us now from the stock exchange. What are you hearing there, Alison?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: There's just a lot of uncertainty and a lot of confusion when it comes to those meetings that happened on the sidelines at the G-20 between China's President Xi and President Trump. Those meetings, of course, happening in Argentina over the weekend.</p><p>What came out of there was, OK, there's going to be a deal to talk and progress toward a deal. But there's a realization today on the floor where I am at the New York Stock Exchange that there really is no deal and there's nothing concrete. Even if you look at the 90-day cease- fire that was announced in the tariff war, there was some confusion about when that date would actually start. Economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, saying it started January 1st. The White House saying, no, it starts earlier than that.</p><p>And then you have the President today in a series of tweets trying to explain what exactly is going on outside of those meetings when it comes to trade. And that really just accentuated the confusion. You have the president saying the 90-day cease-fire begins when Xi and Trump had that lovely dinner in Argentina. So, there's just a lot of confusion about what concrete is actually going to happen when it comes to really finding a resolution in the trade dispute happening between the U.S. and China -- Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: Right, Alison. The Dow now down 750 points. Stay with us as the closing bell gets closer.</p><p>Meantime, he is charged with murdering a young woman in Charlottesville during the aftermath of that white supremacist rally last year. And today we are hearing why he hyperventilated during interrogation. And how a picture of Hitler is suddenly involved in this trial. Plus, Joe Biden weighing in on who he thinks is most qualified to be president -- himself. We'll talk about what that means for 2020.</p><p>[15:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA: A remarkable moment today as people pay their respects to President George H.W. Bush in the Capitol Rotunda. Former Senator Bob Dole helped from his wheelchair to salute his old friend.</p><p>Right now, more than 200 members of Bush's extended family are filing through the Capitol Rotunda to say their goodbyes. And soon President Trump will head to Blair House for a meeting with the Bush family to offer private condolences. I want to check in with CNN's special correspondent, Jamie Gangel. I know Laura Bush also visited the White House today. What more can you tell us about that?</p><p>JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: And, Anna, it turns out, it wasn't just Laura Bush. Our colleague, Kate Bennett, is just telling us that actually 20 members of the Bush family were invited to the White House with the former first lady, Laura Bush. We have a picture of them all there. You can see standing in front of former President George H.W. Bush's portrait with the black cloth draped over it.</p><p>I think, Ana, what we're going to see today and tomorrow is both families trying to do, as a friend said to me, do what 41 would do. They're going to really try to be as gracious as possible, even with their history together. There is I think a mission by the Bush family to be gracious, to be respectful of the office. And one of the things they said to me was they really feel the White House has bent over backwards to extend themselves and give every courtesy to the Bush family this week.</p><p>[15:40:02] And as you just mentioned in just a little while, I think a little after 4:00, we're going to see President Trump and first lady, Melania Trump, go over to Blair House to pay their condolences.</p><p>So, I just think in this week where we've heard so many tributes of Bush 41 being a gentleman, total class, gracious, that's really what you're going to see these two families do. What will be interesting, however, to see is what happens at the cathedral tomorrow for the service where all the former Presidents are going to be together for the first time. We're all going to be watching that very closely -- Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: No doubt about it. Jamie Gangel, thank you for your ongoing reporting on this.</p><p>Democratic stars are now reacting to Joe Biden's declaration. Joe Biden also will be at the funeral. But he's on his book tour right now and he is saying he is the most qualified in the country to run for president.</p><p>Plus, it has been months and months of silence but any moment we expect Robert Mueller will reveal details on how Michael Flynn cooperated with the special counsel.</p><p>[15:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA: We have this just in from the Charlottesville, Virginia trial. The man accused of plowing his car into a crowd of demonstrators protesting against white nationalists. Jurors today heard audio tapes of James Fields Jr. sobbing during interrogation. He broke down. He hyperventilated for several minutes after being told people had been injured and one had died. Feels is on trial for killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others during that unite the right rally in August of last year.</p><p>Also, in court today, a judge also allowed an image of Adolf Hitler that prosecutor say Fields sent to his mother. The judge also allowed audio of phone conversations between Fields and his mother recorded just after the attack. In one of those calls, Fields can be heard slamming victim Heather Heyer's mother, calling her an anti-white communist and said she was the enemy. When his mom replied, she lost her daughter. He responded, that doesn't (expletive) matter, she is the enemy, mother.</p><p>When the defense puts on its case lawyers for Fields are expected to try to convince the jury that he acted out of fear of their counter protesters and not with criminal intent.</p><p>Well, the 2020 race for President is already heating up. Former Vice President Joe Biden telling a book tour crowd, quote, I'll be as straight as I can with you. I think I am the most qualified person in the country to be president. He said he will make a decision on a presidential run in the next two months. And he went on to make this admission.</p><p>Quote, I am a gaffe machine, but my God, what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can't tell the truth.</p><p>CNN senior political writer and analyst Harry Enten is joining us now. So, I remember when being a gaffe machine was a bad thing. Do you think in today's political world it's actually perhaps a good thing in the eyes of voters?</p><p>HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER: I don't know if it's a good thing, but compared to the man in the White House, I'm not sure how you could be more of a gaffe machine than he is, as least as we commonly define gaffes. Look, I think voters are looking for authenticity. That was one of the big problems with Hillary Clinton when she was matched up against Donald Trump. He won on that authentic measure even if people thought that she was more qualified than he was. So, to me Joe Biden, his main sell could be authenticity. His authenticity pitch that could in fact work with him. The stuff about him being experienced, I'm not sure that's such a selling point, however.</p><p>CABRERA: Let me ask you about that. Because as you point out, he said he was most experienced. Then it could be a crowded field for the 2020 primary. Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts also considering a presidential run. Listen to this exchange she had with CNN's Manu Raju about Biden's comments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Senator, last night Joe Biden said he'd be the most qualified person to run for President. Do you agree?</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: I think that the Vice President has many wonderful qualities. And I'm glad to hear that he's out and talking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: What do you make of that?</p><p>ENTEN: I mean, look, I think that she's trying to balance this whole entire act. Right? Where she doesn't want to attack someone else in the field and at the same time. While at the same time she's trying to sell herself. And that's going to be one of the real balancing acts I think a lot of Democrats are going to have going forward in 2020. Is the field is going to be so large, so huge, 10, 15, could be up to 20 people. Who knows?</p><p>They want to go after the President of the United States while at the same time they want to be able to differentiate themselves from the fellow Democrats in the field. It's going to be very interesting to see who is the first one who eventually goes on the attack but that's not going to happen for a pretty long time, I don't think.</p><p>CABRERA: Kind of going back to this authenticity that you talked about. We heard from Bruce Springsteen this week. He's no Trump fan but he says, he thinks Trump going to be re-elected president in 2020 because nobody can talk like Trump can. Is there truth to that?</p><p>ENTEN: I mean, look, Donald Trump has defied the critics once before. He did so in 2016 when people such as myself thought that he had no shot of winning at least when winning in the primary season. At the end of the day when you have a president -- and incumbent President, these campaigns tend to be about his or her record, or his record in the case of this country.</p><p>And so, yes, at this point, maybe there is no one who can stand up and is this sort of presidential figure. But you know what? You go back to 1992 when George H.W. Bush was running, there weren't a lot of people in that democratic field who looked like presidential figures either.</p><p>[15:50:00] But then one emerged because the President, George H.W. Bush was so unpopular. If Donald Trump is as unpopular in two years as he is today, he will probably lose.</p><p>CABRERA: All right, Harry Enten, good to have you with us.</p><p>ENTEN: Thank you.</p><p>CABRERA: Thank you, sir.</p><p>CABRERA: Back to our breaking news. The Dow still falling. Let's take a look. It's down 746 points now, just minutes from the closing bell. We'll have details on how the President's tweets could be driving this.</p><p>[15:55:00](COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA: Welcome back. One of the world's most successful internet entrepreneurs is calling out Facebook. Marc Benioff the founder of Salesforce is hitting Facebook over issues of privacy and lack of self-regulation. And joining us is CNN's business senior technology correspondent, Laurie Segall. Laurie, he's actually calling the social media giant the new cigarettes?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN BUSINESS, SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and I will say, Marc Benioff is becoming an incredibly influential leader in Silicon Valley. He's calling out tech companies left and right. And he talked to me about this idea of the fourth industrial revolution. He says we are so connected and with that comes a lot of ethical implications. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARC BENIOFF, FOUNDER, SALESFORCE: When everyone and everything is connected, OK, you're going to have to really think about, do you trust what is happening? Do you trust these companies and these products that are in your home? And in your car? And what's going on?</p><p>SEGALL: I mean, I've got to tell you, Marc, I don't 100 percent. Look at what's happened in the last couple years. How can we put all our faith in big tech when in the last years it doesn't seem like some of these companies know the impact of their own algorithms?</p><p>BENIOFF: I think it's kind of the metaphor of the social networks. It's great, actually. When a started, they're talking about is Nirvana, everything is wonderful. We're going to connect everybody together. Now we find out they're not uniting us, they're dividing us. You know? That they're not maintaining our data. That they're selling it. You know, that there isn't privacy. You know, that there's a -- basically, a huge ecosystem of people who are harvesting the data for personal gain.</p><p>SEGALL: Do you trust this industry to self-regulate?</p><p>BENIOFF: I don't trust the industry to self-regulate. I already said, Facebook is the new cigarettes. It's not good for you. It's addictive. You don't know who is trying to convince you to use it or misuse it. The government has to step in and regulate it, and Facebook has proven that to us over and over and over again that they need to be regulated, because they're not self-regulating.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEGALL: Yes. And I think it's also worth noting this idea of the business model in Silicon Valley and when it comes to Facebook, is it fundamentally broken. I think that's another question we have to ask as we have these questions about ethics in the future of technology. CABRERA: We have just about 30 seconds, Laurie. But Facebook has said in the past that they welcome some kind of regulation, don't they?</p><p>SEGALL: Yes, you know, but I think a lot of this is, it's taken a long time and it's taken a lot of bad things to happen for them to get to this point. And, of course, I think they want the right kind of regulation at this point. And I think there's a lot of pressure right now on the government for them to get it together, for them to get in front of things. Because I think Facebook's whole ethos has been, they have been too reactive and not proactive. You look at what happened with the election, with data use. And so now I think they're -- you know, kind of playing catchup in a way that I think they're under a lot of pressure on both sides. Republicans and the Democrats to get it together. And the question is, you know, can the government come up with the right type of regulation for Facebook. I think that's a big question that we're going to be looking at in the future.</p><p>CABRERA: Their survival may depend on it. Thank you so much Laurie Segall, for sharing with us. Don't forget to check out her series, \"THE HUMAN CODE\" at CNNbusiness.com.</p><p>That does it for me, thanks for being here. \"THE LEAD\" with Jake Tapper starts right now.</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Welcome to \"THE LEAD,\" I'm Jake Tapper. We start with breaking news in our money lead today. A massive stock selloff as concerns grow that the trade truce between the U.S. and China may not actually be much of a truce. The Dow closing down almost 800 points, wiping out yesterday's gains and putting the market at risk. At risk of losing all of the gains it's made this year. CNN's Alison Kosik is live at the New York Stock Exchange. Alison, why the selloff?</p><p>KOSIK: Yes, a dramatic move to the down side, especially when you look at the Dow. Down almost 800 points. The market is reassessing what came out of the meeting between China's President Xi and President Trump in Argentina. There is growing doubt that the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China is going to actually end any time soon. Despite the White House speaking positively about meetings at the G-20, there is this realization now in the financial markets that nothing concrete actually came out of those meetings and that there is no deal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2018120408CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWN-99K1-DXH2-63XX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 4, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George H.W.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TERRY KEENAN, CNN ANCHOR: You are looking at live pictures from here at the New York Stock Exchange.  We are less than 60 seconds away from the closing bell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And good afternoon, everyone.  I'm Terry Keenan, in for Jan Hopkins.</p><p>Let's find out how the markets are doing in this final minute of trading.</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Dow Industrials set to close with a pretty respectable gain, even on the day that Wall Street awaits word from Microsoft.</p><p>JOHN METAXAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm John Metaxas at the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq managing a 2 percent gain on a very quiet trading session, but the attention shifts to Microsoft -- the judge's ruling due out in about a half hour.</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Steve Young, at U.S. District Court in Washington, where indeed Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected in about half an hour to issue the landmark antitrust final judgment breaking up the world's biggest software company, Microsoft.</p><p>PATRICIA SABGA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Patricia Sabga at the JavaOne conference in San Francisco.  We spoke with Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems and Bill Gates' biggest rival.  Hear what he has to say about Microsoft.</p><p>KEENAN: And President Clinton orders Medicare to increase its coverage for senior citizens.</p><p>It's Wednesday, June 7th, and you're watching STREET SWEEP.</p><p>Stocks rose in the last hour of trading today, as investors continued to wait for the historic antitrust ruling against Microsoft. CEO Bill Gates says his company will survive if it's broken up, but that it will slow innovation in the computer industry.</p><p>Gates, one of the richest men in the country, just minutes away from finding out the fate as a judge has decided for his company at the U.S.  District Courthouse in Washington, D.C. If Microsoft is the 800-pound gorilla of the software business, it doesn't mean there aren't a lot of other smaller meaner predators out there hoping to take a bite out of the business, or take the business away entirely.  You might call them the \"ABM\" crowd: Anyone But Microsoft.  And their rallying cry is Java and they are rallying today in San Francisco at JavaOne.</p><p>That's where \"THE N.E.W. SHOW\" anchor Patty Sabga is and she spoke with one of Bill Gates' biggest competitors and critics.</p><p>And, Patty, what did he have to say?</p><p>SABGA: Hi, Terry.</p><p>Well, we're here at JavaOne in San Francisco.  Now, outside of the DOJ, this is probably ground zero of anti-Microsoft sentiment. Java, of course, is the programming language that you write once and run anywhere, from a Microsoft Windows PC to a Macintosh.  It was developed by Sun Microsystems, released about five years ago, and it is a grenade that was lobbed directly at the heart of the Microsoft- Windows monopoly.</p><p>Now, yesterday, we sat down with Scott McNealy.  He is the CEO of Sun Microsystems, and we asked him if he thinks Microsoft should be split up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT MCNEALY, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, SUN MICROSYSTEMS: I would -- yes, I'd get the chainsaw out.  But I don't think -- you know, IBM didn't need to be split up.  They were very responsible, very willing -- not happy about it, but certainly willing and eager to implement the judge's wishes, if you will, in their antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Microsoft is: to heck with them -- very remorseless.  I mean, it's just a very, very different group.  So I don't think conduct and cajoling and consent decree kind of remedies will work.  I think structural is the only way that it will work with that particular situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SABGA: And then of course the other question too has to be, if we do get a split with Microsoft, Microsoft's stocks will suffer and it's indisputable.  As Microsoft stock heads south, so too does the Nasdaq.  And a lot of other big tech names get beaten up as well.  So in effect, couldn't the punishment of Microsoft come back and hurt Sun?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCNEALY: I'm not sure I buy that logic.  I think Sun has done quite well despite or -- no matter what happens to Microsoft.  And I think other companies do very well.  I think investors have choice. And they'll go with where the market opportunities are.  And sure it was great, and it was a wonderful gravy train to be able to invest in a monopolist.  And that is not a great, brilliant investment strategy. It works, but that's not necessarily what I would call, you know, a really insightful investment strategy.</p><p>If that's no longer available to them, they'll have to invest in competitive companies.  We've proven our ability to actually make money and provide a great return to our shareholders even in the face of a monopolist.  I think it will be even better when we have full choice back in the marketplace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SABGA: Again, Terry, that was from yesterday.  And of course that was Scott McNealy's most recent statement to the press as we all await Judge Jackson's final judgment in this landmark case -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: And somehow, I think he's probably still calling the same tune today, Patty.  I know you canvassed the feeling there at JavaOne. What's everyone saying?</p><p>SABGA: It's actually sort of a mixed feeling here at JavaOne. Some people feel that innovation has just gone on, and that really Microsoft hasn't really hurt it.  Bear in mind, there are over 330 companies that are exhibiting here at JavaOne, and there are over two million programmers who are working with the language that was released just five years ago.</p><p>Now others feel, however, that it will actually help innovation, And of course, one person we talked to said, ironically enough, if it weren't for Microsoft, than none of this would have ever taken place. Because Java, remember, was developed to strike right at the heart of the Windows monopoly -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thank you, Patty -- Patty Sabga.</p><p>Well, as we said, the Microsoft ruling is expected at 4:30 p.m. and we will bring it to you live.  The Department of Justice has scheduled a 5:00 p.m. news conference, which will also be seen right here on CNN.</p><p>Let's go to our Steve Young, who is at the U.S. District Courthouse, awaiting today's ruling.</p><p>And Steve, what can we expect?</p><p>YOUNG: Well, Terry, I expect that Judge Jackson is on the second floor at that end of the building behind me, which houses the District Court.  It's taken as a given that he's going to order a breakup of the company.  The only cliffhanger is whether it will be into two parts or three.  He expressed interest in three-part break up, but the government said that would be too intrusive, would take too long to implement.  And it asked in its the final, proposed judgment that the company split in two.</p><p>Antitrust watchers are looking for something else.  It was widely held last week by antitrust experts that the judge may have blundered in cutting short the final, or so-called remedy phase, in not allowing Microsoft to put on witnesses to try to argue against a breakup.  The antitrust experts want to see and they're waiting closely to see if the judge attaches a reasoned explanation along with the, really, the boiler plate that was in his word processor, put there by the Department of Justice and the 19 states that are suing the government -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thank you very much, Steve.  And of course we will be checking back in with you later in the hour -- Steve Young.</p><p>It has been more than 100 weeks since this case began and in less than 30 minutes, we will have that final historic antitrust decision on Microsoft.</p><p>For some market perspective on today's ruling, I'm joined by Phil Dow.  He's the market strategist with Dain Rauscher Wessels.  And for the legal viewpoint, we have John Coffee onboard.  He is a professor at Columbia University.</p><p>And gentlemen, welcome.</p><p>Phil, let me start with you, because all through the 1990's, Microsoft was a bellwether stock, and perhaps the quintessential stock of this bull market.  It has faltered.  It's down 45 percent.  How much of that is because of the Justice Department?</p><p>PHIL DOW, DAIN RAUSCHER WESSELS: I think a part of it's due to the Justice Department.  I think you have emotional content when the government gets involved.  But I think we've got to separate Microsoft the stock from Microsoft the company.  And my feeling is that the outcome, regardless of what the judges decides, is going to be positive for the stock longer-term.  I think investors should own this company.</p><p>KEENAN: Interesting, because a lot of negative sentiment -- you think once this cloud is kind of pushed aside, that then the fundamentals of the company can shine through?</p><p>DOW: I think first we'll have a little bit of quiet and some of the emotion will die down, but I think people will begin to recognize that this company is going to probably be the one that delivers seamless access to the Internet with your handheld device, with your PC, and is kind of still a solid solution company.</p><p>To me the biggest problem the company faces is keeping employees and recruiting employees.</p><p>KEENAN: John Coffee, what should we be looking for when we see the judge's ruling?  It seems a fairly foregone conclusion that we will see a breakup of the company in the judge's decree.  What else should we be looking for?</p><p>JOHN COFFEE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL: I'd say focus on the conduct remedies because that's where the greatest question marks lie.  The divestiture issue is going to have longrun significance, but it's not going affect anything next week or next month.  Microsoft could however be significantly changed in its ability to compete. It may have to disclose its source code, may have to give a common price to all equipment manufacturers, may have to change the way in which it markets its Windows, offering a stripped-down, bare bones model as well as a high tech model, with all the applications.</p><p>All of that is going to change the nature of competition in this industry, and one of the biggest questions will be whether those conduct remedies go into force next week or whether they're going to be stayed, either by the court or by an appellate court.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, hold that thought.  Stay put -- to both of you, continue to be with us throughout the program.</p><p>We want to go to Midtown Manhattan right now and bring in John Metaxas.  He's been following Microsoft's stock today at the Nasdaq marketsite.</p><p>And John, we had a little pop to the upside.</p><p>METAXAS: That's right.  The Microsoft news that's coming out within the half hour, an overhang to the market today, overshadowing what went on today.</p><p>We had a very decent two percent gain in the Nasdaq, but it was one of the quieter sessions of the year -- up 82 points to 3839 -- closing with strength, 1.4 billion shares changing hands.</p><p>Despite all the concerns about what the remedy for Microsoft will be, the stock managed the rally today, or a mini-rally -- up 7/8's or 1.3 percent.  If you take a look at where Microsoft has traded since the beginning of the year, hit its high at just under 120 dollars at the beginning of the year.  It's been a downward slope since then, hitting close to $60 a share a few days ago.  That would be a decline of 50 percent.  The stock has started to come up with rest of the Nasdaq.  So the question for investors is, has the market figured in the worse for Microsoft at this point?</p><p>Nasdaq was up 82, at 3839.  Back to you, Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks a lot, John.  Just ahead, a rally here on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Let's go to Rhonda Schaffler on the floor for the latest -- Rhonda.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Hi there, Terry.</p><p>A pretty decent close to the day, all things considering, and Microsoft being one of those things.  We had a couple of developments late in the day.  Some of the other techs really stepped up to the plate here.  Hewlett-Packard and IBM had some pretty decent gains -- Goldman Sachs making some upbeat comments about the prospects for IBM's revenues.</p><p>So that helped things out here, along with the fact that financial stocks throughout the day had been performing pretty well. So the Dow did manage to close with a gain.  A lot of traders here are saying people are looking forward to getting this Microsoft story -- having a little bit of closure for now on it.  People are very curious to see how that stock is going to be performing tomorrow as well -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thank you, Rhonda.</p><p>We'll have much more on the impending Microsoft decision as we wait for that 4:30 ruling from the judge in Washington.  We'll take you there live for that.</p><p>And still ahead, President Clinton orders Medicare to beef up its coverage for seniors.</p><p>Details and the news headlines up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Still awaiting the historic Microsoft antitrust ruling, which is due out within minutes.  As we continue canvassing reaction from around the country, We go back to San Francisco.  This time we bring in computer journalist Michael Fitzgerald of RedHerring.com.</p><p>Michael, welcome.</p><p>Bottom line, what do you think this ruling will mean for computer users?</p><p>MICHAEL FITZGERALD, REDHERRING.COM: Bottom line is we don't think it matters to the average consumer, to you, or me or our parents.  You can make some arguments that it might matter to corporate users in certain areas, but it seems to us most of the people who are making those arguments are just a bunch of Cassandras.</p><p>KEENAN: What about the competition?  Anybody benefit competitionwise?</p><p>FITZGERALD: You can argue that if Microsoft takes their eye off the ball because of this or gets distracted that it's going to help Sun or it's going to help Oracle.  I think Microsoft has in the database market kept Oracle honest.  But, you know, by and large, it certainly doesn't hurt them, let's just put it that way.  But I don't think it necessarily helps them either, because you can certainly make a strong case for saying that Microsoft split up this way could be even more aggressive in certain areas than it is right now, depending on what the ruling actually says.</p><p>KEENAN: Microsoft all along has taken a very belligerent attitude toward the Justice Department.  Steve Ballmer even said back in 1997, \"The heck with Janet Reno.\" Do you think that the company regrets taking such a tough stance?</p><p>FITZGERALD: I didn't think so at all.  In fact, one of my colleague was arguing that he thinks Microsoft really wants to be broken up; they just don't want to do it themselves.  I wouldn't go that far, but I think that you're seeing from Microsoft is this is a company that grew up in the '80s.  It's fundamental way of doing business, which is to add things that were not invented here and figure out how to integrate things in its fundamental way of being an operating system company is being challenged, and they're reacting like wounded, cornered animals, and that's what they feel like is happening to them.</p><p>KEENAN: You know, Microsoft is one of the earliest users of stock and stock options as compensation for its employees, and of course, as we've just seen, the stock a terrible performer this year, almost cut in half.  Do you think that going forward Microsoft is going to have trouble hanging on to its key employees?</p><p>FITZGERALD: Well, I think there's a burnout factor, but let's remember, this case is not the only thing affecting their stock.  They had a quarterly earnings announcement in the middle of this episode that, you know, where they did their normal kind of gloom-and-doom forecast for future earnings, and for once, the market kind of looked at them and said, you know, they're right, we don't think they're going to be as able to beat our estimates as solidly they had been this past.  So I think that that has also factored into what's happening with their stock.</p><p>And you know, in terms of a talent perspective, let's not forget the whole Nasdaq was down, you know, a lot of the startups that were throwing, you know, get-rich-quick options at people, don't really have that ability anymore.  So that remains to be seen from the options perspective.  I don't think they're particularly damaged right now.  Despite the drop-off in the stock, it's still a very good stock.</p><p>If they really were concerned about it, they could also start paying dividends to people, which clearly makes people more interested in your stock.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, thank you very much, Michael, we appreciate it, Michael Fitzgerald of RedHerring.com.  We have this quick programming note for you: Be sure to tune in to the \"MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR\" at 6:30 this evening.  Bill Gates will be the guest.</p><p>And let's go to Atlanta now and check some other headlines making news this afternoon.</p><p>Lou, good afternoon.</p><p>LOU WATERS, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, Terry,</p><p>An executive order from President Clinton will make it easier for older Americans to take part in clinical trials.  The president's directive covers the 40 million Americans now in the Medicare program. It requires the program to reimburse recipients who take part in eligible clinical trials.  Under the current policy, Medicare does not cover the costs of chemical trials designed to test new drugs or treatments.</p><p>If you are an AT&amp;T customer, your long distance phone bill may be going up -- or it may be going down.  AT&amp;T is raising per-minute rates during certain hours for millions of customers who are not on discount plans, but AT&amp;T says it also is lowering its Sunday rates 40 percent. The company also says the savings from a reduction in access fees will be passed along to consumers.</p><p>A new concern for cell phone users, if your cell phone can display text messages, it could become victim of a new cyber-virus. The new bug is similar to the ILOVEYOU virus we've been telling you about that recently was spread by e-mail to computer systems around the world.  This latest bug was originally written to attack a Spanish-based cell phone network.</p><p>A face familiar to Americans during the gulf War Has faded away. The Army general who served as a Desert Storm spokesman for the Pentagon has died.  Retired Lt. Gen. Thomas Kelly was 67.  He suffered from cancer for about a year.  General Kelly earned numerous awards and decorations.  More news anytime.  I'm Lou Waters.</p><p>Now back to Terry in New York.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thank you, Lou.</p><p>We are still on alert for the landmark Microsoft ruling.  As soon as we have it, you'll have it.</p><p>We'll also bring you some of the highlights of today's market action from both the Nasdaq and here at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>STREET SWEEP continues in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Let's take a quick trip down the stairs to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and Rhonda Schaffler for a look at some the Big Board movers.  And that $8 move in IBM certainly caught my eye.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Yes, it really helped out the Dow here late in the day.  First, let's tell you about General Motors Hughes Electronics stock.  That one was actually down.  We had a brokerage downgrade on the stock, with Soundview lowering the rating to hold from buy. Yesterday, GM set a three-for-one split GMH stock.  As far as IBM goes, this was a big contributor to the Dow's advance.  Late in the day, some comments coming from Goldman Sachs analysts quite positive about IBM's revenue prospects.  The stock really took off late in the session, and it was the best performing Dow stock and also came on a day where some of the other techs were a bit mixed.</p><p>One other stock that was a high flier was KLM Royal Dutch Air. This stock a little bit less than 10 percent.  It confirmed persistent rumors that it's talking with British Airways about an alliance, just talking, no assurance that a deal will be reached.  There is no deal until it is on paper.</p><p>Beyond that ING Barings raised KLM to hold from sell.  So that stock got a lift on that news -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks a lot, Rhonda.  Rhonda Schaffler. Let's go uptown again to the Nasdaq marketsite and see how Microsoft stock finished out the day.  Let's bring in John Metaxas -- John.</p><p>METAXAS: Well, Terry, Microsoft stock up 7/8 on the day at 70 1/2.  And as we look at the stock in after-hours trading, it's trading up another quarter dollar at 70 3/4.  Just moments away -- or I should say minutes away -- from that anticipated ruling from Judge Jackson.</p><p>Nasdaq had a very quiet, but good session today.  Semiconductor, Internet, many of the financial stocks doing well, including some of the online brokers.</p><p>But perhaps the story of the day was the Microsoft competitors, as attention shifts to them.  Sun Microsystems -- we just heard Scott McNealy earlier in the program -- creators of the Java programming platform up 4 7/16 today.  Oracle, the largest database software company in the world, up nearly $3 a share, a gain of nearly 4 percent on the day.  Apple Computer has long been a competitor of Microsoft, with their Mac operating system, basically the only other operating system out there for PCs -- or I should say before Linux came along. But Apple up 4 percent on the day.</p><p>But the biggest gains were for those Linux stocks, and we had Red Hat up 17 1/2 percent, one of the leading Linux operating system makers.  Corel surging 30 percent, a gain of more than a dollar a share.  They are a software vendor for the Linux operating system.</p><p>So some good individual moves here, and a decent day for the Nasdaq ahead of that Microsoft announcement.</p><p>KEENAN: That's for sure.  Thanks, John.</p><p>OK, let's check what's going on in after-hours trading.  Pat Kiernan is standing by at the Instinet trading desk in midtown Manhattan -- Pat.</p><p>KIERNAN: I'm sorry, this picture's going to come into clearer focus about 10 minutes from now, I guess.  But we are seeing fairly active trading in Microsoft even before the judge's ruling comes out: 828,000 shares have traded on Instinet since 4 o'clock on Microsoft. And it is about in-line with the close at 4 o'clock.  Microsoft up 1/8 right now from the 4 o'clock close at 70 5/8.</p><p>You heard John mention some of the competitors.  In Instinet trading, Oracle since 4 o'clock has gained 1/16 trading at 80 1/16. And Linux, VA Linux Systems, trading up here after hours, up 3/8 at 38 1/8 -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks a lot, Pat.</p><p>Let's see what \"MONEYLINE\" has in store for tonight's coverage of the Microsoft decision, in addition to a man who might have something to say about the case, Bill Gates.</p><p>Here's our Stuart Varney -- Stuart. STUART VARNEY, CNN ANCHOR: Well, you're absolutely right, Terry. Tonight on MONEYLINE, we're going to discuss the most successful company in a generation, facing punishment from the government.  In the relationship between government and business, there is no bigger case than this one.  So we're going to speak directly with Bill Gates about this landmark decision.  We're going to find out how he will reassure investors, how he plans to fight back on appeal, and how he feels personally about the potential breakup of the company that he founded.</p><p>There are, of course, Microsoft opponents, and we will be speaking to one of them.  For him it's payback time.  We're going to hear from a former Netscape chief executive, Jim Barksdale.  He once predicted that this would be the century's most important ruling, and he will be on our air tonight.</p><p>That's \"MONEYLINE\": 6:30 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>Back to you, Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, see you then, Stuart.  And coming up: just minutes away from the Department of Justice's historic decision.  And our financial editor, Myron Kandel, is going to take a look back at some major breakups in American business history.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL EISNER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, WALT DISNEY: I think Microsoft is a great company.  I think they've done an unbelievable service to the entire Information Age.  They're innovators.  I would hope that whatever they end up doing with Microsoft doesn't leave them in a way that they can't continue being that way.</p><p>Have they done some things wrong?  Has their behavior been a little aggressive?  I guess it has, and I guess there should be some retribution for that.  But I wouldn't want to bring the whole company down on its knees.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEENAN: All right, that was comments -- exclusive comments here on CNN -- by Disney CEO Michael Eisner about judgment day for Microsoft.  And we're just getting word here that Microsoft will be holding a news conference at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, as will the Justice Department following Judge Penfield Jackson's ruling at 4:30 p.m.</p><p>Will the Justice Department add Microsoft to the list of companies split up in the past?  That answer, of course, is just a couple minutes away.  But what is the history of breakups, and what have they brought to giant companies and their founders?</p><p>Our Myron Kandel takes a look from our New York studios -- Myron. MYRON KANDEL, CNN FINANCIAL EDITOR: Well, Terry, of course the first great breakup was a Standard Oil Trust, owned by John D. Rockefeller.  And what happened then in 1911 under President Teddy Roosevelt and the trust-busters, that company -- that trust was broken up into 34 different companies.  Rockefeller became even wealthier, owning all those pieces.</p><p>The next one was in the early '80s when AT&amp;T was forced to divest seven \"Baby Bells.\" Investors who held on to those shares did very well in the years ahead.  So if that's any portent of what might happen with Microsoft, maybe investors don't have that much to worry about, Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  Thank you, Myron.  Myron Kandel.</p><p>We are continuing a Microsoft watch here as we wait for the judge's final ruling in the case.  Stay tuned for CNN for that breaking news.  \"SHOWBIZ TODAY\" will not be seen.  We'll be right back with the decision after this short break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Welcome back.  I'm Terry Keenan in for Jan Hopkins.  We also welcome our CNN International viewers.</p><p>After a trial of more than 100 weeks, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has finally handed down the historic anti-trust ruling to end the Microsoft monopoly.  Our Steve Young has been following this case from the get-go, and he joins us now from Washington with the latest -- Steve.</p><p>YOUNG: Terry, the brief has just been handed to me.  I am still looking at it.  We know that it's 23 pages.  We know that the judge was expected to break the company up in two.  I think, frankly, I'm going to have to look at it a little bit more, but I'll be back in the next minute or two with some more details.</p><p>KEENAN: Steve, why don't you go through that document, and we'll continue to talk here at the New York Stock Exchange.  Actually, we're going to go out to Redmond, Washington, and bring in our Katherine Barrett.  She's standing outside of Microsoft headquarters.</p><p>Katherine, what's the mood like there?</p><p>KATHERINE BARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Terry, Microsoft is wasting no time.  It will be sending out prepackaged reaction comments from company founder Bill Gates even as the judge is releasing his ruling.  Then, as you mentioned, the company will hold a press conference here at 2 o'clock local time, 5 o'clock Eastern.  The company is expected to make a prompt legal appeal of this ruling, but even as it challenges a possible breakup, the so-called \"conduct remedies\" were supposed to have taken effect immediately after the judge's ruling pending any appeal, although that again is another element that the company could appeal to the court.</p><p>Now, we were told this morning that Bill Gates would also be meeting with and e-mailing his employees late today or tomorrow, perhaps to explain the company's move or even give them some kind of a pep talk to retain employees whose morale has admittedly suffered during this long legal battle and particularly suffered with its impact on the company's stock price.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, Katherine\u2026</p><p>BARRETT: There's an awful lot of debate and uncertainty locally about what this ruling will mean for the area, but there are too many uncertainties really to predict at this stage -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, Katherine, I have to interrupt you and go back to Washington.  We are just getting word that Judge Jackson has ruled and has decided to split Microsoft into two company.</p><p>Our Steve Young has been pouring through the document.  Steve, what else do you see in there?</p><p>YOUNG: Terry, I think the headline is that the judge appears to have adopted the entire final judgment.  I'll be 99 percent certain of that perhaps in another couple of minutes, but the headline is he orders that Microsoft be divided into two companies: one for the Windows operating system, the other for applications, Internet business and everything else.</p><p>He sticks with the government's requirement that Microsoft, in its own rhetoric, set out a blueprint for its own corporate demise by proposing a formula no longer than four months after entry of this final judgment.</p><p>In addition to the structural or breakup proposal, which has now been entered in this historic final judgment in the most major antitrust trial since 1984, there are a string, a long string of so- called \"conduct remedies,\" which restrict Microsoft's business practices.  Microsoft will have to, for example, charge the same price for the Windows operating system to the 20 largest computer-makers. The government contended at trial, and there was testimony to that effect, that Microsoft withheld technical information from competitors and used the price of Windows as a threat to keep computer-makers from using competing products.</p><p>There are many detailed conduct remedies in this, and they are supposed to go into effect almost immediately.  So again, it is a two- part breakup that is ordered by the judge.  He appears to have adopted all the implementation language suggested by the government.</p><p>We have not yet had a chance to read the accompanying memorandum. It is perhaps in there where there will be some reasoned explanation from the judge as to why he has done what he has done.</p><p>Microsoft is expected almost immediately to appeal this entire final judgment to Judge Jackson himself.  The company full well knows that Judge Jackson will almost certainly turn a -- I would say will certainly turn a cold ear to that.  Microsoft will then appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on the second floor of this -- or rather the sixth floor of this very same building.  The government hopes, though, to circumvent that and get the case straight to the Supreme Court, which might not be as friendly to Microsoft as the appellate court has before -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: Steve, I just want to quickly run two things by you.  As you can hear, a very loud bell ringing here.  No reaction to this decision, just the usual bell.  But this split -- the judge ordering that the split will last for 10 years.  Also, that the conduct remedies will go into effect in 90 days.  Either one of those two things surprising?</p><p>YOUNG: No, 10 years was what was originally envisioned by the government.  Microsoft wanted a shorter period of time.  It wanted the two companies or three or however many there might have been to be able to recombine.  However, the government's provision would allow Microsoft's new company, which it's being called generically, the one with applications and everything else to do business with the old company, the one with the Windows operating system so long as third companies were not disadvantaged.  So no major surprise in that, Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  Thank you very much, Steve.  Steve Young.</p><p>All right.  We're already getting word out of the Justice Department applauding this decision.  Our Bob Beard is there with the latest -- Bob.</p><p>BOB BEARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, yes.  Hi, Terry.</p><p>As you would expect, the Justice Department very, very pleased at Judge Jackson's ruling splitting the software king into two companies. This has been a case prosecuted by the Justice Department for so long now.</p><p>Here is a statement just released by the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, a man we all know and have seen -- Joel Klein.  And I quote -- a very, very simple same, one sentence.</p><p>Quote: \"The court's order is the right remedy for Microsoft's serious and repeated violations of the antitrust laws.\" That is all that the Justice Department is saying at this time from Joel Klein. Again, the court's ordered the right remedy for Microsoft's serious and repeated violations of the antitrust laws.</p><p>We are expecting a news conference here at the Justice Department at one of their conference rooms around 5 o'clock Eastern Time this afternoon.  Attorney General Janet Reno will be there.  Joel Klein will be there, as well as the attorney general of one of the states that was in this case, the attorney general of Iowa, Tom Miller.</p><p>But again, a short one-sentence statement from the Justice Department, saying that the court's order is the right remedy.</p><p>Terry, back to you.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  Thank you, Bob, and we of course will also be having a 5:00 p.m. news conference from Microsoft as well.  You can watch both those news conferences right here on CNN and CNNfn at the top of the hour.</p><p>I'm now rejoined by market strategist Phil Dow of Dain Rauscher Wessels and law professor John Coffee of Columbia University.</p><p>Now, Professor Coffee, let me start with you.  You're the legal eagle here.</p><p>From what you heard, how bad is it for Microsoft?</p><p>COFFEE: Well, the conventional wisdom is right.  The judge has in effect ordered what the government wanted.  And because the conduct remedies will go into force in 90 days, unless stayed, the critical procedural issue is whether Microsoft can convince the D.C. Circuit to stay the conduct remedies.</p><p>That has great significance because the standard for a stay is whether you can convince the appellate court that you are probably going to be successful on the ultimate merits.  And so the decision on a stay, to some extent, will prefigure the ultimate decision of the D.C. Circuit.  We'll get a foreshadowing of the D.C. Circuit views this decision at that stay stage.</p><p>KEENAN: Phil, how do you think investors will react to this?</p><p>DOW: I think there will be an emotional content to it.  My guess is that nobody is going to be surprised.  I think the stock may open a little bit on the downside tomorrow.</p><p>But I think at some point the company is going to respond to it with financial guideposts, with plans that people I think will begin to focus on.  I think the stock over time will recover, whether it's one, two, or three companies.  And I do believe there will be kind of a quiet period coming up.</p><p>But we like Microsoft, the company.  The stock is going to be an emotional one for a while here.</p><p>KEENAN: And eventually, Jack, Bill Gates is going to have to decide where he's going to go to work in the morning, because he's only going to be able to work at one of the two companies, although he has given up the CEO title.</p><p>COFFEE: Well, that's going to affect the morale.  If Bill Gates says, I'm going with you and abandoning you, that does carry a message for all the employees who in effect are left behind.</p><p>And indeed, Microsoft also has to prepare this divestiture plan, and that's going to have a demoralizing impact on employees as they start watching in effect a divorce of the old-time family.</p><p>KEENAN: Any competitors here that you think can make a killing off of this?</p><p>DOW: Well, we were talking before the show that there might be some middleware companies that do well coming in, in the competitive space.  My guess is going to be, though, that you now are going to see Microsoft respond and give us some guidance as to what they intend to do as a broken-up company.</p><p>My guess also is that they've been lowballing us on their financial ability to deliver earnings.  I think you're going to see better earnings later this year.</p><p>So I think that one has to kind of go on faith that it's still a great company, great management, and let's see how they do with the numbers later on.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  We're going to take a quick break, and in just a minute, we're going to have another check in after-hours trading. We'll see what Microsoft is doing.  We'll also have the first comments from Bill Gates on judgment day for the company he founded.  And how long will this case be drawn out in the appeals court?  We'll try to answer that question as well, coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL GATES, CHAIRMAN, MICROSOFT: This is the beginning of a new chapter in this case.  We will be appealing this decision, and we have a very strong case on appeal.  This ruling is inconsistent with the past decisions by the appeals court, with fundamental fairness and with the reality of the marketplace.  Consumers every day see more competition, lower prices, and an economy full of innovation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEENAN: Bill Gates wasting no time putting his spin on Judge Penfield Jackson's ruling to break his company up into two parts, you will hear more of Bill Gates on \"MONEYLINE\" coming up at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Well, let's see how Microsoft shares are reacting in after-hours trading, our Pat Kiernan joins us from the Instinet trading desk in midtown Manhattan.  Pat, any reaction?</p><p>PAT KIERNAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Terry, we had Microsoft shares trading very actively between 4:00 and 4:29, but at 4:20 the shares were halted and that's how Microsoft remains right now. Microsoft shares are not trading, they were halted so that investors could have a look at this news from Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. And we expect that at least until after 5:00 we will not see any trading in Microsoft shares, but we will continue to watch that very closely.</p><p>At last word, it was trading right about where it closed at 4:00 in the 70 1/2, 70 5/8 range on Microsoft.  And the competitors of Microsoft are still trading, but no big moves in a lot of those stocks, Oracle unchanged.  Sun Microsystems down 11/16.  AOL is down 1/16.  Corel is down 3/16.  Red Hat is down 1/16.  All those numbers, the changes from the 4:00 close.  So very much in line with the 4:00 closes and we are still waiting for Microsoft shares to reopen -- Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, continue to monitor that, thank you Pat, Pat Kiernan reporting from the Instinet trading desk.</p><p>Want to take you back down to Washington and our technology correspondent Steve Young, he of course has been following this case from the get-go, and he is joined by antitrust expert Rick Rule of Covington &amp; Burling -- Steve.</p><p>YOUNG: Terry, now we've had a chance to look at the memorandum and we are going to see into the mind of the judge, a lot of the key question was Microsoft's protestation, that breakup came as a total surprise in that there was no remedy phase.</p><p>Rick Rule was head of antitrust at the Justice Department in the Reagan and part of the Bush administration.  The document from the judge says: \"Microsoft's profession of surprise is not credible.  From the inception of this case, the company knew from well-established Supreme Court precedents dating from the beginning of the last century, a mandated divestiture was a possibility, if not a probability.\" What about that?</p><p>RICK RULE, ATTORNEY, COVINGTON &amp; BURLING: Well, as -- first off, the judge made it very clear that he was going to hold off remedies phase during the main trial.  He never reopened discovery, he never took any evidence on the remedy phase.  The fact of the matter is, I think as most people have pointed out, there has not been a court-imposed divestiture in a Section II Sherman Act case in 33 years.  There has never been such a divestiture imposed in a case like this.</p><p>And the government -- you go back to when they brought the case in 1998, they made it clear that they were looking for a rifle-shot remedy, some contractual remedies; they were not looking for divestiture, divestiture was something that came up really after the close of the trial.  And there was never an opportunity for Microsoft to put the evidence in the record that would show how inappropriate this remedy is and how contrary to the public interest it is.</p><p>YOUNG: Well, Rick, the judge says further in the memorandum that Microsoft had full warning, that it had a five-month period of mediation with a distinguished mediator appointed by the court.  He does, for the first time, use the word \"radical\" here.  He says: \"The final judgment proposed by plaintiffs,\" and he says, \"they can propose anything they wish, they won, is perhaps more radical than might have been resulted if mediation had been successful.\" Does he appear to be playing -- placing the blame for the lack of success on Microsoft or, what do you think?</p><p>RULE: Well, if he is I think that's very unfortunate.  There's a tone in this that somehow Microsoft because they don't simply give into the government, they don't basically recognize that the law is on their side and exercise their rights of appeal, somehow has to be punished by a radical remedy.  That's not what the law is.</p><p>The fact is the remedy is not designed to punish Microsoft, it is supposed to make the public interest better, and that's what this fails to do.  The judge doesn't say anywhere in here that the remedy is going to make the public better off, and that really ought to be what the court focuses on.</p><p>YOUNG: I want to ask you one more question before returning it to Terry.</p><p>RULE: Sure.</p><p>YOUNG: The judge also says: \"Microsoft officials have been quoted as saying the company has done nothing wrong.  The court is well aware there is a substantial body of public opinion, some of it rational,\" the judge writes, \"that holds to a similar view, it's time to put that to the test.\" Microsoft doesn't disagree with that, does it?</p><p>RULE: No, and in fact, Microsoft always has known this would go to the court of appeals, and this is not particularly surprising.  The court of appeals is where this case is ultimately going to be decided and decided correctly.  But I think it's interesting that a court would say there is a difference in the public opinion, I'm not going to make the decision, I'm going to kick it to the court of appeals. That's not what trial courts typically do.</p><p>YOUNG: OK, Rick, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>RULE: Thank you.</p><p>YOUNG: And, Terry, back to you at the stock exchange.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thank you very much.  Steve, I had a quick question for Rick if he's still there.</p><p>YOUNG: He is.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, Rick, I'm wondering how, if at all, you think election-year politics might play in the appeals process here, and if Microsoft might try to wait out, try to get a friendlier administration?</p><p>RULE: Well, to be honest with you, I don't think Microsoft has to wait for political decisions.  All they have to do is count on an imposition of the rule of law by the court of appeals, which I think will occur.  Politics doesn't need to enter into this, shouldn't enter into this.  All that Microsoft needs, all that consumers need is a fair and accurate application of the law, and Microsoft will prevail.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, thank you, Rick.</p><p>RULE: You're welcome.</p><p>KEENAN: Rick Rule, joining us from Washington.</p><p>For a look now at the implications of the Microsoft decision, we're going to bring back computer journalist Michael Fitzgerald of RedHerring.com, and he joins us again from San Francisco. Michael, any surprises here to you?</p><p>FITZGERALD: No.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, so what's next, do you think, for Microsoft?</p><p>FITZGERALD: Well, I think that the guest who commented about what happens in terms of the stay, that's the big next question. Clearly, Microsoft now has to respond and say, OK, if we're going to break up, this is the way that it's going to get done, and you know, then they'll be doing that on their end of things.  And from a sort of what happens next perspective, though, if the decision to break them up gets stayed, that's obviously crucial for the business at large.</p><p>I mean, people are basically operating under the assumption out here in the Valley and in other parts of the tech business that nothing is going to happen for the next couple years as this makes its way through the courts; if that changes and we find out about it in 90 days, then people are going to have to sort of stand up and take notice and start thinking about what they really want to do.</p><p>KEENAN: Do you think Microsoft as a company is ready to put these remedies into place in 90 days?</p><p>FITZGERALD: Well, I think it's -- there's a lot of stuff that they are going to have to do.  I mean, they are basically being asked to reorganize along business units in a way that they don't feel is appropriate for their business, but I think, you know, in three months, you could probably come up with ways to do it.</p><p>And it's entirely possible they have had some people in the background someplace, thinking about, OK, what do we really want to do?  Who is going to go where?  Which company gets Ballmer?  Which company gets Gates, if this is actually what happens?  I mean, they have to do it, so of course they will be able to do it.</p><p>KEENAN: And of course, this judgment is also going to unleash a flood of other lawsuits from consumers, from competitors, and that if not just costly to Microsoft, is going to be another headache for the company to face.</p><p>FITZGERALD: Absolutely.  There's no question that when the decision came out that they were going to be a monopolist -- they were a monopolist, rather, that they were open suddenly to a lot of different lawsuits and there also several important suits that were already in place beforehand; one involving shareholder distribution -- or share distribution, in fact, that could also be very damaging to them.  So, legally this is not much fun for Microsoft, there is no question about that.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks, Michael -- Michael Fitzgerald.</p><p>And coming up next, our legal analyst Roger Cossack talks about the appeals process, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) KEENAN: OK.  There you are looking at a podium at the U.S. Justice Department, where in just a couple of minutes we are expecting a news conference on Judge Penfield Jackson's decision to break up Microsoft into two parts.</p><p>We now bring in our legal analyst, Roger Cossack, to sift through the implications of today's landmark Microsoft antitrust decision.</p><p>And Roger, let's talk appeals, because that's the next step there.</p><p>ROGER COSSACK, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Right.  Right.</p><p>Well, Terry, there's two ways this can be appealed.  There's an expediting act in which -- and I'm sure the government is going to want to at least ask for it to go this way, which would be a direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court.  And the reason for that is no matter what happens it'll be a quicker decision.</p><p>Microsoft, on the other hand, is probably going to want it to go to the D.C. Court of Appeals and ask that the Supreme Court not take a look at it until the D.C. Court of Appeals have an opportunity to sort of sift through some of the issues and maybe filter out some of the extraneous ones so that if it does end up before the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court only sees it on the important issues.  The difference in that is probably whether it takes a year at the outset to finish these appeals or it takes two years at the outset to finish these appeal.  So you can see that Microsoft, who certainly wants time to go before this happens.</p><p>Of course, the issue is whether or not they can get a stay during these appeals.  If they couldn't get a stay, it would probably -- the appeal wouldn't probably be worth much.  But I suspect that they would be able to get a stay, and therefore, you know, Microsoft is going to want to drag this thing out as long as they possibly can.</p><p>KEENAN: You know, we just saw a video news release with Bill Gates saying that he does believe that Microsoft will prevail upon appeal.  It sounds like Microsoft believes that they have a pretty friendly audience in the D.C. Court of Appeals.  Is that indeed the case?</p><p>COSSACK: Yes, that's right.  They believe that the law is more on their side among -- with the D.C. Court of Appeals.  And Judge Penfield Jackson in his -- Thomas Penfield Jackson, in his opinion, says: Look, I understand that there are differing points of view; let's get this thing decided once and for all.</p><p>They've made it clear, Microsoft has, that they believe they've got a better case on appeal.  Well, let's just get it to appeal.</p><p>But D.C. court has -- Court of Appeals has on prior cases ruled on cases similar to this more in Microsoft's favor.  So I think that there came a point where Microsoft, it became clear to them, that they just weren't going to win here and they were just going to do everything they could to build a record, as we lawyers say, so that when it went up on appeal they'd have the best -- they'd have the record possible.</p><p>You know, when you read this finding and this decision by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, I mean, it just -- it just drips, almost, I suspect with anger.  I really haven't read many with this.  It talks about how Microsoft is untrustworthy and disingenuous.  And you almost have this sense that while he writes about Microsoft, he's really talking about Gates.</p><p>And it's a very unusual and a very harshly written opinion.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  Thank you very much, Roger.  Roger Cossack, joining us from Washington.</p><p>We want to go back to the Instinet, where Microsoft has resumed trading after being halted in after-hours action, and bring in Pat Kiernan.</p><p>And Pat, what's going on?</p><p>KIERNAN: Terry, the stock's been open for about three minutes now, and we're seeing Microsoft trading at 71: the first few trades after it reopened at 70 3/4.  That was up a quarter from where the stock closed at 4 o'clock.</p><p>Now, the last trade, just 30 seconds ago, I'm told, that Microsoft traded at 71.  So not a big move.  We are in-line with the 4 o'clock close, and we are continuing to see the competitors of Microsoft trading very much in-line where they closed at 4 o'clock as well.</p><p>KEENAN: All right.  Still, I think those long-suffering Microsoft investors are at least happy to see the stock above 70 for the first time in a few weeks.</p><p>KIERNAN: And it looks like it is for the moment stable in that range.  We haven't seen a lot of volume cross since the stock reopened, but we will keep following.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  Thank you, Pat.</p><p>And just ahead, we'll have some final thoughts on this historic day in the corporate world.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: And I'm rejoined here at the New York Stock Exchange by Phil Dow of Dain Rauscher Wessels and John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University.</p><p>And Jack, you know, Microsoft all along has been very defiant in this case, and even said, you know, a breakup would be reckless beyond belief.</p><p>Do you think the company, Bill Gates in particular, perhaps regrets pursuing such an aggressive strategy against the Justice Department? COFFEE: Well,we could find that it was a strategic blunder not to accept mediation in front of Judge Posner, because his proposed remedies involved only conduct sanctions and not divestiture.  And that will be one of those calls that will be looked at for the next decade.</p><p>KEENAN: Phil, your final thoughts: Is this a market-moving event?</p><p>DOW: I don't believe this is a market-moving event, but it's not a zero-sum game.  These companies -- if Microsoft is split up, I still think they'll have opportunities to innovate and make profits.</p><p>KEENAN: And the technology sector: Some people attribute the decline in the Nasdaq in part to the aggressive stance that the Justice Department has taken against, which is arguably one of the most successful companies of this generation.</p><p>DOW: Well, my guess is you'll see other companies innovate, that it's a competitive world.  Competition breeds great business models that tend to survive.  My guess is that this is going to be a process that goes on for some time.  Microsoft ends up, I think, surviving and doing well.</p><p>KEENAN: Jack, will this breakup be different than the breakup of AT&amp;T, which was easily divided, fairly easily divided into seven different businesses, because there were already the seven regional Bell operating companies?</p><p>COFFEE: Well, start with the word \"if.\" If there is a breakup -- I personally expect a remanned and very much complicated further proceedings.  But if there was a breakup, it's much harder, because this is a horizontal breakup rather than a vertical divestiture.</p><p>KEENAN: And so there will -- it's not a natural split if indeed we do see one.</p><p>COFFEE: This was a very integrated company, and that's the integration that's been separated.</p><p>KEENAN: You like Microsoft shares here.  Do you think they can return to their old highs?</p><p>DOW: I do.  I think it's going to be fits and starts for a while.  But I think this is a great management.  Whether it's split up or not, this company will find opportunities to grow the business.</p><p>KEENAN: If you're an investor and the company is indeed broken up, do you follow Bill?  Do you go to the company that he decides to go with?</p><p>DOW: I think you keep all the pieces, and then watch each piece give financial guideposts and watch how they deliver on those.</p><p>KEENAN: OK.  We want to take you back down to Washington at the Justice Department.  There you see Attorney General Janet Reno.  Let's listen in.</p><p>(JOINED IN PROGRESS)</p><p>JANET RENO, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: As you know, the court has just announced in the -- its remedy in the Microsoft case.  I'm pleased that the court has ordered a strong, effective remedy to address the serious antitrust violations that Microsoft has committed.</p><p>The court's remedy strikes the right balance.  The structural remedy will stimulate competition that will have a lasting impact on this important industry.  In the interim, conduct relief will ensure that Microsoft cannot break the law while the structural provisions are taking effect.</p><p>Today's ruling will have a profound impact not only by promoting competition in the software industry, but also by reaffirming the importance of antitrust law enforcement in the 21st century and the importance of competition.</p><p>I am so very proud of all the hard work and efforts of this team. With the remarkable trial work of David Boies and Phil Malone, all the other attorneys from the San Francisco field office, the paralegals, the computer technicians and others.</p><p>Joel, your team has demonstrated once again that the Department of Justice can meet any challenge in discharging our duty to enforce the law and it's a great feeling.  Your efforts will protect competition and ensure that consumers have more choices and improved products in the marketplace.</p><p>I also want to tell the attorneys general how happy I am you're here today.  Tom Miller and Dick Blumenthal are representing the state attorneys general who have worked so well and so tirelessly on this case.  The cooperation of federal and state law enforcement has been superb.</p><p>And, Joel, thank you for your leadership, your vision, your absolute determination which have provided the American people with an outstanding example of the legal system at its best.</p><p>Joel?</p><p>JOEL KLEIN, U.S. ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good afternoon. First, let me thank you, Attorney General Reno, for your comments and for your unwavering support and leadership throughout this entire case.</p><p>The court's order today is the right remedy for Microsoft's serious and repeated violations of the antitrust laws.  It will stimulate competition in the PC operating system market and throughout the entire computer industry.</p><p>When the remedy is implemented -- and this is the key point -- customers, consumers in a free and competitive marketplace will decide for themselves what software they want to purchase.  Neither a monopolist nor the government will dictate that choice. The court had an extraordinary record upon which to enter today's order.  Judge Jackson had this case before him for more than two years.  He heard all the testimony and arguments and reviewed thousands and thousands of documents during the 78-day trial.  He carefully weighed the evidence and made extraordinarily detailed findings of fact.  He analyzed the legal precedents and issued lengthy conclusions of law.</p><p>He found that Microsoft had repeatedly abused its monopoly power and violated the law by crushing emerging threats to Windows' dominance and specifically by increasing the barriers to entry into the PC operating system market.</p><p>The remedy the court ordered, breaking Microsoft into a operating systems company and an applications company, is fair and it's measured.  Indeed, it directly flows from the extensive findings and legal conclusions that the court had previously entered.  That's what the law requires and that's what Judge Jackson did.</p><p>Sustained abuse of monopoly power is among the most serious and most damaging of all antitrust violations, since it eliminates the competition that creates innovation and choice in the marketplace.</p><p>Microsoft repeatedly used its operating system monopoly to eliminate threats posed by cross-platform software products, cross- platform products that would have essentially allowed other operating systems to compete with Windows.</p><p>The divestiture will give the applications company every incentive to develop precisely those kinds of cross-platform products on its own, and to make the key Office productivity suite available for other operating systems.  All of this will stimulate competition and innovation.</p><p>And the interim restrictions on the operating systems company are needed to permit competition to emerge.  They are narrowly tailored to prohibit Microsoft from repeating the past illegal actions.</p><p>And three years after divestiture is implemented, all of the interim conduct provisions will terminate.  All that will remain are provisions to stop the two companies from colluding with one another. By then, competition, not regulation, will limit Microsoft's power to thwart innovation.</p><p>After divestiture, I expect both companies will be vibrant, strong and successful firms.  Each will be free to create new, exciting products, and they will have every incentive to compete vigorously with one another and with others in this industry.  That competition will benefit America's consumers and the entire economy.</p><p>I'm very proud of the antitrust division for the extraordinary work done by our entire team in assembling the evidence, presenting it to the court and preparing and submitting our remedy.  These people, starting with David Boies and Phil Malone -- and David unfortunately could not be here today because he has trial proceedings in Florida -- these people have demonstrated a fact that is forgotten all too frequently today, and that is that government service can be a noble calling in which dedicated men and women work hard, usually with little or no recognition, to enforce our country's laws and to protect the public interest.  America is in their debt.</p><p>I also want to pay tribute to my friends, Attorney General Tom Miller and Dick Blumenthal and their colleagues in the states.  They, too, are dedicated public servants, and we have worked well together to enforce the laws over these many months.</p><p>And in closing, I want to stress that Microsoft itself is responsible for where things stand today.</p><p>Its repeated illegal actions were the results of decisions made at the highest levels of the company over a lengthy and sustained period of time that reflected defiance of, not respect for, the rule of law.  Today's decision marks an important step in addressing the serious effects of Microsoft's illegal actions and requiring the company to obey the law.</p><p>And Tom, it's my pleasure to turn it over to you.</p><p>TOM MILLER, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF IOWA: Thank you, Joel.  And of course I want to start by paying tribute and acknowledging the extraordinary courage and incredible work by Attorney General Reno, Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, the legendary David Boies, the incredibly hard working Phil Malone, and everybody else on the federal team.  They were a great team.</p><p>And I also want to acknowledge my 18 colleagues and their staffs in the states.  We're a terrific team, too.</p><p>And I want to particularly mention two people that were our lead counsels during this two-year period: Steve Houck (ph) from New York and Kevin O'Connor (ph) of Wisconsin.</p><p>Together, as the judge referred in his opinion, the collective effort of the senior officials at the Department of Justice and the 19 states brought forward a good product.</p><p>We worked hard.  I believe we worked in the public interest, and I believe we did our best.</p><p>Today's opinion -- today's order by Judge Jackson, I believe is strong, but yet fair and measured.  And that combination, strong, fair and measured, produces a good remedy.</p><p>It's strong, because it does break up the company into two companies.  It's strong in certain aspects of the conduct relief, but yet it's fair.</p><p>It's fair for a number of reasons, let me mention two.  One is Microsoft had a lot of warning.  They had the FTC proceeding.  They had the consent decree proceeding, and then as Judge Jackson found, in spite of that, they had repeated serious violations.</p><p>The other reason it's fair is because what the evidence showed that Microsoft, when they were confronted with important and perhaps difficult competition, their resort was to their monopoly; to use that in an illegal way to maintain that monopoly or to use it in other ways.  It was not reaching for a better product or for innovation.  It was reaching for that crutch -- that illegal crutch.  So it's fair in that situation.</p><p>And it's measured, because, as was discussed in the May 24 hearing, it could have been more, it could have been stronger, it could have been three companies, it could have been broken up into the baby Bills, but this is the least intrusive of the divestitures that are possible.  And that has two important consequences in its measured qualities.</p><p>One is that the question of compatibility that some consumers rightly are very concerned about is not put in jeopardy. And secondly, it maintains the highest possible shareholder value, probably increases shareholder value in the opinion of many experts.</p><p>I looked at the Wall Street Journal yesterday.  It showed what happened to AT&amp;T when it was broken up and the enormous increase in shareholder value.  That potential is here as well.</p><p>It's the right remedy because of those qualities: strong, fair and measured.  Right for consumers.  Consumers always benefit by competition, they never benefit by monopoly.  Consumers, most of all, will have greater choice, they'll have additional products, they may pay lower prices.  They probably will have better service.</p><p>KEENAN: All right, you have been listening to the team that spearheaded the U.S. government's case against Microsoft from the Justice Department, a news conference that began with Attorney General Janet Reno wholeheartedly endorsing Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision this afternoon to break Microsoft into two separate companies.  The attorney general saying that such a move would boost competition in the software industry; other Justice Department lawyers saying that it would stimulate innovation and that both companies if indeed there were to be a divestiture after appeal, both companies would be vibrant and successful firms.</p><p>We now want to go back to Washington and our Steve Young, who of course has been following this case all along.  And, Steve, to listen to some of the Justice Department lawyers, it sort of sounds like parents scolding a bad child when they speak about Microsoft here?</p><p>YOUNG: That's right, Terry.  They regard Microsoft as a recidivist.  It occurred to me as I was listening Microsoft was the world's biggest software company.  If it holds up on appeal, it no longer will be; that will be IBM.  Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the man who did this, left the courthouse at about 5:00 straight up Eastern Time with nary a word, he got into his car, and he drove away. He has started the clock ticking. Microsoft has four months from today, no matter what else happens, to come up with a plan to reorganize itself as the government used to say.  Now they use the divestiture word, and it has 90 days before further proceedings in this matter -- Terry. KEENAN: All right, thank you very much, Steven.  We should just quickly stress that no breakup is imminent.  Microsoft does have the right to appeal that portion of this before there are any breakup was put into effect.  That's going to do it for our coverage from the New York Stock Exchange on judgment day for Microsoft.  For CNN viewers, INSIDE POLITICS is up next.  And on CNNfn, \"THE N.E.W.

Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay.</p><p>BAY: Good evening, and welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>We begin tonight with a supercharged tech rally on Wall Street. The Nasdaq gained ground for the seventh time in eight sessions.  Even more impressive, stocks today were able to build on yesterday's huge gains that followed the Fed's surprise rate cut.  If Alan Greenspan was holding out to achieve maximum impact, it appears he succeeded.</p><p>The Nasdaq today surged another 5 percent, or 102 points, to 2,182, on volume of nearly 2.8 billion shares.  And that tech tide helped lift blue chips.  After an up-and-down day, the Dow posted a late charge to end 77 points higher at 10,693.</p><p>The upswing extended to the broader market, the S&amp;P 500 gaining 15 points, or more than 1 percent.  The recent run-up in techs is so strong, it has some on Wall Street wondering if this is the birth of a new bull market.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If Alan Greenspan was the catalyst for Wall Street's mid-week bull run, technology profits were the force behind the follow-through.</p><p>Strong reports from IBM, Apple Computer, and Advanced Micro Devices sent investors on a tech buying spree.  Chip stocks like PMC Sierra soared 8, while Applied Materials jumped 5.  But it was strength in tech stocks across the board that encouraged many observers.</p><p>JIM GLICKENHAUS, GLICKENHAUS &amp; CO.: Some of the information we're getting out of Intel, out of Altera, out of other tech companies is saying maybe, maybe, maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel. I'm more hopeful.</p><p>LISOVICZ: That improving sentiment has been apparent for most of this month, propelling the Nasdaq 33 percent higher from its April 4th low, which, by some yardsticks, confirms the onset of a bull market.</p><p>MICHAEL BALOG, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: That's very much reminiscent of the bullish days that you saw a lot in the '90s -- the sense that people are around to buy stocks on the weakness is back a little bit in the marketplace.</p><p>LISOVICZ: And some of the biggest beneficiaries of recent buying: Apple Computer up 83 percent from its 52-week low.  EMC up 70 percent.  Oracle up 54 percent, and IBM up 33 percent.</p><p>But the index which measures most tech stocks, the Nasdaq composite, is still down nearly 12 percent year-to-date, and off nearly 57 percent since its high last March.</p><p>JOE BATTIPAGLIA, GRUNTAL &amp; CO.: There are those who are looking for a capitulation to come into the market, for a huge bear sentiment, etcetera, etcetera.  But I like to point out that we've had one of the most destructive losses of paper capital, $4 trillion, over the last year, which is indeed pain and suffering, no matter how you want to define it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LISOVICZ: Some analysts say investors were waiting for two pieces of the puzzle to come together: signs that the economy wasn't falling off a cliff, and evidence that there is demand for products and services that tech companies provide.</p><p>Investors got what they were waiting for this week with the Fed's intervention and some solid corporate earnings, but there are still plenty of more report cards in the offing that could quickly undo that newfound optimism -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Yeah, a note of caution.  Thank you.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Sure.</p><p>BAY: Well, more good news for the tech sector came after the bell when Microsoft blew past a Street forecast.  The software titan said it earned 44 cents a share, or nearly $2.5 billion in the quarter.</p><p>In after-hours action, Microsoft is up more than 3.5, at 71.70, after gaining more than $2 in the regular session.</p><p>Now, Steve Young has been listening to the conference call, and he joins us now -- Steve.</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, Microsoft didn't exactly beat its breast in triumph, but it had reason to crow, and the company does say it's pleased.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG (voice-over): In its latest financial results, Microsoft scored a respectable triple, but hardly a home run.  Its earnings were two cents better than expected.  Sales gained 14 percent, a bit more than many had thought.  And the outlook was somewhat reassuring, but the company cautioned that could change.  And new business isn't picking up as fast as before.</p><p>GREG VOGEL, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: They knocked the cover off the ball, is a very positive quarter.  It's still slower growth than what, over the last few years, Microsoft has been growing at. But that's to be expected.</p><p>YOUNG: The economic slowdown is hurting chip and PC companies, but Microsoft benefited from the sale of software upgrades for computers already sold.  It said results were strong across all businesses, especially growing demand for Windows 2000 and its server software for the business community.</p><p>Looking ahead, the company projects sales in its next and final quarter of its fiscal year will be flat to slightly down, which could mean sales will grow about only 10 percent this year.  But Microsoft is usually conservative, and results might top that.</p><p>MARK HERSKOVITZ, DREYFUS PREMIER FUNDS: They're going to come out with a new operating system, Windows XP.  The outloook is good there.  We've heard promising comments from Dell, from Intel, that there is some increase in demand for PCs.  That's very, very helpful to Microsoft.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: On its conference call, the company said, though, the ad market is soft, it's racked up single-digit growth in online ad dollars.  And it claimed its dot-net strategy to be a power seller of Internet services, is gaining developer support, and buying share -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Steve, what about cautionary notes?  Any at all?</p><p>YOUNG: Almost none.  CFO John Conner was asked about the general economy.  He said if it doesn't pick up even more, there may be a slower uptake, but he did not seem overly concerned.</p><p>BAY: Interesting.  Steve Young, thanks.</p><p>After the after-hours, the news was not all positive.  Nortel Networks announced that it lost 12 cents a share, or $385 million in the quarter, in line with forecasts.  But the Canadian Telecom equipment supplier said it would cut an additional 5,000 jobs on top of previously announced layoffs of 15,000.</p><p>And more bad news from Gateway, which reported a first-quarter loss of $503 million and took a charge of more than a half billion dollars.  The PC maker said it expected to break even in the second quarter and get back to profitability in the second half of the year. Neither stock, though, making much of a move after hours.</p><p>But for now, tech investors have been focused on the positive. As of today, the Nasdaq has surged 33 percent over the past sessions. So are tech stocks out of the woods?  For some perspective, we are joined by Ron Hill, equity strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.</p><p>Ron, welcome.</p><p>RONALD HILL, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN: Nice to be here, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Did the Fed cut yesterday officially usher in a bull market?</p><p>HILL: I think they sort of got us all started here.  We would have liked to see more volume, I think, on the New York Stock Exchange in a big, sort of more breadth, nine-to-one kind of day.</p><p>BAY: That volume is something you've been looking for for a while, correct?</p><p>HILL: Indeed.  So we were hoping to get more.  And again, today, volume was off a little bit, but the price action's been pretty good. It's always nice to close at the highs of the day.</p><p>BAY: So are you saying yes?</p><p>HILL: I'm saying -- yes, I think the bottom has been made.  I'm not sure that the first big upthrust of the bull market is still somewhere out in front of us.</p><p>BAY: And other than volume, what do we need to see to get us to that first big the upthrust?</p><p>HILL: A lot of Positive breadths.  A lot of positive breadths. Nine to one, upside volume to downside volume on a good day would really mean that the whole emphasis has gone on the buy side.  The sellers are in retreat, essentially.</p><p>BAY: What do you think it'll take for us to get to that breadth?</p><p>HILL: Well, we're starting to get through the earning season. We're getting more good news than we had before.  So we priced in too much bad news, Now we're pricing in some good news.  But like we said earlier in the program, there are still more earnings to come, and they're starting to get -- the good stuff comes out early.  The bad stuff tends to come later, so let's see if we can get into that.</p><p>BAY: As Susan was saying, a note of caution, because we've had quite a number of bright spots.  But overall, obviously, the earnings picture this quarter is bleak? HILL: Indeed.  Down over double digits, relative to year over year, and probably still going to be pretty bleak in the second quarter.  I think when we get the second-quarter earnings, we're going to start getting guidance that things are indeed getting better and that things are on the upswing.  The economy will be doing better. That's when I think people will really get convinced.  But we'll probably be buying ahead of that.</p><p>BAY: You'll be buying ahead of that.  And actually, your outlook is quite positive.  You expect the S&amp;P to, what, hit -- is it 1,450 by the end of the year?</p><p>HILL: 1,450 by the end of the year.  That's about 30 percent off the lows.</p><p>BAY: So why so positive?</p><p>HILL: Well, when they get a big liquidity lift, and when Fed has these -- generates a lot of new cash into this economy, that liquidity comes under this market like a fuel, and you get sort of a lift-off day.  And that's usually good for 30 percent off the bottom in the first year.  That gets you to 1,450, and that's a poor-quality market. Often, the average is 40 percent gains in the first year.</p><p>BAY: So what should investors be doing?  You said you were going to be buying ahead of a turnaround.  Is that what you think investors should be doing?</p><p>HILL: Indeed.  I think you should be getting your position -- your portfolio more cyclically orientated.  That means looking at some retailers, looking at early cyclical technology stocks, like semiconductor equipment makers and semiconductors.  Maybe some software as well.</p><p>BAY: All right.  So give us some names, some retailers that you like.</p><p>HILL: Retailers -- Lowe's, for example, in the home-building area.  We also like BJ's, the sort of warehouse retailer.  And for high growths, or department store, Kohl's will be a nice one.</p><p>BAY: Kohl's is a name that actually comes up often.</p><p>And then what about in the techs?  You said semis and software?</p><p>HILL: Yes, and the equipment makers.  Applied Materials, KLA- Tencor have been on fire in this rally.  They should be leading you into a whole big tech outperformance.  They're starting to do that.</p><p>BAY: We know where you come down in this whole chip debate.</p><p>HILL: Yes, yes, we think it's going to turn very, very nice here within the next six months or so.</p><p>BAY: Ron Hill, thanks for joining us.</p><p>HILL: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Next on MONEYLINE: a good news, bad news report from Sun Microsystems, beating estimates on profits, but missing on sales. Bruce Francis will take a look for us.</p><p>A brighter picture for Sun's arch rival: inside Microsoft, after the bell report, and the dramatic late-day reaction.  We'll talk with Veteran Executive Bob Herbold.</p><p>And, New York, racing against time to prevent a replay of the California power crisis.  Will they succeed?  We'll have a special report.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Wrapping some of tonight's major profit reports: McDonald's suffering from lingering mad cow concerns, profits there tumbling 16 percent.  This marks the second consecutive quarter of decline for McDonald's bottom line.  Still, CEO Jack Greenberg says he's \"cautiously optimistic\" for a recovery this year.</p><p>Profits plunged at Ford, but following in the footsteps of rival GM, the auto maker did beat expectations.  Sears met lowered estimates, but the retailer warned profits will continue to decline in the second quarter.</p><p>Data storage king EMC also met lowered expectations.  Profits, which surged more than 50 percent last year, climbed a less impressive 20 percent to about 400 million.</p><p>A surprise report from Xerox: the beleaguered copier wasn't expected to reveal its numbers until later this month.  Xerox posted a narrower-than-expected loss, and said it expects to climb back to profitability this year.</p><p>Checking investor reaction: McDonald's, Ford and Sears all lost ground, while EMC added more than 6, and Xerox jumped over $2, or nearly 40 percent.</p><p>And another closely watched report came after the bell: Sun Microsystems.  It issued quarterly numbers that left tech analysts scratching their heads.  At first glance, Sun seemed to beat the Street by one penny, earning eight cents a share, or $263 million, a 43 percent drop from one year ago.  But one penny of that came from an accounting change.</p><p>In after-hours activity, Sun off a penny, although it was down as much as $1.  It's been a rough year for Sun stock, down by about two- thirds from its high.</p><p>Bruce Francis listened in on the company's conference call, and has a close look at the numbers.  Tell us about it, Bruce.</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Sun is clearly not celebrating this end of the tech recession here. Sun met reduced financial targets by slashing costs, including pay for employees.  Now, since many employees get paid on how Sun performs, those costs dropped as Sun's revenue growth rate dropped to polar temperature levels.  As for the outlook, many clouds remain. Sun says it isn't calling the bottom yet in its business, unlike competitor H-P.  Sun believes that earnings per share will be flat or down in the current quarter, Sun's fourth.  Until now, analysts were expecting 10 cents a share.</p><p>For fiscal 2002, which begins in June, Sun sees revenue growth of just 15 percent, less than half of what the company was pumping out at the beginning of the current fiscal year.  But Sun says that lower growth will come mostly in the back half.  That means that Sun is expecting continued weak business condition for much of the next eight months.</p><p>Now, analysts say that could -- emphasize \"could\" -- blunt some of the recent enthusiasm for Sun stock.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE ELLING, LEHMAN BROTHERS: The stock has rallied lately. And I guess -- I mean, I basically thought that they would have to guide down numbers, it was a question of how much.  And they did guide down, and they're now looking for only 15 percent growth next year, and that's all going to come in the second half.  So, it is going to be somewhat of a sober mood.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: Sun says that it itself is no exception to the trends that are causing their customers to hold back on purchases.  CEO Scott McNealy said on that conference call that he too is cutting back on some of Sun's technology projects.  So, sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</p><p>BAY: Now, you noted, Bruce, that H-P did call a bottom and Sun did not.  So, what does that mean?</p><p>FRANCIS: I think we can be too soon in saying, this was it. Nevertheless, Sun (sic) marketed heavily to telecom and Internet companies.  Those were the biggest drops in spending.  Sun might be a different case, I think the jury is still going to be out on this one.</p><p>BAY: The jury is still going to be out, and what do we need to see to get a sense of conviction about this from Sun?</p><p>FRANCIS: I think you need them to come out and say: \"OK, we've finally seen a bottom, we are really beginning to see a turnaround. We see less hesitation by big corporate customers on buying.\" Haven't seen that yet.</p><p>BAY: In other words, you need a bit of a consensus out there on this?</p><p>FRANCIS: You need a consensus, exactly. BAY: Bruce Francis, thanks.</p><p>Coming up: the Mississippi keeps on rising, threatening levees in several states.  We'll get the latest on flood conditions with a live report.</p><p>Plus, we'll hear from a Microsoft executive Bob Herbold on what drove the software titan past analysts' forecasts.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"Tech Watch\": some late-breaking news from E- bay.  The online auctioneer posted a surge in profits, beating the Street by three cents a share, while revenues nearly doubled $154 million.  Topping off the good news, E-bay raised revenue guidance for the second and third quarters, saying the economic downturn is not slowing its growth.  In after-hours trading, the stock is up sharply, gaining more than 3 to $53.25.</p><p>Just ahead: Mr. Greenspan works his magic on Wall Street, but is he too late to save the economy?  We'll talk to one economic forecaster who says we're headed for a recession, and there's nothing the Fed can do about it.</p><p>Plus: the latest on flood conditions along the Mississippi, how the levees there are holding up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: As we mentioned, Microsoft powered past market forecasts for both profits and revenue.  The company said it earned 44 cents a share, 2 cents ahead of forecasts on a nearly 3 percent rise in profits, and a big rise in revenue, up 14 percent from one year ago.</p><p>Microsoft stock, which has had a rough year, has recovered much of its lost ground.  It's up more than $3 in after hours trading.  In tonight's tech watch we are joined by Microsoft's Bob Herbold, from the company's offices in Redmond, Washington.</p><p>Bob, welcome back.</p><p>BOB HERBOLD, MICROSOFT: Hi, Willow.</p><p>BAY: You had good news on both the top and the bottom line.  The PC sector is still, as far as we can tell, struggling.  So how did you do it?</p><p>HERBOLD: I have to tell you, we have a very broad-based business at this point, and we're benefiting from that.  Many of the other companies that you report on regularly are focused more on the dot-com industry or the telecommunications industry, and we're pretty broad. And we saw good growth on all components of our business, so it was a solid quarter.</p><p>BAY: So, do you see signs out there of PC demand picking up, or would you at least say the worst is over? HERBOLD: We'd probably say that, at least for this quarter, that things have stabilized a bit.  We saw a little more health on the business side than on the consumer side, which is a change and we think a positive one.  But we want to be conservative as we look out into the future, to make sure we're not jumping no inappropriate conclusions here in terms of our business.  But it was a good quarter.</p><p>BAY: Last quarter you described your near term outlook as guarded.  So, how would you describe it now?</p><p>HERBOLD: Well, I think we're always guarded.  We want to make sure we're looking at the business in a conservative way so we're not surprised and you're not surprised in terms of what we turn up.  But we think our estimates for the next quarter and next fiscal year are sound.  We're viewing the PC business as reasonably more healthy in the next fiscal year compared to what we saw this year.</p><p>BAY: You trimmed Q4, though, did you not?</p><p>HERBOLD: I beg your pardon.</p><p>BAY: Did you trim the fourth quarter?</p><p>HERBOLD: Slightly.  But from a revenue standpoint it's about where we indicated it would be back in December when we adjusted things for this quarter that we just reported on as well as next quarter, so I think that we were fortunate.  We had it fairly accurate back in December and we'll stick with that general range.</p><p>BAY: OK, now you were rather specific in some of your guidance going forward.  Does that man that the cloud has lifted and visibility is actually improving?</p><p>HERBOLD: Well, it is in terms of next fiscal year as we get closer to it.  On the other hand we have 25 percent of our fiscal year remaining for this fiscal year, so we want to be careful.  We're getting close to understanding better where the PC business might lie, and that helps us out.</p><p>BAY: Bob Herbold, thanks for joining us after a solid report today.</p><p>HERBOLD: Thanks very much, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Thanks, Bob.</p><p>The Mississippi today continued to rise toward flood levels, threatening to overwhelm levees and inundate homes along hundreds of miles of river.  For the latest, we're joined from Prairie Du Chien, Wisconsin, by CNN's Bob Franken -- Bob?.</p><p>BOB FRANKEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, behind me is the Mississippi river.  The problem it's not supposed to be anywhere near behind me.  It's suppose to be several hundred yards over there.  But it's overflowed its banks.  We're expecting that it's going to crest here, in Prairie du Chien, tonight and head on down river threatening next, probably Davenport, Iowa.</p><p>Now the governor of Wisconsin, Scott McCallum, made a late afternoon tour of this area to announce that he was calling out the National Guard as needed.  There was a smattering of National Guard troops here who available as needed to help local officials. Meanwhile, the people here are, for the most part, trying to stay in their homes along the water.</p><p>They've put up huge amounts of sandbags, that create dikes to try to prevent the water from getting in and to back that up with pumps, keeping the water going.  They're hoping that they're be able to do it without leaving their homes, without severe water damage in their homes.</p><p>Officials say probably that there probably have been no more than 50 homes that have had any serious damage at all.  This was caused by a spring thaw that was the only thaw this year, a winter thaw that normally occurs in Wisconsin, did not happen.  That's what caused the upper Midwest to have the big rise of the Mississippi river.</p><p>This is considered the second biggest flood of the Mississippi since 1965.  That was a record setting year, and one of the reasons there have been as few problems as there have been, is that people learned a lot of lessons.  They've built proper levees and that type of thing.  One problem about Davenport, Iowa, it doesn't have that kind of levy -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: And, Bob, what about the weather there, are they going to catch a break?</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, they hope they catch at break.  There're some showers predicted.  People feel it that it could be handled.  If there is more rain than predicted it could be a huge problem.</p><p>BAY: Bob Franken, thanks.</p><p>Coming up in the next half hour of MONEYLINE: More on today's power surgeon the tech sector, and late reaction to some after hours releases.</p><p>And the FCC eases the rules on who owns the networks.  We will check out what it may mean for some of the biggest names in the media business.</p><p>Plus the verdict is in for the man in the hot seat.  We will check out the popular reaction to Alan Greenspan after the Fed's surprise rate cut.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines: Microsoft's sales and profits top estimates, and the stock takes off in after hours trading.  And the Nasdaq shows no signs of slowing down, the index tacking on an another 5 percent to yesterday's 8 percent run-up.  So, Is the bull back?</p><p>Plus, if you hear \"power crisis\" you probably think of California, but not so fast.  New York City may find itself in the same boat this summer.  We'll take a look.</p><p>But first, momentum continues on Wall Street, sending the Dow and Nasdaq higher for the third day in a row.  The Nasdaq spent the entire session in the plus column, fueled in part by strength in chips and software.  The Index finished up 102 points to 2,182.  With today's strong move, the Nasdaq is up 33 percent since hitting a two-year low on April 4.</p><p>The Dow struggled a bit throughout the session, but managed to close on the plus side, thanks to solid performances by IBM, Microsoft, Procter and Gamble, and Intel.  The broader market pulled out a win for the day as well, closing up 15 points to 1,253.</p><p>The 10-year stock plunged more than a point, while the 30-year tumbled nearly 2.  The yield there falling to 5.80 percent.</p><p>So, is this advance in stocks the beginning of a real bull run or is it a suckers rally?  Terry Keenan takes a look in tonight's behind the numbers -- Terry.</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, spring forward, fall back?  That is what many people are asking these days on Wall Street after the markets incredible early April run.  While the jury is still out on whether this upside explosion is really the start of something big, the two week surge in the Nasdaq is unprecedented.</p><p>In the 11 trading sessions since April 4, the Nasdaq has risen 33 percent.  Never before has the index risen so far, so fast in its 30 year history.  Prior to this month, the most explosive rally began in October of 1998, when the index gained 30 percent in 22 trading sessions.</p><p>Now, in both cases, the rallies were spurred by a surprise interest rate cut by the Fed.  One reason why many believe that this April run does have legs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT WALBERG, BRIEFING.COM: We're seeing stock rallies in the face of what is considered disappointing earnings news.  I think this is over and now, the fear factor, which has been driving the market, the big fear is, missing out on this rally, which is why I think you will see a lot of investors pouring money into the tech sector into the next couple weeks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEENAN: Well, in fact, some big names have even out-paced the Nasdaq in performance this month.  Yahoo! up 75 percent since early April; AOL up 47 percent; Charles Schwab up 45 percent; Cisco up 38 percent.</p><p>Nevertheless, many traders do remain skeptical of this rally. Short, sharp rallies in bear markets are the norm, rather that the exception.  The 13 percent gain in the S&amp;P this month is much more inline with the typical bear market bounce, which generally averages about 10 percent.  In addition, the Nasdaq has been so volatile in recent years.  Historical comparisons are tough to make.  Still, this rally so far puts other bear market snap backs to shame, and few are ready to dismiss it just yet -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Fair enough.  Terry Keenan.  Thanks</p><p>And the action continues in after hours trading.  Jen Rogers has the details from the Instinet trading floor.</p><p>Jen, a busy night?</p><p>JEN ROGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A very busy night.  Let's start with Microsoft.  Nearly 6 million shares changing hands on Microsoft. The stock moved up more than $4 to $72.30.  Very active trading.  They came up, beating the Street by 2 cents a share.  Revenue is up 14 percent from a year ago.  Outlook was also solid, although they did trim fourth quarter earning results.  That did not hold the stock back here in after hours.</p><p>In fact, the Microsoft news really giving legs on to other stocks here.  Sun Microsystems moving up $.34 to $21.05.  This is a comeback in after hours.  It was down more than a dollar initially after we got the earning news from Sun.  Originally, it looked like they beat the Street by a penny, but because of an accounting change, they were basically in line.</p><p>The outlook was not bullish, but the stock was able to move up here, 34 cents.  Ebay, another one to the upside, up $3 to $53.10. The online auction company coming out and beating the Street by 3 cents and also beating the revenue number.</p><p>Nortel came out and met lowered expectations of 12 cents -- that was a loss of 12 cents a share.  The stock moved up $.35.  The company also said it was cutting an additional 5,000 jobs, making that a total of 20,000 jobs cut by midyear.  Overall, Dell, Oracle, Intel and Cisco on the upside.  And most of that, people are saying is on the Microsoft news -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: All right, Jen.  A lot going on.  Jen Rogers, thanks.</p><p>A day after the Fed slashed interest rates, the treasury secretary left Washington to speak before the Economic Club of New York.  But he was focused more on tax cuts than the economy. Secretary O'Neill said he believed the House and Senate next week would come together on a tax cut number close to the president's request of $1.6 trillion.  When could tax relief become a reality? Well, one of our reporters caught up with the secretary after the speech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: Sir, how soon can the administration deliver on a tax cut?</p><p>PAUL O'NEILL, TREASURY SECRETARY: Hopefully, before the first of June. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAY: Paul O'Neill was generally tight-lipped about the economy which he described as quote \"stable.\" The treasure secretary thinks it's stable.  Our guest tonight says, don't believe it.  He believes we're in a recession and Alan Greenspan is way too late. Lakshman Achuthan of Economic Cycle Research joins us.</p><p>Lakshman, welcome.  We're in a recession or headed to a recession?</p><p>LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN, ECONOMIC CYCLE RESEARCH: Recession is in front of us.  If it started now or next month, it doesn't really matter.</p><p>BAY: You say it's unavoidable.  Why?</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Unavoidable.  Well, what we do is we're watching leading indicators of the economy.  We're watching a very broad array of lead indexes.  And the patterns we're seeing in those indexes are consistent with a recession.  If there was not a recession in front of us, it would be unprecedented, given these indexes, and they do have a good record.</p><p>BAY: So, is it the indexes?  Or is it also particular data points that you can point to.  You know, the weak job numbers, for example.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Well, the weak job numbers are part of it.  That's part of the story going forward.  But that's not the whole story. Some people will say it's an inventory correction.  But it's bigger than that.</p><p>Each cycle has its own story.  We never know which indicator is the right one to watch.  That's why you watch indexes and that's why you watch a broad array.</p><p>BAY: Now, right now, this economy paints a somewhat confusing picture, in there's a little bit of the battle of the indexes going on.  Another index widely used and highly regarded, the Conference Board, says, we are not headed for a recession.  We are not in a recession.  So, are you saying that that index is calling this wrong?</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Well, I think the interpretation of that index is debatable.  That index was something that Jeffrey Moore, the founder, put together 30 years ago, and we've done a lot of work since then. Instead of looking at one index -- just like there's no Holy Grail -- there's no one indicator that's perfect.  There's no one index that's perfect.</p><p>We look at a broad array: 11 leading indexes for the overall economy for sectors heading down.  The lynch pin, which has been holding us up here, has been the consumer, as we all have been talking about. That we think will come under a lot of pressure, because unemployment will continue rising. BAY: So, you think, for example, the layoffs that we report on a near daily basis will catch up or soon be revealed in those numbers and will affect consumer confidence and consumer spending.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Basically, yes.  Those will be -- you announce a big layoff but then it takes a little while to happen.  And there are also lots of little layoffs going on that we're not announcing.</p><p>BAY: What about the market right now?  Investor confidence appears to have been restored.  Wouldn't that act as sort of a counter-balance?</p><p>ACHUTHAN: I think, to the extent you can have a pre-emptive move, or a quick move to restore investor confidence, like we've seen the Fed doing this doing this year, 200 basis points.  That's sending a message, and that helps.  It mitigates the downturn.  It would be worse if you didn't have that.  But I think the consumer confidence numbers you've seen slip so far, are related to equity markets being volatile, not to job markets being volatile.  That will be a different type of number you'll see going forward.</p><p>BAY: So, this aggressive rate action by the Fed cannot forestall the recession, but it will help with the recovery on\u2026</p><p>ACHUTHAN: What it does is helps mitigate the downturn.  It will not be as severe or as long as it would have otherwise been.  If we look at past recessions and see how the monetary policy worked then, you see it worked a little bit slower and we have longer recessions. This is quick.</p><p>BAY: How much more pain is headed in our direction?  Because, recession or not, this has been painful, it has been steep, and very quick, this decline.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Very quick.  And that may be part of the just in time information and these things that are new that the economy changes. But, I would say that you have to look at leading indicators.  The stock market is an imperfect leading indicator.  It may be saying, up, but we want to see other ones rise too.</p><p>BAY: Real quick -- how long?</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Not in the next few quarters.</p><p>BAY: Not in the next few quarters.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: No.  Until you see the weekly indicators move up.</p><p>BAY: Thank you for joining us</p><p>ACHUTHAN: OK.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE, the power crunch threatens to spread beyond California.  New York City scrambles to head off its own blackouts this summer.</p><p>And later: The word on the Street about the man at the Fed.  We take a look at the sometimes fragile image of Alan Greenspan.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: The California energy crisis has raised a question for every governor and mayor in America: could it happen here?  It's a real concern in New York City, which has suffered crippling blackouts in the past.  The city is now racing to construct a handful of small power plants before the summer heat sets in.  Peter Viles has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the South Bronx, a race against the clock to finish building this mini-power plant before summer heat waves could drive New York City into a power crises.</p><p>JOE LEARY, NEW YORK POWER AUTHORITY: Last summer, we may have simply dodged a bullet because of a cool, wet summer.  We don't want to take that chance again.</p><p>VILES: New power plants are just as unpopular in New York as they are in California.  Environmentalists are suing to stop the new plants, but the mayor of New York is determined to get them built.</p><p>MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI, NEW YORK CITY: They ask me, why do we need more generators?  And I said, long-term, because you want the lights to go on.  There's nothing for nothing in this life.</p><p>VILES: The underlying problem is that the city's economy has grown dramatically, but its power supply has not.</p><p>MICHAEL CLENDENIN, CON EDISON: The demand has grown over the last five years each year by about 170 megawatts.  One megawatt powers 1,000 homes.  So that's like having 170,000 new homes go up each year without any new power plants being built.</p><p>VILES: New York's power supply is a national issue.  It runs everything from the New York Stock Exchange, to the United Nations, to television networks, and its needs are awesome: the subway system alone consumes enough electricity to light up a city of 500,000 homes.</p><p>New York was crippled by blackouts in 1965 and 1977.  One legacy of those crises: the city is now required to produce 80 percent of the power it consumes.  And right now, the city does not have 80 percent of what it would need during a heat wave this summer.</p><p>GIULIANI: If you're asking me if there's a risk that we could have brownouts, or even worse than that this summer?  Yes.</p><p>VILES: Seven huge power plants are in the planning stage, but approval alone can take as long as 18 months.  In the meantime, the city is rushing to build 10 mini-power plants at six sites in a ring around Manhattan.</p><p>GIULIANI: This is an emergency.  I think the New York Power Authority, Governor Pataki, were correct to address it that way.</p><p>VILES: The generators are made by General Electric and cost roughly $25 million apiece.</p><p>(on camera): The advantage of these mini-generators is that they come pre-fabricated, so they can be assembled and brought on-line in a real hurry.  At the beginning of the year, this site in the South Bronx was an empty lot.  In a couple of months, it will produce enough electricity to light a city of 80,000 people</p><p>(voice-over): The new plants do not guarantee, however, that the lights will stay on this summer.  The city's most recent power crisis two summers ago stemmed not from inadequate supply, but from breakdowns in the system that delivers power throughout the city.</p><p>Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, The Bronx, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Straight ahead on MONEYLINE: bearish on brokerages.  One analyst who says the stocks are overvalued.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In our \"Sector Focus\" tonight: brokerages.  The stocks were some of the biggest beneficiaries of yesterday's rate cut rally, but the euphoria didn't last.  Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Merrill, Lehman and others all fell today.</p><p>Part of the problem may have been some bearish words from UBS Warburg.  Analyst Diane Glossman downgraded the stock, saying: \"They can't be rated a buy if I'm not willing to buy them.\" Her reason? She says there is no sign of a pick up in business, and recent stock price gains don't reflect the fundamentals.  Topping it off, Ed Kerschner, chief strategist at UBS cut Merrill from his highlighted stock list.  Taking a look at those gains UBS finds so fearsome: the S&amp;P Brokerage Index has crushed the S&amp;P 500 this month, up almost 25 percent.</p><p>Still to come: big changes may be coming in who owns what along the television dial.  We'll check out how regulators are changing the rules on medial ownership.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Tomorrow on MONEYLINE: the bottom line on Big Blue, a rare tech company that seems to be riding out the high-tech storm.  What's the secret of IBM's continued success?  Tomorrow on MONEYLINE.</p><p>We have been hearing for months about the PC slump, and the latest quarterly report from Gartner DataQuest shows just how bad it really is.  The U.S. market contracted by 3 1/2 percent during the first quarter of the year.  It is the first contraction since Gartner began tracking quarterly trends back in 1993.  And a big development in the ongoing PC wars.  Dell has replaced Compaq as top PC maker worldwide. A victory of sorts for media companies.  The Federal Communications Commission has relaxed its rules on network ownership, a move that could save struggling smaller stations and could lead to major changes in the law in the future.  Allan Dodds Frank has the story from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It is a big victory for Viacom.  The Federal Communications Commission deciding to amend a 55-year-old rule to allow the consolidation of CBC and the struggling UPN network.  FCC Chairman Michael Powell said allowing Viacom to own two networks is likely to promote competitive efficiency and diversity.  Former FCC Chairman Richard Wiley, representing Viacom, said it was about the survival of UPN.</p><p>RICHARD WILEY, VIACOM ATTORNEY: The FCC did find that UPN has been losing money, and that there's a concern that if the dual network rule weren't changed, you might have a loss of the network.</p><p>FRANK: The 6-year-old UPN airs minority and niche shows, such as \"The Hughleys,\" \"Moesha,\" \"WWF Wrestling\" and \"Star Trek: Voyager.\" The FCC decision also would allow the WB network, owned by AOL Time Warner, parent of CNN, to merge with one of the four big networks.</p><p>SCOTT CLELAND, PRECURSOR GROUP: It is an early precursor to further relaxation of the broadcast ownership limits.  This is an indication of where we are going long-term.</p><p>FRANK: Consumer advocates condemned the decision.</p><p>HAROLD FELD, MEDIA ACCESS PROJECT: When you have two independent networks that are working against each other, they -- you know, are each trying to get each other's audiences.  When you have only one network with two different units, they are actually really careful not to really compete against each other.</p><p>FRANK: The FCC will next re-examine at ban of newspapers owning TV stations in the same market.</p><p>(on camera): While the FCC decision may herald a new era of relaxed rules, the commission noted it does not plan any change in the ban on mergers between the top four networks.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank, CNN Financial News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Up next: Alan Greenspan back in good graces.  Plus, our financial editor Myron Kandel and \"Ahead of the Curve.\" Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Taking a look at some of what could move the markets tomorrow: Wall Street reacts to tonight's after-the-bell earnings from Microsoft and Sun Micro.

Joining us now, Myron Kandel.</p><p>So, you think today is quite significant?</p><p>MYRON KANDEL, CNN FINANCIAL EDITOR: Oh, it really is, Willow, because coming off yesterday's majestic rally, you would expect the market to pull back, and it didn't.  Instead, it added to it.  You know, it was just last week that I was calling on Alan Greenspan to cut interest rates and do it sooner.  It took him five days to pay attention.</p><p>BAY: You weren't calling loud enough.</p><p>KANDEL: \u2026 but, obviously, Wall Street is very happy he did that.</p><p>BAY: And you actually mapped this out quite clearly.  You called a bottom, and then you said, what this market really needs is an interim rate cut by the Fed.</p><p>KANDEL: Well, you're right.  When the market bounced from that terrible day, the Dow did, the terrible day on March 22, from that point to today's close, the Dow is up 17 1/2 points.  OK?  The Nasdaq took a couple of weeks to bottom out.  April 4th was the bottom on the Nasdaq.  And as we reported, the Nasdaq is up 33 percent in 11 days. Those are amazingly fast moves in the market.</p><p>BAY: Fast moves, yes.  But Terry raised the question earlier, you know, is this a sucker's rally?  In bear markets we tend -- and certainly, in this one, we have seen these very short, fairly steep rallies.  Why isn't this one of those?</p><p>KANDEL: Well, but this rally has a lot behind it.  In addition to its magnitude, which is really unusual, it has four cuts by the Federal Reserve, and cuts by the Federal Reserve in interest rates lead to market rallies, and this one has happened, and it's going to stay up.</p><p>BAY: OK.  Myron Kandel, we'll take your word for it for the moment.  Thanks, Myron.</p><p>Finally tonight, you think your stocks have been soaring over the past few days?  Well, one beaten-down name has rocketed to a 52-week high, shares of Greenspan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY (voice-over): The Fed chief has won rave reviews for his surprise interest rate cut, getting a thumbs-up in the local New York press for pulling a bull market out of a hat.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STUART VARNEY, CNN ANCHOR: Tonight, job cuts at two tech giants: Nortel slashing 10,000 and Dell announcing its first layoffs ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILLOW BAY, CNN ANCHOR: Holding Amazon shares?  One analyst has one word of advice: sell.  We'll tell you why you don't hear that advice often on Wall Street.</p><p>VARNEY: Did Marc Rich conspire to buy a presidential pardon? That explosive question now at the heart of a criminal probe.</p><p>BAY: And, the revolving door in the corner office: top execs back in their old jobs to help a company in distress.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Live from coast to coast, this is MONEYLINE.</p><p>BAY: Welcome to MONEYLINE.  I'm Willow Bay in Los Angeles.</p><p>VARNEY: Hello, Willow, and hello, everyone, I'm Stuart Varney in New York.</p><p>BAY: Our top story: techs in trouble.  Disturbing news late in the day from Nortel, Hewlett-Packard and Dell.  We begin with an unprecedented move from Dell, one of the pioneers of the digital age.</p><p>America's biggest PC maker today said it was slashing 1,700 jobs: This is the first time Dell has cut its work force.  And then there was more bad news after the bell.  The company fell short of profit expectations that were lowered late last month.  The stock up during the regular session is down more than $1 in after hours trading. Bruce Francis has more on Dell in the doldrums -- Bruce.</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, Dell can't say when those doldrums will end.  Dell says that this quarter will be slightly weaker than analyst are expecting, and that beyond that, the company wouldn't provide any guidance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS (voice-over): The last hold out in the PC industry in layoffs, Dell gave in to declining PC growth rates and announced the firing of 1,700 people, the first layoffs in its 16-year history.</p><p>MICHAEL DELL, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, DELL COMPUTER: We had some excess facility and those combined together are the charters you see taken in the fourth quarter.</p><p>FRANCIS: A look at Dell's plummeting growth rates explains what the company is up against.  After growing at around 50 percent for years, Dell's sales increased just 26 percent this year, and estimates call for even less growth next year.  Analysts say the company has to adjust accordingly.</p><p>ROBERT CIHRA, ING BARINGS: It probably is a wise move, because heading in to a year where demand is certainly uncertain, at best, I think keeping your cost as low as possible is the smartest thing to do.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dell also reported earnings that were in line with lower projections, but still a penny short of what Wall Street analysts hoped for.  Revenue grew 28 percent.  But, as the company slashed prices in PCs, net income rose 16 percent.</p><p>CIHRA: The problem is, really the way Dell was able to really grow its top line, was through extremely aggressive pricing, and that cost 3 them about 3 points of margin, which I think is the issue going forward here.</p><p>FRANCIS: The PC business is so challenging right now that Dell won't forecast beyond the first quarter, the one we're in now.  Dell is projecting 5 percent less revenue and 10 percent less in earnings than analysts currently are expecting.</p><p>DELL: Our first quarter guidance is going to be about 8 billion in revenues and roughly 17 cents a share, which on a operating margin percent basis is pretty flat with the fourth quarter.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: Dell said in its earnings report that their performance was in stark contrast with that of the rest of the industry.  But that may be damning with faint praise.  As analyst Andy Neff likes to point out, Dell right now is the best house in a tough neighborhood -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, Bruce Francis reporting.  Thanks, Bruce.</p><p>Also struggling with sluggish PC sales: Hewlett-Packard.  After the bell, that company missed sales targets by more than $400 million. The company did meet already lowered expectations of 37 cents a share, down from a year ago.  And those revenues which fell short of analysts estimates, grew only 2 percent from a year ago.</p><p>Up nearly 2 points in the regular session, Hewlett-Packard down $1.85 in after hours trading.</p><p>Shares of Nortel plunging after hours.  Late today, the company said it will layoff as many as 10,000 employees.  That's an increase from the 4,000 originally announced in January.  The telecom equipment maker also guided 2001 revenue and earnings forecasts sharply lower. Nortel says, an economic downturn in the U.S. will hurt business well into the fourth quarter.  In after hours, shares of Nortel down more than 7 1/2 points.  Nortel stock is currently off 65 percent from its 52-week high.</p><p>BAY: During regular trading, one of Nortel's competitors, Ciena, set off a tech buying binge after issuing a rosy profit report.  The blue chips stocks advanced today as well, erasing most of yesterday's losses.  The Dow gained 95 points to end at 10,891.  The Nasdaq surged more than a hundred points at its high today, closing up 61 1/2 to end just under 2553.  The S&amp;P rose 10 to 1326.</p><p>The single biggest driver in today's tech rally, as we mentioned: Ciena, which enjoyed the kind of eye-popping gain that we used to see regularly a year ago when the Nasdaq was nearing its peak.  Allan Chernoff joins us now with more on just what Ciena said to give investors the green light to buy -- Allan.</p><p>ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, Ciena delivered what Wall Street was looking for, and then some.  Exactly the kind of bullish news investors wanted to grasp on to.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF (voice-over): After hearing company after company warn of the effects of a slowdown in telecom equipment spending, Ciena's financials lit up Wall Street's switchboard.  Revenues actually rose from the prior quarter, up 22 percent.  Ciena earned 18 cents a share during its first quarter, up 500 percent from the year-ago period, and three-cents better than the consensus forecast.</p><p>And the company raised its forecast for the entire year: 73 to 75 cents a share, which would be more than 260 percent last year's earnings.  Ciena's equipment raises the capacity of fiber optic data networks.  The company's stock soared more than 12 points to 89, though it's still well off its high of 151 hit last October.</p><p>Fiber optics firms jumped in unison, Corning, the top maker of fiber optic cable, JDS Uniphase, the number maker of fiber components, even competitors Lucent and Nortel closed higher.</p><p>TRACY EICHLER, PAINEWEBBER: Expectations have come down that when a company reported better than expected earnings and showed that guidance going forward is actually stronger than expected, it gave technology the boost it needed.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Data networking shares shot up on optimism from Ciena's results.  Extreme, Redback, Network Appliance, Cisco and Juniper.  All these stocks have been severely depressed, still trading at fractions of their 52-week highs.</p><p>ANGEL MATA, LEGG MASON: I think people want to believe that the worst is over, and that now we can slowly start picking away and buying some of these stocks that have been hammered.  Yes, I agree with the fact that, if Ciena's going to do well, then obviously that bodes well for similar stocks.</p><p>FRANCIS: And companies providing components for high speed data connectivity through networking joined the party: Emulex, Brocade and Qlogic. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: Just as Ciena's multiplexers magnify the power of fiber optic cable, Ciena's earnings had a multiplier effect on the Nasdaq.  Analysts say, that's partly because the Nasdaq had been deeply oversold.  But they warn it'll take more bullish news like Ciena's to keep driving the Nasdaq significantly higher.  And Willow, of course we did not get that after the bell.</p><p>BAY: No.  But Allan, let me ask you, how do you account for the fact that Ciena's business is so robust, yet we get this terrible news today from Nortel?</p><p>CHERNOFF: Well, Ciena is very targeted and they are very cost efficient, especially in this type of a market, where people are looking to reduce their expenses, Ciena's business actually helps companies to be very efficient because their equipment helps to, in fact, have that multiplyer effect for fiber optic cable -- to get more bang for the buck from the cable.</p><p>BAY: Good job, Allan, thank you.</p><p>Well, later in the broadcast, we'll talk with the president of Ciena, Gary Smith, on the company's banner day -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, Willow, in political news today the furor over the Marc Rich pardon continues to escalate.  U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White confirmed that her office, along with the FBI, has launched a criminal investigation into just why a fugitive trader received a presidential pardon.  Greg Clarkin has the latest on the scandal that's the talk of Wall Street and Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Federal prosecutors in New York today confirmed an investigation into former president Clinton's last minute pardon of Marc Rich and his business partner Pincus Green.  Mary Jo White, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, issued a statement saying:</p><p>\"Various questions have been raised concerning the activities and pardons of Marc Rich and Pincus Green.  The United States attorney's office and the FBI New York office have opened an investigation to determine whether there have been any violations of federal law. There will be no further comment\"</p><p>In a statement released yesterday, Clinton denied the pardon was bought.  In New York today, he put the best face under the investigation.</p><p>QUESTION: Mr. Clinton what's your reaction to the Mary Jo White investigation, sir?</p><p>CLARKIN: But it may not be so good if federal prosecutors determine money donated to Clinton's library fund and other Democratic causes came from Marc Rich, a fugitive living in Switzerland. Prosecutors will be looking at the role of Denise Rich, Marc Rich's ex-wife, and a major contributor to the Democrats.  A former assistant U.S.  attorney, says prosecutors, will be examining phone and bank records and anything else that may link donations Denise Rich made to the granting of the pardon.</p><p>RANDY MASTRO, GIBSON, DUNN &amp; CRUTCHER: It's always difficult to prove, in a bribery investigation, a quid pro quo relationship.  It's also made more difficult in this situation, because, potentially, you're trying to track down funds that come from overseas sources, including Switzerland, which has tough bank secrecy laws.</p><p>CLARKIN: But a congressional critic of the pardon says such cases can be built.</p><p>SEN. JEFF SESSIONS (R), ALABAMA: I've prosecuted mayors, judges, city councilmen, county commissioners for bribery and extortion under federal statutes.  It's not impossible to prove.  If money changed hands and people interviewed who are involved with that, their conversations are inquired into.  If there's no connection, the facts will so show.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: And key to the federal investigation will be the timing of Denise Rich's contributions.  Legal experts say it could take months for prosecutors to comb through the various records to see what, if any, link exists between those donations and this pardon -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Greg Clarkin, thank you very much.</p><p>Now, for a closer look at the legal issues at the heart of the Marc Rich uproar, let's go to CNN's legal analyst Greta Van Susteren.</p><p>Greta, welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Thank you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: There seems to be some dispute about whether you can actually pin down bribery in a case like this without any doubt whatsoever.  What's your opinion on that?</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Well, first of all, to prove a case of bribery, it doesn't have to be 100 percent certain.  It just has to be beyond a reasonable doubt.  And in order to prove that, a prosecutor has to produce evidence to that would show a criminal intent and that's very difficult id it's simply an exchange money that may be even date coincident with some decision made by another person.</p><p>Very difficult without something more than a transaction with money.  It's not impossible, but you must show it's a quid pro quo, that there's criminal intent.  It's hard to do, and at this point, this is only an investigation.  It is only being looked at.  There is no evidence that has been, at least not in the public domain, of an actual crime. VARNEY: The implications for this are presumably more political than they are legal because Mr. Clinton has an absolute right to pardon whomsoever he pleases?</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: That's right.  The Constitution gives the president of the United States the power to pardon.  But even the political ramification is sort of interesting.  Remember, the Constitution has also -- he's also limited to two terms as president of the United States.</p><p>So, you know, in some ways, this is going to be probably be an issue that's going to get lot of play in the media.  If there's never a crime charged against anyone, against Denise Rich or Marc Rich or anybody else, it's going to get a lot of play.  We're going to learn an awful lot about pardons in the next few months.  So at the very least, we're going get a huge civic education.</p><p>VARNEY: Greta, may I ask you, do you think that Marc Rich will ever return to the United States?  If you were his lawyer, would you advise him to return now?</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Absolutely not, because there's some question, Stuart, whether or not he's an American citizen.  If he's an American citizen, he may have some tax obligations stemming from 1983 or 1984 when he may have stopped paying taxes.</p><p>I mean, so there are lots of tax issues.  It's not this particular question.  Last night on CNN, Shawn Tully of \"Fortune\" magazine was on the air and he said he doesn't even want to come back. He just wants the freedom to travel to other countries where the United States could extradite him while he's under indictment.</p><p>VARNEY: Greta Van Susteren, CNN's legal analyst.  Greta, we'll see you tonight on \"THE POINT.\" Thanks for being with us.</p><p>VAN SUSTEREN: Thanks, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Next on MONEYLINE, dueling tax plans on Capitol Hill. The Democrats sketch out what they view is fair tax relief.</p><p>And later the four letter word among analysts, sell.  We'll look at how Amazon got slapped with a recommendation that's a rarity on Wall Street.</p><p>And a report -- a profit, I should say.  A profit letdown, and first-ever layoffs direct from Dell.  Much more on today's developments with top analyst Dan Niles.  Willow and I will be back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: The tax debate is heating up on Capitol Hill.  Today, Democratic leaders unveiled the framework of the tax plan they're working on.</p><p>Fred Katayama reports from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When it comes to cutting taxes, the Democrats say smaller is safer.  They announced that are taking a fiscally conservative approach in drafting their tax plan.</p><p>The Democrats want to divide the surplus outside of Social Security and Medicare in three: one-third of it, or $900 billion, for tax cuts, roughly half that of Mr. Bush's plan; another third to pay down the national debt and reform Medicare and Social Security; and the last third to spend on programs like education, prescription drugs and defense.</p><p>The Democrats say when drafted, their plan will be more fair and responsible than that of Mr. Bush.</p><p>REP. RICHARD GEPHARDT (D-MO), MINORITY LEADER: His plan is part of a budget that gives excessive priority to cutting tax rates for those at the top while we need critical investments in Social Security, education, and health care.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Conservatives say the Democrats are leaning toward a package that's a spending plan in disguise.</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, THE CLUB FOR GROWTH: This is really an indication that what the Democrats truly want to do is spend a substantial amount of the surplus.  They're talking about an additional $1 trillion of spending.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Liberal economists argue that the Democrats are acting in a more responsible way, since a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion may not materialize.</p><p>HENRY AARON, THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE: We can afford some tax cut, but smaller is better.  We will have no difficulty at all two years from now, if our hopes are being fulfilled, cutting taxes again. But if they are dashed, if our hopes are dashed, and we've committed a lot to tax cuts that appear to be excessive, two years from now, we'll have a hell of a time trying to reverse that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATAYAMA: To back their contention that Mr. Bush's plan favors the rich, the Democrats brought out Senator Jon Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs.  Senator Corzine said the Bush plan would save him one million dollars in taxes, calling it a \"windfall for me, but bad for the country.\" He said he favors tax cut should be more targeted to those who need it the most, the low and middle income families.</p><p>By the way, two Republicans senators said they could not support Mr. Bush's tax cut plan, saying it was too costly.  And now the president getting messages from Capitol Hill that he may still lack the votes needed to pass his tax cut plan and that more work needs to be done -- Stuart.  Well, Willow, rather. BAY: It's Willow, Fred.  Thank you.  Thanks, Fred.</p><p>Coming up next, the details on today's double digit jump from Ciena.  We will talk with the company's president when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's \"Tech Watch\": More on that supercharged rally from Ciena.  This morning, the fiberoptics equipment maker beat the street, posting a 131 percent jump in revenue.  Way off its 52-week high of 151, Ciena is still up nearly 80 percent in the last 12 months.</p><p>Joining us with more on his company's earnings, Gary Smith, Ciena's president.  Gary, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>GARY SMITH, PRESIDENT &amp; COO, CIENA: Good evening.</p><p>BAY: Investors certainly liked what they heard today, but I wonder if you could explain how in the midst of all of this bad news from your customers and your competitors -- just tonight, some more bad news from Nortel -- your business is booming?</p><p>SMITH: I think the story that's really going on here is the shift in the spending away from the legacy kind of voice architecture that most of carriers have, which is really not dealing well with data traffic.</p><p>And that's why they're operating costs and their capital cost are going up so much, really to this next generation of networks, which has is really been evangelized and led by Ciena into its next generation networking that has much lower operating costs, lower capital costs, and much more intelligence on the networks to basically create new services.</p><p>And I think what you're seeing here is really some of the more legacy-orientated vendors who helped build the voice networks are seeing some softness in demand and we, frankly, are not.</p><p>BAY: So while spending is down overall, companies are spending money on the kind of equipment that you make that makes them more efficient, essentially?</p><p>SMITH: That's exactly it.  I mean, so, you've really got to look at where the dollars are going, and I think there's a real shift towards the kind of products that Ciena has been bringing to the market.</p><p>BAY: The question, of course, is how long that shift will continue.  I know that you raised your outlook for 2001, but not all analysts have such rosy expectations.  One in particular, from Dresner, downgraded you today and one of the things that she was concerned about is that there's a contraction in spending at least through the first half of 2001, and she's just not convinced that you're immune or will be immune.  Are you? SMITH: Well, I don't think we're -- we don't pretend to be immune from the macroeconomics, but I think we are better position than virtually all of our competitors to be able to survive the kind of, you know, sort of short-term economic clamp-down that's going on.</p><p>And in fact, you know, it's actually helping in some way because the carriers have been forced to look at very carefully how they're spending their dollars, not just continuing to do that that they've done before.  So, I think this very much plays to our story and I would say that we believe we have better visibility than we've ever had, and that's obviously why we upped our expectations for the year.</p><p>BAY: What effect do you think this will have on your stock price, still way off its highs, as we mentioned?</p><p>SMITH: Well, obviously, you know, we can't speculate on what's going to happen in the stock market.  What we can speculate on is what's going to happen in our business, and I think we feel very bullish about the move that's going on here.  We've been evangelizing this through for about the last two years and I think you're starting to see real evidence of this in the financial performance both our legacy competitors and also in some of these tier-one carriers that are moving to this next generation.</p><p>BAY: Gary Smith, I'll let that be the last word.  Thanks for joining us tonight with your rosy outlook from Ciena.</p><p>SMITH: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Coming up, was the USS Greeneville out of bounds when it hit and sank a Japanese boat?  Fresh information on last week's sub accident in our \"News Digest.\" Stuart and I will be back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: New information today about last Friday's submarine accident from the Pentagon and from civilians who were onboard during the collision.  Wolf Blitzer has more on that now in the MONEYLINE \"News Digest\" -- Wolf.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Stuart.  Navy officials today confirmed the USS Greeneville was inside its assigned operating area, but outside a training area marked on maritime charts when it hit a Japanese trawler.  That word came in a Pentagon briefing.</p><p>Officials also said they'd given the names of 16 civilians who were on board the sub to federal safety investigators.  Those names are not being made public, and Navy brass defended the sub's helmsman, who supervised a civilian guest in his position during the sub's ascent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REAR ADM.

MONEYLINE will be back after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's headlines, a computer trailblazer falls short of already lowered forecasts, Dell disappoints on profits, a few hours after slashing its work force for the first time ever.</p><p>And even bigger layoffs coming at Nortel, the Canadian fiber optics power house says it's cutting 10,000 jobs.</p><p>Plus, a shocking slap in the face for Amazon.com.  As one Wall Street house advises investors to sell that stock.</p><p>BAY: Our top story tonight: tech stocks in a world of trouble. After the bell tonight, a trio of tech heavyweights unleashed bad news, starting with Dell.  The PC maker reporting profits of 18 cents a share, or $508 million, less than lowered forecasts.  And it said it will fire 1,700 employees, 4 percent of its work force.</p><p>And Nortel Networks, the Canadian fiber optics giant, said it was cutting 10,000 jobs and warned it would lose money in the first quarter because of a sharp slowdown in the U.S. market.  It also slashed its 2001 sales forecast. And Hewlett-Packard matched its already lowered profit forecasts, earning $727 million, down 33 percent from one year ago.  Revenue rose by only 2 percent.  Last month, H-P warned that the slowing economy would weigh on results.  Checking the after hours reaction: Dell down more than 1; Nortel off more than 7 1/2 and H-P slipping $1.85.  More on this later.  Dan Niles will join us after the Dell conference call.</p><p>VARNEY: And more trouble today for another new economy pioneer, as the rarest of birds swooped down on Amazon.com, when a prudential securities advised investors to sell the stock, a rarity indeed. Susan Lisovicz has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A slowing economy and the Internet implosion are just two factors weighing on the world's largest Internet retailer.  Investors have abandoned Amazon.com.  Its stock has plunged 80 percent over the past year.  And weaker revenue figures and the companies lower targets point to rougher times ahead.  Yet Prudential securities analyst Mark Rowen is the only analyst at a major brokerage to put an actual sell rating on Amazon.  He says, the stocks valuation is too high.</p><p>MARK ROWEN, PRUDENTIAL: In our view, the problem is the valuation and even though the stock is off 87 percent from its high, we think there's still significant down side risk here.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Analysts often question the stock's valuation, but that rarely prompts them to put a sell rating on a stock.  In fact, even in these challenging times, 29 percent of all recommendations in the S&amp;P 500 are strong buys; 39 percent are buys; 31 percent are rated as holds, and only .4 percent are rated as sells, the same fraction are rated as strong sells.</p><p>LISOVICZ (on camera): The subtleties of analysts' recommendations have long been misunderstood by the investing public. Analysts know that a downgrade to a sell will, in many cases, upset portfolio managers, shareholders, and the company itself.  So, a recommendation of a hold is in many cases a de facto sell.</p><p>Experts say it's important to remember that research analyst have their own self interest to consider.</p><p>MITCH ZACKS, ZACKS INVESTMENT: The analyst's own worth, and the analyst's compensation is based on how he's perceived by these portfolio managers, the more in esteem he's held by the portfolio managers, the higher salary he can command, and the more valuable he is to his brokerage firm.</p><p>LISOVICZ: Further inhibiting a sell rating, many brokerage firms have an investment banking division that may do business with the company in question, which just underscores one of the fundamentals in Investing 101.  Before buying a stock, do some research yourself. Susan Lisovicz, CNN financial news, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) VARNEY: Shares of Amazon traded lower today, but then bounced back.  Perhaps investors are betting that this sell call is a sign of a bottom.  Shares of Amazon closed up fractionally at 14 1/2, but Amazon is off 83 percent from its 52-week high -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, still to come, we'll get the latest on what drove tech stocks to a second straight rally.  We'll check in with John Metaxas at the Nasdaq.</p><p>Plus, we'll hear from money manager Susan Byrne on why all this volatility may haunt us for months to come.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Two in a row; another strong rally for the Nasdaq.  Let's go to John Metaxas who followed the action all day long at the Nasdaq market site.</p><p>JOHN METAXAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, Ciena's results better than expected in earnings, were what drove the market higher.  But, perhaps, more important was the fact that they raised revenue expectations for their upcoming performance, and in this environment, that's not something investors are used to.</p><p>The result was a strong surge in Ciena shares today, which brought the rest of the market higher.  Ciena up $12 on the day. Fiber optic components makers followed in its wake.  JDS Uniphase, SDL -- Sycamore, rather, and Juniper among the gainers.  JDS Uniphase, the largest fiber optics component maker, rising despite the fact that Merrill Lynch cut their quarterly and their yearly estimates on that stock.</p><p>But it wasn't just the networkers and the fiber optics.  Recovery continuing in the semiconductors today, and some analysts say that's a good sign for this market.  Prudential telling us we can expect one more wave of downward earnings revisions.  But they say Intel presents good risk forward.  Intel among the gainers, along with Xilinx, Vitesse, Broadcom, and PMC-Sierra.  In other words, Prudential says it's OK to buy the chips right now.</p><p>Networkers, as we told you, were up.  Cisco riding the wave, up 5 percent.  The other big caps gaining: Oracle up 2 percent; Sun up 2 percent; Microsoft managing a small gain.  Look at this gain for Dell Computer -- up 9 percent after announcing those layoffs today, after the bell.  They fail to meet expectations and they guided lower.  But, perhaps, most importantly, they said they can't tell what's going on beyond the first quarter.  Lack of visibility and that's the real problem.  We don't know how long this tech slowdown will last -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Well said indeed.  John Metaxas at the Nasdaq, thanks.</p><p>Well, joining me now, a fund manager who wouldn't touch much Nasdaq tech names.  No, not without a very long pole.  Joining us is Susan Byrne of Westwood Funds.</p><p>Susan, a pleasure to have you with us.</p><p>SUSAN BYRNE, WESTWOOD FUNDS: Thank you.  Nice to be here.</p><p>VARNEY: You're a very big hitter; you manage billions of dollars and yet, your favorite area at the moment is natural gas.</p><p>BYRNE: I like to own stocks where the outlook is clear and that the money that they're going to make is well established.  You've seen the volatility in the market in last few days.  People really don't know what the market is going to do in six months or nine months.  But in natural gas, we know that the price is going to be somewhere between $4 and $5 per MCF, which is down from the peak.  But that's a profitable level for the producers.</p><p>VARNEY: So, you've got a clear view out front?</p><p>BYNE: I think I do.</p><p>VARNEY: ...and that's what you're look for?</p><p>BYRNE: Well, the market doesn't agree with me.  That's where we have our chance.  Because, if the market agreed with me, that these were great stocks for the future they wouldn't be selling so cheaply.</p><p>VARNEY: True.</p><p>BYRNE: So, people still think that the technology is where to go because the stock prices are down, but still very expensive.</p><p>VARNEY: You also like utilities, don't you?  Why?</p><p>BYRNE: Well, I think they really go hand in glove.  We haven't built any electrical plants in a long, long time.  We saw the crisis in California.  As that goes on, we'll see it in other states.  But what people need -- is nobody wants belching utilities, what they want are clean fuel.  And clean fuel is natural gas.  So, you'll see smaller plants and an ability for people to use on the grid, off the grid, peak pricing, less -- this is deregulation, but with deregulation, everybody wants a clean environment and that's natural gas.  So they really go hand in glove.</p><p>VARNEY: Can you give me a name that you really like in natural gas and name you really like in electric utilities?</p><p>BYRNE: Yes, a name I really like would be Duke Energy.  In electric utilities, perhaps Reliant from my home state of Texas. Also, in the natural gas area, I like Anadarko and Devon petroleum.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, what kind of gains are you looking for from here to the end of year?  Do you think you'd get 10, 15 percent out of them?</p><p>BYRNE: Well, I think you've got to think in terms of getting on first base.  I don't think it's the kind of year where you sit up there and swing for the fences.  You want to have a lot of surety.  We can already see how the markets are bouncing around. So, I think you want to go, and if we get 15, 20, 25 percent out of these stocks, I believe for this year -- now they were up 100 percent last year.  So, that kind of move, I think, is going to be very, very credible for this year.</p><p>VARNEY: Are you so cautious that for the small investor who could really move into any asset category they want, would you say move a lot of it into cash because you're so cautious?</p><p>BYRNE: Well, I'm cautious because I like to find value. Actually, there's been a lot of value in the market smaller and mid cap names.  Actually, they are up a lot in the year.  But the big dominant market caps are in the technology area and that's what people think of as the market.</p><p>But it's really not the market.  There are retailers.  Sears Roebuck is selling at eight times earnings, and I think you can take a dip, perhaps a little toe into Compaq or even Apple.  But stay away from the high P/E stocks.  They still have more to go.</p><p>VARNEY: Fair enough.  Susan Byrne from The Westwood Funds, thanks for joining us.</p><p>BYRNE: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: OK -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, moving to tonight's \"Sector Focus\": online media stocks.  Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch turned bullish on the sector today, saying online advertising is finally about to hit rock bottom, and ad-reliant stocks might see the spending floodgates open later this year.  The stocks were mixed today.  Yahoo! surged nearly three. AOL Time Warner, the parent of this network, that added almost 1 1/2. But both Goto.com and DoubleClick lost ground.</p><p>VARNEY: And coming up next, CEO deja vu: Why corporate America is looking to the past to fill the chief executive slot.  MONEYLINE will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Tomorrow on MONEYLINE: Humbling times for a Wall Street superstar of the 1990's, EMC.  What has investors dumping shares of the data storage king.  We'll have the \"Bottom Line\" tomorrow night on MONEYLINE.</p><p>VARNEY: Late today, the Justice Department announced President Bush's nominee to take over the antitrust division.  His name, Charles James.  Steve Young, who followed the Justice Department's fight with Microsoft for us, joins us now with more on this -- Steve.</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, antitrust lawyers tell us that Charles James is plenty able, and very conservative.  He's 46, a partner in the Washington office of the Cleveland law firm Jones Day, where he chairs the firm's antitrust and trade regulation practice. Some other points: from 1991 to '93, he was deputy assistant general in the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.  For six years, he was at the Federal Trade Commission in several posts, including the Bureau of Competition.  At his law firm, his specialties included mergers and acquisitions, telecom joint ventures, the information and financial services industries.</p><p>He may be very conservative, but another antitrust lawyer we spoke with said it's all but impossible for a new antitrust chief to turn on the lights and do nothing.  The big question, of course, is how will James stack up against his predecessor, Joel Klein, the trust-buster who spearheaded the drive to prosecute and then break up Microsoft.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN AXINN, AXINN, VELTROP, HARKRIDER: Charles James is more likely to be responsive to the business point of view perhaps than Joel Klein would have been, and those cases will come up in the merger area more often usually than in other areas.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YOUNG: Consolidation continues in many industries, ranging from commercial aviation to high technology.  Convergence is accelerating between TV and the Internet.  So, lots of captains of industry will be adding Charles James to their Rolodexes and Palm Pilots tonight -- Stuart,</p><p>VARNEY: Twice you mentioned that his colleagues had said he was a conservative.  What does that mean in terms of antitrust policy?</p><p>YOUNG: He will listen more responsively to business because he's represented business, they say.  But they think that he will be less to the right than many people expect.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, Steve Young, thanks very much.  Let's go to Willow -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, now to our weekly feature, \"Workplace 2001.\" Tonight: Corner office comebacks.  They may have retired, but a number of successful former CEO's are in demand again, being asked to pinch hit at their old jobs.  Just this week, Robert DiNicola, returned to run Zale, the jewelry retailer; the latest in a string of executive recycling.</p><p>Peter Viles reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's happened at Maytag, at Xerox, and at Lucent Technologies: American CEO's are finding they can turn back the clock and go back to their old jobs. At least they can if their old company is struggling and the board wants them back. Jeffrey Garten, author of \"The Mind of the C.E.O.,\" says the constant pressure from investors sometimes leaves corporate boards feeling they have no other option.</p><p>JEFFREY GARTEN, AUTHOR, THE MIND OF THE C.E.O.\": There's a sense that being a CEO today, particularly of a big global company, is extraordinarily difficult, much more difficult than it's ever been before.  And as a result, there aren't that many people who look like good candidates.</p><p>VILES: Corporate America's comeback kids include: Henry Schacht at Lucent; Paul Allaire at Xerox; John Pepper, back as chairman at Procter &amp; Gamble; Leonard Hadley at Maytag; and David Johnson at Campbell Soup.</p><p>And here are five reasons they were asked back: in the year before Lucent brought back Schacht, its shares fell 61 percent.  Xerox fell 55 percent in the year before Allaire came back; Procter &amp; Gamble, 39 percent; Maytag 35 percent, and Campbell's Soup, 27 percent.</p><p>James Citrin, a corporate headhunter, says companies in crisis often look to buy time by bringing back the old boss.</p><p>JAMES CITRIN, SPENCER STUART: Spencer Stuart's working with a Fortune 100 company as we speak on a succession strategy, and they shared with me very recently that they have a contingency plan whereas if the current, sitting CEO were to be recruited away, or God forbid, if anything happened to him, they have now engineered a plan to bring back the retired, well-regarded CEO into the saddle for an interim basis.</p><p>VILES: But bringing back the old boss doesn't always right a listing ship.</p><p>(on camera): Take Lucent and Xerox.  Both companies were in trouble before they brought back the old CEO and both companies are still in trouble.  Lucent shares are down 42 percent since Schacht came back to run the company and Xerox's shares are down 72 percent during Allaire's second tour of duty.</p><p>Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: And just ahead, late breaking insight on Dell Computer. We'll hear from analyst Dan Niles, straight from Dell's conference call.</p><p>Plus, an unusual visitor to the New York Stock Exchange plans on making it his new home, after surviving the perils of cyberspace.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Wall Street has its agenda set for tomorrow digesting these after-the-bell tech reports.  Dan Niles, technology analyst at Lehman Brothers, just got off the Dell conference call, and he comes to us from San Francisco.</p><p>Dan, as always, welcome.</p><p>DAN NILES, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Thanks, Willow.</p><p>BAY: A lot of bad news from Dell today, and I gather you got a few surprises on the call.</p><p>NILES: Yes, a couple of them.  I think the main thing here is that what Dell said is they plan on keeping the pressure on pricing for, you know, the next six months at least going forward.  And they said as a result, they don't expect their operating margins to really change from current levels and for gross margins to stay pretty flat, at least sound like for the next six months.</p><p>So that was kind of the first surprise where, you know, people have been thinking the margins would go up as you went through the year.  That was kind of the indication off their preannouncement.  It doesn't look like it's going to happen anymore.</p><p>Second thing is they didn't give any guidance for the full year. They said the visibility was too murky right now for them to really do that, so they just really guided Q1 to revenues down 8 percent a punch hole, which was even a little bit more than we previewed a couple days ago.  So, those were kind of the negatives surprises that they put out there on the table.</p><p>BAY: Any positive surprises?</p><p>NILES: Well, the positive surprises, I think, are maybe more Dell specific.  They talked about the fact that Europe saw the best growth they've seen in 12 quarters.  It up 19 percent sequentially. They talked about the fact that their business model is really optimized for this kind of environment.</p><p>So, the worse pricing gets, in a perverse kind of way, the more it benefits Dell relative to their competitors.  The bad news is we're all going to have to cut our earnings estimates tomorrow from about, most people are at $0.90.  We're at $0.84 and those numbers will probably go down to about $0.80, maybe even a little bit lower, depending on where people end up.</p><p>BAY: Sense of these layoffs, is this it?</p><p>NILES: Well, we'll have to wait and see.  I think you saw Dell's numbers.  You saw Nortel laying off 10,000 people.  I think, you know, if the economy kind of reacts the way I think it's going to, which is it's going to take at least another six months for these interest rate cuts to kick into gear, you mat see more.  And my feeling is in general, with most tech companies, you're going to see more, not less as it\u2026</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAY: And do you think that's true with HP as well, more bad news to come from them? NILES: Yes, I think a lot of it is economically related and so if Dell is having issues, Cisco is having issues, you know, Sun, Nortel just lowered their numbers and you're doing a story on EMC tomorrow, it's kind of hard to see how a lot of the big tech companies escape.</p><p>BAY: Not a rosy outlook at all.  Dan Niles, as always, thanks for joining us.</p><p>NILES: Thanks Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, thanks very much, Willow.  Well, today, the good news from Ciena helped out the Nasdaq stock market.  But after- the-bell, we got bad news from Dell and Hewlett-Packard.  That could wipe out all that good news from Ciena.  It really isn't going Mike Kandel's way in the tech sector.  But here he is to see if he can find a shining light or a silver lining to this cloud -- Mike.</p><p>MYRON KANDEL, CNNFN FINANCIAL EDITOR: You know, I always do look for a silver lining, Stuart.  I'm discourage by those two late reports.  They really are -- and just when the tech sector was getting a big push as it showed today, it's going to run out of steam tomorrow because I'm sure it's going to get clobbered by those two reports that were so negative.</p><p>The silver lining: Maybe, maybe this will encourage the Fed to cut interest rates sooner than later.  And so I'm really expecting another quarter point cut or a quarter point cut between now and March 20th when the Fed has its next official meeting and then another quarter point on March 20th.</p><p>VARNEY: Is that enough for the market?  The market wants dramatic, aggressive action.  I think the market wants a half point cut.</p><p>KANDEL: Yes, it'll get a half point cut, I believe, but it'll get it in two stages.  At least, that's what I hope and I think Alan Greenspan will pay attention to the news today, continued layoffs, continued warnings, that need some remedial action and interest rates are the answer.</p><p>VARNEY: Mike, we always like a man who looks for that silver lining and you found it.  And thank you very much for it.  Good luck.</p><p>Up next, \"Ahead of the Curve\": What you need to know tonight before the markets open again tomorrow.  Willow and I will be back in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Taking a look at some of what could move the markets tomorrow: As we've been telling you, watch shares of Dell, Nortel and Hewlett-Packard.  They are all down in later trading after reporting bad news after-the-bell. And watch for a key economic indicator, the Producer Price Index for January.  It's expected to show a slight rise overall.</p><p>Finally tonight, one of the stars of Super Bowl XXXV taking Wall Street by storm.  Now, you may not remember the game, but you may remember this ad from the online brokerage E*Trade.  It's the one with a chimp riding through the wasteland that's the dot.com industry.</p><p>Today, Mr. Brooks was riding high again atop his horse Prairie, but this time, the occasion was a little more upbeat.  E*Trade was celebrating its move from the Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Brooks even did the meet and greet with New York Stock Exchange Chairman Dick Grasso.</p><p>Stuart, that concludes our report on monkey business this evening and that brings us to the end of MONEYLINE for this Thursday.  I'm Willow Bay.</p><p>VARNEY: I didn't get the ad, by the way, in the first place during the Super Bowl, but that's another story.</p><p>I'm Stuart Varney and we wish you good night from New York.</p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fdch.com\">www.fdch.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:42CC-HDY0-009B-G3JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7512\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>February 15, 2001;
