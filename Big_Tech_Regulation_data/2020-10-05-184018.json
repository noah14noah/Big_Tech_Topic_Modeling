Why it matters: That means investing in fleet electrification and convincing people to take alternative modes of transportation like Uber buses, electric bikes and scooters are key goals for the company \u2014 which doesn't have a history of playing nice with cities. </p><p>\"We are guests on the streets of the cities in which we operate.

(Khosrowshahi points out drivers are making more and like the schedule flexibility.)What's next: Uber wants to be the \"operating system for your everyday life, anyway you want to get around or anything that you want delivered to you.\" Uber Eats is a model that will expand to grocery and other items like medicine. Even taking the subway (though that won't make money for Uber) may be part of that network.\"Using Uber for us means that we become an everyday use case and we can help you depending on what you need and want, not depending on what makes us money,\" Khosrowshahi said. Reality check: Uber essentially wants to be a platform for moving around your city. But it's becoming a tougher time to be a massive platform company as the anti-Big-Tech climate persists. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO100095441573674353512757767700207</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH1-B611-JCMN-Y20V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"288\"/><timeReceived>7:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>energy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>cities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>transportation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>business</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPM9</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN59</classCode><className>GIG ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DKUD</classCode><className>BICYCLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000565</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN5F</classCode><className>ON DEMAND SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPM9</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DKUD</classCode><className>BICYCLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000565</classCode><className>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000355</classCode><className>COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE000A46G</classCode><className>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The company then watched its competitors like Lyft roll out the same functions while disregarding warnings from regulators.</p><p>\"If other companies are able to operate and there's no enforcement of the regulations or laws, than we're going to take that as tacit approval,\" Kalanick said.</p><p>The CEO's comments arrive <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2014/09/san-francisco-and-los-angeles-prosecutors-target.html\">days after prosecutors</url> in San Francisco and Los Angeles issued warnings to ridesharing companies that they are violating laws with a new carpooling service that allows separate fares for several passengers riding the same direction. The attorneys have also told the companies that their background checks are inadequate and rides to airports are illegal.</p><p>Kalanick's arrest-me-or-step-aside declaration came during a question-and-answer session with Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, who is president of the Mayor's conference. The focus of the discussion was how cities can help big tech firms thrive.</p><p>A panel discussion that followed -- including Logan Green, CEO of Lyft, an Uber competitor -- had a similar theme. But again the issue of regulation came up: West Sacramento Mayor Christopher Cabaldon challenged Green on what Cabaldon perceives as a strategic reversal by the major ridesharing companies.</p><p>Ridesharing companies originally appeared open to rallying together local governments to create a joint framework around the new service that has cut deeply into the taxi business. At that time, the companies were asking states to \"stay out of the regulatory business,\" said Mayor Cabaldon. But more recently, ridesharing firms have begun complaining about a patchwork of different laws, he said.</p><p>\"That's the issue I'm trying to understand - am I being played, or is there an end game that we are getting to the finish line together on?\" asked Cabaldon.</p><p>Green, who is a co-founder of Lyft, said that in some cases, states have established regulations that remove rule-writing burdens on individual cities - and those actions help everyone. As an example, Green cited initial rules issued by the California Public Utilities Commission.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that just last week, however, Public Utilities Commission President Michael Peevey <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/techflash/2014/09/state-regulators-rules-for-uber-lyft-sidecar-puc.html\">called a November hearing</url> to considering making changes to regulations around background checks on ridesharing drivers.</p><p>Sunday's conference focused on Cities 3.0, a theme promoted by Johnson that involves embracing technology and innovation in the civic arena. A second session that afternoon dealt with how mayors should respond to political unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

It is set to put hundreds of dollars each week in the pockets of eligible Americans who no longer can transport passengers, deliver meals or rent out their homes as a primary source of income because they have been ordered to stay indoors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Had Congress not acted, some workers for on-demand companies would have been unable to obtain such aid: That's because these laborers - in the eyes of the law and the Silicon Valley tech giants that they serve - are not treated the same as traditional full-time employees and afforded similar help when they're facing financial duress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The unemployment insurance system, created during the Great Depression, is strikingly out-of-date and completely unequipped to deal with our current crisis,\" Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who helped craft the legislation, said before its passage.</p><p>For some workers and their top advocates, though, the early celebration might be short-lived: Some said they fear it could take too long, or prove too onerous, to access new jobless benefits. Others questioned the very nature of program, which would see the federal government, not the likes of Airbnb, Uber and Lyft, paying for the weekly sums to the workers upon whom many tech platforms rely most.</p><p>\"Companies are essentially getting a bailout because they won't be paying unemployment insurance as a result,\" said Veena Dubal, an associate professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law who is an advocate for gig workers' labor rights. \"It could get workers money, but maybe not in the rapid way they need money.\"</p><p>The rare, bipartisan effort on Capitol Hill underscores the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1,000 in the United States and sickened scores more, while shuttering businesses, closing schools and overwhelming the country's health-care system. It has upended the economy and jolted Washington, where lawmakers overcame partisan divisions to wrestle together a stimulus package that's historic in its size and scope - in a matter of days.</p><p>A record 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, the latest sign that the country's economic slowdown threatens to become a prolonged recession. But missing from among those applicants are people who make their living entirely through services like Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Grubhub and Postmates, which treat drivers, renters and delivery workers as independent contractors, not employees. These and other freelancers and self-employed workers make up 10 percent of the U.S. workforce, previous federal studies have found.</p><p>Gig-economy companies long have touted this setup as the future of work, a legal flexibility that in practice permits workers to make money on their own schedule. But the arrangement also allows some tech companies to avoid paying for a portion of their on-demand workers' health-care costs or remitting taxes to the government for social safety-net programs, including unemployment insurance, sparking widespread criticism - and a raft of legal challenges.</p><p>The latest example surfaced Thursday, when New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that a state appeals court had ruled in favor of her case against Postmates, a food delivery service. Judges determined that the on-demand couriers for the app are, in fact, employees - and that the company should contribute to state unemployment funds for them.</p><p>\"As the nation battles the spread of the coronavirus and more and more employees are laid off, Postmates drivers should know they have the same safety net millions of others in New York have today,\" James said in a statement. Postmates responded in a statement that it disagreed with the decision, stressing the need for a \"modern worker classification framework.\"</p><p>In crafting their coronavirus aid package, lawmakers in Congress opted against wading into the thorny war over who qualifies as an employee. Instead, lawmakers set up a fund focused on self-employed workers affected by the outbreak yet ineligible to receive traditional unemployment insurance. The workers can soon apply in their states for aid, and until the end of July, they will see a $600 boost to each of their checks, lawmakers said.</p><p>Those who drive for Uber or rent homes on Airbnb as side gigs - to supplement other full-time employment - already can access existing out-of-work support if they lose their primary job. Lawmakers also enhanced those benefits when they adopted the CARES Act this week.</p><p>\"COVID-19 is the kind of crisis that demonstrates the extent to which we've got a whole swath of the economy working without basic social insurance protections,\" Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said in a statement. \"We are making sure that people who would normally fall through the cracks, like gig workers and freelancers, get covered.\"</p><p>Airbnb praised lawmakers in a statement for adopting a package that helps \"a new sector of the workforce who depend\" on the company. Lyft said the bill would \"help the vast majority of people who drive\" with the ride-hailing app. \"Those who've lost the opportunity to earn need and deserve this support,\" Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. He recently wrote an open letter to Congress and the White House, stressing Uber did not seek a \"bailout,\" but rather aid for drivers.</p><p>To Dubal and fellow labor activists, however, that's precisely what it is - a program subsidized by the federal government in the absence of action tech giants should have taken on their own.</p><p>\"It's potentially a boon for gig companies,\" she said.</p><p>With only days at their disposal, Senate aides who helped broker the initial coronavirus aid deal said they lacked the time to rethink the whole system, including rewriting the tax code. Others said it could cause further economic damage if they had assessed new burdens on major businesses, including gig-economy companies, some of which have witnessed precipitous declines in the stock market.</p><p>And many lawmakers agreed that the new pandemic assistance fund should be a starting point for a broader update to the country's worker-protection laws. \"Over the long-term we need to modernize the unemployment insurance system to cover these workers on a permanent basis,\" Wyden said in a statement.</p><p>While Washington is fronting the costs, it's the states that set unemployment insurance rules and determine how much out-of-work Americans receive. That means the exact process by which gig-economy workers must now apply - and how long it takes to obtain benefits - could vary.</p><p>Some people may have to apply for traditional unemployment benefits, then be denied, to be eligible for the new pot of funds commissioned by Congress, experts feared, potentially meaning that it could be weeks before some Uber drivers and Airbnb hosts actually see their first checks.</p><p>\"The challenge is, this has never been done,\" said Alastair Fitzpayne, executive director of the Future of Work Initiative at the Aspen Institute. He said regulators would be \"responsible for new programs they haven't implemented before at a moment when they're receiving historic unemployment claims.\"</p><p>In the meantime, labor activists called for gig-economy companies to pay their fair share.</p><p>\"Uber, Lyft and taxi drivers across the country have seen their earnings plummet and are desperate for relief,\" said Moira Muntz, spokeswoman for the Independent Drivers Guild, a Machinists Union affiliated group that represents more than 80,000 drivers in New York City. \"Providing these workers compensation for lost earnings is the right thing to do amid this pandemic. Meanwhile, the app companies need to step up, too, starting with those most affected by the crisis\"</p><p>The guild also called for easier access to sick pay for those who are affected by coronavirus and automatic compensation for at-risk groups, such as those over age 70, who are required to stay home. Uber and Lyft have committed to providing up to two weeks of sick pay for drivers unable to work because of the coronavirus.</p><p>Kimberly James, who drives for multiple apps, including Uber's food delivery service and Lyft, said health problems have sidelined her for nearly the past two weeks. She hasn't been able to secure a doctor's note describing her autoimmune disorder and inability to work - so she hasn't been able to collect much-needed sick pay from the apps that offer it.</p><p>\"You cannot get through to a doctor right now,\" she said.</p><p>James said the prospect of monetary aid at a moment when she's out of work could be a godsend - but she said this week that previous experience means she isn't holding her breath.</p><p>\"I mean, yeah, it'd definitely cover me and help me,\" she said. \"I'm scared to death it's going to be like usual and I fall through the cracks somehow with some stupid rule here or there because somehow I always seem to.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-54b7e2000c1940f1a275d30543d3bd98</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHN-VBD1-DXKP-J3WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1539\"/><timeReceived>6:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 27, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DN59</classCode><className>GIG ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000157</classCode><className>BAILOUTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097WW</classCode><className>UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEUyNDQ5RTc4RDI2NDc3Q0I3MUE0OEE2NTA3QjYzRkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM</classCode><className>Unemployment Compensation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

But whether this will diminish the power of Big Tech, or simply embolden it, remains to be seen.</p><p>Having been banned from using American suppliers for its phones, China's telecommunications giant Huawei this September came out with a smartphone, the Mate 30, which contained no US-made hardware whatsoever, and ran a version of the Android operating system that lacked any services provided by Big Tech company Google.</p><p>More recently, the Chinese government is reported to have embarked on a \"3-5-2 policy\" to remove US-made technology from all government offices and public institutions, at a rate of 30 per cent removal in 2020, 50 per cent in 2021, and the remaining 20 per cent in 2022.</p><p>China, in short, is being forced to create a stand-alone tech sector, drastically increasing the likelihood big American tech companies such as Facebook and Google will face competitive threats on a scale they've never dealt with before.</p><p>The question is, will the decoupling lead to a Balkanisation of tech, under which Facebook might see off a competitor such as Beijing's TikTok, it having been banned from the US and its allies by executive decree, just as Huawei was banned?</p><p>Or will the decoupling loosen Big Tech's grip on society, diminishing the global power of these American platforms to the point where regulators finally feel they can get on top of the problem?</p><p>While we wait to see how China changes the technology landscape, there is one thing lawmakers and regulators can do.</p><p>In 2020, they can make good on their promise to end the special dispensations tech companies have from the rules that govern all other companies.</p><p>If, for instance, traditional transport companies must pay their workers minimum wage, then technology-based transport companies should, too.</p><p>If, for instance, traditional publishers and broadcasters are to face punishment when they publish defamation or falsehoods or incite violence or hatred, then technology-based publishers and broadcasters should, too.</p><p>And if these winds of change prove so strong that some technology companies risk collapse, then that's a problem for Big Tech to solve, not lawmakers.</p><p>If finally imposing social and legal norms on the likes of Uber and Facebook would undermine their business, then one could only conclude those businesses were never built on solid foundations in the first place.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78br75dxjussi5ysj2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPC-YJG1-JD34-V29N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The vehicle was in automatic-driver mode, and there was also a \"pilot\" inside who could have stopped the tragedy( <url normalizedValue=\"http://business.financialpost.com/transportation/uber-halts-pilot-program-in-toronto-after-woman-struck-and-killed-by-self-driving-car-in-arizona\">http://business.financialpost.com/transportation/uber-halts-pilot-program-in-toronto-after-woman-struck-and-killed-by-self-driving-car-in-arizona</url> ). But police said he had reached down to pick something up off the floor and wasn't paying attention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two humans, the victim and pilot, obviously share blame, but the principle culprit was the robot car which was ill-equipped to avoid a collision with anything. In this case, the collision was with a human being and ended her life.</p><p>But this fatality, and another involving Tesla automatic mode, is hugely significant to the auto and tech worlds who have been racing to get autonomous vehicles approved for mass adoption. But that notion is now delayed for years as the accident, among many non-fatal mishaps, has sent computer scientists and law enforcement officials back to the drawing board.</p><p>Big tech's dirty little secret is that its business model is unethical - it's time to hold Facebook and others accountable( <url normalizedValue=\"http://business.financialpost.com/diane-francis/big-techs-dirty-little-secret-is-that-their-business-model-is-unethical-its-time-to-hold-them-accountable\">http://business.financialpost.com/diane-francis/big-techs-dirty-little-secret-is-that-their-business-model-is-unethical-its-time-to-hold-them-accountable</url> )</p><p>Meet QNX, contender for the nervous system of the future's driverless cars( <url normalizedValue=\"http://business.financialpost.com/technology/meet-blackberrys-qnx-the-nervous-system-of-the-driverless-cars-of-the-future\">http://business.financialpost.com/technology/meet-blackberrys-qnx-the-nervous-system-of-the-driverless-cars-of-the-future</url> )</p><p>Uber halts pilot program in Toronto after a woman is killed by a self-driving car in Arizona( <url normalizedValue=\"http://business.financialpost.com/transportation/uber-halts-pilot-program-in-toronto-after-woman-struck-and-killed-by-self-driving-car-in-arizona\">http://business.financialpost.com/transportation/uber-halts-pilot-program-in-toronto-after-woman-struck-and-killed-by-self-driving-car-in-arizona</url> )</p><p>Ironically, Silicon Valley proponents boasts this is the technology that can eliminate the 30,000 car fatalities annually. But only if it is foolproof, which is not the case yet.</p><p>Such a delay will give society a pause to examine the fact that autonomous vehicles and drones will create mass technological unemployment. Being a truck driver happens to be the most common job in 29 out of 50 U.S. states, and represents an estimated one-in-eight in Canada. An estimated 3.5 million drive trucks across these countries long distances and millions more drive other vehicles from taxis to Uber cars, vans, delivery vehicles, and buses.</p><p>For this army of people about to be automated out of their livelihoods, any delay is good news. It's also vindication for the powerful Teamsters union and others who have been lobbying against allowing these vehicles on public roads even for testing, much less for mass adoption.</p><p>\"I've driven 4 million miles and yet every day I head out there's always some new situation I have to deal with,\" a truck driver told the media last week. \"Can it [computers] really distinguish between a deer and a child and always make the right call?\"</p><p>Drones represent another blow to employment when they begin to deliver people and packages short and long distances. Fortunately, regulators such the Federal Aviation Administration require all drones to get permission to fly as they devise a ubiquitous air traffic control system.</p><p>The Teamsters opposition to autonomous trucks represents the first shot fired in a looming political war against mass automation that will monopolize politics this decade and next. The reality is starting to sink in that automation products are and will ravage the middle class, notably robot-cars as well as Amazon's voracious platform which is eating the retail sector alive.</p><p>The second most common job in America is retail clerk or cashier.</p><p>Amazon, in just 24 years, has gone from a website offering books to revenues that now surpass all of America's department, grocery store and restaurant chains combined. It's technological efficiency and growth does not merely raise questions about unemployment but also about excessive concentration of economic power.</p><p>Clearly, cars that drive themselves are on hold and should be. These vehicles can eventually be a godsend to the elderly or disabled or to public transportation. But leaders must do a cost benefit studies before they allow technologies to lay waste to workers.</p><p>Besides, machines are only as intelligent as the least intelligent human being that designed and manufactured them. Will man-made machines be better? And will the machines support the drivers, pilots, and clerks they replace? !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Google, Uber, and Ford would rather it be you, according to some experts. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech companies making self-driving cars could become better protected under the law than those car's owners, experts warn, as the announcement came of a powerful new coalition of automakers and big tech companies forming to take on US government regulations around self-driving vehicles.</p><p>Google, Uber, Lyft, Ford and Volvo, all of which are working on self-driving car technology, will lobby as the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets to bring autonomous vehicles to the road across the US. </p><p> Related:  We don't need self-driving cars - we need to ditch our vehicles entirely</p><p>Heading it up will be David Strickland, the former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Administration, the same group he will now be working to influence .  The lobbying group argues that self-driving vehicles will reduce the severity and frequency of crashes. According to the US Department of Transportation, 94% of car crashes are caused by human error.</p><p>There's general consensus that self-driving cars will eventually make roads safer (ask any parent of a Snapchatting teen how much they trust drivers). Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among those 15 to 29 years old. </p><p>The first task for the lobbying group will be just rolling out self-driving cars. </p><p>But the liability issues will be thorny.

His favorite things to program were videogames. But in the mid-'80s, getting the machine to do what he wanted still felt a lot like manual labor. \u201cBack then you would have to do the graphics pixel by pixel,\u201d Kalanick says. \u201cBut it was cool because you were like, oh my God, it's moving across the screen! My monster is moving across the screen!\u201d</p><p>These days, Kalanick, 37, has lost none of his fascination with watching pixels on the move. In Uber's San Francisco headquarters, a software tool called God View shows all the vehicles on the Uber system moving at once. On a laptop web browser, tiny cars on a map show every Uber driver currently on the city's streets. Tiny eyeballs on the same map show the location of every customer currently looking at the Uber app on their smartphone. In a way, the company anointed by Silicon Valley's elite as the best hope for transforming global transportation couldn't have a simpler task: It just has to bring those cars and those eyeballs together\u2014the faster and cheaper, the better.</p><p>\u201cUber should feel magical to the customer,\u201d Kalanick says one morning in November. \u201cThey just push the button and the car comes. But there's a lot going on under the hood to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>A little less than four years ago, when Uber was barely more than a private luxury car service for Silicon Valley's elite techies, Kalanick sat watching the cars crisscrossing San Francisco on God View and had a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Matrix</emphasis>-y moment when he \u201cstarted seeing the math.\u201d He was going to make the monster move\u2014not just across the screen but across cities around the globe. Since then, Uber has expanded to some 60 cities on six continents and grown to at least 400 employees. Millions of people have used Uber to get a ride, and revenue has increased at a rate of nearly 20 percent every month over the past year.</p><p>The company's speedy ascent has taken place in parallel with a surge of interest in the so-called sharing economy\u2014using technology to connect consumers with goods and services that would otherwise go unused. Kalanick had the vision to see potential profit in the empty seats of limos and taxis sitting idle as drivers wait for customers to call.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IN AN UBER-FIED FUTURE,</emphasis> FEWER PEOPLE OWN CARS, BUT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THEM.</p><p>But Kalanick doesn't put on the airs of a visionary. In business he's a brawler. Reaching Uber's goals has meant digging in against the established bureaucracy in many cities, where giving rides for money is heavily regulated. Uber has won enough of those fights to threaten the market share of the entrenched players. It not only offers a more efficient way to hail a ride but gives drivers a whole new way to see where demand is bubbling up. In the process, Uber seems capable of opening up sections of cities that taxis and car services never bothered with before.</p><p>In San Francisco, Uber has become its own noun\u2014you \u201cget an Uber.\u201d But to make it a verb\u2014to get to the point where everyone Ubers the same way they Google\u2014the company must outperform on transportation the same way Google does on search.</p><p>No less than Google itself believes Uber has this potential. In a massive funding round in August led by the search giant's venture capital arm, Uber received $258 million. The investment reportedly valued Uber at around $3.5 billion and pushed the company to the forefront of speculation about the next big tech IPO\u2014 and Kalanick as the next great tech leader.</p><p>The deal set Silicon Valley buzzing about what else Uber could become. A delivery service powered by Google's self-driving cars? The new on-the-ground army for ferrying all things Amazon? Jeff Bezos is also an Uber investor, and Kalanick cites him as an entrepreneurial inspiration. \u201cAmazon was just books and then some CDs,\u201d Kalanick says. \u201cAnd then they're like, you know what, let's do frickin' ladders!\u201d Then came the Kindle and Amazon Web Services\u2014examples, Kalanick says, of how an entrepreneur's \u201ccreative pragmatism\u201d can defy expectations. He clearly enjoys daring the world to think of Uber as merely another way to get a ride.</p><p>\u201cWe feel like we're still realizing what the potential is,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don't know yet where that stops.\u201d</p><p>From the back of an Uber-summoned Mercedes GL450 SUV, Kalanick banters with the driver about which make and model will replace the discontinued Lincoln Town Car as the default limo of choice.</p><p>Mercedes S-Class? Too expensive, Kalanick says. Cadillac XTS? Too small.</p><p>So what is it?</p><p>\u201cOK, I'm glad you asked,\u201d Kalanick says. \u201cThis is going to blow you away, dude. Are you ready? Have you seen the 2013 Ford Explorer?\u201d Spacious, like a Lexus crossover, but way cheaper.</p><p>As Uber becomes a dominant presence in urban transportation, it's easy to imagine the company playing a role in making this prophecy self-fulfilling. It's just one more sign of how far Uber has come since Kalanick helped create the company in 2009. In the beginning, it was just a way for him and his cofounder, StumbleUpon creator Garrett Camp, and their friends to get around in style.</p><p>They could certainly afford it. At age 21, Kalanick, born and raised in Los Angeles, had started a Napster-like peer-to-peer file-sharing search engine called Scour that got him sued for a quarter-trillion dollars by major media companies. Scour filed for bankruptcy, but Kalanick cofounded Red Swoosh to serve digital media over the Internet for the same companies that had sued him. Akamai bought the company in 2007 in a stock deal worth $19 million.</p><p>By the time he reached his thirties, Kalanick was a seasoned veteran in the startup trenches. But part of him wondered if he still had the drive to build another company. His breakthrough came when he was watching, of all things, a Woody Allen movie. The film was <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Vicky Christina Barcelona</emphasis>, which Allen made in 2008, when he was in his seventies. \u201cI'm like, that dude is old! And he is still bringing it! He's still making really beautiful art. And I'm like, all right, I've got a chance, man. I can do it too.\u201d</p><p>Kalanick charged into Uber and quickly collided with the muscular resistance of the taxi and limo industry. It wasn't long before San Francisco's transportation agency sent the company a cease-and-desist letter, calling Uber an unlicensed taxi service. Kalanick and Uber did neither, arguing vehemently that it merely made the software that connected drivers and riders. The company kept offering rides and building its stature among tech types\u2014a constituency city politicians have been loathe to alienate\u2014as the cool way to get around.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IF UBER EXPANDS INTO DELIVERY, ITS COMPETITION WILL SUDDENLY INCLUDE BEHEMOTHS LIKE</emphasis> AMAZON, EBAY, AND WALMART.</p><p>Uber has since faced the wrath of government and industry in other cites, notably New York, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, DC.</p><p>One councilmember opposed to Uber in the nation's capital was self-described friend of the taxi industry Marion Barry (yes, that Marion Barry). Kalanick, in DC to lobby on Uber's behalf, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis> he had an offer for the former mayor: \u201cI will personally chauffeur him myself in his silver Jaguar to work every day of the week, if he can just make this happen.\u201d Though that ride never happened, the council ultimately passed a legal framework that Uber called \u201can innovative model for city transportation legislation across the country.\u201d</p><p>Though Kalanick clearly relishes a fight, he lights up more when talking about Uber as an engineering problem. To fulfill its promise\u2014a ride within five minutes of the tap of a smartphone button\u2014Uber must constantly optimize the algorithms that govern, among other things, how many of its cars are on the road, where they go, and how much a ride costs. While Uber offers standard local rates for its various options, times of peak demand send prices up, which Uber calls surge pricing. Some critics call it price-gouging, but Kalanick says the economics are far less insidious. To meet increased demand, drivers need extra incentive to get out on the road. Since they aren't employees, the marketplace has to motivate them. \u201cMost things are dynamically priced,\u201d Kalanick points out, from airline tickets to happy hour cocktails.</p><p>Kalanick employs a data-science team of PhDs from fields like nuclear physics, astrophysics, and computational biology to grapple with the number of variables involved in keeping Uber reliable. They stay busy perfecting algorithms that are dependable and flexible enough to be ported to hundreds of cities worldwide. When we met, Uber had just gone live in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, as well as Shanghai, Dubai, and Bangalore.</p><p>And it's no longer just black cars and yellow cabs. A newer option, UberX, offers lower-priced rides from drivers piloting their personal vehicles. According to Uber, only certain late-model cars are allowed, and drivers undergo the same background screening as others in the service. In an Uber-fied version of the future, far fewer people may own cars but everybody would have access to them. \u201cYou know, I hadn't driven for a year, and then I drove over the weekend,\u201d Kalanick says. \u201cI had to jump-start my car to get going. It was a little awkward. So I think that's a sign.\u201d</p><p>Back at uber headquarters, burly drivers crowd the lobby while nearby, coders sit elbow to elbow. Like other San Francisco startups on the cusp of something bigger, Uber is preparing to move to a larger space. Its new digs will be in the same building as Square, the mobile payments company led by Twitter mastermind Jack Dorsey. Twitter's offices are across the street. The symbolism is hard to miss: Uber is joining the coterie of companies that define San Francisco's latest tech boom.</p><p>Still, part of that image depends on Uber's outsize potential to expand what it does. The logistical numbers it crunches to make it easier for people to get around would seem a natural fit for a transition into a delivery service. Uber coyly fuels that perception with publicity stunts like ferrying ice cream and barbecue to customers through its app. It's easy to imagine such promotions quietly doubling as proofs of concept. News of Google's massive investment prompted visions of a push-button delivery service powered by Google's self-driving cars.</p><p>Kalanick acknowledges that the most recent round of investment is intended to fund Uber's growth, but that's as far as he'll go. \u201cIn a lot of ways, it's not the money that allows you to do new things. It's the growth and the ability to find things that people want and to use your creativity to target those,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are a whole hell of a lot of other things that we can do and intend on doing.\u201d</p><p>But the calculus of delivery may not even be the hardest part. If Uber were to expand into delivery, its competition\u2014for now other ride-sharing startups such as Lyft, Sidecar, and Hailo\u2014would include Amazon, eBay, and Walmart too.</p><p>One way to skirt rivalry with such giants is to offer itself as the back-end technology that can power same-day online retail. In early fall, Google launched its Shopping Express service in San Francisco. The program lets customers shop online at local stores through a Google-powered app; Google sends a courier with their deliveries the same day.</p><p>David Krane, the Google Ventures partner who led the investment deal, says there's nothing happening between Uber and Shopping Express. He also says self-driving delivery vehicles are nowhere near ready to be looked at seriously as part of Uber. \u201cThose meetings will happen when the technology is ready for such discussion,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is many moons away.\u201d</p><p>At the same time, Krane is clear that Google's big investment was motivated not just by Uber's potential but also by the potential for the two companies to work together. Krane mentions maps as one technology the companies are looking to collaborate on. He doesn't offer specifics, but it's easy to imagine one day searching for a restaurant on Google Maps and seeing not just its location but the wiggling web of Ubers that could take you there. For now, however, Uber shows little interest in getting ahead of itself. Of Kalanick, Krane says: \u201cHe's a heat-seeking missile. He's undistractable.\u201d</p><p>Such focus will be vital as Uber looks to expand from dozens to hundreds of cities. In the meantime, the pure, hard calculus of getting every ride to arrive within five minutes will be plenty to keep Kalanick occupied. As much as business success, the charge he gets from cracking this code drives his commitment to Uber, just as making videogames did when he was a kid. \u201cI just enjoyed it. It was fun,\u201d Kalanick says of his days as a preteen coder. The same, he says, applies to his willingness to go all in on Uber. \u201cWhen something's fun, it's obvious: That's when you just need to do more of it.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Staff writer</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARCUS WOHLSEN</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(@marcuswohlsen) wrote about Dropbox in issue 21.10.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WIRED-10591028_0114_15</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WIRED2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BHG-BP51-F13F-155M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338905</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2208\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wired</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59741\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 1059-1028</issn><volume>Vol. 22</volume><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 2014</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLCR</classCode><className>RIDE SHARING SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CYWK</classCode><className>MOBILE APPLICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>PE000DFHR</classCode><className>TRAVIS KALANICK</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009UE1</classCode><className>SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Still, the public reproach over a loophole in Uber's software threatens to further shake trust in the platform in London and elsewhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Uber has long found itself in the crosshairs of authorities around the world over what critics say was a corporate culture, built under its former co-founder Travis Kalanick, that tested the regulatory and legal envelope of countries where it operated. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi has said he is trying to repair some of the reputational damage that strategy wrought.</p><p>In particular, he has courted London authorities after years of strained relations with city officials, regulators and competitors, including the city's ubiquitous black cabs. London officials lauded Uber generally for what it said was progress improving the company's internal issues.</p><p>Monday's ruling, however, shows how the company - in a similar vein to other big tech companies - is now facing questions about its ability to police the behaviour of others on its platform. It couldn't be determined if the issue was a significant problem elsewhere, and Uber declined to comment about other markets. However, the company said its technical and operational fix was being rolled out globally.</p><p>Transport for London, or TfL, the city's main transportation regulator, said it had found 14,000 instances in late 2018 and early 2019 in which unauthorised drivers swapped their own photos with those of authorised drivers on Uber's platform, allowing them to pick up riders themselves. A TfL spokesman said in some cases it believed drivers were using the loophole to allow people they knew to use their own accounts to pick up riders.</p><p>TfL said all 14,000 rides identified were uninsured and that two of the 43 drivers involved were unlicensed drivers - meaning they had not been vetted by the regulator with a criminal-background check or for their driving ability.</p><p>At least one ride involved a driver whose licence had been revoked by the regulator, TfL said.</p><p>The regulator said it couldn't disclose how many overall rides those 14,000 violations came from - citing commercial sensitivity for Uber. However, it said the number of customers affected was significant.</p><p>TfL said Uber told the regulator about the unauthorised accounts this northern summer, but TfL found the problem to be widespread after further investigation.</p><p>TfL said Uber fixed the loophole in October, but it still didn't have the confidence to grant it a licence because drivers might find other ways to get around restrictions in the app.</p><p>\"If not that loophole, a different loophole might be exploited,\" a TfL spokesman said.</p><p>The regulator said Uber's London drivers had been using vehicles without correct insurance in place, and that overall it was concerned that Uber's app could be manipulated. It said it wasn't confident that Uber could keep its passengers safe \"while managing changes to its app\".</p><p>Uber said it would appeal against the decision, which it called \"extraordinary and wrong\". It had been strengthening its driver identification processes over the past two months and would soon introduce \"facial matching\" to prevent \"photo fraud\".</p><p>In September, Uber said it was working on a security enhancement that would require drivers to look at their smartphone camera and blink, smile and turn their head to verify their identity.</p><p>\"We have changed our business over the last two years and are setting the standard on safety,\" said Jamie Heywood, Uber's regional manager for Europe.</p><p>London is one of Uber's most important markets. When it pushed into the city, it met stiff resistance from black-cab drivers worried about the competition and regulators who said they wanted to make sure Uber followed the rules and provided a safe environment for users.It survived legal challenges to become a part of everyday life for many Londoners. Yanking its drivers off the road would put extra strain on the city's transportation networks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-9699817e0ff211ea9470066db2a5425c72c87b08c55eaa728c19ffb53c29d1e8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKM-X4S1-JD3N-5254-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001030</classCode><className>LICENSES &amp;

That might have weighed on the buy-side's appetite to get involved this time around. Leveraged lending rules still have teeth, it seems, even if they could be on the way out.</p><p>It's also a sign of both how hot US leveraged finance markets are, and the ambition of tech firms to do things their own way.</p><p>Not long ago, the lack of underwriting would have stopped a deal before it made it off the ground, but when investors of all shapes and sizes are scrambling for US corporate debt paying a floating rate of interest, this is no obstacle.</p><p>The transaction is an interesting test of the ability of tech firms to innovate in all facets of their business. Spotify's direct listing IPO can be seen as another example of this. Both point to a willingness of tech firms to enjoy the advantages of capital markets access, but on their own terms, and with as much control as possible.</p><p>With the Uber deal due to close next week, it remains to be seen how keen investors will be to hop on board, however starved of yield they may be. Pricing talk so far suggests Uber will have to offer more compared with its last deal, but that could be a small price to pay for innovation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROWK-b17bshmx7w4zzd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROWK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S10-W6S1-F0GS-H278-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318064</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"241\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global Capital Euroweek</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 15, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000402</classCode><className>CORPORATE DEBT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000919</classCode><className>INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000426</classCode><className>CREDIT REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000919</classCode><className>INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000426</classCode><className>CREDIT REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

This is about economic growth. It means new jobs, new research opportunities here at the UofA,' Ducey said.&lt;nl/&gt; Speaking about the deal, Uber's vice president of advanced technology, Brian McClendon, said: \"We'll work with some of the leading experts in lens design here at the university to improve the imagery of what we capture and use to build out mapping and our safety features [\u2026] I think the College of Optical Sciences is one of the leading in the world, and we are looking for improving the technologies that mapping and driverless vehicles are dependent on, and this is a great place to start,\"&lt;nl/&gt; The move comes after Uber poached[2] about 50 people from Carnegie Mellon University's robotics department when it formed a similar partnership with CMU several months ago. The ride-hailing company pilfered so many university staff to work on its self-driving car initiative that it was accused of effectively gutting competing, local projects. Nearly a third of the university's robotics researchers and engineers ended up moving around the corner to Uber's new facility that had been set up in a renovated chocolate factory.&lt;nl/&gt; Governor Ducey has been a vocal supporter of Uber since taking office in January. The Republican told state regulators they couldn't enforce rules that require Uber drivers to have commercial insurances and licenses, saying the policy was hampering job creation and stifling innovation. Ducey has said that Uber creates jobs and helps grow the economy, and the state should be helping it, not hindering it. The governor also signed an executive order[3] supporting the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles on some public roads in Arizona.&lt;nl/&gt; A number of big tech and vehicle firms have been working on self-driving cars recently; Google unveiled the first finished prototype of its driverless car in December, and other companies such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz and Audi are involved with similar projects. It's been reported that Apple also is working on a self-driving vehicle initiative[4], and is looking for a facility to test it.&lt;nl/&gt; [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/tucson/2015/08/driving-innovation-in-arizona/\">https://newsroom.uber.com/tucson/2015/08/driving-innovation-in-arizona/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/5/19/8622831/uber-self-driving-cars-carnegie-mellon-poached\">http://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/5/19/8622831/uber-self-driving-cars-carnegie-mellon-poached</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://azgovernor.gov/sites/default/files/201508251002.pdf\">http://azgovernor.gov/sites/default/files/201508251002.pdf</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.techspot.com/news/61772-apple-self-driving-car-may-further-along-than.html\">http://www.techspot.com/news/61772-apple-self-driving-car-may-further-along-than.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT13388114406199463481098722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GSK-XM61-F03R-N01S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"508\"/><timeReceived>8:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TechSpot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>August 26, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Expanding out from ride-hailing into food-ordering and other services via its family of apps, the company taps into every one of the #8216;key themes#8217; and #8216;investing opportunities#8217; the Swiss bank's tech team has identified for 2020: scale, secular growth tailwinds, underlying asset value, a management team focused on positive capital allocation and a rising margin profile. READ: Uber safety report shows more than 3,000 instances of reported sexual assault, shares slip The UBS analysts, which started off with a US$56 stock price target, forecasts Uber's ridesharing bookings to grow at a 15% compound annual growth rate between 2019 and 2024, with adjusted net revenue growing at a 17% rate over that time. </p><p>Uber is seen as #8216;the clear #1 player in North America#8217; with stable-to-slightly declining share as well as being the in the top two positions in markets the company operates outside of North America, although #8216;battleground' markets such the rise of rivals such as Ola and regulatory \"headwinds\"in London or Colombia. On the big question of whether Uber, which is reportingquarterly losses above US$1bn,can expand margins and turn profitable on an underlying (EBITDA) basis by 2021, the analysts answer a decisive #8216;yes#8217;. While seeing an opportunity to expand gross margins over the medium-to-long term, the analysts said they believe #8216;a large contributing factor#8217; to Uber's path to profitability and achieving long-term adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%-plus #8216;is related to rationalization of markets and normalizing use of incentives and discounts#8217; as well as how the company #8216;leverages#8217; operating expenses. Accordingly, UBS expects Uber to turn EBITDA positive by 2021 and forecasts around a 14% adjusted EBITDA margin in 2024. #8216;UBER's collection of businesses look poised to scale into the next large cap multi-sided marketplace with improving economics and flywheel effects around supply and demand,#8217; the analysts said in a note to clients on Tuesday. #8216;While debates will likely persist over the structure/path to end goals of scaled leadership across end demand verticals and value optimization of non-core assets, we see mgmt [sic] committed to unlocking asset value and compelling risk/reward.#8217;

However, while the company that started off as a taxi industry disruptor has been the innovation poster child in consultants' slide decks the world over, until Facebook stepped up to the plate last year, it had also been the most obvious example of a fast-growth company eschewing any sense of moral responsibility in its pursuit of domination.</p><p>Its founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick was forced to resign in the wake of numerous scandals that pointed to the company's \"toxic culture\", and his replacement as CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has since been at pains to say that it is continuing to work to clean up its act.</p><p>The internet industry as a whole is under heightened scrutiny from regulators around the world for being out of step with societal expectations of conduct - particularly in the aftermath of the livestreaming of the Christchurch mosque terror attack on Facebook - and it seems like Uber senses it may hurt its fortunes.</p><p>While it is probably unrealistic to expect most investors to base their cold calculations on the ethical behaviour of Uber's leadership, it is interesting to note that, amid this backdrop of growing mistrust, it has adopted the highly unusual approach of adopting a one share-one vote structure.</p><p>Most tech start-ups turned public use a dual-share structure, that give stronger voting rights (and therefore control) to the class usually retained by the company's founders and leadership team.</p><p>Uber is trying to make it clear that its public incarnation will be transparent and not be run like some kind of bro's club. At the risk of reading too much into its intentions, it is hopefully a sign tech is starting to shed itself of the misguided notion that it is somehow different, and set aside from the normal expectations of business and society.</p><p>Just as the outside world demanded Uber do something about its macho, win-at-all cost culture, revolving around its founder and his inner circle, Lane Fox asserts that global tech companies will do better when they realise their decision makers must reflect more of the multitude communities they serve.</p><p>As a board member at Twitter she says this also applies there, as social platforms struggle to grasp the idea that not everyone thinks they are making the world a better place.</p><p>\"I think Jack [Dorsey] would acknowledge that one of the reasons for the fundamental structural issue with abuse on the platform is because it was started by four white guys who'd never been shouted at on the street,\" Lane Fox said.</p><p>\"None of them ever walked down a dark road feeling a little bit anxious, ever had a builder wolf-whistle at them or any of that daily stuff that you probably put up with if you're a woman, and I think that they really regret that.</p><p>\"They're good guys, they're on the good side, but they regret that structural inability to see around the corners just because of the things they didn't face.\"</p><p>Given Uber is only 10 years old, it is perhaps wrong to hope it is going through a contemplative mid-life self-assessment ... perhaps it is more like a teenager feeling the first twangs of self-awareness and social standing.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons to question the potential for a $US100 billion post-IPO valuation, such as the advance of driverless vehicles and the long-term defensibility of its market share. But it is to be hoped that more human challenges are also being raised in its boardroom. If the glare of the public spotlight brings with it a genuine attempt to address its place in the world, that cannot be a bad thing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc74xi4dfhgjn1j3myb54x</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWN-29R1-F0J6-J52T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

and no one got up to build a big company that would completely annihilate certain people's jobs and massively shift the economy to a more low-cost way of working, but we have to live with the consequences of those unintended consequences now.\"</p><p>It is amid <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/christchurch-signals-the-end-of-the-techtopian-dream-20190325-h1cr15\">this kind of industry and societal soul searching</url> that Uber has announced plans to raise $US10 billion in one of the most hotly anticipated public listings in years.</p><p>It is asking investors to accept the notion that digital disruption is reshaping society, and that they had better get on board with its inevitable domination ... even if it may never make a profit.</p><p>However, while the company that started off as a taxi industry disruptor has been the innovation poster child in consultants' slide decks the world over, until <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/technology-companies/facebook/facebook-faces-fight-to-put-horror-year-behind-it-as-regulators-and-users-lose-patience-20181213-h1931t\">Facebook stepped up to the plate last year, </url>it had also been the most obvious example of a fast-growth company eschewing any sense of moral responsibility in its pursuit of domination.</p><p>Its founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick was forced to resign in the wake of numerous scandals that pointed to the company's \"toxic culture,\" and his replacement as CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has since <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/news/world/uber-chief-admits-workplace-culture-needs-improvement-20181023-h170f8\">been at pains to say</url> that it is continuing to work to clean up its act.</p><p>The internet industry as a whole <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/social-media/facebook-s-reckoning-the-global-battle-to-regulate-social-media-20190414-p51dyl\">is under heightened scrutiny from regulators</url> around the world for being out of step with societal expectations of conduct - particularly in the aftermath of the livestreaming of the Christchurch mosque terror attack on Facebook - and it seems like Uber senses it may hurt its fortunes.</p><p>While it is probably unrealistic to expect most investors to base their cold calculations on the ethical behaviour of Uber's leadership, it is interesting to note that, amid this backdrop of growing mistrust, it has adopted the highly unusual approach of adopting a one share-one vote structure.</p><p>Most tech start-ups turned public use a dual-share structure, that give stronger voting rights (and therefore control) to the class usually retained by the company's founders and leadership team.</p><p>Uber is trying to make it clear that its public incarnation will be transparent and not be run like some kind of bro's club.</p><p>At the risk of reading too much into its intentions, it is hopefully a sign tech is starting to shed itself of the misguided notion that it is somehow different, and set aside from the normal expectations of business and society.</p><p>Just as the outside world demanded Uber do something about its macho, win-at-all cost culture, revolving around its founder and his inner circle, Lane Fox asserts that global tech companies will do better when they realise their decision makers must reflect more of the multitude communities they serve.</p><p>As a board member at Twitter she says this also applies there, as social platforms struggle to grasp the idea that not everyone thinks they are making the world a better place.</p><p>\"I think Jack [Dorsey] would acknowledge that one of the reasons for the fundamental structural issue with abuse on the platform is because it was started by four white guys who'd never been shouted at on the street,\" Lane Fox said.</p><p>\"None of them ever walked down a dark road feeling a little bit anxious, ever had a builder wolf-whistle at them or any of that daily stuff that you probably put up with if you're a woman, and I think that they really regret that.</p><p>\"They're good guys, they're on the good side, but they regret that structural inability to see around the corners just because of the things they didn't face.\"</p><p>Given Uber is only 10 years old, it is perhaps wrong to hope it is going through a contemplative mid-life self-assessment ... perhaps it is more like a teenager feeling the first twangs of self-awareness and social standing.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons to question the potential for a $US100 billion post-IPO valuation, such as the advance of driverless vehicles and the long-term defensibility of its market share. But it is to be hoped that more human challenges are also being raised in its boardroom.</p><p>If the glare of the public spotlight brings with it a genuine attempt to address its place in the world, that cannot be a bad thing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520116956</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWM-WJG1-DY19-C016-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><timeReceived>11:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Der US-Bundesstaat verabschiedete das strengste Datenschutzgesetz der Vereinigten Staaten, das Verbrauchern mehr Kontrolle \u00fcber ihre personenbezogenen Daten geben soll. Damit machte der Bundesstaat seine Hauptstadt Sacramento \u00fcber Nacht zu einem der strengsten Regulatoren der weltweiten Tech-Branche. W\u00e4hrend kalifornische Abgeordnete das Gesetz entwarfen und damit die Weichen f\u00fcr das digitale Zeitalter stellten, nahmen die meisten Internetkonzerne kaum Notiz von der aufkeimenden Bedrohung und brachten daher auch nur wenige ihrer betr\u00e4chtlichen Lobby-Ressourcen in den Prozess der Gesetzesentstehung ein.</p><p>Google, Facebook und zwei f\u00fchrende Tech-Handelsverb\u00e4nde steckten gemeinsam nur 235.000 US-Dollar in die Lobby-Arbeit - und das in den drei Monaten vor der Abstimmung \u00fcber das Gesetz. Facebook, das zu der Zeit alle seine Ressourcen auf den Skandal um Cambridge Analytica konzentrierte, gab in dem Zeitraum laut offiziellen Dokumenten weniger als 18.000 US-Dollar f\u00fcr Lobbyarbeit rund um das Datenschutzgesetz aus. Die j\u00fcngsten Versuche der Tech-Branche, Teile des im Januar in Kraft tretenden Datenschutzgesetzes zu verhindern, verliefen nicht gerade erfolgreich. Sie zeigen, wie weit das Silicon Valley und sein zwei Autostunden entfernter Nachbar Sacramento tats\u00e4chlich voneinander entfernt sind. Bei der Lobbyarbeit in Washington geben sich Mark Zuckerberg und anderen Silicon-Valley-K\u00f6nige viel M\u00fche. Und auch mit den europ\u00e4ischen Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rden schlagen sie sich seit Jahren herum, wehren sich gegen die strengen Beschr\u00e4nkungen. Die Europ\u00e4ische Union hat immerhin das strengste Datenschutzgesetz der Welt. Doch es ist nun gerade die Zur\u00fcckhaltung in der kalifornischen Politik, die die Tech-Konzerne tief getroffen hat, sagen Experten.</p><p>Die Silicon-Valley-Giganten k\u00e4mpfen inzwischen gegen die Gesetzgeber Kaliforniens und somit auch gegen die Wahlinitiativen, die in weniger als drei Jahren zwei Datenschutzkampagnen auf den Weg gebracht haben. \"Man meint, dass sich Sacramento auf der anderen Seite des Mondes befinden w\u00fcrde\", sagt der demokratische Stratege Andrew Acosta. Die Tech-Konzerne spinnen ihre bislang d\u00fcnnen F\u00e4den nach Sacramento nun zu einem dichten Netz. Erst recht, weil sich die Gesetzgeber noch eingehender mit Datenschutzbestimmungen befassen. Facebook, Google sowie die Branchenverb\u00e4nde TechNet und The Internet Association haben ihr gemeinsames Lobby-Budget in Kalifornien drastisch erh\u00f6ht: 2019 und 2020 um mehr als 80 Prozent gegen\u00fcber der vergangenen zweij\u00e4hrigen Legislaturperiode.</p><p>Die vier Akteure gaben von Januar bis September 2019 insgesamt 1,3 Millionen US-Dollar aus, um die politischen Entscheidungstr\u00e4ger in Sacramento zu beeinflussen. Facebook hat gerade erst die exzellent vernetzte Sacramento-Insiderin Mona Pasquil Rogers engagiert, die nun die Kalifornien-Strategie des Konzerns verantwortet. Aber ist es zu sp\u00e4t f\u00fcr die Offensive? Tech-Konzerne sind bereits in der Gunst der \u00d6ffentlichkeit gesunken. Diese sieht die Rolle der Technologie in der Gesellschaft und im t\u00e4glichen Leben zunehmend kritisch. Das k\u00f6nnte die Lobby-Bem\u00fchungen in Sacramento untergraben, wo selbst wirtschaftsnahe Republikaner schon Alarm geschlagen haben. Die Wahlinitiative in Kalifornien, bei der B\u00fcrger Gesetzesvorschl\u00e4ge auch ohne Unterst\u00fctzung des Gouverneurs zur Abstimmung bringen k\u00f6nnen, k\u00f6nnte f\u00fcr weitere Unw\u00e4gbarkeiten sorgen.</p><p>Die diesj\u00e4hrige Offensive der Tech-Industrie hat - zur \u00dcberraschung vieler - keine wesentlichen \u00c4nderungen im neuen Datenschutzgesetz hervorgebracht. Im Gegenteil: Verbraucherschutzanwalt Alastair Mactaggart, der das Gesetz mit entworfen hat, war derart besorgt, dass die Lobby-Bem\u00fchungen das Datenschutzgesetz verw\u00e4ssern k\u00f6nnten, dass er direkt eine zweite Wahlinitiative f\u00fcr 2020 vorantrieb. Die \u00fcberarbeitete Gesetzesversion w\u00fcrde den Verbraucherschutz noch versch\u00e4rfen - und die Gesetzgeber davon abhalten, \u00c4nderungen vorzunehmen, die das Datenschutzgesetz schw\u00e4chen w\u00fcrden. Dies k\u00f6nnte erkl\u00e4ren, warum die Tech-Unternehmen - die die neuen Datenschutzbestimmungen Kaliforniens nicht m\u00f6gen - nun auf die Unterst\u00fctzung Washingtons setzen. Ihre letzte Hoffnung sind staatliche Regulierungen, die die Gesetze der einzelnen Bundesstaaten aufheben beziehungsweise ersetzen.</p><p>Im vergangenen Monat half eine von Technologie- und Telekommunikationskonzernen finanzierte Stiftung dabei, eine Delegation kalifornischer Gesetzgeber nach Washington zu entsenden. In Gespr\u00e4chen mit Kollegen im US-Kongress diskutierte ein Ausschuss die Schwachstellen im kalifornischen Recht und wies auf die Vorteile der Bevorrechtigung Washingtons gegen\u00fcber den Bundesstaaten hin, sagt einer der Organisatoren gegen\u00fcber \"Politico\".</p><p>Ein genauerer Blick auf die Finanzdaten aus Kampagnen zeigt jedoch, dass \"Big Tech\" im Wahlkampf der Kandidaten keine gro\u00dfe Rolle gespielt hat. Facebook gibt in der Tech-Branche mit Abstand das meiste Geld f\u00fcr den Wahlkampf aus, seit dem Jahr 2009 bereits 1,7 Millionen US-Dollar. In dieser Summe ist noch nicht einmal jener Betrag enthalten, den ein ehemaliger leitender Angestellter des Unternehmens f\u00fcr seine eigene Kampagne f\u00fcr den Posten des Generalstaatsanwalts im Jahr 2010 geleistet hat. Laut staatlichen Dokumenten hat Google 959.000 US-Dollar ausgegeben, bei Apple waren es nur 256.000 US-Dollar. Zum Vergleich: Der Telekommunikationskonzern AT&amp;T hat in diesem Zeitraum 5,3 Millionen US-Dollar in die Taschen der Kandidaten gesp\u00fclt, die Gewerkschaft SEIU sogar 6,2 Millionen US-Dollar.</p><p>Tats\u00e4chlich, sagen Strategen, k\u00f6nnten einige fortschrittliche Gesetzgeber sogar den Gegenwind von Unternehmen wie Facebook begr\u00fc\u00dfen. Wenn Facebook eine gro\u00dfe Summe an die Abgeordnete Buffy Wicks spenden w\u00fcrde, die sich f\u00fcr die Wahrung der Privatsph\u00e4re einsetzt, meint Stratege Acosta, w\u00fcrde sie wohl sagen: \"Immer her damit.\" Er f\u00fcgt hinzu: \"Es ist bezeichnend, dass Pr\u00e4sidentschaftskandidaten Mark Zuckerberg in ihren Kampagnen schlecht machen. Facebook liegt am Boden und alle treten auf die Firma ein.\"</p><p>Amazon hat bereits den Vorsto\u00df in die Kommunalpolitik gewagt und erlebte ein PR-Desaster. Das Unternehmen stecke fast 1,5 Millionen US-Dollar in ein sogenanntes Political Action Committee, also in eine private politische Organisation, die Stimmen f\u00fcr wirtschaftsnahe Abgeordnete des Stadtrats von Seattle sammelte. Stratege Steve Maviglio, ein Berater f\u00fcr W\u00e4hlerinitiativen, h\u00e4lt es allerdings f\u00fcr noch riskanter, wenn sich Tech-Unternehmen gar nicht in das politische Rennen einmischen. Er meint: Dadurch, dass jeder sein eigenes S\u00fcppchen kocht, w\u00e4re das Datenschutzgesetz in Kalifornien erst m\u00f6glich gewesen.</p><p>Maviglio wurde von einer Technologie- und Telekommunikationskoalition engagiert, um die Gesetzesinitiative zu bek\u00e4mpfen. Aber statt ihm Millionen Dollar zu versprechen, wenn er die Initiative stoppen w\u00fcrde, warteten die Unternehmen ab. Niemand wollte den ersten Schritt machen. Erst im Februar 2018, vier Monate, nachdem das Volksbegehren eingereicht wurde, kam die erste finanzielle Zuwendung. Im April 2018 k\u00fcndigte das durch den Cambridge-Analytica-Skandal ersch\u00fctterte Facebook aber an, das Datenschutzgesetz nicht l\u00e4nger bek\u00e4mpfen zu wollen. Der Gesetzesentwurf der B\u00fcrgerinitiative schnitt in Umfragen stark ab. Im Juni verabschiedete die Regierung das Datenschutzgesetz einstimmig, noch bevor es zur Volksabstimmung kam. So kann Washington auch k\u00fcnftig \u00c4nderungen daran vornehmen, ohne es vorher den W\u00e4hlern noch einmal vorlegen zu m\u00fcssen. \"Es gab ein grundlegendes Missverst\u00e4ndnis dar\u00fcber, wie die Wahlinitiative funktioniert und wer was zu tun hatte\", sagt Maviglio. \"Es war nicht leicht, die Gesetzgeber davon zu \u00fcberzeugen, sich einzumischen. Und offen gesagt war genau das der Grund, warum der Gesetzesentwurf \u00fcberhaupt verabschiedet wurde. Die Regierung wusste einfach nicht, wie sie sich h\u00e4tte einbringen und das Gesetz in eine andere Richtung h\u00e4tte bringen k\u00f6nnen.\"</p><p>Der ehemalige demokratische Berater Roger Salazar zeigt einen Kontrast auf zwischen den heutigen Technologie-Start-ups und den Hardware- und Software-Giganten wie Hewlett Packard und Apple, die in den 1980er-Jahren das Silicon Valley beherrschten. Er erinnert sich, dass die Unternehmen der ersten Generation in der Regel F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte der alten Schule anheuerten. Also solche, die es verstanden, \"mit der Regierung umzugehen\". J\u00fcngere Technologieunternehmen h\u00e4tten andere Schutzmechanismen und pflegten andere Beziehungen. M\u00f6glicherweise, weil sie mit schwindelerregender Geschwindigkeit wachsen, meint Salazar: \"Ich glaube, sie wurden \u00fcberrumpelt.\"</p><p> In Zusammenarbeit mit POLITICO  </p><p> \u00dcbersetzt aus dem Englischen von Anna Friedrich. </p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Original Gesamtseiten-PDF</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVWE20191231DWBEHPWIRTSCHAFT8U63Q0F51TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Erinnert an Washington: Das Kapitol in Kaliforniens Hauptstadt Sacramento ist der Sitz der Regierung des Bundesstaates</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DWAXEL-168721596</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DWAXEL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW2-2SY1-DY2B-S4G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">268994</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Axel Springer AG Alle Rechte Vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>Die Welt</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"14993\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>Ausg. 304</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Dienstag 31.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi even trotted out a new favorite slogan for the company. Uber, he said, wants to be the \"operating system for everyday life.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the actual announcements at the event may be too incremental to turn around a company facing a long and daunting list of problems, including record losses, multiple rounds of layoffs, continued scrutiny over passenger safety, potentially existential regulatory threats and a stock price that is hovering near an all-time low.</p><p>Uber executives described new rider perks, transit integrations and sustainability efforts. The company touted tweaks to help drivers predict future earnings at a time when many drivers -- and Uber's home state -- are pushing for it to recognize them as employees with full benefits. And it talked up safety features such as texting 911, reporting incidents during rides, real-time ID check and ride verification, even as it's yet to release its long-awaited safety transparency report, which it has warned investors about.</p><p>Khosrowshahi also showed off what he described as \"the next generation of the Uber app,\" with more integration of its food delivery and micromobility services.</p><p>\"It's lipstick on several pigs at once,\" said David Kirsch, a University of Maryland business professor. \"I'm trying to figure out what magic do they think they're invoking by putting these things into a single app.\"</p><p>Uber reported burning through a staggering $5.2 billion in the three months ending in June, its largest quarterly loss ever. Even when setting aside losses for stock compensation associated with its May initial public offering, Uber still lost about 50% more than the same period the year before.</p><p>The company's stock is now down by nearly a third from its IPO price in May. On Thursday, Uber closed down slightly, following the event.</p><p>Gad Allon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, described Uber's announcements as focusing on small issues when big challenges remain unresolved.</p><p>\"I don't see any of them as game-changers,\" said Allon, who called Uber the biggest business experiment ever, for pursuing rapid global growth fueled by endless red ink. \"More and more players joined that bandwagon, but it wasn't clear the horizon was ever profitable,\" he said.</p><p>Uber's tried to focus on bright spots Thursday, such as an exclusive food delivery partnership with the fast casual restaurant Sweetgreen and a partnership with Rachael Ray to deliver her recipes in 10 cities for 10 weeks. But as with its core ride-hailing business, concerns remain about how much Uber is relying on subsidies to earn market share with food deliveries.</p><p>\"It doesn't look like Uber is primed to take food delivery over, at least not profitably,\" said Tasha Keeney, an analyst at Ark Invest, who believes the company's valuation needs to be cut in half from its IPO value. Likewise, Kirsh noted that it's not burdensome for Uber users to switch to another app, such as Grubhub, for the features Uber is now better integrating in its app.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, some close to Uber argue the updates unveiled at the event could have a meaningful impact on the business.</p><p>Keith Chen, a business professor at UCLA and former Uber employee, likened Uber Pass -- a new service that offers savings like ride protection and no fees on Uber Eats deliveries in some cities -- to Amazon Prime, the popular loyalty program that offers customers free shipping and other perks.</p><p>He described Pass as the type of incremental update that could help Uber differentiate itself from its competitors such as Lyft, which doesn't offer food delivery.</p><p>Chen also thinks that Uber's announcement of expanding its rewards program to include food delivery will be helpful. He sees Uber's profitability in some markets as proof that it can make money more broadly.</p><p>\"There's clearly a path toward profitability by trying to provide this service across verticals their competitors can't match,\" Chen said. \"But I wouldn't call it revolutionary. It's one more step in that direction.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190926uber-event-analysis1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X56-FD91-JBPX-X04P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi even trotted out a new favorite slogan for the company. Uber, he said, wants to be the \"operating system for everyday life.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the actual announcements at the event may be too incremental to turn around a company facing a long and daunting list of problems, including record losses, multiple rounds of layoffs, continued scrutiny over passenger safety, potentially existential regulatory threats and a stock price that is hovering near an all-time low. </p><p>Uber executives described new rider perks, transit integrations and sustainability efforts. The company touted tweaks to help drivers predict future earnings at a time when many drivers -- and Uber's home state -- are pushing for it to recognize them as employees with full benefits. And it talked up safety features such as texting 911, reporting incidents during rides, real-time ID check and ride verification, even as it's yet to release its long-awaited safety transparency report, which it has warned investors about.</p><p>Khosrowshahi also showed off what he described as \"the next generation of the Uber app,\" with more integration of its food delivery and micromobility services. </p><p>\"It's lipstick on several pigs at once,\" said David Kirsch, a University of Maryland business professor. \"I'm trying to figure out what magic do they think they're invoking by putting these things into a single app.\"</p><p>Uber reported burning through a staggering $5.2 billion in the three months ending in June, its largest quarterly loss ever. Even when setting aside losses for stock compensation associated with its May initial public offering, Uber still lost about 50% more than the same period the year before.</p><p>The company's stock is now down by nearly a third from its IPO price in May. On Thursday, Uber closed down slightly, following the event. </p><p>Gad Allon, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, described Uber's announcements as focusing on small issues when big challenges remain unresolved. </p><p>\"I don't see any of them as game-changers,\" said Allon, who called Uber the biggest business experiment ever, for pursuing rapid global growth fueled by endless red ink. \"More and more players joined that bandwagon, but it wasn't clear the horizon was ever profitable,\" he said. </p><p>Uber's tried to focus on bright spots Thursday, such as an exclusive food delivery partnership with the fast casual restaurant Sweetgreen and a partnership with Rachael Ray to deliver her recipes in 10 cities for 10 weeks. But as with its core ride-hailing business, concerns remain about how much Uber is relying on subsidies to earn market share with food deliveries. </p><p>\"It doesn't look like Uber is primed to take food delivery over, at least not profitably,\" said Tasha Keeney, an analyst at Ark Invest, who believes the company's valuation needs to be cut in half from its IPO value. Likewise, Kirsh noted that it's not burdensome for Uber users to switch to another app, such as Grubhub, for the features Uber is now better integrating in its app.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, some close to Uber argue the updates unveiled at the event could have a meaningful impact on the business.</p><p>Keith Chen, a business professor at UCLA and former Uber employee, likened Uber Pass -- a new service that offers savings like ride protection and no fees on Uber Eats deliveries in some cities -- to Amazon Prime, the popular loyalty program that offers customers free shipping and other perks. </p><p>He described Pass as the type of incremental update that could help Uber differentiate itself from its competitors such as Lyft, which doesn't offer food delivery. </p><p>Chen also thinks that Uber's announcement of expanding its rewards program to include food delivery will be helpful. He sees Uber's profitability in some markets as proof that it can make money more broadly.</p><p>\"There's clearly a path toward profitability by trying to provide this service across verticals their competitors can't match,\" Chen said. \"But I wouldn't call it revolutionary. It's one more step in that direction.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The press event briefly redirected the media's attention to the skies at a time when Uber is bombarded with PR crises on the ground. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the wheel of PR misfortune has resumed spinning.</p><p>Uber is now reportedly the subject of a criminal probe from the Department of Justice over a tool it built to help drivers dodge law enforcement in cities like Portland, Oregon, where Uber was not allowed. Uber and the Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation.</p><p>\"We support the criminal investigation by the United States Department of Justice into Uber's use of the Greyball tool to evade regulators, and will continue to move forward with our own efforts to subpoena the requested records from Uber,\" Portland Commissioner Dan Saltzman said in a statement.</p><p>The ride-hailing startup also entered the courtroom this week to defend itself against charges it stole trade secrets and intellectual property for its self-driving car business from Google's Waymo. The case risks undermining what Uber describes as \"potentially ... the most lucrative business in history.\"</p><p>And if that's not enough, Uber CEO <person><nameText>Travis Kalanick </nameText></person>recently bailed on appearing at a big tech conference amid an ongoing internal investigation into sexual harassment allegations made by a former employee.</p><p>Call it the new normal for Uber. Once the unstoppable darling of Silicon Valley, the startup has been tripped up by a series of stumbles this year. It is now besieged by lawsuits, executive departures, resurgent competitors and bad headlines. </p><p>\"Public perception is shaken,\" Mike Walsh, an early Uber investor, told CNNTech. \"But I'm hopeful and confident that'll come back.\"</p><p>The damage has been months in the making. Uber was hit by a viral boycott in late January after it was perceived as breaking up a strike of taxi drivers who were protesting President Trump's travel ban. The next month it launched an \"urgent\" investigation in response to sexual harassment allegations. Weeks later, Kalanick was caught on camera arguing with an Uber driver.</p><p>Along the way, there have been a series of executive departures, including president Jeff Jones, who quit because of concerns over the firm's management culture, and Rachel Whetstone, head of policy and communications. </p><p>It \"sends a bad signal to other employees and potential hires,\" Walsh said. \"A company can't grow and excel without top talent, so this is concerning to me.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, some of Uber's competitors are benefiting from its stumbles. Lyft, Uber's top rival in the U.S., recently raised $600 million in funding and said it experienced a 60% increase in new passenger signups the week after the Uber boycott.</p><p>\"Lyft was doing well before Uber shot itself in the foot,\" Michael Moe, a Lyft investor, told CNNTech in an interview last month. \"But certainly those issues at Uber... have created an acceleration to Lyft's business.\"</p><p>That doesn't mean Uber's drivers are suddenly fleeing the service. Harry Campbell, a driver for Uber and Lyft who runs a popular blog for drivers in the industry, said \"Uber is just as busy as ever for drivers.\"</p><p>But the string of public setbacks does raise questions about Uber's long-awaited IPO. It has raised more than $10 billion in funding. The company has stayed vague on timing for going public, but IPO expert Lise Buyer suggests its valuation could take a hit when it does.</p><p>\"Can a company with a black eye or five go public? Depending on what those errors were and how convincingly the problems have been solved, absolutely yes,\" said Buyer, an IPO adviser with Class V Group who helped take Google public. \"But, generally, there is a cost.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The press event briefly redirected the media's attention to the skies at a time when Uber is bombarded with PR crises on the ground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the wheel of PR misfortune has resumed spinning.</p><p>Uber is now reportedly the subject of a criminal probe from the Department of Justice over a tool it built to help drivers dodge law enforcement in cities like Portland, Oregon, where Uber was not allowed. Uber and the Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation.</p><p>\"We support the criminal investigation by the United States Department of Justice into Uber's use of the Greyball tool to evade regulators, and will continue to move forward with our own efforts to subpoena the requested records from Uber,\" Portland Commissioner Dan Saltzman said in a statement.</p><p>The ride-hailing startup also entered the courtroom this week to defend itself against charges it stole trade secrets and intellectual property for its self-driving car business from Google's Waymo. The case risks undermining what Uber describes as \"potentially ... the most lucrative business in history.\"</p><p>And if that's not enough, Uber CEO <person><nameText>Travis Kalanick </nameText></person>recently bailed on appearing at a big tech conference amid an ongoing internal investigation into sexual harassment allegations made by a former employee.</p><p>Call it the new normal for Uber. Once the unstoppable darling of Silicon Valley, the startup has been tripped up by a series of stumbles this year. It is now besieged by lawsuits, executive departures, resurgent competitors and bad headlines.</p><p>\"Public perception is shaken,\" Mike Walsh, an early Uber investor, told CNNTech. \"But I'm hopeful and confident that'll come back.\"</p><p/><p>The damage has been months in the making. Uber was hit by a viral boycott in late January after it was perceived as breaking up a strike of taxi drivers who were protesting President Trump's travel ban. The next month it launched an \"urgent\" investigation in response to sexual harassment allegations. Weeks later, Kalanick was caught on camera arguing with an Uber driver.</p><p>Along the way, there have been a series of executive departures, including president Jeff Jones, who quit because of concerns over the firm's management culture, and Rachel Whetstone, head of policy and communications.</p><p>It \"sends a bad signal to other employees and potential hires,\" Walsh said. \"A company can't grow and excel without top talent, so this is concerning to me.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, some of Uber's competitors are benefiting from its stumbles. Lyft, Uber's top rival in the U.S., recently raised $600 million in funding and said it experienced a 60% increase in new passenger signups the week after the Uber boycott.</p><p>\"Lyft was doing well before Uber shot itself in the foot,\" Michael Moe, a Lyft investor, told CNNTech in an interview last month. \"But certainly those issues at Uber... have created an acceleration to Lyft's business.\"</p><p>That doesn't mean Uber's drivers are suddenly fleeing the service. Harry Campbell, a driver for Uber and Lyft who runs a popular blog for drivers in the industry, said \"Uber is just as busy as ever for drivers.\"</p><p>But the string of public setbacks does raise questions about Uber's long-awaited IPO. It has raised more than $10 billion in funding. The company has stayed vague on timing for going public, but IPO expert Lise Buyer suggests its valuation could take a hit when it does.</p><p>\"Can a company with a black eye or five go public? Depending on what those errors were and how convincingly the problems have been solved, absolutely yes,\" said Buyer, an IPO adviser with Class V Group who helped take Google public. \"But, generally, there is a cost.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20170505uber-crises1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NGD-0HB1-JBPX-W0XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><timeReceived>4:22 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>May 5, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Its shares are up 8 per cent today (but still stand $5 below the $45 IPO price) after the ride-hailing app said it expected to turn its first ever quarterly profit, before deducting for interest, tax and depreciation, in the final quarter of this year. That will be powered by improving margins in its US Rides division and Uber cutting its losses in its Eats business.

Wired explained that Uber's management has worked the company into&amp;nbsp; <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wired.com/business/2013/12/uber-surge-pricing/\">a position where it prioritizes reliability</url> over pricing the service in order to capture a wider slice of the populace -- higher prices mean more drivers are encouraged to hit the road.</p><p>However, Uber's management may also be misinterpreting the lesson Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) provides, a company Wired said is a major influence on Uber. While Amazon is relentlessly reliable, it's also relentlessly populist, continually sinking profits back into the company and working to make it easier and available to everyone with an internet connection. While it's had its conflicts with labor groups and lawmakers, Amazon has largely avoided getting lumped in with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO), and other big tech companies that suffer from a negative elitist reputation. Uber, Wired said, is already falling into the trap of becoming associated exclusively with the well-to-do, which does not correspond with the company's stated long-term goals of running traditional taxi services out of business.</p><p>As Valleywag put it in a separate post,&amp;nbsp; <url normalizedValue=\"http://valleywag.gawker.com/the-weekend-uber-tried-to-rip-everyone-off-1484140137\">Uber's management may sneer at the tightly-regulated taxi cab industry</url>, but those regulations ensure that taxis serve a broad slice of the population.&amp;nbsp;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-uber-20131216,0,3779232.story#axzz2neLZgqlR\">A Los Angeles Times column explained</url>: \"surge pricing\" may ultimately be a net benefit for Uber. That said, if every taxi service did it, the companies might be better off, but they would serve fewer passengers, and that's not in the public interest, which is why taxis aren't allowed to do it.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

The transportation giant will open an office with at least 3,000 employees in a downtown neighborhood, with plans to make Dallas its largest hub outside of its San Francisco headquarters.The move is a feather in the cap for the sprawling southwestern city. A growing number of transportation operators have opted to launch a range of cutting-edge mobility services, from self- driving trucks to robotic food delivery and air taxis, in this Northern Texas metropolis.\"If you look at the companies making those decisions - Uber, Kodiak, Toyota - Dallas makes a lot of sense, because of the ease of operations, real estate and the talent pool,\" said Duane Dankesreiter, senior vice president of research and innovation at the Dallas Regional Chamber of Commerce[2]. \"Dallas is well-positioned in terms of the new mobility conversation.\"Earlier this month autonomous trucking startup Kodiak Robotics opened an office in Dallas, where it will soon launch its first commercial route[3]. Toyota relocated its North American headquarters to north Texas in 2017.A central hubUber will hire or relocate about 400 employees to Dallas by the end of the year, Chris Miller, Uber's senior manager of public policy in Texas, told the Dallas Morning News. </p><p>By July 2020, workers will move into a glamorous new 250,000 square foot tower called the Epic[4], located in a downtown neighborhood called Deep Ellum.Most of the Dallas employees will work in finance, human resources, legal, business development, Uber Eats and recruiting, Travis Considine, communications manager for UberTexas, told FreightWaves. The company's decision, he said, was \"primarily driven by the depth of the Dallas labor market for the types of talent we are looking to recruit.\"Among the businesses the new office will support is Uber Elevate, an air taxi service that the company plans to launch in only three markets[5] - Dallas, Los Angeles and Melbourne, Australia - by 2023.Texas migrationWith the new hub, Uber joins a stream of transportation companies that have migrated to the Dallas metro areas in recent years. A partnership between the Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Frisco and autonomous vehicle company Driver AI (recently acquired by Apple[6]) brought the nation's first self-driving car service to public roads in 2018; the service is now operating in Arlington, another suburb.[7] A group of civic and business leaders is conducting a feasibility study to see if the Virgin Hyperloop One[8] would be viable in the region.In addition to Kodiak, several other self-driving truck outfits are testing vehicles, among them San Diego-based TuSimple[9], as well as the San Francisco startups Embark[10] and Starsky Robotics.[11]Many of these companies were lured by good weather and a favorable regulatory environment for testing autonomous vehicles. That Uber selected Dallas for its second-largest office suggests the city may also may be gaining an edge over top tier coastal cities as a home base for technology companies.As the likes of Seattle, New York and San Francisco struggle with skyrocketing real estate prices, traffic congestion - not to mention local residents who are hostile to big tech - Dallas offers a combination these cities can't or won't offer - lower labor expenses, lower cost of living and a business-friendly climate.State, city and county leaders approved nearly $36 million in economic incentives to bring Uber to Dallas. In return, the company is expected to create 3,000 jobs and pay at least an average annual salary of $100,000. In Seattle, the average tech salary reached $138,000 this year.[12]Dallas is home to the country'sfourth-largest pool of tech talent, major universities and real estate costs that are substantially lower than West Coast markets, Dankesreiter said. \"Compared to other high growth and high tech markets, we're a much better deal.\"A ride-sharing giant stumblesUber could use a deal. The transportation giant lost over $5 billion in the second quarter of 2019[13] and has taken cost-cutting measures, laying off about 400 marketing employees earlier this summer and recently froze hiring of software engineers and product managers.The company also faces mounting criticism that its ride-sharing services have contributed to traffic congestion[14] instead of making it better.Image Sourced from Google  2019 Benzinga.com.

Gautam Hans of the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology voiced concerns about this, noting, \u201cThere's very little to stop them from saying, 'Give us more data and we're still not going to tell you why, otherwise we're going to shut you down.\u2019\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-PMN357091520160414</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JJ4-YY91-DXCW-D448-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"170\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>April 14, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Energy &amp;

The actions of some big tech companies have led governments and the media to lead the accusations of big brother intrusion into our daily lives but Uber has put the boot on the other foot to lay into the Los Angeles Department of Transportation's (LADOT) use of data. Over the past two years, the mobility company has fought to stop LADOT from collecting real-time data on its e-scooter and bike-share schemes, arguing that it infringes passengers' privacy rights. </p><p>Uber's aversion to real-time data collection has spawned an ongoing legal saga that has been argued at the city, state, and federal levels with a script worthy of the world's movie capital. [Read: Proposition 22: Uber and Lyft's last ditch attempt to keep their business model alive[8]] In an LA City Hall hearing in January, a lawyer representing Uber declared: 'It is surely no exaggeration to say that what LADOT is proposing here resembles the world of a dystopian novel, like 1984 or Brave New World, where the government tracks its citizens in real-time about where people were, where they are, and where they are going.' While the Orwellian comparison has so far failed to convince the courts, the case has raised important questions about how cities use data and what limits companies are prepared to go to stop them. The dispute centers on the Mobility Data Specification (MDS), a data standard that facilitates the exchange of anonymized data between transport operators and municipal transport departments. It was first introduced in the autumn of 2018 but its origins can be found in LADOT's 2016 transport technology strategy Urban Mobility in a Digital Age, which served as a roadmap for the city's transportation future - encompassing everything from autonomous vehicles to mobility hubs. One section of the strategy, Data as a Service, spelled out how 'the rapid exchange of real-time conditions and service information between customers, service providers, government and the supporting infrastructure' could optimize safety and efficiency, and improve the overall transportation experience.<url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/08/26/uber-vs-los-angeles-the-fight-for-passenger-privacy-syndication/#Seleta\">https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/08/26/uber-vs-los-angeles-the-fight-for-passenger-privacy-syndication/#Seleta</url> Reynolds, General Manager, Los Angeles Department of Transportation The need for cities to have more control over the vast swathes of data generated by emerging mobility trends was something LADOT General Manager Seleta Reynolds had long been aware of. Prior to taking up her role in LA in 2014, Reynolds was head of the Liveable Streets division at The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, where she witnessed first-hand how ride-hailing companies had suddenly appeared and transform mobility in the city - not always for the better. On arriving in LA, Reynolds was determined to take a more proactive approach and control the code as well as the road. 'We had been working on a series of studies trying to pinpoint how to undergo a digital transformation while taking into account the evolving roles private companies were playing in mobility,' says Reynolds. 'It felt like we needed to architect a new model and a new way of doing this to communicate more effectively with businesses that were operating on the public right of way.' In March 2018, Reynolds awarded a US$1 million contract for developing new standards for mobility operators to a relativity unknown tech consulting firm, Ellis &amp;#38; Associates, led by John Ellis \u2014 a former global technologist at Ford, whose work would form the foundations of the MDS. While initially created under the umbrella of managing multiple modes of new transport trends in a rapidly changing ecosystem, it was the sudden explosion of e-scooters on LA streets in the summer of 2018 which would serve as the catalyst for the introduction of the MDS in October that year.To comply or not to comply?Images of e-scooters being abandoned on pavements - blocking access for pedestrians, cyclists, and those with disabilities - became increasingly familiar throughout 2018, and firms like Lime, Spin and Bird faced growing scrutiny over their apparent failure to act. An increasing number of residents began to view the devices as a menace, and some even took matters into their own hands. Videos and pictures of e-scooters being vandalized, set on fire and dumped in rivers flooded social media, and even spawned a dedicated Instagram page 'Bird Graveyard' where disgruntled Los Angeles residents posted their handiwork. For Reynolds, the increasingly chaotic situation only strengthened the argument for the introduction of the MDS, which she felt would bring some order and accountability back to the streets. While the city's micromobility operators had reservations about opening their data to LADOT, all fulfilled the new real-time data sharing requirements - with one notable exception. With a track record of taking a defiant and litigious approach towards city and state regulation, Reynolds says she was not surprised by Uber's response to the MDS. 'The California Public Utilities Commission [which regulates ride-hailing in the state] previously had to fight to get data from Uber,' she explains. 'They even took them to court to compel them to hand over data they had already agreed to submit.' Uber quickly began lobbying state legislators to support a bill that would restrict cities from gathering granular data on its Jump e-bikes and gained wider support from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who argued the MDS could leave personal data vulnerable to abuse. 'We've only had two government agencies ask us for this kind of information, one was LADOT - the other was Egypt's intelligence service,' says Melanie Ensign, Uber's Global Head of Security and Privacy, who has since left to become CEO of Discernible. Besides its privacy arguments, Uber also began to question LADOT's relationship with the companies it collaborated with to create the MDS, claiming that the potential for the city or others to monetize the data being collected cast a shadow over the integrity of the program. LADOT hit back at the claims, taking the unprecedented step of publishing a set of privacy principles in March 2019 that stated it would never sell the data and would resist any requests from law enforcement agencies for access. 'You have to consider the key difference between the public and private sector,' says Reynolds. 'We're not doing this because we're trying to turn a profit and grow the market; we're doing this because we're trying to keep society going.' Growth of MDSAs the legal battle ensued, others were beginning to see the merits of introducing the MDS on their streets. By mid-2019, more than a dozen US cities had adopted LA's data-sharing standard as part of their own micromobility schemes, and with the expansion, Reynolds saw an opportunity to create a network where cities, nonprofits, and companies could collaborate on its implementation globally. In June 2019, she partnered with OASIS-a non-profit open-source platform-and 14 other cities to create the Open Mobility Foundation (OMF). With the City of Boston's former Chief Information Officer Jascha Franklin-Hodge installed as Executive Director, the foundation invited companies including Bird, Spin, and Microsoft (but not Uber or Lyft) to join, along with non-profits such as The Rockefeller Foundation and Metrolab Network. 'A huge gap had existed for a long time in cities' ability to keep up with changes in mobility and effectively serve in their role as regulators,' says Franklin-Hodge. 'I was very intrigued by MDS when I first encountered it because it represented cities recognizing this gap and saying, 'Well, wait for a second, maybe what we need is not to bury our heads in the sand but instead to create our own set of modern digital tools that allow us to function as regulators or stewards of public space'.' Funded by contributions from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Knight Foundation, and dues paid by its commercial members, the OMF now has over 50 member cites in the US- including New York, Seattle, Portland, Washington DC - and dozens more abroad. While the collection of real-time data is a key tenet of Los Angeles' use of MDS, cities can take an a la carte approach to which elements of the program they want to use, with some, including Sacramento, Minneapolis, and Oakland, opting not to gather real-time data. Commenting on the opposition Los Angeles has encountered, Franklin-Hodge says Uber is now facing a model of regulation it successfully avoided for its ride-hailing business. 'In almost every single city in the United States where Uber launched, they came in without permission, they often went to court and sued the local jurisdiction, and lobbied very heavily and successfully at the state level to pre-empt the ability of local cities to regulate ride-hailing on their streets,' he says. 'They are now seeing an alternate reality they don't like, where cities, from day one, have the data they need to understand the impacts and benefits of new services, and are empowered to make smart regulatory decisions.'This reality hit home in October 2019 when LADOT suspended Uber's permit to operate its Jump e-scooters and bikes, citing their refusal to comply with the MDS. Uber then appealed (and lost) a subsequent hearing in early February. Two weeks later an anti-MDS campaign group Communities Against Rider Surveillance (CARS) appeared, proclaiming itself as a collective of 'concerned citizens, privacy and civil liberties advocates, and transportation innovators committed to making streets safer and more manageable while protecting rider privacy.' Along with seven small NGO's, Uber was a founding member. Franklin-Hodge says the coalition is a 'transparent astroturf campaign' by Uber, that makes inaccurate claims about MDS while ignoring their own legacy of poor privacy practices, multiple breaches of rider data, and falsifying information to regulators. Uber suffered a cyberattack in October 2016 that saw data from 57 million of its customers exposed, and did not admit the leak had even occurred until November 2017 - when it was revealed it had paid off the hackers with a US$100,000 ransom. A subsequent legal action taken by the US government led to a US$148 million payout, and Uber was also later fined by UK and Dutch regulators. In March 2017, the firm was found to have used a software tool called Greyball to actively deceive law enforcement officials in cities where its service violated regulations, using geolocation data, credit card information and social media accounts to identify individuals they suspected of working for city agencies tasked with investigating their compliance. But on the MDS, Uber is not without supporters. It has found an ally in prominent US civil liberty group ACLU which has also raised concerns about the potential for MDS in Los Angeles to reveal sensitive data about users. While there is no evidence this has occurred, or to what degree it is likely to happen, it has cast a wider doubt over its use. Studies from MIT and the University of Texas have shown it is possible to reverse engineer the anonymisation of data, potentially exposing private information about riders. Uber also seized on the Wall Street Journal's revelation in February that the US Department of Homeland Security bought access to a commercial database that allowed it to monitor the movements of millions of smartphone users to track unlawful migrants. Reynolds concedes there will continue to be legitimate questions about how the government and cities manage the retention, protection and aggregation of data, but that there must be a balance in order for cities to be able to deliver quality services in an increasingly digitalized world. 'I don't think this means we shouldn't even collect data, to begin with,' she says. 'This doesn't just apply to the MDS; the government has been in the business of collecting sensitive information about people to deliver services for a very long time.' Then came the climb down. In mid-March, as LADOT was reviewing six-month permit extensions for micromobility operators, Uber quietly informed the transport authority of its intention to comply with MDS requirements. 'I was surprised,' says Reynolds. 'After losing the appeal in February, the next step for them was to appeal that in front of the city transportation commission, but as we were preparing for that, we heard that they were no longer pursuing that hearing and intended to comply fully with all MDS requirements to receive the six-month extension.'But while it had apparently complied, Uber added another twist. In late March it launched proceedings to sue LADOT in federal court, alleging its real-time data sharing requirements violated state and federal law, including the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution.And last month[9], the ACLU also announced it had filed a lawsuit against LADOT and the City of Los Angeles over the same data requirements Uber has pushed back against, alleging they violate the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution and the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Uber maintains that it will not be adhering to the real-time data requirement, saying it only complied 'under duress' to gain the six-month extension. 'We reached an agreement with LA, in terms of latency, so that we could maintain our permit there,' explains Ensign. 'But we still believe that their requirements are illegal under state and federal law. And that's why we filed the lawsuit in March.' 'We have no plans to make similar agreements with any other cities - unless they want to be added to the lawsuit,' she explains. One anomaly about Uber's relationship with the MDS is that it contributes 'quite a bit of code' to the open source platform on GitHub, according to Franklin-Hodge. 'It's a somewhat interesting dynamic that they are actively participating in the open source process, regularly attend our meetings, and are actually constructive contributors to the very thing their lobbying arm is trying to demonize.' Ensign maintains Uber is not against MDS as a concept, saying standardization in the industry is a good thing.<url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/08/26/uber-vs-los-angeles-the-fight-for-passenger-privacy-syndication/#Jascha\">https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/08/26/uber-vs-los-angeles-the-fight-for-passenger-privacy-syndication/#Jascha</url> Franklin-Hodge, Executive Director, Open Mobility Foundation 'The whole point of the lawsuit is to seek guidance from the federal government on where the line should be. We don't want to fight this battle with every single city in the world. But we need somebody other than lawyers in Los Angeles to confirm where the legal line is, so that we can apply that standard across the country.'Looking to the futureAs cities look for new strategies to manage data standards in mobility, more coalitions have emerged. In December, the Mobility Data Consortium (MDC) was launched by SAE International, a professional association for engineers, and in early May it unveiled two best practice guides to help cities with micromobility data management: one for data-sharing governance and contracting; and the other providing a glossary of terms and data metrics. The group currently has 16 members, 12 from the private sector (including Uber) and four civic bodies - Tallahassee, Miami-Dade County, Bellevue, and the Denver Regional Council of Governments. Annie Chang, Head of New Mobility at SAE International, says the new consortium will complement, rather than compete with the OMF, focusing more on defining privacy standards than APIs and specifications. She admits there is a 'mix of feelings' among its members with regards to MDS, and that the organization plans to develop tools and legal clauses for authorities to adopt to address some of these concerns. For Reynolds, the need for cities to have specific outcomes and clarity about why they are collecting the data is equally important. 'The ultimate goal for us is to make the city transportation system work better, to give people more choices, and bring some order to chaos.' But while cities struggle to control the chaos, the final act in this drama is most likely out of their hands. As Ensign says: 'If the federal government tells us LADOT's requirements are not illegal, then we can stop fighting.' SHIFT is brought to you by Polestar.

Since then, more people have woken up to the power of this apparently obscure element of international trade and investment deals. It essentially gives a foreign company the ability to threaten to sue a nation for millions -- even billions -- of dollars if the latter brings in new laws or regulations that might adversely affect an investment. </p><p>The majority of corporate sovereignty cases have been brought by the extractive industries -- mining and oil. That's not least because many of the laws and regulations they object to concern environmental and health issues, which have come to the fore in recent years. New legislation designed to protect local communities might mean lower profits for investors, who then often threaten to use ISDS if they are not offered compensation for this \"loss\". Big tech companies, for all their real or supposed faults, have not turned to corporate sovereignty as a way of bullying small countries -- until now. En24 News reports that Uber is threatening to invoke corporate sovereignty in a dispute with Colombia[3]. According to Uber:a series of recent measures by the Republic have had a serious adverse impact on Uber's investments in Colombia and the viability of its operations in the country. On December 20, 2019, for example, through the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (\"SIC\"), the Republic ordered Uber, Uber Colombia, and another Uber subsidiary that will virtually cease to make the Uber Platform available of Associated Drivers and passengers in Colombia.Uber points out:other companies in Colombia and third countries that offer similar forms in Colombia have not undergone the same treatment and continue to operate in Colombia without similar interference from the Republic.The company claims a wide range of harms:The illegal order of the Republic to block the Uber Platform in Colombia also constitutes an act of censorship in contravention of international human rights instruments that protect net neutrality, freedom of expression on the internet and freedom of use of the internet.At the moment, this is all just saber-rattling, designed to encourage the Colombian government to unblock Uber in the country. If it doesn't, the company says, it will invoke the ISDS Articles[4] (pdf) of the 2012 United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement[5], and ask a tribunal to award compensation. Even if the current threat to use corporate sovereignty is not followed through, it is surely only a matter of time before another big tech company joins the ISDS club.

The Dow, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are making small moves. Investors are in a wait and see mode and here's what Wall Street is watching this hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Beijing issues a stern warning to Hong Kong protesters. The unrest is putting pressure on business, as well as stocks. Merger mania. Today, Pfizer announced the tie up with the Epipen maker, Mylan, while takeaway.com sinks its teeth into Just Eat. And it's Christmas in July for Disney. The studio shattering the box office records. Live from London, I'm Isa Soares in for Richard Quest, it is Monday, July the 29th. And this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening to you and a very Happy Monday. Tonight, Wall Street kicks off a busy week as we were saying. The markets retreat from record highs. We're in the final hour of trading. The stocks, mostly flat as you can see there. The Dow showing modest gains, almost up two tenths of one percent. That's in particular thanks to Apple, as well as 3M, while Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft pull the NASDAQ into the red.</p><p>Well, this week is brimming with potential market movers. All eyes on the Fed, which is expected cut rates on Wednesday for the first time in more than a decade despite a healthy economy and low unemployment. President Trump says quote, \"A small rate cut isn't enough.\"</p><p>U.S. negotiators arrive in China for trade talks, the first since last month's truce, but tensions still linger and expectations remain low.</p><p>Then there are plenty of corporate earnings, too, to feast on, including Apple, as well as Beyond Meat. Warnings we heard just weeks ago, if you remember of an earnings recession have yet to materialize.</p><p>Art Hogan is the Chief Market Strategist for National Securities Corporations. He joins me now from New York. Art, good to see you. Thanks for being on the show. Plenty for us there to get our teeth into. Let's start with the Fed meeting.</p><p>I think it's fair to say that the expectation of a quarter point cut -- how upset is the market going to be if they only get that?</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES CORPORATIONS: Well, it's interesting. I think it's not so much about the cut which is pretty well baked into the cake here. It's very much about the guidance. Is this the first of several rate cuts or does the Fed become data dependent again?</p><p>And the Fed has really gone through this evolution of being autopilot hawks at the beginning of the year to being patient and now they're really determined to take back that December rate hike and they're going to do that with a cut now.</p><p>But whatever they say is going to be imperative in terms of the market's expectations because there is still 20 percent of people that think they should be coming 50 basis points. We think they shouldn't be cutting at all, and the market is locked in on 25 basis points.</p><p>So, it's going to be in the messaging. What does this mean going forward? Are we looking at data now or are we actually becoming, you know, more dovish? This is part of a series of cuts that we're going to see and the market will be looking for that.</p><p>SOARES: Okay, so it's a reading between the lines, reading the tea leaves to reel the message, what exactly will they be listening to what the Fed has to say? Will it be inflation? What would they be looking out for investors here?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, the lack of inflation is what's driving this and a global economic slowdown. They are the two things that have really been driving this, but what we look at is forward guidance while we still have it and forward guidance, at the beginning of the year showed that we're going to raise rates three times this year. That's gone to the fact that we're probably going to cut rates once this year.</p><p>If we have more people slipping into that cut category and the forward guidance shows that there's another cut sometime at the end of this year, I think the market is going to look at this and say \"Okay, we're right, this is what's happening. At the end of the year, we get another 25 basis points,\" and this is part of a cycle, it is not a one-off.</p><p>SOARES: Let me show our viewers, Art, this tweet from President Trump. He tweeted, \"The Fed has made all the wrong moves. A small rate cut is not enough, but we will win any way.\" What do you -- what is your view? Can we rule out a half percentage point cut here, Art?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, we can't rule out anything. The Fed has made a lot of changes in a short period of time. From the beginning of this year, they were intending on raising rates; now, they're intending on cutting rates.</p><p>The only thing that's changed is they can't really get a grip on why inflation is staying stubbornly low, and they can't get a grip on why the global economy is moving.</p><p>But I think that the President is talking about something that in effect is the monetary policy that that that is now shifting gears and becoming easier because trade policy is getting more difficult. And I think that's what's happening.</p><p>The Fed has a step back and say, for longer U.S. and China are in a trade battle, the more the global economy slows and the more chance there is of that slowing down the U.S. economies. They want to get out in front of this.</p><p>SOARES: At the same time, and correct me if I'm wrong here, Art, a rate card at this moment in the cycle, it could potentially send a signal that the current economy could be as good as it gets. Do you -- how do you interpret that move? Is that something that's feasible?</p><p>[15:05:10] HOGAN: No, I don't think so. I think that what the Fed is looking at and saying, there's pockets of slowdown in China. There's pockets of slowdown in Europe. You're maybe going through a difficult breakup with the United Kingdom. There may be a hard Brexit. We don't know any of these things, and I think the Fed wants to say, when we're this close to the zero bound, we want to take aggressive action to prevent a slowdown in the economy.</p><p>So, it's not to say this is the peak of economic growth, but it is also to say, \"Hey, two percent GDP growth is probably what we're going to have for a while now.\" And I think we saw that with the GDP report that just came out and a revision of the fourth quarter of last year. So, as good as it gets is what we've had for the last eight years. And that's the economy growing at about two percent.</p><p>SOARES: In your view, Art, do these rate cuts make it less urgent to strike a deal with China?</p><p>HOGAN: That's a great question. It makes it -- it emboldens the administration to continue the fight longer. So yes, to a certain extent it does. And you're using you're using monetary policy to help assess trade policy, at least to firm your ground there.</p><p>But understand, the other side is doing the same thing. Right? There's plenty of Chinese stimulation coming from their government for their economy. So, it's not as though we're battling on an uneven playing field here.</p><p>But yes, it does involve the administration to stick to their guns as long as the Fed is behind their back, they can continue to fight this fight well into next year, which is the last thing we need.</p><p>SOARES: Great to have you. Thank you very much, Art Hogan there for us in New York.</p><p>HOGAN: Thank you.</p><p>SOARES: Now, Chinese officials are striking an optimistic turn with regard to trade talks that you heard Art Hogan discussing. They are set to resume in the coming hours. U.S. and Chinese negotiators are meeting in Shanghai for the first time since a temporary truce was agreed at the G20 last month.</p><p>The top trade adviser to President Trump, Peter Navarro, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour the negotiators should be left to their job. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: My strong preference here is to let these negotiations take place behind closed doors. And if you want deals reached, there will be full transparency.</p><p>The only thing I can tell you, Christiane, is this is not a trade deal in the traditional sense where one country lowers tariffs and the other country lowers some tariffs.</p><p>The problem we have with China is structural. China engages in various forms of economic aggression.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Max Baucus has served as U.S. Ambassador to China. He is also a former U.S. Senator. He joins me now. Max, let me ask you what we just heard, in fact, from Peter Navarro, who said that trade deal is not so much about trade, as we know, per se, it's more structural. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>MAX BAUCUS, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA: Well, I think he is right, but I don't think we're going to make a lot of headway. Based on my experience in China, I served over there several years, the Chinese and very tough, they're very visionary. They're not going to change their culture, they're not going to change their form of economy. And basically, they think it has served them very well. It's got some subsidies, it's got some technology transfers, got a little bit IP theft. That's where they are.</p><p>Now, they will give a little bit on the margins because they want to keep talking. Don't forget, it's the Chinese who invited the United States to come to Shanghai to meet in a few hours. That's sort of out of the Chinese playbook. Just keep talking, a little bit of time, and then -- but not give in very much.</p><p>SOARES: Okay, so on that strategy then, what is the game plan? What's the long term game plan if we just keep talking, what are you getting, then if you're not prepared to give anything and not getting anything in return?</p><p>BAUCUS: Well, they're going to give a little bit. They're going to buy, as reported, a lot of American products now, soy beans, for example. Maybe Boeing needs a little help, they may buy another Boeing airplane, for example, but they're not going to address the fundamentals. That's pretty clear to me.</p><p>But they will on the margins, probably enough to give Trump enough to say they got a victory. They're buying our stuff, you know, they're going to do a little bit on IP, a little bit here and there and declare victory.</p><p>The Chinese also are probably waiting a little bit to see what's going to happen to the U.S. elections. They can't trust Trump. They always know what he is going to do. He changes his mind so much. But you know, sometimes you get what you asked for, and I'm not sure that they'd like the next administration any better.</p><p>They probably would in a sense that it is probably a little bit more predictable, a little more steady, whatever it is, and that's very important to the Chinese.</p><p>SOARES: What would benefit, Max, President Trump here because President Trump said that he believes China may hold out until 2020 election. What would benefit him more? Just playing -- kicking the can down the road, to continue to put pressure at least -- show to put pressure on China or actually come out with a deal? What will help him in the election when it comes to 2020?</p><p>[15:10:03] BAUCUS: He is a box because the deal that he could probably get would not be sufficient for the hawks and the United States. I mean, he is not going to get with the hawks are asking for, you know, the Navarro's and the Lighthizer's. He is not going to get that. So he's in a bit of a box.</p><p>But if he gets something, ala Trump, he can declare victory, and say, \"I got a deal,\" and he could probably say -- he'll try to say, \"I got more than the previous administration, they didn't gain anything. I got something.\" Yes, he could play it that way, too.</p><p>SOARES: So maybe, we're looking at a small progress.</p><p>BAUCUS: Don't forget, too --</p><p>SOARES: Go ahead, Ambassador.</p><p>BAUCUS: Don't forget too -- you know, he is looking at the market. You know, he does want a deeper rate cut. He wants is economy to be very strong, and the stock market, how it looks, you know, this time next year is going to be very important to him. So, he is going to have his eye on that very much as he tries to figure out what to do about trade not only with China, but with Europe and with Japan.</p><p>Don't forget, there are a lot of tariffs the U.S. still has in a lot of those countries. You know, it's this is part of the America First strategy. We're tough, we Americans and so on so forth, and doing all this and that, I think now, a couple of years later, we're starting to realize that there are certain drawbacks with that, but still that's his main pitch.</p><p>Be tough and he is going to talk tough, and he is going to think that's probably going to be enough -- at least he hopes it's going to be enough -- to carry him in 2020.</p><p>SOARES: Well, it's a strategy that certainly worked in 2016. Ambassador, just stay with us for just a moment because I want to look at China really, in particular in Hong Kong because China is standing behind Hong Kong's embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam as protest reach a new level and business leaders in the territory warn of economic damage.</p><p>In Beijing's first official statement on the protest since they began, described them as a serious challenge. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YANG GUANG, SPOKESMAN, HONG KONG AND MACAU AFFAIRS OFFICE (through translator): The recent developments in Hong Kong especially the acts of violence by a small number of radical activists have seriously undermined Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, seriously challenge the rule of law and public order of Hong Kong and seriously threatened the life and property security of Hong Kong residents.</p><p>They've also touched the bottom line of the principle of one country two systems and can't be tolerated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: While mass demonstrations have been happening for eight weeks, including eight weekends, some of them leading to clashes with police as you can see there from this weekend, protest is now calling for greater democracy for Hong Kong and say Carrie Lam should resign.</p><p>With the uncertainty taking a toll on business, the main share, the Hang Seng today had its biggest one-day drop in more than one month. Look at that. The President of Hong Kong's American Chamber of Commerce told Julia Chatterley it could drive foreign investors away from the city.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TARA JOSEPH, PRESIDENT, AMERICA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN HONG KONG: Well, certainly there are backup plans being made as people start to say survey what could happen in the long term. But to be fair, Hong Kong still is a great environment to operate in.</p><p>People don't want to leave here unless they have to, a gateway city to China, connected to Southeast Asia, great connections to the United States and to Europe.</p><p>But the other aspect of it is there are cities across Asia that are becoming increasingly competitive. Singapore is an obvious one, where multinationals increasingly feel comfortable.</p><p>There are other places -- Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur -- that are trying to bring foreign investors in. So, the more Hong Kong loses a sense of comfort, the more other cities will try to compete for that business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: I want to return to Max Baucus, the former U.S. Ambassador to China. I want to get your thoughts on the clashes, they are violent -- rather violent clashes we've seen in Hong Kong. They've been going for some eight straight weekends. What are your biggest concerns? Where do you see this ending? And how do you see this ending, Max, in particular?</p><p>BAUCUS: Yes, well, I've been in Hong Kong in the last -- or twice in the last eight weeks, and I get both sides, obviously. Some businessmen are a little concerned that all the protests are going to make it more difficult for the business environment to thrive.</p><p>Businessmen always worship at the altar of predictability and certainty. The more they know that their government, they can depend on, the more likely they're going to do business well.</p><p>On the other hand, you know, clearly, whether it's Carrie Lam, or whether it's Xi Jinping, it was a big mistake to propose that extradition legislative proposal and even though that Xi has backed off and said, \"No, no, no, we're not going to do that.\" The protesters got a little bit of a taste of democracy.</p><p>They got -- it's in their mouth. They want to do more. And Beijing cannot allow that to happen. Beijing cannot allow there to be more democracy in Hong Kong in order to save that extradition proposal, then that means that the protesters are going to have to think for themselves how far can they go? How far do they want to go and they're going to be also looking a bit at some of the business concerns that is predictability of business doing well in Hong Kong.</p><p>So, I very much hope that that both sides realize that hey, this is what it is. Hong Kong is going to be transferred to China in 2047 and we're probably not going to get a lot more freedoms than we currently have. But we've got to just be smart about this, but who knows, the protesters may think hey, we got something going here and that's going to put Beijing in a huge big box in Beijing I think it's not going to allow more democracy.</p><p>[15:15:53] SOARES: Fantastic. Great to have your thoughts and your insight here, Ambassador, Max Baucus, the former U.S. Ambassador to China. Appreciate you taking the time to speak to us here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>BAUCUS: You bet.</p><p>SOARES: Good to see you. Now, I want to switch gears slightly. Now, Mylan and Pfizer putting aside their former rivalry at least for today. They're aiming to create a new $20 billion a year company. One stock is rallying, and the other not so much. We'll tell you which one after a very short break. You are watching QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>SOARES: Welcome to Merger Monday on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS and we want to begin in the pharma sector. Shares in Mylan are soaring, it is working with its rival Pfizer to form a new company -- see there. Pfizer down three and a half percent in fact, almost three and a half. Mylan -- look at that up, 13 percent.</p><p>The two are spinning off a portfolio of drugs that no longer have patent protection. Pfizer shares are significantly lower. Matt Egan is in New York for us. Matt, talk us through what is going on with this deal. Is this a David and Goliath tie up?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: It is a bit of a David and Goliath tie up. You know one of the world's largest drug makers, Pfizer is really transforming itself right before our eyes.</p><p>So late last year, Pfizer reached a deal to get rid of some of its consumer health drugs, including Tums and Advil; and then late last month, Pfizer actually went out and spent $11 billion to acquire Array BioPharma, which is a cancer treatment company and now it is merging its off-patent business with Mylan.</p><p>[15:20:06] EGAN: And so what you're going to see is a combination of Mylan's Epipen treatment with Pfizer's Lipitor and of course Viagra and some of the other well-known brands that they have.</p><p>And so the deal is going to create this off patent generic powerhouse up to $20 billion in annual revenue, it's going to have a presence in more than a hundred countries around the world. And Pfizer is hoping that this will allow it to focus on trying to go out and find the next blockbuster drug treatment and spend all that money that it needs to on research and development and get out of this slower growing lower margin business.</p><p>Now from a Mylan perspective, we saw the stock price jump up this morning. It's still up double digit percentages right now. Some analysts are describing it as a bit of a bailout for Milan, because if you look at the long-term short, it's down.</p><p>Mylan shares are down about 76 percent coming into today from their all- time highs in April of 2015. It's a really stunning decline, especially when you factor in you know that other drug companies, including Pfizer are up really tremendously over that span.</p><p>And that's because this generic drug business faces a lot of pressure. It's also because Mulan got into a lot of trouble for their controversial Epipen price hikes, and another big headline that came out of this news is that Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, she is going to retire after this deal closes. She really is one of the most controversial figures in healthcare, in part because of all those Epipen price hikes. And so that is another major development here.</p><p>SOARES: Yes, and I'm sure -- I'm guessing perhaps that's helping the share price, too. Matt, thank you very much. Now, ordering food delivery could cost anywhere from $10.00 to $100.00. It depends what you fancy, ordering a food delivery company is more like $6 billion. And that's what Amsterdam's takeaway.com is offering to merge with London based, Just Eat to keep up with competitors in Europe like Uber Eats and Deliveroo.</p><p>Anna Stewart is following all for us. We've seen quite a surge in terms of the share price. Are we looking at maybe potential bidders here?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: I think we are. I think a potential counterbid isn't on the offing. But really if you look at the share price, particularly for Just Eat, well over 20 percent today. I think this is a relief from investors.</p><p>This is a stock that has been in the doldrums for months. It actually fell out the FTSE 100 last year. There you go, up 22.7 percent, and you know, this is largely because although it's a market dominant leader in the U.K., it's having to spend an awful lot of money competing against the likes of Deliveroo, which recently was bought by Amazon. Uber Eats that recently slashed delivery fees. It's struggling to keep up.</p><p>Activist investor shareholder, Cat Rock Capital, let's get it right -- were absolutely thrilled because they've been campaigning for a tie up like this for months, and finally they're seeing it.</p><p>SOARES: From those you've been speaking to in terms of analysts, if it doesn't go this way, who could be the counter bids? Where could they come from? Uber Eats? Deliveroo? Could they get -- would they want -- would they be interested in this, Anna?</p><p>STEWART: Well, I think when you look at Uber Eats or Deliveroo, they already have such a big presence in the U.K. if we're looking at acquiring Just Eat because it's got a dominant position already.</p><p>I suspect there will be problems with regulators. They are already actually having problems with Amazon investing heavily in Deliveroo.</p><p>However, I do think, an analyst I've spoken do think that you're likely to see any counter bids from outside of the sector, it is the Big Tech giants, they are fighting on every front whether it's cars and driverless technology.</p><p>SOARES: It's so overcrowded though.</p><p>STEWART: It's such a crowded market, but maybe Softbank, you know they are investing heavily in DoorDash. There are plenty of people out there and I think the future for this could potentially be subscription models.</p><p>SOARES: What? Explain.</p><p>STEWART: Well --</p><p>SOARES: You're wrapping me -- hold on, you can't -- how would that work?</p><p>STEWART: Well, think about the fact that you have Amazon and Amazon Prime or Uber.</p><p>SOARES: Exactly.</p><p>STEWART: Well, if you could pay them a flat fee, perhaps you could reduce your delivery fee and your driver fee, perhaps -- I suspect these companies will want to keep you in their ecosystem.</p><p>SOARES: Oh, I like that, very clever. Thanks very much. Anna Stewart there.</p><p>Now, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary is worried there could be further delays in getting the Boeing 737 MAX flying again. Profit at his airline plunged last quarter. He is facing a quadruple point impact. The low-cost competition in Europe is heating up.</p><p>There is uncertainty over Brexit. You've heard that before. Pilots and cabin crew are threatening to strike. Now, plans to grow with a new Boeing 737 MAX planes are in doubt. O'Leary says Boeing needs to get its [bleep] together with regulators.</p><p>Now with airlines saying and 737 crisis is costing the millions, a new report accuses U.S. regulators are failing in their duty to regulate before the two 737 MAX crashes that killed, if you'll remember, 346 people.</p><p>It says after significant lobbying, the U.S. air safety watchdog handed oversight of critical safety systems to Boeing itself. Insiders at the Federal Aviation Administration told \"The New York Times\" that senior managers often sided with Boeing, against the advice of their own experts.</p><p>[15:25:15] SOARES: Natalie Kitroeff is in New York. She is \"The Times\" reporter covering this story for Boeing. And Natalie, this is extremely worrying. Break it down for our international viewers. At what point did the FAA began to lose control or oversight, let's say over Boeing 737 MAX?</p><p>NATALIE KITROEFF, ECONOMY REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": So this was the combination of a decades long push, that was a lobbied by industry to get the F.A.A., to get Congress to urge the F.A.A. to hand more and more control to aerospace manufacturers.</p><p>The result was a certification of the plane in which the F.A.A. handed as much control to Boeing as possible. And so what occurred was late in the development of the plane, the F.A.A. allowed Boeing to certify, to approve this software that was on the MAX without much F.A.A. input at all.</p><p>SOARES: Okay, let's take a step back. But why was it delegating more of the work and review as well as the oversight of the manufacturers? I mean, does politics play a part here.</p><p>KITROEFF: Well, there was intense lobbying by industry and Congress through its weight behind this shift. But F.A.A. leadership also embraced this new approach, and the logic there is that the F.A.A. saw itself as smaller than industry, as unable to participate in every aspect of the certification process.</p><p>The idea behind the shift was to hand more of the mundane tasks over to the manufacturer. But what we saw in the case of the 737 MAX, is that it went beyond that. And there were critical systems that were handed to Boeing for approval.</p><p>SOARES: But they had warning signs very early on. This is from your article here. \"Despite their hazy understanding of the system, F.A.A. officials decided against grounding the 737 MAX. Instead, they published a notice reminding pilots of existing emergency and procedures.\" This is after the crash of Lion Air last October, the warning signs were that all along?</p><p>KITROEFF: Well, you have F.A.A. engineers during the certification of the MAX raising questions about systems that were unrelated to MCAS, for example. This rudder, cable control system, F.A.A. engineers wanted Boeing to change the system, Boeing pushed back and managers sided with Boeing.</p><p>There's no sign that engineers raised any questions about MCAS to be very clear. But what did occur is management handed the reins over to Boeing late in the development and then there was little new safety assessments that were shared with the F.A.A.</p><p>SOARES: And Natalie, finally, what is the F.A.A. and what is Boeing -- what are they saying off the back of your reporting?</p><p>KITROEFF: Well, the FAA and Boeing are staunchly defending the certification process. Both sides have said that rules were followed. And to be clear, an F.A.A. engineering test pilot did know about the changes late in the game to MCAS.</p><p>And so I think what lawmakers are asking right now, what Federal investigators are asking right now is if the rules were followed, is that enough? And do we need to look at whether the system itself may need some changes?</p><p>SOARES: Yes, big questions being asked no doubt in terms of exactly how the regulation and how it's employed, isn't it? The software and/or the techs that need to be checked. Thanks very much Natalie there for us from -- \"New York Times\" reporter who covers Boeing.</p><p>KITROEFF: Thank you.</p><p>SOARES: Now, the man convicted in one of the banking sector's biggest scandal speaks to CNN about what he did, the price he paid and whether it could happen all again.

And the teen who has just won $3 million playing a video game. We look at the big numbers behind the Fortnite World Cup. Before that, the headlines for you at this hour.</p><p>Police say a 6-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl were killed in Sunday's shooting at a festival in California. A man in his 20s was also killed. The gunman was shot dead by police. Police say he opened fire with an assault-style weapon that he purchased legally.</p><p>It was a solemn day in a town in Italy where a funeral was held for a murdered police officer Mario Cerciello Rega was stabbed repeatedly last week during a confrontation with two American teenagers he was trying to arrest. One of the teen's told a judge the stabbing was self-defense because they didn't realize the victim was a police officer.</p><p>Russia's opposition leader suggesting he may have been poisoned in police custody. Alexei Navalny blames authorities for a mysterious allergic reaction that sent him to the hospital. He was detained last Wednesday after calling for pro-democracy demonstrations, and he's now back in jail according to his attorney.</p><p>Welcome back to QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, it is 8:33 in the evening here in London. Now, a trader convicted of defrauding UBS for more than $2 billion tells CNN it could happen again. Kwaku Adoboli's massive loss shook the London financial sector.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN: Police in London have arrested a 31-year-old man on suspicion of fraud after UBS lost $2 billion in what it's called -- calling unauthorized trading. It's a lot of money, $2 billion. Both the bank and the police are still investigating any possible wrongdoing. The losses are so great, UBS says it might wipe out the bank's profits in the next quarter.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Now, that was how we covered the story in 2011. According to UBS, the eventual losses from Adoboli's trading came to $2.3 billion. The bank said no client money was lost, but Adoboli was charged with fraud and just two days later, CEO Oswald Gruebel resigned.</p><p>At his trial the following year, Adoboli was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to seven years in prison, released after three and a half years, he was then deported from the U.K. to Ghana, and he still faces travel restrictions.</p><p>CNN's Eleni Giokos spoke with Adoboli, she joins us now from Johannesburg. Eleni, when this happened, he -- I think he was pretty young. He was in his 20s. Now with years, more perspective --</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN AFRICA CORRESPONDENT: Yes --</p><p>SOARES: What did he have to say as to what happened in this case?</p><p>[15:35:00] GIOKOS: Yes, you know, it was so interesting, and I have to say this, look, I have done interviews with the wolf of Wall Street, you know, Jordan Belfort and even Nick Leeson; the guy that brought down Barings Bank, and it was really interesting to speak to Kwaku Adoboli because he is still pretty traumatized from the deportation to Ghana.</p><p>But he also had a sense of responsibility for what occurred all those years ago. But he also said to me that he felt that he was the fault guy, that he -- that he was the only person who took the fault despite the fact that there were other people involved in those trades that they unaccounted for that over $2 billion loss.</p><p>But no means was he trying to shift responsibility. He felt that, you know, he served his time and of course, he left a lot of lessons. But what's really interesting Isa here is that this is a man that knows what it's like to trade. High frequency trading, he understands what it's like to have the pressure of creating maximum profits by taking risk, but of course, sometimes the trades don't work.</p><p>And I said, you know, can we draw parallels between what we see in the markets today versus the environment that you're working in back, you know, pre-crisis levels. And he said, look, markets are sitting at all-time highs, you've got stimulus coming through, and he said to me that he thinks that the crisis that occurred ten years ago still hasn't fully played out yet. He was also warning about bubbles. But take a listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KWAKU ADOBOLI, FORMER STOCK TRADER: Well, the reality is that, in low- yielding markets where the Fed is continuing to give stimulus, banks and traders are going to try and deploy that stimulus, and so they will take risk because they need to generate their profits. So if you layer on top of that, more regulation, what you're actually forcing the traders to do is to find a way around those regulations, right?</p><p>So, it's counter -- it's the two imperatives are contradicting each other, OK?</p><p>GIOKOS: Do you feel that you were scapegoated?</p><p>ADOBOLI: Look, I was the only person who was held to account for the loss at UBS. But it's well known that there were many people involved in what happened. So, I've been punished really excessively I think, especially with deportation on top. Now, in order to achieve a deportation, you have to maintain this narrative that, you know, he's an extra bad person which is, you know, everything is about narratives, right?</p><p>GIOKOS: Do you think anything has changed in the world of banking and finance in terms of the risk that they're willing -- these institutions are willing to take on?</p><p>ADOBOLI: Absolutely not. And the reality is that the purpose of the industry hasn't changed. And unless the purpose of the industry moved from generating profits through extraction of value from processes rather than trying to facilitate growth and the building of communities and societies, the risk appetite will never change.</p><p>It's the purpose that's the problem rather than the risk. So, when your purpose is to generate profits through taking risk and extracting value, you will always -- you will always get to the same end point, which is that too much risk is being taken because it's a singular goal.</p><p>GIOKOS: Looking back now, is there anything you would have done differently?</p><p>ADOBOLI: Because we were young -- and you know, how many young men and women are in the industry, 25, 26 today who get asked to do something and they think, well, if I'm being asked, it must be because it's possible and I've got to find a way to make it work. And when we were 25, 26, 27 years old, it was, like, well, can-do attitude, we've got to find a way to make this work, right? That's what's being asked of us.</p><p>And with the majority I've got now, I would have turned around and gone, you know what? We'll do it but you need to give us more resources so that we can do it properly.</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes --</p><p>ADOBOLI: We can do it more safely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIOKOS: And you know what, Isa? I also asked about whether we should see more regulation and whether that could help, and he said -- and so, you heard what he was saying about the purpose of just being profit-driven. He says, listen, you're going to have more regulations in play, but people are just going to work actively to find more loopholes and that's going to be the reality.</p><p>SOARES: Fascinating interview, Eleni Giokos there for us in Johannesburg. Thanks very much, Eleni, good to see you. Now, when we return, Daimler wants to revolutionize trucking its plans to combat climate change, and how online shopping fits into everything. We'll bring you that story, next.</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES: Now, online retail sometimes mean slower prices, but some shoppers are starting to worry about the environmental costs like big delivery trucks that dazzle gasoline and adds to CO2 emissions. But Daimler says electric trucks it is building -- meaning, it can be a sustainable business. John Defterios has more for you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR (voice-over): Daimler is revolutionizing its truck division. On a track at its Stuttgart headquarters, the Mercedes E-Actros, the woman at the helm believes this is the future.</p><p>GESA REIMELT, HEAD OF E-MOBILITY GROUP, DAIMLER TRUCKS: The CO2 emission is really zero, yes. Now, if you look at the energy consumption, if the energy is green energy, that is charged into the battery, then it's zero as well. So this is huge.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: This innovation from the world's biggest truck-maker is made possible by changes under the hood.</p><p>REIMELT: Development of electric cars since around about five years, and we see rapid development for the batteries. Until the 2021 launch, every detail will be perfected in the workshop. What was created in the lab must be tested on the street. Rigterink is ready to do so.</p><p>ARNE RIGTERINK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RIGTERINK LOGISTICS GROUP: From the production to the warehouse to the customer itself, everything you need is logistics behind that.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Rigterink's company has some 400 vehicles, its driver are on local roads every day, servicing the click, buy and arrive culture of today's shopper. The German research house Agura(ph) says 38 percent of road emissions in Europe come from heavy duty vehicles, so change is vital.</p><p>RIGTERINK: That's part of our philosophy to keep up with new technologies, and as logistics company, we have to think of waste where we can use the technology to help our nature and our environment.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: But we're only at the beginning of the e-truck revolution. Longer distances will require a shift in policy.</p><p>REIMELT: If society wants mobility, and if they want it fast, then charging infrastructure is really a topic, it's really a challenge. Here we all need to contribute, so it would help if governments would invest into infrastructure as well.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: John Defterios, CNN, Germany.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES: Now, this is something to really marvel at. Disney has smashed a record with the highest grossing year for a movie studio ever, and there are still -- quite a few months -- well, five months in fact to go. Three of its releases this year have made over a billion dollars as \"Avengers: End Game\", now the highest-earning movie ever.</p><p>Then there's \"Captain Marvel\" as well as \"Aladdin\". Two others are close to breaking into a billion-dollar club, it's \"Toy Story 4\" as well as \"Lion King\" which I haven't had a chance to see. And there are more coming attractions in new \"Star Wars\" film as well as the sequel to \"Frozen\", both come out this Fall.</p><p>Frank Pallotta is in New York for us. And Frank, this level of dominance is pretty unprecedented. So, it's clear that it's doing something right. So, what's the secret?</p><p>FRANK PALLOTTA, CNN BUSINESS MEDIA REPORTER: Well, the secret is that right now, what people are really going to or what consumers are really going out to see are, event-type movies. Movies that get you out of your home because at the end of the day, you can just kind of stay home and watch Netflix or go on social media, you really don't have to go to the movies anymore unless you really have to go to the movies.</p><p>So, what Disney has really done is created this big spectacle, these big movies, think of \"Avengers: End Game\", that's one of the biggest and broadest comic book movies there is. Think of the \"Lion King\" with these very photo realistic special effects. They make you feel as if, if you do not go see it on the opening weekend or at all, you're going to be missing out a cultural event, not a movie, a cultural event.</p><p>SOARES: So, fine, really, their strategy is just pay big money for top-of- the-range franchises, they exploit them ruthlessly. Is that roughly it?</p><p>PALLOTTA: I mean, that's a part of it, but I also want to kind of contend too as well that anyone can go out and just buy, you know, some of these companies, I mean, not everyone, but you know what I mean. Like money is not just the only thing. There is a certain level of the Disney brand, that Disney is just not a studios, it is just not a theme park company, it's not just a media-network company, it's a lifestyle brand.</p><p>You know, you kind of wake up in the morning and you eat Mickey Waffles, you go to bed at night watching \"Avengers\" and you know, maybe Netflix for now, eventually Disney Plus. So, there's a certain level that they understand their audience very well. They can really buy these companies, but you have to take it a little bit more than that, and they also have to learn how to really market it to the masses, not just in America, but worldwide.</p><p>SOARES: Let's talk about Disney's rivals, because they're just not competing with other Hollywood studios, they are also competing, streaming with the likes of Netflix, right? So, talk us through how successful that could be it.</p><p>PALLOTTA: Well, it's --</p><p>SOARES: That could be for them.</p><p>[15:50:00] PALLOTTA: Well, what's going to be really interesting is that right now, as you said that Disney kind of had -- Disney broke the record with $7.67 billion first year. That was with five months to spare, but in November, is going to be a huge month for the company. It's not only \"Frozen 2\", but also Disney Plus will launch in November.</p><p>And this is a huge moment for Disney going forward. Think of it this way, they could have this huge, tremendous studio, and if Disney Plus isn't a big hit right out of the gate, if it isn't kind of circling all of this, the future of the company is a little bit kind of like concerning.</p><p>Now, I'm more bullish, obviously, but what I would say is that they are going to be competing less with the Warner Brothers and the Universals of the world in the coming years potentially, and more with the Netflixs of the world.</p><p>SOARES: Well, I can't wait to see if \"Frozen 2\", I'm sure my son can't either, but although having to deal with the songs afterwards, it'll be quite painful. Frank Pallotta there for us, thank you very much, Frank, good to see you.</p><p>Now, this was a moment when a 16-year-old video game player became a multi- millionaire.

They all support him, so it's super awesome to see them, you know, celebrating the big win together.</p><p>SOARES: Let's talk about the business because this is fascinating right around the world. How do you go about recruiting, Michael, recruiting these young boys? What skills are you looking for?</p><p>MOORE: You know, it's a little bit of -- I don't want to give away too much of our trade secrets --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Yes --</p><p>SOARES: I'm not asking you for trade secrets, just roughly the skills. What --</p><p>MOORE: Yes --</p><p>SOARES: Can I do it? Can anyone do it?</p><p>MOORE: Yes, I mean anyone can do it --</p><p>SOARES: Were you looking for a particular age?</p><p>MOORE: We're just looking for the best. The best of the best at playing games and that can be anyone. You know, we keep seeing these really young 16-year-old guys --</p><p>SOARES: Right --</p><p>MOORE: Who just like have -- are really talented, and you know, finding them is part of our job and helping them grow them into professionals who can compete and, you know, take home $3 million prize pools.</p><p>SOARES: Which is a quite significant sum. You say they're very talented, do you have to have for example attention, your attention, you have to be very -- you know, a very good attention span, you have to just understand the gaming world? What exactly -- I mean, my husband loves gaming, and he's always said to me, I wish someone could pay me. He's just 40 --</p><p>MOORE: Oh, yes --</p><p>SOARES: I wish someone could pay me to do this --</p><p>MOORE: And that's all of our dream, but it's a lot of work that goes into what these guys do. They practice a lot, they spend up to 14 or even 15, 16 hours a day practicing, which is, you know, no joke. It takes a lot of dedication to, you know, to be at the top of their game.</p><p>SOARES: At what age -- I mean, we were asking people the minimum age to enter what it should be, the 13, 16 or 18 --</p><p>MOORE: Sure --</p><p>SOARES: People are voting no as we speak. What age are they considered too old, Michael? At what point do we say -- you say actually, you're not the right candidate?</p><p>[15:55:00] MOORE: I mean, it's hard to say. I don't think there's any like actual hard age limit on the upper end for us, really, the best of the best is all we're looking for, and if that person happens to be 30, then that's who we would -- you know, who would be the best.</p><p>You know, these young guys who have a lot of time to devote to practicing and you know, their hand-eye coordination and everything like that is still at its peak, and I think -- you know, that's why we see a lot of these young guys really performing at the top of their game, but no, there's definitely no really hard upper limit.</p><p>SOARES: I'm sure you've heard this criticism. The Duke of Sussex has called for Fortnite to be banned, saying the game had created addicts, basically. What do you say to that criticism?</p><p>MOORE: You know, I think it's important to be cognizant of that kind of stuff and make sure we're creating healthy kind of habits in our kids. You know, I'm a father, and I plan on, you know, taking an active role in making sure my kids, you know, are balancing life and everything, you know, past-times and things that they enjoy.</p><p>So, I don't think it necessarily makes sense to try and, you know, keep kids from engaging in gaming which is, you know, in a lot of ways a social space, things they do with their friends --</p><p>SOARES: Yes --</p><p>MOORE: You know, helps them, you know, with a lot of different life skills that I think, you know, in moderation, gaming can really be a positive thing.</p><p>SOARES: Very quickly, Michael, do your children play video games and how long for?</p><p>MOORE: They're a little too young, they're a little too young right now, but I hope someday to be, you know, playing -- enjoying games with them, yes.</p><p>SOARES: You're already training a winner, thank you very much there, Michael Moore.

Now Mark Haefele \u2014 chief investment officer for UBS Global Wealth Management \u2014 is naming fields that could outperform in the 2020s the way big tech has in the 2010s. Haefele says stocks are his firm's top bet in coming years, even though they're on track for smaller gains over the next decade. But he's hardly bearish on tech, and says investments in 5G wireless technology, artificial intelligence, and big data are also likely to outperform. Click here for more BI Prime stories.[1] Big tech conquered the world in the 2010s, and the FAANG stocks and their peers might be sorry to see the decade end. </p><p>Mark Haefele \u2014 the chief investment officer for UBS Global Wealth Management \u2014 says a period of smaller stock gains is coming. And he's urging investors to incorporate new and more targeted ideas if they want to stay ahead in the 2020s. \"Although returns are likely to be lower in the 2020s than the 2010s, we believe stocks are still likely to outperform other publicly listed asset classes,\" he said.\"Large-cap technology stocks probably won't repeat their performance of the last decade, but other parts of the market do have the potential to deliver above-average growth.\" Haefele says these four trends have the potential to stand out the way tech did in the years ahead.(1) SustainabilityHaefele says the growing attention to climate change and ways to mitigate or reverse it will result in opportunities to invest in new companies, new products, and green bonds. He points specifically to the growing talk from European leaders about investments in green technology. \"Consumers, governments, and regulators are all going to be big drivers of a shift toward sustainable investments and products over the next decade, and we think that investors who get ahead of that trend will be rewarded,\" he wrote. One way to invest in sustainable companies is the iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF[2].(2) Genetic therapiesThere's been tremendous innovation in medications that treat diseases on a genetic level[3], and Haefele thinks that, too, is just getting started. \"We are now seeing a whole new generation of gene and cell therapies gaining regulatory approval to treat certain rare diseases and cancers,\" he said. \"Large-cap pharma is sitting up and taking note, and we therefore expect to see heightened deal activity in the next decade.\" He adds that diversification is particularly important in this field because of the high rate of failure for early-stage drug developers. Two ETFs that include several of those companies are the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF[4] and the Invesco Dynamic Biotech and Genome ETF[5].(3) Digital transformationHaefele hardly thinks tech's time in the sun is over, and picks a series of industries that are likely to advance and attract more investment in the years ahead. For example, he says 5G wireless revenue will nearly double in 2020, a springboard to even more growth afterward. \"The combination of 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and cloud computing will define a new era of digital transformation and innovation in the decade ahead,\" he said.\"We advise diversified investing focused on six key themes: digital data, enabling technologies, E-commerce, fintech, healthtech, and security and safety.\" Investors can gain exposure to some of those themes through theGlobal X Fintech ETF[6],Amplify Online Retail ETF[7], and theFirst Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity ETF[8].(4) WaterThe global population continues to grow, and that means demand for water will continue to climb. Haefele says the two most populous countries in the world, China and India, need far more fresh water than they have. He also notes that European countries are creating new water safety regulations that will encourage new investments.  \"The world faces a mismatch between water demand and supply, which will be exacerbated in the decade ahead by the effects of demographics and climate change,\" he said. \"Owing to the urgency and scale of water-related issues, and the need for capital spending in emerging markets, we expect continuous revenue and profit growth for the entire water value chain.\" One way to get exposure to that issue is through theInvesco Global Water ETF[9].NOW WATCH: A big-money investor in juggernauts like Facebook and Netflix breaks down the '3rd wave' firms that are leading the next round of tech disruption[10]See Also: A clinical psychologist explains how 4 biases are hurting your stock-picking abilities \u2014 and shares his best advice for conquering them[11]A manager of the No. 1 stock fund over the past 20 years attributes his success to a contrarian approach.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, April 29th. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. cases of the coronavirus have now surpassed the one million mark as more states ease lockdown restrictions and try to get back to work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, President Trump signing an executive order to keep meat processing plants open as concerns about food supplies now grow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, a look at the impact the pandemic is having on the U.S. economy when the GDP is reported for the first quarter. That will be out in about an hour and a half. Economists are expecting a contraction of 4 percent for the quarter. Some are looking for an even steeper decline. We will also be hearing from Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell later today. We will have all of that live later on Fox Business.</p><p>Another big earnings day this morning. Boeing is due out in half an hour. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that the aircraft maker is now facing a criminal probe into quality control issues on its still grounded 737 Max fleet. The company also reportedly looking to raise capital through a major bond sale. We'll bring you the Boeing numbers when they hit. The stock is up 1.25 percent.</p><p>General Electric reported earnings in the last hour, reporting trouble in the aviation business. The company says orders were down 14 percent due to the rapid decline in commercial aviation demand. The company targeting over $2 billion in cost cutting at GE. The stock is down this morning 2.5 percent.</p><p>After the bell tonight, attention turns to Microsoft, FaceBook and Tesla, all reporting quarterly numbers.</p><p>Futures this morning pointing to a gain at the start of trading this morning. We have a firmer tone for futures. Take a look. The Dow Industrials right now up 159 points. That's two-thirds of 1 percent. The S&amp;P is up 23 and the Nasdaq higher by 90 points. This after the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 erased early gains yesterday, actually ended negative. The Dow was down 32 points, the Nasdaq was down 122, and the S&amp;P down 15 at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet reporting a rise in revenue, but also reporting ad sales took a sudden downturn in the month of March as the coronavirus pandemic worsened.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mostly mixed. European indices -- oh there's Alphabet this morning, up better than 8 percent on the heels of those earnings last night.</p><p>France has announced it will tighten restrictions on foreign investments in French companies from outside of Europe. That's to limit foreign control over key sectors, including technology. This follows the U.S. Commerce Department adding more restrictions on exports to China to prevent them from getting any military technology. The European indices, as you can see, moving fractionally today. The FT, best performer.</p><p>In Asia overnight, slight gains there, and it was fractional moves. Japan is closed overnight for a holiday, as you can see there.</p><p>And let's check oil prices, this morning are bouncing after U.S. stockpiles rose less than expected. Hope is growing that demand will return as lockdowns ease up across the country. The price of oil now at $13.99. That's up 13 percent this morning.</p><p>Joining the conversation, Dagen McDowell, Steve Forbes and Jackie DeAngeles.</p><p>Great to see everybody today.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELES: Good to see you.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning include Covid-19 cases in the United States now topping 1 million as more states roll back restrictions this week. Today, Tennessee will allow retail stores to reopen at 50 percent capacity. Wisconsin is allowing non- essential businesses to do curbside drop-off of goods. Car washes will reopen and rentals for outdoor recreational equipment also ready to open.</p><p>In California, Governor Newsom outlined the state's four phases to reopen. He says that the state is just weeks away from reopening lower risk workplaces, like non-essential manufacturing, curbside pickup for retail and schools as well reopening there in California. The reopening of classrooms has been met with criticism, though, after Newsom suggested they may restart as early as July.</p><p>Simon Property Group reportedly planning to reopen nearly 50 shopping malls and outlet as soon as this Friday. This move coming as more states ease the stay at home restrictions. Shopping centers in Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, South Carolina, all among those opening on May 1st or May 2nd this weekend. There will be strict measures to control Covid-19, including reduced hours and free masks for shoppers. Simon Property Group shares this morning up better than 7 percent.</p><p>A massive joint worker strike set to hit some of the country's largest companies on Friday. Employees at Amazon, Target, Walmart, Whole Foods, FedEx and Instacart are all planning to walk off the job. They are demanding better pay and safety protections during this pandemic.</p><p>Friday is International Workers Day. That's also called May Day, you know, which is marked with protests across the world. So that will likely be the headline on Friday.</p><p>Joe Biden hoping a key endorsement from Hillary Clinton will help him win the female vote in November. The former presidential candidate herself made the announcement during a virtual town hall yesterday. Mrs. Clinton is the latest high profile Democrat to throw her support behind Joe Biden.</p><p>And Major League Baseball allowing teams to offer refunds to fans for games not being played because of coronavirus, this pandemic. The MLB exploring several different options for a possible return this summer, meanwhile, including splitting the league in three regional divisions, having teams play against rivals near them. The league is hoping to start the season no later than July, possibly in Florida, Texas or Arizona, before letting teams return to their home parks.</p><p>North Carolina's governor, meanwhile, says that Nascar's Coca-Cola 600 will likely run as scheduled. That's happening at the end of May unless health conditions worsen. Nascar wants to run the race Memorial Day weekend with teams social distancing and without fans in the stands.</p><p>Reopening the economy, topic a. Texas Governor Greg Abbott announcing plans for Texas to begin partially reopening by this Friday. The state easing restrictions on some businesses, like restaurants, movie theaters, retailers. The governor says a second wave of openings could happen as early as mid-May if the state sees further declines in the number of cases of coronavirus.</p><p>Joining me right now is House Appropriations Committee member and Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar.</p><p>Congressman Cuellar, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D-TX): Thank you so much and good morning to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what should we expect from Texas? How do you see this rolling reopen happening?</p><p>CUELLAR: You know, the governor's taking a measure of step by taking -- you know, trying to open up the economy in a very careful way. And I understand what he's trying to do because we do have to open up our economy. But we still have to answer four questions, do we have enough testing? Do we have a system to monitor and track cases? Are hospitals not working in a crisis mode? And are we seeing 14 days of cases going down? We have to answer those questions. And as we open up the economy in Texas, we have to just be flexible to make sure that we meet those conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what about testing, because I know that that's going to be key to getting back to work? And how is this -- how do you envision this? Do you think that people are going to have to get tested every day, every couple of days? I mean -- because you can get a test on Monday and then contract it on a Wednesday, right?</p><p>CUELLAR: Yes, of course. You know -- you know you could -- you could be OK one day and then have contract it another time. You're absolutely right. But we've still got to have tests or at least do one test of an individual at that time. And, I mean, look, money's not an issue. I mean Congress has put in billions of dollars. In fact, this bill that we voted on last week added $25 billion for testing. So it's just making sure we have the capacity to do the testing better than what we're doing now.</p><p>The health of the individual, Maria, is very important.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CUELLAR: And I understand the health of the economy is important also.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course. Lives and livelihoods.</p><p>Here's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, critical to making sure the economy stays open and people in the state stay healthy will be the contact tracing that gets done when someone does test positive. You need to have people in the healthcare system in Texas tracking down who has come in contact with that infected -- that positive individual.</p><p>Give us an update on the hiring, because I think that Texas needs to hire at least 1,000 new people to do contact tracing. And do you think the people of Texas who don't like government getting in their business will get on board with basically getting questioned about their contact with individuals?</p><p>CUELLAR: Well, you know, certainly that's one of the four factors that I mentioned that we've got to meet and tracking and tracing is going to be important. I think a lot of people depend and trust their local health department or the local providers and -- but we do need to have some assistance in making sure we have a system to monitor. Every part of the state of Texas, Texas is so large, I mean certain cities, like my hometown, Laredo, is trying to do its best. Houston, Dallas, San Antonio. So we're seeing different things getting there. But, again, if we don't meet the four conditions or try to get to them as soon as possible, testing, monitoring and tracking, as you said, hospitals not working in a crisis, seeing a couple weeks of cases going down, you know, we -- we, you know, we -- it -- we still have to open up the economy in phases and I want to do that. I'm part of the White House bipartisan group to look at this. And I made some -- on Monday I turned in my suggestions to the White House as to what we need to do and those four conditions are certainly part of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What were your suggestions?</p><p>CUELLAR: Well, you know, different things. You know, the four things that I mentioned -- but I also -- I'm a big believer in international trade. I, in fact, just right before this I was communicating with my friend, CBP -- Commissioner Mark Morgan from CBP. I think we need to do some testing, at least the temperature checks of people coming into the United States. We don't want to stop trade. But, for example, Laredo is still handling 6,000 -- 6,500 truckers that are coming from Mexico every day. There's still people coming in under a limited basis. So we need to at least take the temperature of those individuals. In fact, the president, yesterday, that was one of the suggestions I sent in and one of the suggestions that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CUELLAR: I mean one of the things the president said yesterday, that we need to start looking at possibly testing international travelers. And I agree with that. We've got to have the movement of trade, but we've still got to take some precautions.</p><p>Finally, the other thing that I suggested, one of the other things, was, you know, we depend a lot on Mexico and Canada and we've got to make sure that essential businesses in the U.S. are the same over there, because you can't have Mexico close some of the businesses that affect the chain supply in the United States. So we've got to have better coordination with our Mexican and Canadian friends when it comes to trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you, Congressman, before you go, real quick, when would you expect international travel, for example, from Italy to resume?</p><p>CUELLAR: That I don't know. I mean, I don't know if anybody knows that. But, I mean, I -- I still feel that as we ease up some of the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sounds like it's a 2021 affair. It -- it sounds like it's a 2021 affair, that's what I'm saying. I mean I don't -- that's probably going to be the last thing that they allow to happen again, international travel, where we know that the Covid-19 cases were pretty severe.</p><p>But we'll be watching that. It's an important piece of this.</p><p>CUELLAR: Oh, yes. I mean that -- that is certainly one of the things that - - that -- you're right. I mean that won't be one of the priorities, but -- but I still say that if people are coming in and, let me just talk about trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CUELLAR: Every day in Texas, you know, we have thousands of trucks that come in from Mexico. Mexico's doing things a little different from the U.S. And I'm saying that because of the essential trade and those things are not restricted, we ought to at least test some of the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I understand.</p><p>CUELLAR: You know, the people that are handling the trade that are still having to pass every day --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CUELLAR: Thousands of them and a least test those individuals.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's got be coordinated.</p><p>Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much.</p><p>Henry Cuellar joining us there.</p><p>CUELLAR: Thank you, Maria. Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, we've got a big hour coming up. The CEO and president of the Cleveland Clinic is here, Dr. Tom Mihaljevic. He is here on the latest vaccine efforts.</p><p>Plus, UBS America's president and head of global wealth management, Tom Naratil, joining me exclusively with his insight for investing over the long term.</p><p>The CEO of Subway Restaurants, John Chidsey joins us on the state of small business and the Paycheck Protection Program funding as well.</p><p>Plus, at 8:00 a.m. this morning, Louisiana Congressman, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise weighing in on the next round of funding for small business loans.</p><p>And I will speak with former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman on Hillary Clinton's endorsement of Joe Biden.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big two hours coming up right here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: Hopefully, by the time we get to this coming winter, then we will know whether or not we have a safe and effective vaccine. And then the challenge will be to scale it up enough to be able to distribute it meaningfully, both in this country and throughout the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Dr. Anthony Fauci predicting a Covid-19 vaccine could arrive sooner than first expected. Pfizer now this morning says that a new coronavirus vaccine could be tested as early as next week with the potential for emergency use by the fall. This as the number of virus cases in the United States is now topping 1 million.</p><p>Joining us right now is the Cleveland Clinic CEO and president, Dr. Tom Mihaljevic.</p><p>And, Dr. Tom, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>DR. TOM MIHALJEVIC, CEO AND PRESIDENT, CLEVELAND CLINIC: Thank you very much for having me. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, we love the Cleveland Clinic and you've joined us before, as has your predecessor. Tell us what your take-away is in all of this? We have cases topping 1 million. We seem to have seen a bit of a flattening of the curve, certainly in Ohio. What's your take-away so far of where we are with this?</p><p>MIHALJEVIC: At this point, here in Ohio, we have certainly seen the flattening of the curve. The number of newly infected patients has been stable over the last two and a half to three weeks. So what I would like to say is that we have gotten in control of the pandemic using social distancing and other measures that were implemented early.</p><p>Certainly now the next step ahead of us is to start to open, first and foremost, our hospitals to all patients who need medical care, not just those who are infected with Covid, because the number of the patients who are infected and hospitalized is low. They consume only 2 percent of our hospital capacity and, fortunately, the numbers continue to decline.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I know that the hospital industry was not in great financial shape going into this. That's why we saw so much consolidation. You had elective surgical procedures shut down. They are expected to resume next week in Ohio. What are the doctors and nurses seeing inside the Cleveland Clinic in terms of the financial part of this?</p><p>MIHALJEVIC: Well, first and foremost, the deferment of care and initial measures were absolutely appropriate to get a control of the infection and to free up a capacity that we thought and we will need to combat the pandemic. The unintended consequences that we have deferred care for so many.</p><p>Obviously, with the deferment of care, we have seen a decline in the financial performance across the healthcare industry. So -- so the -- the paradox is that very many hospitals are in bad financial shape, very many healthcare workers are being either laid off or furloughed. And we are certainly welcoming the opportunity to take care of all of our patients in coming weeks.</p><p>The really important thing here to emphasize is that hospitals are safe environment to provide care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All -- hospitals are a safe environment and they have been in some corners of the country over-run by coronavirus. People were worried that if you were a heart attack patient or a stroke victim you will -- will not be able to get the proper care because hospitals are overrun with coronavirus. Is that still the case today? Was that ever the case?</p><p>MIHALJEVIC: Well, that is still the case. People are afraid. And I think we have to recognize it. And they're concerned about going to the hospitals because they're concerned that they may contract the virus while being in a hospital.</p><p>I would like to use this opportunity to emphasize once again, hospitals are safe environment. The entire Cleveland clinic system, for example, with over 60,000 employees, we have only one of our employees who is hospitalized with coronavirus infection. And it is absolutely safe to seek care and it is really important to seek care when the care -- when the care is needed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And how is the care handled? What are you caring with? Are you looking at some of these trial drugs that we've been talking about, Gilead Sciences, Remdesivir? How are you treating this, Dr. Tom?</p><p>MIHALJEVIC: When it comes to Covid patients, we are involved in a number of different trials that span from new antiviral drugs that are currently being under investigation, to the new modalities (ph) to treating patients on the ventilators, and we're actively involved, as many other healthcare organizations are, in the development of a vaccine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We -- we -- we will leave it there. And I know you've sent 15 nurses, 10 doctors to help New York Presbyterian. You sent 13 nurses to help Henry Ford. Thank you so much for all that you're doing and your leadership.</p><p>Tom Mihaljevic, good to see you this morning. Thank you, sir.</p><p>MIHALJEVIC: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Power from the top down. FaceBook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has recast his board of directors at FaceBook to push aside dissenters and consolidate his decision-making power. That's according to \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning. Only four of the nine directors who began in 2019 on that board remain on that board. \"The Journal\" writes, it is far from certain that Mr. Zuckerberg's repositioning of FaceBook and his role at the top will lead to a lasting turnaround in its reputation following more than three years of controversy over the spread of misinformation, loose oversight of user data and the company's competitive practices.</p><p>A big story in \"The Journal\" this morning about this.</p><p>Dagen McDowell.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mark Zuckerberg founding the company, was tired of playing defense. The company was back on its heels. It didn't have a message to fight back against the Cambridge Analytica scandal, its sharing information about its users with advertisers and so he is taking the lead. He had a -- it was in December he had the top executives come to Hawaii to meet with him and you've seen this really play out during the coronavirus pandemic where FaceBook has stepped up trying to be a hub of information, trying to deliver on his manifesto, Zuckerberg's manifesto, from a few years ago of being this inclusive community. And he's also made, just in recent weeks, some business deals.</p><p>Just last week, FaceBook bought a $6 billion stake in a telecom operator in India and there's also a new video chat service that would rival Zoom called FaceBook Rooms. He is at the forefront.</p><p>And, you know, he is the face of this company, not Sheryl Sandberg, and he stepped into the fray and is leading.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No -- no, yes, I think -- I think you make a good point. But it is good to have people who push back on the board, just for -- just for fairness for yourself, just to get people to question. So we'll be watching that.</p><p>We are waiting on Boeing earnings, reporting first quarter earnings right after this break.</p><p>We'll take a break, come right back with those numbers.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome Back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, April 29th. Your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Today, we get a closer look at the impact of the coronavirus on the U.S. economy. We will get the first quarter GDP out later this morning as well as a string of earnings including Boeing which is going to be out any minute. Ahead of the numbers, markets are higher, Futures indicating a triple digit gain at the start of trading this morning up 112 points, that's one-half of one percent. The NASDAQ is up 65 and the S&amp;P is up 17 after the markets erase early gains yesterday to end the day in the red.</p><p>We got the Boeing numbers hitting the tape right now. As you can see, markets were lower yesterday. And global markets this morning are mixed. European indices are mixed with the FT-100 higher, but the CAC Quarante in France lower.</p><p>France announced it will tighten restrictions on foreign investments in French companies from outside of Europe, that's to limit foreign control over key sectors including technology. This follows the U.S. Commerce Department adding more restrictions on exports to China to prevent China from getting the U.S.'s military technology.</p><p>Asian markets were slightly higher overnight. Japan was closed for a holiday.</p><p>Let's get right to Cheryl Casone and check on Boeing earnings, they just came out. We were expecting a loss, that's what we got, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, we were expecting a loss of a $1.61, we got a loss of $1.70, so a little more of a loss than expected. The revenue, a miss. The expectation on revenue, $17.31 billion, they came in at $16.91 billion.</p><p>Also, they're talking about the 787, the production rate is going to be reduced from 14 per month down to 10 per month.</p><p>Also, staffing cuts, folks. They're talking about taking several actions to lower production for commercial aircraft and that does mean either voluntary basically -- you know, asking folks to retire or the company will have to take some kind of action as far as cuts. But I'm not getting a percent on those yet.</p><p>Also, the CEO is just now saying, David Calhoun, that the pandemic is affecting every aspect of our business including airline customer demand, production continuity and supply chain stability, really not a big surprise.</p><p>Also, they've got a huge backlog, a total backlog. That's of course that aircraft production story, the Max. Production going to be resuming at low rates, all they're saying is 2020, Maria. They're not giving a date for 737 Max production, that is one of the things that analysts were looking for.</p><p>Also, they're saying at this point, -- here's a new one. They might gradually increase Max production, the troubled 737 Max to 31 per month next year. So that'd be 2021. Stock is up 2-1/4 percent.</p><p>Looking for headlines about are they going to be working with banks, is there going to be a bond offering? Not saying anything yet. But I will say the stock is jumping on the news, a little more than 1-1/2 percent. It was up about 1-1/2 percent though just going into this, though, so actually not the reaction Maria that I thought we would see.</p><p>Cash flow, primarily because of the Max grounding is still an issue for the company and also they're going back to the production cost (INAUDIBLE) because of the Max. So a lot of Max headlines are crossing here, Maria. And not really in a good way. The company definitely taking a hit from that aircraft.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the company was taking a hit going into these earnings, Dagen McDowell, with the -- with the shutdown of the Max jet. We still might see some kind of investment from government in Boeing. You know, you heard what Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary said on this show a couple weeks ago. Look, we'd like to do something with Boeing but we're waiting to hear back. Boeing was the one pushing back, saying we don't want any equity stakes from government.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right, Boeing clearly doesn't want the government being involved in its business and is trying its level best to shore up its finances here. One headline in this earnings report, cash and investments in marketable securities increased to $15.5 billion compared to $10 billion at the beginning of the quarter. That's what's at play here with Boeing.</p><p>So Boeing has been working with the investment banks on a multibillion- dollar bond fueled financing package. Again, trying to right its balance sheet as it weathers what is a historic downturn in this business because of the pandemic.</p><p>One thing to note, because it had considered applying for this Treasury assistance, it doesn't want the government involved via an equity stake. If they can get this bond program in place, the Fed, because of one of it, this primary market corporate credit facility, would essentially be there to backstop that credit facility and would be there to provide some support for those banks lend -- or people lending Boeing money. So that's credit -- I mean, incredibly important to watch.</p><p>But remember, Boeing is under both criminal and civil scrutiny into quality control problems related to the 737 Max assembly line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and that's in the Journal this morning as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The company is also saying that it is exploring all options in terms of liquidity. So there's the comment regarding liquidity and whether or not we will see any government help. But the company says it is sure and comfortable that it will find the necessary liquidity that it needs to run operations.</p><p>So Boeing shares this morning are up even though we've got a miss on the bottom and the top line. We expected that things would be down. We are also waiting on the official announcement that they will cut head count, that is also swirling around trading desks this morning. The stock right now up 2- 1/2 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, wealthy investors apparently sticking by their stocks despite all of this market volatility around coronavirus. This according to a new survey by UBS, finding that almost half of wealthy investors globally expect to keep their portfolios intact at the same level in the next six months. While 37 percent plans to invest more.</p><p>Joining us right now to break down these results of the survey in a Fox Business exclusive is UBS Americas president and head of Global Wealth Management, Tom Naratil. Tom, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>Interesting to see these high end investors appearing confident over the long term. They're not allowing the short-term upsets to change their positioning, is that right?</p><p>TOM NARATIL, PRESIDENT, UBS AMERICAS: That's absolutely right, they're very realistic about the -- about the short-term. We see this in the U.S. and globally. Certainly they're aware of the impact on the economy in the short run, but they're -- but they're looking forward. They're looking forward to what will -- what will happen going out to six months into the future. They do have a lot of cash on the sidelines and they're looking for places to put that to work in risk assets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we had -- we had Mike Milken on yesterday. He said, look, financial markets are doing exactly what financial markets should do, provide liquidity. And let's not forget, there are a lot of areas of this market that are doing very well. Look at big tech, look at biotech, look at a handful of retailers like Walmart sitting near all-time highs as well.</p><p>What are your investors that you've spoken with saying about buying opportunities right now? Are these areas you want to tap into or are the valuations now problematic?</p><p>NARATIL: No, we actually -- we actually break it down, Maria, into thinking about maybe two waves. One is, where do you still have assets that are mispriced in the current environment? And what should we be thinking about in the future?</p><p>If you think about those mispriced assets, we think the credit markets are discounting the potential for recovery where the equity markets are anticipating it. So we would say that the high yield markets, investment grade markets, emerging market dollar denominated debt are all very attractive opportunities currently because they're mispriced relative to equities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we've got Steve Forbes on the panel today and of course Steve, you are a member of the president's task force in terms of reopening the economy. I want to get Tom's take on reopening the economy. But first, give us your take in terms of what needs to be done to see these rolling openings go well?</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA: Well, the key is not to back off. You're going to see some cases rise, but we knew that the virus is still out there. So the key is to keep that thing rolling open.</p><p>And the real debate inside the White House is whether they should push for a payroll tax moratorium which would help businesses, lower labor costs, will help people to keep more of what they earn.</p><p>But I'm wondering with Tom in terms of the optimistic outlook for the future, is the politics. If you get election result in this country, that's going to mean rising taxes and more regulation, that's a very different environment, economic environment than the opposite.</p><p>Are investors looking at the political situation here, not to mention Europe and the rest of the world in creating an environment where people can feel confident that the economy really will grow again or we're going to have the kind of stagnation we had after 2009?</p><p>NARATIL: Steve, those are -- those are really good points. Even though the way that we're looking at that is a bit the way the U.S. came out of World War II. Debt levels will rise to similar levels as a percentage of GDP that we saw during the Second World War and yet there was an opportunity for strong economic growth following that.</p><p>What's really going to be key here is thinking about proper financial planning for the possibility that taxes may rise. Second will be looking at industries that we think will do better in the future. Things like health tech, things like genetic therapy, industries that focus on providing faster broadband if telemedicine is going to be successful, then having lack of access to high speed broadband will be a question between life and death for some people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's a good point. Let me ask you, we're waiting to hear from Jay Powell later, Tom and Cornerstone Macro is out with a report this morning. They say we are expecting the Fed to signal that rates will stay at zero until 2023, Tom. That implies persistent downward pressure on nearer dated yields.</p><p>What are you seeing in terms of the rock bottom rates? Has that been helpful in terms of getting deals done, any refinancing boom perhaps helping the economy, what has been the impact there and what are the customers you're talking with doing with rates this low?</p><p>NARATIL: Well, it will -- it will certainly help growth and investment in the future and we're getting back to the TINA moments, there is no other alternative. And that's why the equity market is going to be attracting cash.</p><p>With rates this low, other than that mispricing that we currently see in the investment grade market which is largely due to one of the factors that you mentioned, there is a need to issue debt. It will be a good time for investors to commit to the -- to the industries that will succeed in the future.</p><p>However, cash will be something that will sit in an investor's liquidity portfolio for safety factors, not for return factors in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. And Tom, thank you for the firm committing all those millions to the COVID-19 relief efforts in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, $500,000 going toward relief efforts in Canada, Mexico, Brazil as well. We're all feeling it and giving back. Tom, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you, sir.</p><p>NARATIL: Thank you, Maria. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom Naratil is the president of UBS.</p><p>Coming up, I'll speak with the CEO of Subway Restaurants, John Chidsey is here, right after the break. His take on the latest round of PPP funding as America's small businesses fight for survival.</p><p>Then, a graduation gift from Oprah, how she is teaming up with Facebook to give graduates across the country an unprecedented commencement speech. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The latest round of Paycheck Protection Program funding is underway this morning, complete with a new set of rules in place for small businesses navigating the system.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of Subway Restaurants, John Chidsey. John, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>Are you seeing a lot of Subway franchisees applying for these PPP loans?</p><p>JOHN CHIDSEY, CEO, SUBWAY RESTAURANTS: Yes, we are, Maria. I'd say about 92 to 95 percent of our franchisees have applied for either PPP or EIDL. I think as you know, Subway unlike a lot of other QSR Systems, while it's the largest in the U.S. and the largest globally, we're literally made up of franchisees that have two to three restaurants. So we are the ultimate small business owner, 100 percent franchise and these loans programs are just so important to make sure our franchisees can survive this crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So are you comfortable with the structure of this? I mean, 75 percent of the money has to go right out to employees so that they get compensated while they're not working. You've got only 25 percent to pay rent and other businesses. Are you comfortable with that structure? Are you comfortable with the structure of the clock starts ticking as soon as you get the loan, you've got eight weeks to pay it back, regardless of if you're open or not.</p><p>CHIDSEY: I mean, obviously we would prefer to have had some --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm sorry, eight weeks to get it forgiven. Obviously, if you pay it back -- if you pay that money to employees within eight weeks the loan is forgiven.</p><p>CHIDSEY: Correct. Yes, I mean, as an industry -- you know, we lobbied for some tweaks in that program. We would have preferred not to have seen the 75 percent, we would have preferred to have seen a lesser amount because I think as you know and your viewers know, things like rent and other payments in the restaurant industry can often be as big or bigger than payroll and that's as important as payroll.</p><p>So yes, we would have preferred to see that loosen. But -- you know, we'll take whatever help we can get at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do you think that most of the Subway franchisees will survive? What's your take on the state of Subway and the fast food industry overall?</p><p>CHIDSEY: Yes, actually I do. I have a lot of confidence in Subway in the sense of -- again, most of our franchisees are small operators. The cost to operate a Subway is substantially less than a lot of other brands given -- you know, the smaller footprints, given the foods that we serve. And so, labor is not quite as much of an issue, footprints are smaller so therefore rents are somewhat smaller. So I think our economic model actually insulates us better than a lot of other chains out there.</p><p>And then secondly, you know, take-out, delivery, where the industry's gone over the past few years is going to play very nicely I think into the way the economy unfolds over the coming months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, this is a really important question. So how do you think things will change once we get out of this? I mean, that's one of the issues that we've been zeroing in on in terms of how things look different. Are you making changes to the Subway Restaurants?</p><p>CHIDSEY: Sure. I mean, I don't think anybody has a crystal ball and understands exactly how it's going to unfold over the coming months or quarters even. But yes, I mean, we're obviously doubling down on -- you know, all employees are going to have wellness checks before they come in, temperature checks, everybody is going to be wearing gloves, everybody is going to be wearing masks, we're going to keep all the ingredients -- you know, covered at all times.</p><p>We've really got a big push on in terms of contactless take-out, third party delivery, and so nobody really knows how long it will take for people to become comfortable with in restaurant dining again.</p><p>So I think we all have to really be prepared for the fact that that could take quarters before people begin to feel comfortable coming back and eating inside restaurants which again is why I think Subway and other QSR chains are ideally positioned for how I think things are going to unroll in the future here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Were the restaurants opened these last six weeks? Obviously the food companies are essential, were you guys open or was this a significant hit? How big a hit was it in terms of the COVID impact?</p><p>CHIDSEY: Well, actually, about 85 percent of our restaurants actually did stay open. So you can imagine the ones that are on college campuses and -- you know, things like that that shut down or in malls, there's nothing you can do about those. But the ones that are free-standing, you know, drive- throughs are in lines, the vast majority though stayed open.</p><p>And again, just having a lower breakeven point in a lot of our competitors I think allowed us to stay open and to do reasonably well. Not just the great by any stretch. But from a -- from a unit staying open stand point, I think we fared pretty well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, John, we'll leave it there. Great to talk with you this morning. We'll be watching the developments. Thank you, sir. John Chidsey this morning.</p><p>CHIDSEY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: CEO at Subway Restaurants.</p><p>Still ahead, an unprecedented ceremony for the class of 2020, Oprah joins forces with Facebook to bring graduates the gift of a lifetime, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the morning buzz. First up, Oprah spreading some cheer to 2020 graduates. She's delivering an online commencement address hosted by Facebook and Instagram next month. Miley Cyrus joining in with a special performance of her hit song, The Climb. Dagen, your thoughts?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that this is awesome. So this is all going to happen on May the 15th and a shoutout to my -- one of my nieces, Phoebe who's graduating from high school in the coming weeks. So this is a huge letdown for so many people graduating from high school and college.</p><p>Also providing some words of wisdom are Jennifer Garner, Simone Biles and Awkwafina to name a few. This is part of what we were talking about. Mark Zuckerberg also really trying to kind of shine up the company, Facebook and Instagram's image during this coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>And to the angry person who was tweeting at me, calling me Mark Zuckerberg's mouth piece, I just say this, kiss my grits.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my God. I love graduation season. I will also give an address for Iona College and it will be virtual, so I'm looking forward to that. But yes, it's a really -- it's a different year for the 2020 graduates, something none of us have ever experienced. We'll see what happens in the coming years in terms of these graduation ceremonies.</p><p>Great for Oprah and I don't know what they're saying out there in terms of mouth piece, Dagen, but you've got him with that comment, I guess. I don't know what to say.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why are people angry? And like angry, Facebook is trying to do something good. It's trying to improve its image which was awful anyway, I digress. You continue --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, how about this? More Americans -- how about this? More Americans are refusing to pop the question. U.S. marriage rates falling to their lowest level on record, down six percent in 2018, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Financial strain and changing relationship norms contributing to this dive and this doesn't have anything to do with coronavirus, Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: No, actually, it doesn't. I was surprised to read that. So this was happening, this decline starting 2018. You mentioned financial strains on people, that's one reason they're not getting married. But also it's sort of the new trend of being able to live together or being in a committed relationship without necessarily having to tie the knot.</p><p>What's interesting too, to bring it back to this pandemic, I mean, I have surveyed and talked to a ton of people who are under quarantine and staying at home with their significant other or their spouse. I myself am engaged and you know, I've learned a lot during the quarantine period, let's just say, things that we haven't necessarily seen before.</p><p>And it's been interesting because you learn about your spouse and your partner and you're not used to spending so much time together but on average couples are spending 20 extra hours together, Maria.

The top dividend-paying stocks are still paying as much as, or in many cases, more than the 30-year Treasury bond. A new report from UBS updates the firm's top dividend ruler stocks list.</p><p><br/> The UBS team remains very positive on the metrics surrounding the U.S. economy. While growth remains solid despite sluggishness overseas, U.S. consumer confidence is at post-recession highs and businesses are finally investing for future growth, after years of holding back spending. Third-quarter SP 500 earnings are on track to increase more than 10%, the fastest growth in three years.<br/> We screened the UBS list for the top yielding stocks to buy now.<br/>Dominion Resources Inc.(NYSE: D) is expected to grow the company dividend 7% this year, in line with the past four years. The company pulled in operating revenue of $3.2 billion for the most recent three-month period, beating estimates by 4.8%. Although Dominion has boosted sales, it kept less than expected as profit. The company recently had some headline issues as a Virginia nuclear plant has fuel rod issues. Fortunately, everything was contained with no environmental damage. Many analysts on Wall Street think that the new EPA bill may actually provide a tailwind for this top utility.<br/>Dominion Resourcesinvestors are paid a 3.30% dividend. The Thomson/First Call consensus price target for the stock is $73.60. Shares closed Friday at $73.89.<br/> ALSO READ: 4 Big Tech Stocks Ready to Breakout and Trade Higher[1]<br/>Intel Corp.'s (NASDAQ: INTC) new commitment to smartphone and mobile applications, combined with the resurgence of PC growth this year, has made it one of the best large cap value stocks to buy in 2014, and the same outlook can drive the stock next year. Inteltrades at 15 times forward earnings, more than in recent years, but still a reasonable multiple for investors looking for growth. The UBS team cited lower beta, a very fair dividend yield and operating leverage as good reasons to invest in the chip giant.<br/>Intelshareholders are paid a solid 2.7% dividend. UBS has a $37.50 target, while the consensus target is $34.77. Intelclosed Friday at $33.74.<br/>Northeast Utilities (NYSE: NU) raised its dividend 7% in February, and it is expected to continue to grow dividends between 6% and 8%. The company serves 3.6 million electric and natural gas customers in three New England states. The company notes that, 'The region's renewable and carbon mandates are not achievable under the current market framework.' That's why it is building transmission lines to connect hydro-power in Canada to the northeast markets it serves, among other projects. The combination of transmission assets and renewable power will put Northeast Utilities in a solid position when it asks for rate hikes. Both tend to be viewed positively by regulators.<br/> Investors are paid a 3.1% dividend. The consensus price objective is $48.61. Shares closed higher than that figure Friday at $50.70.<br/> ALSO READ: 14 IPOs Scheduled for the Week of November 10[2]<br/>Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) announced it will continue to grow dividends and expects to begin buying back more shares this year and beyond, a double plus for shareholders. The company finally rewarded activist investors this year when it announced the spin-off its California assets into a separate company. Occidental had faced calls from Wall Street and activist investors for years to split its U.S. business from its international operations, with analysts valuing the assets at a range of between $19 billion to $22 billion.<br/>Occidental shareholders are paid a 3.3% dividend. The UBS price target is $104, and the consensus target for this beaten down energy company is $105.33. Shares closed Friday at $88.04.<br/>British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE: BTI) announced earlier this year a 6% dividend increase. The company's predictable cash flow translates into very consistent dividend growth. The stock got a nice lift after the merger of Lorillard and Reynolds was announced. That merger has been slowed by regulators reviewing antitrust issues, but in the end, most on Wall Street feel it will be completed.<br/> Investors are paid an outstanding 4.2% dividend. The consensus price target for the European-based tobacco giant is $129. The shares closed trading on Friday at $114.24.<br/> ALSO READ: 4 Oil Service Stocks With Huge Upside Despite Lower Oil Prices[3]<br/> With the prospects for a positive fourth quarter and strength into 2015, more conservative investors may want to focus on these top growth and income stocks.

See more UCLA In the News. The #MeToo paradox: Movement topples the powerful, not the ordinary | New York Times      Michael Chwe, a political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, argues that creating common knowledge usually requires \u201cpublic rituals\u201d: rallies, media events and other shared experiences that cannot only persuade people but show them what others believe.  How UCLA students fought for \u2014 and won \u2014 the right to shape Westwood\u2019s future | Los Angeles magazine      Paavo Monkkonen, an associate professor of urban planning and public policy at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Policy, says that for decades, single-family homeowners in neighborhoods adjacent to campus worked against the interests of UCLA students, faculty, and staff, \u201cby restricting bike lanes, nightlife, and new housing.\u201d The previous council was the official voice of the area, and, according to Monkkonen, it too often used that voice to object to necessary new housing construction\u2026. In September, Monkkonen released a position paper on how and why opportunities for new, dense housing to address the state\u2019s housing need are often blocked by vocal opposition neighborhood councils like in Westwood. In part, Monkkonen concluded, \u201cThe vocal advocacy of a handful of neighbors is often framed as local democracy, but many of these processes exclude the majority of a neighborhood\u2019s residents and explicitly favor those with more money and time.\u201d  New Trump policy makes it easier for big tech to discriminate, insiders say | The Guardian      Industry groups have long pushed for these kinds of changes that would make it harder for the government to scrutinize their labor practices, said Tia Koonse, legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center. </p><p>U.S. colleges raise $47 billion in ninth straight record year | Bloomberg      Among top fund-raisers, second-place Stanford University attracted $1.1 billion and Columbia gathered $1 billion. The University of California at Los Angeles raised $787 million and UC San Francisco took in $730 million. (Also: Chronicle of Higher Education)  Racist dormitory door messages bring new attention to policy | Inside Higher Ed      With the rule, Michigan is meeting its First Amendment obligations, said Eugene Volokh, the Gary T. Schwartz distinguished professor of law at University of California, Los Angeles, and a constitutional scholar. By allowing students to hang whiteboards and decorate their doors, Michigan has created a \u201climited public forum\u201d that it cannot regulate with restrictions on viewpoints, Volokh said.  CIA may have used contractor who inspired \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 to kill RFK, new book alleges | Washington Post      Pease and others argue that there were simply \u201ctoo many holes\u201d in the pantry for Sirhan to have been a lone gunman, and that witnesses were certain the holes in the frames were caused by bullets. She even found a video in an archive at the University of California at Los Angeles that appears to show bullets in the frames. Wolfer\u2019s work as a crime scene analyst was later harshly discredited by California authorities.  Taking gun control to the people after Parkland | The Atlantic      Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles and the author of \u201cGunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America,\u201d explained to me that Florida has been a leader in the gun-rights movement for over thirty years, on the forefront of both the concealed-carry movement and stand your ground laws. It would be a particular feat if BAWN passed such a strict gun control measure in Florida\u2019s gun-friendly political climate, he said.  Six steps to turn regret into self-improvement | New York Times      (Column written by UCLA\u2019s Jennifer Taitz) As a clinical psychologist, one of my most important tasks in helping people lead healthy, happy and meaningful lives is to teach them evidence-based strategies to manage their emotions. That includes how to use regrets to motivate them. I\u2019ve found that even when people feel stuck in endless what ifs, it\u2019s possible to recalibrate. Here\u2019s how.  UCLA researchers use music therapy to help premature babies | KPCC-FM      At UCLA Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital, music therapists are working with parents of premature infants to write songs and make recordings that the babies can listen to when parents can\u2019t be there. But the music is also used to help preemies learn to feed so they can leave the hospital sooner. (UCLA\u2019s Sandra Chea is cited; UCLA\u2019s Jenna Bollard is interviewed.)  Does social media push teens to depression? | HealthDay      \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more sophisticated than the prior reports,\u201d said John Piacentini, director of the UCLA Center for Child Anxiety Resilience Education and Support. \u201cI believe it. I think it\u2019s a nice contribution, and it clarifies this question in an important way.\u201d  Nuclear winter is still a hot topic as a new arms race heats up | The Verge      As nuclear tensions start rising again, the threat of a nuclear winter is coming back into the frame. It\u2019s a subject worth talking about, says Richard Turco, a professor emeritus at UCLA and one of the authors of the 1983 scientific paper that first proposed the idea. \u201cAlthough there is a relatively low probability of nuclear winter happening, the potential consequences would be catastrophic \u2014 namely the destruction of human civilization,\u201d Turco says in an email to The Verge.  Is kombucha good for you? | The Guardian      \u201cInside our gut, each of us has at least 100tn microbes,\u201d says Prof Zhaoping Li, head of clinical nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cEven if one of these foods contains 100m microbes, it\u2019s very trivial in comparison. Many of them will be killed when passing through our stomach and if they make it to the gut, it\u2019s not touching anything.\u201d \u2026 \u201cKoreans have a lower risk factor for bowel disease than Americans,\u201d Li says, \u201cbut that isn\u2019t necessarily because they eat more fermented foods. It could be genetics or because they eat more fish or the fact that overeating is less common. There are so many potential confounding factors at play.\u201d  Blood cells may hold key to \u2018fountain of youth\u2019 | Press Trust of India      Steve Horvath of the University of California, Los Angeles, crunched cellular ages using 353 distinct methylation sites found on blood cell DNA. The researchers provided the first experimental evidence that the aging clock of blood cells is cell-intrinsic, and not set by interactions with other cell types in the body. They are now working to identify mechanisms that can change the clock.  California made it hard to avoid vaccinating kids. Medical waivers have tripled. Now what? | CALmatters      Robert Kim-Farley, professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said adapting for doctors requirements similar to those veterinarians must meet to exempt dogs from rabies vaccines. Vets must submit a form to a local health official for review, and a granted waiver expires after one year. \u201dWhen that oversight occurs, they quickly learn they are not going to get this through unless it\u2019s a really serious situation like the dog is having chemotherapy,\u201d Kim-Farley said. Similarly, \u201cphysicians need to give a cogent, logical reason why this patient should not receive a vaccine.\u201d  From paradise to landfill: Beloved California beach covered in trash | The Guardian      Tina Treude, the director of the marine center at UCLA\u2019s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, says that California is far ahead of most places when it comes to political actions like banning single-use plastic bags statewide. But it\u2019s far from enough. Biodegradable plastic bags, too, make their way into the ocean, and Treude is skeptical about their ability to break down. When she and a student buried typical plastic polyethylene plastic bags and biodegradable plastic bags in sediment in their lab in 2016, they didn\u2019t see any change in either set of bags after 100 days. Biodegradable plastic bags may break down in landfills where the temperatures get high, but the natural conditions in the ocean don\u2019t appear to help degrade the plastic microbially, she explained.  New treatment for painful Peyronie\u2019s disease | New York Times      \u201cFor the most part, men suffer in silence,\u201d Dr. Jesse N. Mills, director of the Men\u2019s Clinic at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in an interview. Given his urological specialty, Dr. Mills said he sees about 20 new patients a week with Peyronie\u2019s, many of whom seek help after seeing ads for Xiaflex online. \u201cI don\u2019t think the incidence has changed in the last 500 years, but more men are realizing there may be an effective treatment, though we still lack a celebrity patient who will do for Peyronie\u2019s what Bob Dole did for erectile dysfunction,\u201d the urologist said.  How gambling can turn addictive for Southeast Asian refugees | Connecticut Public Radio      \u201cGambling is seen as an opportunity out of poverty,\u201d said Dr. Timothy Fong, a professor of addiction psychiatry and co-director of UCLA\u2019s Gambling Studies Program. \u201cWhen you have tremendous amounts of poverty, especially in the Southeast Asian refugee population, that tends to be a very tempting idea.\u201d  Green New Deal aims to move United States to 100 percent renewable energy | KPCC-FM      \u201cIt\u2019s also a new vision of our transportation system, to have zero-emission vehicles over time. And including building for adaptation and resilience, and understanding the impacts of climate change. All of that is work that we have been doing in California, with our various programs,\u201d said UCLA\u2019s Sean Hecht (Audio download)  \u2018Roma\u2019 explored 1970s Mexico. Here\u2019s how issues in the film have played out | KNBC-LA      \u201cShe is very lucky,\u201d said Kevin Terraciano, professor of history and director of the Latin American Institute at UCLA. Indigenous servant women are not always treated well.  Can utilities survive with \u2018massive\u2019 wildfire risks? | E&amp;amp;E News      \u201cThe amount of liability is massive,\u201d said Sean Hecht, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s massive because climate change is making fires burn faster and hotter.... It\u2019s also massive because we have more people living in areas that are more vulnerable. And it\u2019s also because utilities don\u2019t do as good a job as they ought to of maintaining all of their lines.

In her words:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They are not expected to take a significant share of the market from the biggest banks.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whether or not this specific group takes market share, the threat facing incumbents from new competition, regulation and innovation is real.</p><p>To take a look at how we got here let's rewind to 2007. Nearly ten years ago, on 9<sup>th</sup> August that year, the European Central Bank injected almost 100bn into the European banking system, after problems emerged in the sub-prime mortgage sector.</p><p>The banking crisis sent shockwaves running through the world's largest banks that still reverberate today.</p><p>In response to the crisis, central banks across the globe cut interest rates to near zero. For many years now, this is where they have remained.</p><p>Low interest rates have placed significant pressure on bank margins. Coupled with higher compliance costs and increased capital requirements, this has pushed European post-crisis bank returns below their cost of equity.</p><p>At the same time, a new wave of start-ups, enabled by technology and a healthy appetite from venture capital investors, have emerged to challenge individual parts of the financial services value chain.</p><p>Everywhere a bank looks across its product offering, it is fighting new competition from a fintech company.</p><p>The challenge posed to banks by new technology and regulation is about to go up a gear. Business models of incumbent banks are coming under significant threat.</p><p>For years, successive UK Governments have puzzled over how to stimulate competition in the banking industry. While there is still debate on issues such as data privacy and customer consent, we anticipate the government's wish will finally be fulfilled. Competition in the banking sector will explode as a result.</p><p>New, so-called 'open banking' regulations are coming into force in the UK and across Europe with the objective of stimulating further competition in the banking sector.</p><p>This is a marriage of two very dangerous business opportunities - new regulation and new technology - which will combine to reform banks' business models.</p><p>The old world of 'closed banking' involves a single bank entity producing and distributing a wide range of commoditised financial products to apathetic customers that see little value in switching providers.</p><p>The new world of 'open banking' means competition for both who provides the products, and who distributes them.</p><p>Increased competition can't just be driven by technology and regulation. Customers have to want change as well.</p><p>Switching rates may have been slow to date, but our data suggests a strong appetite for change.</p><p>We asked consumers what might induce them to move banks and the most striking thing about what they told us was the sheer breadth of ideas that customers would embrace.</p><p>For example, over a third told us they would switch banks if a competitor offered compelling biometric driven app access and security. And nearly half said deals and offers tailored to their personal circumstances would get them to switch.</p><p>New propositions are already emerging to fill these gaps and whilst customers already have an idea of which new services might be valuable to them, it is worth remembering that famous Henry Ford quote about the invention of the motor car:</p><p>\"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said 'faster horses'\".</p><p>We can't necessarily predict what new innovations will transform the world of banking, or what great services of tomorrow will change the way we manage our money. But we do know that change is coming and banks must respond.</p><p>Banks must decide what role they want to play in the lives of their customers.</p><p>Our view is that the most likely future for banking is a new model, where customers can be offered the products of different providers from a single interface.</p><p>What is less clear to us, is which companies are best placed to own that interface.</p><p>There are compelling reasons why incumbent banks could fill this role. They have the trust of their customers, they understand financial regulations, and they have unparalleled insight into customers' financial history.</p><p>However, there are equally compelling reasons why big tech giants, start-ups, or even price comparison websites might be better placed to take the lead role.</p><p>The bank of the future is just around the corner. It won't look like the banks we know today. It won't talk like the banks we know today. It might not even be a bank we know today.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The spat could complicate Britain\u2019s efforts to forge a\u00a0 post-Brexit trade deal with the US.\u00a0</p><p>Some UK-based tech companies are particularly concerned about the risk of double taxation. This is because EU competition rules, which still apply in the Brexit transition period running until the end of the year, prevent UK companies from offsetting the digital levy against others, such as corporation tax.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s deeply disappointing that we will now have a system where successful, profitable and tax-paying UK tech companies face the prospect of double taxation from a DST that was originally aimed at international tax avoiders,\u201d said Paul Harrison, chief financial officer at\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3ac6989e-8e94-4ba1-8680-64ab698a6464\"> Just Eat</url>, the UK-based food-ordering service that is among the British tech companies likely to be most affected.\u00a0\u201cIt is a badly designed policy that will severely undermine the UK tech industry.\u201d</p><p>In a concession to their critics the government on Wednesday\u00a0agreed to consider whether to exempt \u201cmarketplace delivery fees\u201d, such as those charged by Just Eat and Deliveroo for ferrying food orders to customers\u2019 doorsteps.\u00a0</p><p>However, Just Eat\u2019s core business, where diners order from traditional takeaway restaurants through its app, will still be hit by the new tax.\u00a0\u201cThat clearly doesn\u2019t go far enough,\u201d Mr Harrison said of the potential delivery fee exemption.\u00a0</p><p>Just Eat commissioned a report last year from the Centre for Economics and Business Research, an economics consultancy, which found the digital services tax will place a \u201csignificant burden on UK domestic tech companies\u201d, including \u00a370m in additional taxes in the first year after its introduction and hundreds of millions of pounds more in lost investment thereafter.</p><p>The report added the tax would put UK tech companies at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d to overseas competitors.\u00a0</p><p>The measure, which affects companies with annual global revenue of more than \u00a3500m and \u00a325m plus of UK sales from relevant activities, is meant to ensure that online transactions such as advertising are taxed where customers or users live.</p><p>The UK initiative is just one of many by countries keen to secure more tax from US tech companies.\u00a0</p><p>These unilateral measures come despite efforts to forge a new set of global rules for digital taxation\u00a0by the OECD, the Paris-based international organisation, by the end of this year.\u00a0</p><p>The Treasury said the UK\u2019s new digital tax will be repealed once a global agreement is in place. \u201cOur strong preference is for an appropriate global solution,\u201d a spokespeSrson said.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The Johnson government has given industry the impression it is eager to take on \u201cbig tech\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you go into the Treasury, there is a huge institutional push on this issue,\u201d said one tech industry lobbyist. \u201cOne official said to me: \u2018To be blunt, you just need to pay more tax\u2019.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The government on Wednesday signalled it would accept the recommendations of the Furman Review, a report published last year which urged the creation of a new\u00a0\u201cdigital markets unit\u201d to \u201csupport greater competition and consumer choice in digital markets\u201d. The government also said it would revisit any UK or EU regulations that might \u201centrench monopoly behaviours\u201d.\u00a0<br/></p><p>However, the industry argues the digital services tax will harm the competitiveness of high-growth UK companies that the government should be championing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat we have here is a problem of international taxation,\u201d said Julian David, chief executive of TechUK, a trade body which represents hundreds of UK and multinational tech companies, including Amazon, eBay, Deliveroo and Uber.</p><p>\u201cTrying to fix that at a country level is really unhelpful\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009If you end up\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009with individual systems, British-based companies are going to get caught up in different tax regimes.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>In the UK, online transactions account for more than 20 per cent of all retail sales, say analysts, second only to China among large internet markets.\u00a0</p><p>Several British ecommerce companies have been operating now for two decades or more, including Trainline and Skyscanner in travel, Asos and Boohoo in fashion, and Ocado and Just Eat in food ordering. Newer, fast-growing ventures that operate online marketplaces include Depop in clothing and Deliveroo in food.\u00a0</p><p>Not all UK-based online retailers would be affected by the digital services tax, but those that act as intermediaries in a marketplace, such as Just Eat, Deliveroo and Trainline, are likely to come within its scope.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">[</emphasis>Mr David said at its heart, the digital services tax was a vote-winning \u201cpopulist measure\u201d, rather than a levy that would generate meaningful additional revenues for the Treasury.\u00a0</p><p>Despite the\u00a0damage to some firms from the digital service tax, other tech industry lobbyists gave a cautious welcome to other measures in the Budget, including a boost to R&amp;D and the threat of tougher regulation for Big Tech.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe budget delivers a strong signal to innovative British tech start-ups that this Government is for them,\u201d said Dom Hallas, executive director of Coadec, which represents UK tech ventures.\u00a0\u201cBut there\u2019s still lots more to do to really turbocharge the tech scene, and the devil will be in the detail of a number of consultations announced today.\u201d\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-a2ccbba85f0e11eab0ab339c2307bcd4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCK-9KD1-DXP9-90M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1109\"/><timeReceived>11:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 11, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Eurostat will then aggregate the data by municipality and publish that data on a Member State and individual region level.</p><p>This collaborative venture represents an initial step by the EC in tackling the absence of regular and reliable data in this area, and recognises the need to balance: (a) the opportunities for micro-entrepreneurs using these growing platforms; and (b) adverse societal effect on local communities of landlords using their properties for short term lets, e.g. increasing property prices.</p><p>While this agreement has been universally welcomed, it is noted that there are other categories of information that could also be useful from a policy-making perspective, such as the number of listings, hosts, beds and types of accommodation.</p><p>A number of cities including Paris, Barcelona, Berlin and Amsterdam have previously sought to place restrictions on the use of short-stay accommodation platforms, but this has not always been successful. For example, on 19 December 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the EU's most senior court) ruled that Airbnb did not have to meet particular regulatory requirements as it was correctly classified as an intermediation service rather than an estate agent (a stark contrast to their ruling on Uber with respect to the transportation services space). This new data sharing agreement does not tackle the limited regulatory restrictions that can be placed on online platforms. However, the EC hopes that this data collaboration will allow for more informed and balance policymaking.</p><p>With a 2019 survey showing that 21% of EU citizens use a website or app to arrange accommodation, there have been numerous calls for a digital regulator to better police this space. It is thought that the much anticipated Digital Services Act will make some progress on this front, but the slow development of this legislation may struggle to match the evolving issues face by online platforms. That said, this remains an interesting example of big tech companies collaborating with supranational bodies on regulation, as well as regulators seeking to become better informed on the nature and effect of new technology platforms to ensure informed decision making in this space.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

No records for the Dow.  The S&amp;P has a record.  They've made a right  cobbler of what was supposed to happen there between bells and gavels.   Anarchy seems to have broken out.  But it was a strong gavel.  Let me just  count.  No record for the Dow.  S&amp;P and NASDAQ at record highs.  The day is  over.  It's Thursday It's July the 20th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, Britain and the EU, the clash over the latest Brexit negotiations.   Also, the U.S. and Europol are shining light on the dark web.  Europol's  director will be live on this program tonight.  And the most famous  prisoner in America is to be freed soon.  O.J. Simpson has been granted  parole.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City,  where I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening.  O.J. Simpson has been granted parole.  The football star  turned object of cultural sensation and then convicted, was serving a nine  to 33-year sentence for kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly  weapon.  Having served the minimum, nine years in prison, he's now been  told he will soon be released on parole.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mr. Simpson, I do vote to grant parole when eligible,  and that will conclude this hearing.  </p><p> O.J. SIMPSON, IMPRISONED IN 2008 FOR KIDNAPPING, ARMED ROBBERY:  Thank you.   Thank you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  Simpson apologized.  He told the parole board he was a model  prisoner and he promised that he would have no conflicts if released.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMPSON:  I've done my time.  You know I've done it as well and as  respectfully as I think anybody can.  I think if you talk to the wardens  and them, they'll tell you I gave them my word, I believe in the jury  system.  I've honored their verdict.  I've not complained for nine years,  all I've done is try to be helpful, and encourage the guys around there,  hey, man, do your time.  Fight in court.  And don't do anything that's  going to extend your time.  And that's the life I've tried to live because  I want to get back to my kids and my family.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  There the picture is of the parole board.  Paul Vercammen is in  Lovelock, Nevada.  This really turns on a question of had he served enough  time.  Because all the other pieces of the jigsaw, no conflicts, no -- he  had behaved in prison.  There was no reason not to grant him parole if the  feeling was he had served enough time.  </p><p> PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's correct.  Richard.  It's  also very much a thing here in Nevada.  That they rely on what's called the  risk assessment profile.  O.J. Simpson is now 70 years old.  He had not  caused any problems in this prison behind me, Lovelock is what it's called.   It's in the high desert.  He had no run-ins.  He was the commissioner of  the softball league.  He said that he was a guy that other inmates could go  to if they had problems.  </p><p> So, all defense attorneys in Nevada will tell you they follow this grid,  these risk assessment guidelines and he just scored as a low risk.  And  another huge twist, as can only happen in the case of O.J. Simpson where  there's always drama.  So often we cover parole hearings and victims or  victim come up and they are teary-eyed, they are fearful and they are  scared.  And they say to that parole commission, please do not let this  inmate out, I am in fear for my life.  Instead, Bruce Fromong, the only  surviving victim of that armed robbery comes in here and says, basically,  free Simpson.  He should be out of here.  Fromong had told us repeatedly he  thought Simpson did too much time for the crime.  Richard?  </p><p> QUEST:  So, when realistically does the nine years minimum, when does that  deadline hit?  And how quickly will he be released?  It's not going to  happen tonight.  </p><p> VERCAMMEN:  No, it is not.  And here's what's going to happen.  We're in  northern Nevada.  At this place where it's -- amazingly hot today, what's  going to happen.  He's going to be here for a while.  October 1st is his  release date.  And from best we can tell, there could be a hiccup.  Because  there's got to be very specific rules on what he does after prison.  He's  going to go to another prison in the Las Vegas area or southern Nevada.   He'll be there for a couple of weeks and then he'll be released.  </p><p> [16:05:00] He has said repeatedly, we heard this in the hearing, he's going  to go to Florida.  That's where his children live, that's where his good  friend Tom Scotto lives.  I've talked to Scotto many times over the phone  he says he thinks Simpson will be able to be in a way protected there.   Maybe not be under the scrutiny that he would let's say in Los Angeles.   That's where we think he is headed with a very, very strict set of rules  imposed upon him by the patrol commission.  </p><p> QUEST:  Let's finish on that point, Paul.  Because this is parole.  This is  not acquittal.  This is not a vacating of the conviction.  This is parole.   And under the rules of parole, if you reoffend, or you break the terms, you  go back.  </p><p> VERCAMMEN:  Exactly.  And they made it a point.  Richard to underscore  that.  One of the commissioners staring him down and saying, if you  reoffend, you will be right back in Lovelock.  One thing we should note,  O.J. Simpson in this assessment was found to have had a problem by the  commissioners, with alcohol.  So, he's got to keep himself clean, from  drugs, alcohol, we're not saying that he took drugs.  We also know that  he's been told you can't consort with certain people.  Whether they are ex- cons or whatever the case may be.  They have not given us yet this list of  conditions, but we imagine it's going to be extensive.  It's going to be  detailed.  And the warning is O.J., you better watch your step even if you  do go to Florida.  </p><p> QUEST:  Paul, good to hear you, thank you for putting it into perspective.   Paul Vercammen out of Lovelock in Nevada.</p><p> So, to our business agenda tonight.  Round two of the Brexit negotiations  will come to an end.  And Europe says it's time for Britain to get its act  together.  The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he must have  more details about the U.K.'s position.  And what it's hoping to get.   Leading the talks from the British side, David Davies described the talks  as robust but constructive.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICHEL BARNIER, CHIEF BREXIT NEGOTIATOR, EUROPEAN COMMISSION (through  translator):  A clarification of the U.K. position, is indispensable for us  to negotiate and for us to make sufficient progress on this financial  dossier, which is inseparable from the other withdrawal dossiers.  </p><p> DAVID DAVIS, BRITISH SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EU:  We've had  robust, but constructive talks this week.  Clearly there's a lot left to  talk about and further work before we can resolve this.  Ultimately getting  to a solution will require flexibility from both sides.  But as Michel  said, we shouldn't expect incremental progress in every round.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  So, every round.  This was round two of the negotiations.  Thank  you.  The two sides have agreed to meet every month before March 2019,  which marks the two-year Article 50 deadline from UK's notification to  quit.  So, on round two, seconds away, let's look at the issue that they  dealt with so far.  And so far, the U.K. isn't managing to dodge too many  blows as the negotiations are under way.  </p><p> First of all, the Brexit costs, the amount the U.K. must pay.  The EU has  got it somewhere at $115 billion.  But Barnier says he needs vital details  from Britain.  Of course, your aware, some in Britain believe that there  shouldn't be a Brexit bill.  But the general acceptance is there will be a  bill to pay.  What they're arguing about is just how much.  </p><p> And then you have the very serious question of citizens' rights.  The  acquired rights of EU nationals in the U.K. and U.K. nationals elsewhere.   Citizens' rights, Barnier says, it's a fundamental divergence of the  opinion.  </p><p> Then finally, the EU says progress must be made on these issues, before  they start talking about a new trade deal.  At the same time business  remains worried.  The British Chamber of Commerce is calling for a more  sustained and some structured discussion on Brexit and Citigroup confirms  it may move business operations two Frankfurt.  And on last night's program  you had the Small Business Federation saying that they want greater clarity  as well.  </p><p> This is a negotiation that could go right down to the line.  Mike Gapes is  the Labour MP, he joins me from London.  We're watching these negotiations,  there's a very tight timeline, but as the minister, as David Davis says,  there won't be progress or incremental improvement in every round, will  there?  </p><p> MIKE GAPES, BRITISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOUR PARTY:  Well, actually the  timeline is probably such that they won't be a comprehensive agreement in  time for March of 2019.  And they're going to have to work out transitional  arrangements, which could last several years what the government calls  interim arrangements.  </p><p> [16:10:00] But the fact is that the intricate details of 43 years of  integration of the U.K. economy, and regulations through the environment  and there's other things, are so complicated, it can't all be sorted out in  the short time.  </p><p> QUEST:  What do you think the Brexit bill should be?  How long is a piece  of string?  I realize you know, what's the number, what do you think the  number is.  </p><p> GAPES:  I can't give you an answer to that.  But the U.K. has entered into  obligations for example, the costs of pensions for former employees of the  European Union, the cost of infrastructure projects, which are partly  completed or planned.  There's a whole range of things which would require  a legal commitment and a requirement that we do meet our obligations.  </p><p> QUEST:  The hope is to settle the acquired rights, the Brexit bill and  potentially the Northern Ireland issue by October, when there will be the  potential to discuss the wider issues.  Do you think that is realistic?  </p><p> GAPES:  I think that's very optimistic.  I also think that we as members of  Parliament, we are in the dark.  The government is not telling us what its  position is.  It's not just Michel Barnier who saying the government needs  to give more detail.  Members of the House of Commons -- where of course,  Theresa May no longer has an overall majority -- are in the dark as well.   We are waiting to begin the legislative process in September for a repeal  bill to withdraw.  But we don't yet know what the British government's plan  is.  What it actually wants.  And I'm not sure they know.  </p><p> QUEST:  You would expect that the British government can't sort of  negotiate and at the same time, have an entire Parliament watching over its  back at every stage of the way.  Parliament is going to have its vote once  the process is over.  </p><p> GAPES:  Well the danger is that Theresa May still believes that somehow no  deal is better than a bad deal.  That position was killed in our general  election in June.  There is now going to be a position where Parliament is  going to assert itself.  Whether it does so this year or whether it does so  next year.  But there will be the necessity of having a broad consensus  within the House of Commons and also the House of Lords.  In order to  ensure that we are satisfied with the terms of these negotiations.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you still believe that Brexit will happen?  Or as I believe you  are of the opinion, that some shape or form will be found to keep the U.K.  within.  </p><p> GAPES:  I'm of the view that we need to mitigate the damage that any  leaving of the EU will put us into a dangerous position if we also leave  the single market and the customs union.  It will be disastrous for our  economy.  There are many of us -- it's not just in my party -- there are  many people across the House of Commons and in the House of Lords, that  want to have the closest possible ongoing relationship with the European  Union even if we have voted to leave.  And that means, as far as we can,  staying in the European economic area, the single market and that is  necessary for inward investment and prosperity of our people.  People  didn't vote to become poorer in the referendum.  </p><p> QUEST:  But would you say membership of EEA, in other words that the, you  have to eat Europe's rules, without having a seat at the table.  The Norway  option, you're familiar with it.  Would you say that is preferable to being  outside the single market.  </p><p> GAPES:  No, no, no.  It's actually, the choice staying in the single market  is fundamental, is preferable.  The best option, is to actually be involved  in the decision-making.  The best solution would be not to leave the  European Union.  If the British people have voted for that.  Then we've got  to try to get the next best.  Which is the mitigate the damage.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> GAPES:  Thank you.</p><p> QUEST:  Now Wall Street where trading continues.  The S&amp;P -- now look at  the markets.  We don't -- we have a fall of the Dow.  We have a fall of the  S&amp;P and there are record highs.  It was dragged down, by the way, by the  way, by Home Depot.  But the NASDAQ did eke out a very small gain.  Just  five points or so.  And that's the tenth straight session of gains.  And  therefore, the NASDAQ is at a record.  </p><p> But as you can see, the numbers we're talking about today are very small.   Which reinforces the general view at the moment, that the upward pressure  remains even though there is one or two.  </p><p> [16:15:00] This is, by the way, the longest streak in more than two years.   If you take Donald Trump's inauguration, you can see just the way -- you've  got the NASDAQ, which has been on the biggest tear of all.  The Dow  industrials and the Dow and the broader market of the S&amp;P are pretty much  mirroring each other which is fascinating, with one or two minor hiccups.   The NASDAQ is up 15 percent.  The Dow and the S&amp;P is up 9 percent.  All of  which prompts me to want to know from Rana Foroohar is with me, CNN's  global economist analyst and a columnist for the \"Financial Times.\"  </p><p> RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Hello, my friend.</p><p> QUEST:  Now look at those numbers, is everything as bad as everybody says?   And is there as much chaos and confusion out of the Trump administration  and there's as much worry about the economic agenda.  What's going on?  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  I think the most important line is the red line.  I think the  only game in town right now is tech.  And I think that what's really  interesting is in part because there's been so much chaos in Washington.   The fact you're probably not going to see tax reform.  You're not going to  see health care reform.  A lot of things that business wanted to see,  people are saying where can I find growth.  Where is that sure thing?  The  tech sector is where that's at.  </p><p> QUEST:  And the reason the tech sector is because we've all got smartphones  and we've all moving into more of these.  And we've got AI coming down the  road.  It's not rocket science that tech is going to be the cornerstone and  the concrete of the next century.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Well right, and I like the word concrete.  Because in some ways,  I think we're moving to a deeper period of how tech is going to disrupt  everything.  We already have our phones, right?  We've had the consumer  revolution.  Now we're moving into tech making its way into industrial,  disrupting the entire S&amp;P.  </p><p> QUEST:  So, when you see Amazon, today with the deal with Sears, Sears goes  up 20 percent.  Just because it's selling its Kenmore appliances with Alexa  capabilities.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p> QUEST:  I mean, it got 10 percent.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Anything that's been touched by Amazon, Google or Facebook is  gold.  I think what's really interesting is I would count on fang  companies, the big tech companies to keep their valuations.  Everything  else I'm not so sure about.  Because we are really in frothy areas for a  lot of companies.  Not the biggest ones.  </p><p> QUEST:  Of course, the fangs will keep their value or will keep --</p><p> FOROOHAR:  Yes, because they are going to eat everything else.</p><p> QUEST:  They're the ones we're all using.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Right, absolutely.  And they have all of our data.  They're  monetizing even --</p><p> QUEST:  It's cause and effect, Rana.  It's a truism.  If we're all using  Facebook and Netflix and brawl using Amazon, they're the ones that are  going to rise.  It's the new ones like Blue Apron who may or may not.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  True enough.  But all of this is predicated on the fact that the  regulatory environment remains as it is, which is very light touch.  We'll  see what comes down from the EU and we'll see what happens in Washington.   In some ways if you look at politically, the 2018 and 2020, making a boogie  man out of big tech is a political possibility.  </p><p> QUEST:  By the way, I've been asking people this question.  By the way  Rana, when did you last buy something at Sears?  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Oh, my gosh.  Not since I was growing up in rural Indiana, I  don't think.  Sorry in all seriousness.  What can I say.  I bought  something this morning on Amazon.  </p><p> QUEST:  That's my point.  </p><p> Thank you.  We've been asking all sorts of people that question, when they  bought something at Sears.  I'll talk about it in Profitable Moment at the  end of the program.  </p><p> As we continue our QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  Tonight, a victory in the battle  against the dark web.  U.S. authorities say they've taken down an illegal  marketplace selling guns and drugs.  We have the details after the break.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:20:54] QUEST:  More now on today's breaking news.  O.J. Simpson has  been granted parole.  Jeffrey Toobin is with me.  Were you surprised?  </p><p> JEFFERY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Not really.  He has served a  long time.  He's already 70 years old.  There are not many 70-year-olds in  prison in the United States.  And the state of Nevada has standards for  when people are granted parole.  And to all appearances, he met them and  the decision seemed reasonable to me.  </p><p> QUEST:  To the court of public opinion, from which he may have been  convicted for murder in an earlier case.  And those who say you should  never have been let loose again, your answer is what?  </p><p> TOOBIN:  Well, that I agree.  That he did get away with murder.  I wrote a  book, I studied that trial very carefully.  I think the jury -- I disagreed  with the jury decision in that case as many Americans did.  But this was a  separate case and in fact, I think he was punished unduly harshly in this  Nevada case, which was a crazy robbery, kidnapping in a, in a seedy Las  Vegas hotel.  That I think was payback for the murder.  </p><p> QUEST:  How strict from your experience are parole officers in terms of  enforcing a parolee?  </p><p> TOOBIN:  It vary as lot.  They tend to be pretty strict.  There are not --  there are people you are not supposed to associate with.  He is in a  somewhat unusual situation because he is going to try to do his parole in a  different state.  In Florida where he's lived before he was arrested again.   His life will be somewhat circumscribed.  But it will be a hell of a lot  better than being in prison.  </p><p> QUEST:  I need to turn to Donald Trump.  And I need to ask you, Donald  Trump said that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, should not investigate  the finances would be crossing the red line.  He doesn't really get much  say in the matter.</p><p> TOOBIN:  No, he doesn't.  Unless he decides to take the political risk of  ordering Mueller's firing.  It is true -- </p><p> QUEST:  That would be nuclear.  </p><p> TOOBIN:  We're talking about Donald Trump here.  If you had said to me, is  he going to fire the FBI director?  I'd say, of course not, no one would do  such a thing when the FBI director was investigating him.  I would not at  all put it past the president to fire Robert Mueller, if he feels like he  is getting too close to Trump or doing something that's outside his  jurisdiction.  Donald Trump is operating by his own rules.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is Jeff Sessions well and truly damaged goods as Attorney General  of the United States?  </p><p> TOOBIN:  It's a very peculiar situation.  This was a really scathing  attack.  But it didn't really take away any of Sessions' authority as  attorney general.  It was embarrassing for Sessions.  But I thought  Sessions' response today was pretty much the only one he could make.  I'm  the attorney general.  I'm going to continue fighting crime.  I'm proud of  the work that we're doing.  It is part of the continuing weirdness of the  Trump administration.  But I don't think it fundamentally changes Jeff  Sessions' authority.  </p><p> QUEST:  It is a strange world, Jeff Toobin.  </p><p> TOOBIN:  Mr. Quest, I could not agree more.  </p><p> QUEST:  When we start with O.J. Simpson and we end up with the attorney  general being criticized by his boss, the president of the United States.  </p><p> TOOBIN:  Sir, as always.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  </p><p> Jeffrey was talking about Jeff Sessions doing his job.  While the  Department of Justice says it's taken down a massive illegal online  marketplace.  Is called AlphaBay.  And it's operating on the dark web.  One  of the internet's inaccessible to the normal browsers.  The sort that you  and I might use on the web.  This sort of place is where drugs, guns and  stolen documents, fake goods have been sold according to the Department of  Justice.  Rob Wainwright is the director of Europol and to the DOJ  announcement in Washington.</p><p> [16:25:00] So, what is it that you took down?  And how difficult was it to  take it down?  </p><p> ROB WAINWRIGHT, DIRECTOR, EUROPOL:  Well, it's even better than you said,  Richard.  Because we took down in a coordinated action in Europe and the  United States two of the three largest criminal marketplaces that are  operating in the dark net.  And between them they were trading in over  350,000 different listings of drugs and other illicit commodities.  So  actually, we've punctured a pretty big hole in the infrastructure of a  multimillion dollar digital underground criminal economy.  And I think it's  a very good day for law enforcement.  And a worrying day for those that are  engaged in criminal activity online.  </p><p> QUEST:  I don't want to rain on a good day for law enforcement.  However,  you'll be familiar -- look, if you just squeeze it, it's like a balloon.   Squeeze one bit and it will pop out somewhere else.  What measures are you  taking that will prevent somebody else or another entity from opening up to  take advantage of a marketplace clearly exists on the dark web?  </p><p> WAINWRIGHT:  We are in a race against the criminals.  They will innovate  again.  They will reform, but they will do so with a high degree of risk  right now.  Because the really clever part of this operation, if I say so  myself, is the way we coordinated.  We took covert control of very large  market in Europe.  Left it running.  Therefore, being able to identify the  criminal activities of the users involved.  While then shutting down  AlphaBay here in America and watching while all of those criminal users  flocked to this other marketplace instead.  </p><p> So, we were able to capture eight times as much intelligence about the uses  in doing this coordinated hit.  And you know, the criminals, Richard, there  are not going to know what else we're doing already out there.  What we're  going to be doing tomorrow, next month and so on.  And we're already seen  reaction in the criminal underworld, which is saying to their people, don't  go on any marketplaces right now.  It's a dangerous place now.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you have the resources and the expertise necessary -- now look,  I've never met a policeman who didn't say he wanted more resources.  But  you know what I'm asking you here.  Are you state of the art or are the  criminals ahead of you?  </p><p> WAINWRIGHT:  I don't want any more resources, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  You don't believe that any more than I do.  </p><p> WAINWRIGHT:  Listen, we worked with an internet company firm in this case  that gave us a great additional lead-in to one of these cases.  But this is  really a story about coordinated law enforcement action across different  countries.  Fantastic coming together of Europol, FBI, DEA, Dutch police.   And when we combined the technical operation resources of our community,  you know, we can really do some damage against criminality on the internet.   So, I think it's a big deal.  </p><p> QUEST:  Rob, director, thank you very much.  Lovely to have you.  Always  grateful to have you on the program Appreciate it.  </p><p> QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tonight.  the president of the United States has a  warning for the special counsel I was talking about it with Jeffrey Toobin.   The counsel is investigating the Russian meddling in the U.S. election.   Now he's saying, stay out of my business.  Or at least my family's  finances.  We'll discuss that, after the break.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:30:28] Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  And in a moment, we'll be talking a millionaire who has a  plan to expand Heathrow Airport and believes it will save billions over the  existing plan for the expansion.</p><p> Elon Musk says he has government approval to build a hyperloop between  Washington and New York.  The trip would take half an hour.  While before  that this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first.</p><p> The former American football star O.J. Simpson has been granted parole  after serving nine years in prison for kidnapping and armed robbery.  His  fall from grace has fascinated people since his murder trial and acquittal  in the 1990s.  Simpson could be freed as soon as October.  </p><p> The U.S. Attorney General says he plans to keep doing his job.  Even though  president Donald Trump told \"The New York Times\" he would have hired  someone else, had he known that Jeff Sessions would recuse himself from the  Russian investigations.  The Attorney General Sessions did so, when it  became public he didn't disclose meetings with the Russian ambassador.  </p><p> Another leading voice of rock music has gone silent.  California  authorities found Chester Bennington, the front man for the band, Linkin  Park, dead of possible suicide at his home in Los Angeles on Thursday.   He's survived by his wife and six children.  It comes only months after  Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, a close friend of Bennington's, committed  suicide.</p><p> President Trump's issued a stark warning to the special counsel Robert  Mueller.  Investigating the Trump family finances beyond any Russian  connections, would in his words cross a red line.  In \"the New York times\"  and the president said, the special counsel's investigation was compromised  by a variety of conflicts of interest.  </p><p> Now the president's son and son-in-law, and along with the former campaign  chairman Paul Manafort, they were scheduled to testify before the Senate  Judicial Committee next week.  Jared Kushner is expected to appear before  the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday.  </p><p> Joining me now, Ian Bremmer, who broke the news of president Trump's  undisclosed meeting with President Putin at the G-20.  Ian is the president  of the Eurasia Group.  Before we get all this other stuff, Ian, just tell  me -- first of all, congratulations on the story.  But when they had this  meeting, which went on for the best part of an hour, were they just sitting  at the side of the dining room table with the other G-20 or 18 leaders,  just looking, wondering what on earth are they talking about?  </p><p> IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Yes, not immediately, right.   Because it's not that unusual to have step asides and this is meant to be  the opportunity for the leaders to get to know each other better.  But when  it's going on for half an hour, 45, and then you know basically an hour,  that's when the other leaders in the room are saying -- it's very clear  that you know, with despite the fact that a number of Trump's American's  allies are in the room.  That by far the relationship that he feels the  most comfortable with personally is a country they consider to be an  adversary.  </p><p> It's also the one country that if you look both at the campaign as well as  Trump as president, it's the one country, the one leader that Trump has  consistently taken every opportunity to never criticize.  I mean he'll  criticize the Japanese on trade.  The Germans for trade, not doing enough  on paying for security, the Chinese on currency, you name it, they're going  to take a hit from Trump at some point except Putin.  And so, I think  people just you know can't add it all up.  This is yet one more indication  of that.  </p><p> QUEST:  We don't know what they talked about.  We know that the president  said it was you know, the pleasantries a bit and they talked about  adoption.  And the Russian rules, law concerning that.  Do you buy that?  </p><p> BREMMER:  Adoption is sort of Russian code word for sanctions which are  linked to the adoption issue under this Magnitsky case.  And that's  something that the Russians, of course, are very interested in ensuring is  removed from them and their economy.  Putin talks about it a lot.  So yes,  that's not pleasantries.  Adoption is a significant issue.  Trump Jr., of  course, also said during his meeting that ended up being about getting  information on Clinton, that that was also about adoption that turns out  adoption is a very popular issue to discuss among pleasantries with  Russians.  </p><p> [16:35:06] QUEST:  Robert Mueller can investigate what he likes.  We know  that from the former special prosecutor of course, Ken Starr.  Whitewater  with the Clintons started as a bad land deal and ends up as a sexual  scandal involving the president, with many people caught up and convicted  on the way.  So, when the president says investigating my family finances  is a red line, what do we make of that?  </p><p> BREMMER:  Well I think that a lot of people on the Democratic side, believe  that the Starr investigation did get over-exuberant beyond its mandate.  It  was inappropriate, shouldn't have been done.  And that it became indeed a  witch hunt against Clinton.  And I do think that a lot of people on the  Republican side believe that the same thing is going to be true of the  Mueller investigation.  That you give these guys an inch -- we're a very  litigious society -- the investigators are going to find something.  I do  think there is reason for the Trump administration, for President Trump to  feel besieged as this investigation inevitably gets bigger and bigger.  But  that doesn't mean that he has any ability, any legal recourse to stop the  investigation from happening.  And if he were to fire Mueller, the  investigation is still going to proceed.  </p><p> QUEST:  Finally, look, viewers watching us tonight, -- of which there are  many, many delighted to have with us -- are wanting really to know one  simple thing.  This Russia issue, is it just going to rumble on for the  whole four years of the first administration?  Does it go anywhere?  Is  there a denouement?  Or are we just going to literally it's going to be  like watching the paint dry.</p><p> BREMMER:  The fact that the national security adviser was forced out in  record time as a consequence of lying about his Russian connections, is a  big deal.  And I do think that these investigations as they proceed and as  leaks inevitably come from them, you'll see people like Paul Manafort, who  ran the Trump campaign, maybe members of the Trump family are going to be  in trouble.  And that's can lead two big headlines.  So, I do think that  shoes will drop and consequences will be had.  </p><p> But I also think that the media does have a fundamental anti-Trump bias.   Certainly, in the United States.  And as a consequence, anything that  smells like Trump and Russia, whether it's a big deal or a small deal,  really blows up.  And I do think that some of the media coverage around  this story, but yes, I was the initial person breaking it.  Frankly, made  it out to be a bigger deal than the individual meeting actually was.  It  does matter that they're continuing to cover up all this stuff.  But I do  think that there is one-sidedness of it.  </p><p> QUEST:  Ian Bremmer, good to see you, sir.  </p><p> BREMMER:  You too, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  Imagine taking a train from Manhattan to Washington, it takes three  hours at the moment.  You can fly and a drive to the airport, well that can  take two or three years.  Elon Musk believes he can cut the journey in the  corridor from D.C.  to New York, to half an hour.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:40:15] QUEST:  It's called the northeast corridor from Washington up to  Baltimore.  Philadelphia to New York.  A train journey that will take you  best part of three hours, even on Acela which is the high-speed train  service.  Now imagine you can do it in 29 minutes.  That is Elon Musk's  promise founder of Tesla, SpaceX and a company called the Boring Company.   He has just tweeted, received verbal government approval for the Boring  Company to build an underground New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore- Washington  hyperloop.  </p><p> Current journey, three hours, Musk says there could be up to a dozen entry  and exit elevators in each city.  Renee Marsh is CNN's regulation  correspondent.  She's at the other end of the line.  Now Renee, he says  he's got received verbal government approval.  What does that mean?  </p><p> RENEE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION CORRESPONDENT:  That is a great  question, Richard.  And at this point.  It's really unclear.  I can tell  you New York to D.C.  in 29 minutes it sounds great, and as you know, Elon  Musk talks about this for a long time.  His vision of this hyperloop.  This  mode of transportation comprised of the pods that travel through this  system of sealed tubes without any air resistance and can get you where you  need to go, but he talked about this verbal agreement that he received from  the government.  But he didn't quite say which entity of the U.S.  government gave him that verbal agreement.  </p><p> I can tell you, I spoke with the Department of Transportation.  They said  no comment.  Referred us to the White House.  We did reach out to the White  House, they didn't deny this.  But at the same time, they didn't confirm it  either.  Only saying that they had some good conversations with Mr. Musk  about, about advancing infrastructure.  So, it remains unclear what he's  exactly talking about.  </p><p> QUEST:  Listen to a guest we had on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS last week.  A week  before last this was Hyperloop 1, another project which you'll be familiar  with, which has already tested out west.  Listen to what the head of that  project said about the prospects for hyperloop.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERVIN PISHEVAR, CO-FOUNDER HYPERLOOP ONE:  We want to build this between  cities around the world.  We would love to have it, we're shooting for an  operational hyperloop somewhere in the world by 2021.  We have incredible  leadership from Rob Lloyd, our CEO as President of Cisco.  Brent  Kalinowski, treasurer of Google.  Launch this around the world.  We're in  government studies around the world and hope to be able to announce our  first projects in the future.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  So, Renee, everybody wants hyperloop.  But you know as well as I  do, they can't even build a high-speed train.  </p><p> MARSH:  That's right.  </p><p> QUEST:  They couldn't even spend the federal money that was available, they  were giving the money away and people still didn't want to spend it how  realistic is this hyperloop?  Or is it just hyper-hype?  </p><p> MARSH:  I think everyone gets excited about this prospect because it would  be quite an advancement.  But when you talk about a project like this,  first of all, one person can't just give you the sign-off.  You have to  have the state and local permits necessary to build this sort of  revolutionary transportation system.  And that in itself is very complex.   And it would take a long period of time.  To your point, they can't even  build high-speed rail, let alone hyperloop.  Which we've never seen  anything like that in our transportation system before.  So, the short  answer to your question is -- it's an extremely complicated process.  That  cannot certainly not happen overnight.  </p><p> QUEST:  It won't happen in my lifetime.  I'll put that money on it.  </p><p> MARSH:  Don't be so negative, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right.  Maybe I'll be old and decrepit and I'll actually get on  the hyperloop.  Good to see you, Rene.  Thank you.  </p><p> As we continue.  On QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we'll meet the man who says he  can slash the billions of dollars off the cost of Heathrow's third runway.   Although the penultimate installment of our series, India 2024.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [16:45:00] UPPMA VIRDI, FOUNDER CHAI WALLI (voiceover):  I am an  Indian/Australian and my aim is to bring the two cultures together and I  found that grounding through chai.  My name is Uppma Virdi, and I'm 27  years old and I run Chai Walla.  I my mission is to educate the world  through chai.  Chai was part of our daily ritual.  Warmth, family, unity.   Coming together for a common purpose.  Which is to bond over chai.  </p><p> Melbourne is definitely a coffee culture.  However, I was on a mission to  make all the cafes here make chai properly.  Because they weren't making it  how chai is meant to be made.  Every street corner India, every hundred or  two hundred meters you see or meet these people making chai.  My mission  and my purpose is to support small farmers and support small businesses in  India that probably don't sell to big tea companies.  There are many things  I have learned through my journey through Chai Walli.  But one thing that  always sticks with me is to listen to yourself.</p><p> (on camera) And that is the blend that my grandfather used to give me  growing up.</p><p> (voice-over) I feel that we all have the answers within us, we just need to  give ourselves the mental headspace to listen to those answers.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  So, we will never build a third runway at Heathrow Airport in  London.  Well, lawmakers from several British parties are forming a group  to question the case for this third runway.  And say there are unanswered  questions about noise levels and flight paths.  And yet at the same time  this is the plan, Heathrow East, Heathrow West with a new third runway that  goes at the top.  A hotel operator has come up with his own expansion  proposal.  </p><p> The founder of the royal group says his plan would save $8.6 billion and be  kinder to the environment and the neighbors.  You're going to see this is  the plan at the moment.  And this is what he's planning to do.  Basically,  he cuts off the last bit of the runway, to make it shorter.  But what that  means is, you don't have to do massive rescheduling work around the  motorways of the M-4 and the M-25, it would be cheaper, quicker and able to  be done in a lot less time.  </p><p> Surinder Arora is the founder and chairman of the Arora Group joins me from  London.  Sir, Willie Walsh of IAG likes your plan, a few others like your  plan.  But this has been looked at.  A gazillion times, including the idea  of a shorter runway to the north.  So why do you hope that you're going to  curry favor or find favor with this?  </p><p> SURINDER ARORA, FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN OF THE ARORA GROUP:  Richard, hi, I've  spent all my life around Heathrow for the last 45 years and I've worked,  and I've had businesses around the airport.  I used to do private flying  myself.  So, I love aviation.  And looking at the expansion plans at  Heathrow and especially last year after the Davies commission report was  produced, which recommended the expansion should happen at Heathrow, we've  been looking at it and being the largest land owner where the runway and  the new infrastructure is going to go, we looked at different schemes.  </p><p> [16:50:00] And our main scheme actually is the same as the Heathrow scheme,  with the runway over the M-25, within the red line that was put forward by  the government.  Except we're taking about 23 percent less land.  And go  ahead.  </p><p> QUEST:  One of the critics of your plan says that actually you will create  a greater noise level on the approach into Heathrow.  Therefore, yes, you  may gain on the round-about, but you'll lose on the swings.  There will be  more noise from arriving aircraft.  </p><p> ARORA:  If I may clarify, the main scheme, there was a red line put round  the expansion plan, round Heathrow.  The existing runway is actually, we've  gone with the 3,500-meter runway.  The scheme you are looking at on the  left, same as Heathrow.  We went with that except how we've managed to come  up with the savings of over $5.6 billion, the initial savings was by having  better layout, rather than having a satellite terminal connected by  underground train, working with the airlines and I feel that's one of the  things that Heathrow in my view have never done is actually sitting down  and discussing with their partners, customers.  </p><p> QUEST:  Isn't the reality of this, they've come up with 1,001 different  plans.  Those like Zach Goldsmith.  Those like Boris Johnson who are  implacably opposed to any form of expansion of Heathrow.  It doesn't matter  what you come up with.  It's not going to happen.  </p><p> ARORA:  No, no, no.  Look I when I came to England in '72, Heathrow was the  number one international airport in the world.  We have been falling  behind, compared to our European partners, compared to Dubai.  Compared to  Paris, other places.  Unless we do something about it, it is not just about  having more flights in and out of Heathrow, it is actually what is right  for the nation.  We just had the recent elections and the government is  still committed.  If you ask everyone round the world, where do people want  to fly in and out of Heathrow -- </p><p> QUEST:  The government doesn't have the support and the wherewithal to get  particularly post-election.  So, my final thought to you, sir, is do you  think we will see a third runway at Heathrow in your or my lifetime?  </p><p> ARORA:  I most definitely believe so.  I think we need it, I believe it  will happen, and I remember saying about 15 years ago, that the U.K. in the  southeast where we haven't built another runway since the mid '40s that  would need expansion and will need expansion of Heathrow, Gatwick and  Stanton over the next three or four decades, but Heathrow is where we need  the expansion desperately.  The Davies commission report recommended.  I  believe it will happen.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, we appreciate you coming in to talk about it  tonight, very important, thank you.</p><p> Business to bring to you, Microsoft shares at a new high in after-hours  reported strong earnings, Satya Nadella it has been driven by the cloud  platforms, we are familiar with that.  But look at the price up two  percent, shares at $75.4.  Share have gained 20 percent so far, this year  on Wall Street.  On Wall Street, shopping is the best way to describe, the  Dow was down, so no records, as indeed was the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ does  come in at a record.  But I think you've got to look at it the way in which  the market traded today, there was a lot of sort of just downright  choppiness.  </p><p> That forced it.  But at the same time, there is a strong view that there's  an underlying momentum higher which we saw with the S&amp;P 500 getting its  multi-record days.  And that is a breakout as they say in the chart view.   European stocks ended the day highly unchanged, mixed with FTSE eking out  the best of the day.  Not quite sure why, the euro jumped against the  dollar, ECB left rates unchanged.  But Mario Draghi at the ECB did say that  the ECB was, was committed to continuing their QE program at 60 billion to  70 billion euros, until at least December 2017.  If you want to follow the  podcast.  </p><p> [16:55:00] It is all at the usual iTunes, CNN/podcast.  We will have a  Profitable Moment after the break.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment, it was 1886 that Sears Roebuck opened  its first store and over the next century became a bastion of American  retailing.  Particularly in the Midwest.  Everybody seemed to go to Sears  and you bought houses, cars, automobiles.  Bits and bobs for the house.   Sears, if you take a look at how that progressed, has been the hallmark of  American retailing.  And unfortunately, hard times have fallen on the  company of.  They've shut many, many stores and yet today, they came up  with an announcement that they were going to sell their Kenmore appliances  through Amazon and the stock rallied some 20 percent.  </p><p> What does it tell us?  It tells us very little about Sears.  Because Sears  is probably yesterday's retailer.  It tells us something about the  necessity to sell Kenmore on Amazon.  But what it really tells us, is about  Amazon itself.  This behemoth retailer of the 21st century.  Think about  it, in this week alone we've seen two examples, Sears sells on Amazon.  And  the price goes up 20 percent.  Blue Apron gets threatened by Amazon in the  meal kit industry, and their share price collapses.  </p><p> This is not about Sears or Blue Apron.  This is about Amazon.  And the  power of the $1,000 stock that is now ruling the retail world.  That's  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in New York, whatever  you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  We will do it  again tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

No records for the Dow.  The S&amp;P has a record.  They've made a right  cobbler of what was supposed to happen there between bells and gavels.   Anarchy seems to have broken out.  But it was a strong gavel.  Let me just  count.  No record for the Dow.  S&amp;P and NASDAQ at record highs.  The day is  over.  It's Thursday It's July the 20th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, Britain and the EU, the clash over the latest Brexit negotiations.   Also, the U.S. and Europol are shining light on the dark web.  Europol's  director will be live on this program tonight.  And the most famous  prisoner in America is to be freed soon.  O.J. Simpson has been granted  parole.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City,  where I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  O.J. Simpson has been granted parole.  The football star  turned object of cultural sensation and then convicted, was serving a nine  to 33-year sentence for kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly  weapon.  Having served the minimum, nine years in prison, he's now been  told he will soon be released on parole.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mr. Simpson, I do vote to grant parole when eligible,  and that will conclude this hearing.  </p><p>O.J. SIMPSON, IMPRISONED IN 2008 FOR KIDNAPPING, ARMED ROBBERY:  Thank you.   Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Simpson apologized.  He told the parole board he was a model  prisoner and he promised that he would have no conflicts if released.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMPSON:  I've done my time.  You know I've done it as well and as  respectfully as I think anybody can.  I think if you talk to the wardens  and them, they'll tell you I gave them my word, I believe in the jury  system.  I've honored their verdict.  I've not complained for nine years,  all I've done is try to be helpful, and encourage the guys around there,  hey, man, do your time.  Fight in court.  And don't do anything that's  going to extend your time.  And that's the life I've tried to live because  I want to get back to my kids and my family.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  There the picture is of the parole board.  Paul Vercammen is in  Lovelock, Nevada.  This really turns on a question of had he served enough  time.  Because all the other pieces of the jigsaw, no conflicts, no -- he  had behaved in prison.  There was no reason not to grant him parole if the  feeling was he had served enough time.  </p><p>PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's correct.  Richard.  It's  also very much a thing here in Nevada.  That they rely on what's called the  risk assessment profile.  O.J. Simpson is now 70 years old.  He had not  caused any problems in this prison behind me, Lovelock is what it's called.   It's in the high desert.  He had no run-ins.  He was the commissioner of  the softball league.  He said that he was a guy that other inmates could go  to if they had problems.  </p><p>So, all defense attorneys in Nevada will tell you they follow this grid,  these risk assessment guidelines and he just scored as a low risk.  And  another huge twist, as can only happen in the case of O.J. Simpson where  there's always drama.  So often we cover parole hearings and victims or  victim come up and they are teary-eyed, they are fearful and they are  scared.  And they say to that parole commission, please do not let this  inmate out, I am in fear for my life.  Instead, Bruce Fromong, the only  surviving victim of that armed robbery comes in here and says, basically,  free Simpson.  He should be out of here.  Fromong had told us repeatedly he  thought Simpson did too much time for the crime.  Richard?  </p><p>QUEST:  So, when realistically does the nine years minimum, when does that  deadline hit?  And how quickly will he be released?  It's not going to  happen tonight.  </p><p>VERCAMMEN:  No, it is not.  And here's what's going to happen.  We're in  northern Nevada.  At this place where it's -- amazingly hot today, what's  going to happen.  He's going to be here for a while.  October 1st is his  release date.  And from best we can tell, there could be a hiccup.  Because  there's got to be very specific rules on what he does after prison.  He's  going to go to another prison in the Las Vegas area or southern Nevada.   He'll be there for a couple of weeks and then he'll be released.  </p><p>[16:05:00] He has said repeatedly, we heard this in the hearing, he's going  to go to Florida.  That's where his children live, that's where his good  friend Tom Scotto lives.  I've talked to Scotto many times over the phone  he says he thinks Simpson will be able to be in a way protected there.   Maybe not be under the scrutiny that he would let's say in Los Angeles.   That's where we think he is headed with a very, very strict set of rules  imposed upon him by the patrol commission.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's finish on that point, Paul.  Because this is parole.  This is  not acquittal.  This is not a vacating of the conviction.  This is parole.   And under the rules of parole, if you reoffend, or you break the terms, you  go back.  </p><p>VERCAMMEN:  Exactly.  And they made it a point.  Richard to underscore  that.  One of the commissioners staring him down and saying, if you  reoffend, you will be right back in Lovelock.  One thing we should note,  O.J. Simpson in this assessment was found to have had a problem by the  commissioners, with alcohol.  So, he's got to keep himself clean, from  drugs, alcohol, we're not saying that he took drugs.  We also know that  he's been told you can't consort with certain people.  Whether they are ex- cons or whatever the case may be.  They have not given us yet this list of  conditions, but we imagine it's going to be extensive.  It's going to be  detailed.  And the warning is O.J., you better watch your step even if you  do go to Florida.  </p><p>QUEST:  Paul, good to hear you, thank you for putting it into perspective.   Paul Vercammen out of Lovelock in Nevada.</p><p>So, to our business agenda tonight.  Round two of the Brexit negotiations  will come to an end.  And Europe says it's time for Britain to get its act  together.  The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he must have  more details about the U.K.'s position.  And what it's hoping to get.   Leading the talks from the British side, David Davies described the talks  as robust but constructive.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, CHIEF BREXIT NEGOTIATOR, EUROPEAN COMMISSION (through  translator):  A clarification of the U.K. position, is indispensable for us  to negotiate and for us to make sufficient progress on this financial  dossier, which is inseparable from the other withdrawal dossiers.  </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, BRITISH SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EU:  We've had  robust, but constructive talks this week.  Clearly there's a lot left to  talk about and further work before we can resolve this.  Ultimately getting  to a solution will require flexibility from both sides.  But as Michel  said, we shouldn't expect incremental progress in every round.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  So, every round.  This was round two of the negotiations.  Thank  you.  The two sides have agreed to meet every month before March 2019,  which marks the two-year Article 50 deadline from UK's notification to  quit.  So, on round two, seconds away, let's look at the issue that they  dealt with so far.  And so far, the U.K. isn't managing to dodge too many  blows as the negotiations are under way.  </p><p>First of all, the Brexit costs, the amount the U.K. must pay.  The EU has  got it somewhere at $115 billion.  But Barnier says he needs vital details  from Britain.  Of course, your aware, some in Britain believe that there  shouldn't be a Brexit bill.  But the general acceptance is there will be a  bill to pay.  What they're arguing about is just how much.  </p><p>And then you have the very serious question of citizens' rights.  The  acquired rights of EU nationals in the U.K. and U.K. nationals elsewhere.   Citizens' rights, Barnier says, it's a fundamental divergence of the  opinion.  </p><p>Then finally, the EU says progress must be made on these issues, before  they start talking about a new trade deal.  At the same time business  remains worried.  The British Chamber of Commerce is calling for a more  sustained and some structured discussion on Brexit and Citigroup confirms  it may move business operations two Frankfurt.  And on last night's program  you had the Small Business Federation saying that they want greater clarity  as well.  </p><p>This is a negotiation that could go right down to the line.  Mike Gapes is  the Labour MP, he joins me from London.  We're watching these negotiations,  there's a very tight timeline, but as the minister, as David Davis says,  there won't be progress or incremental improvement in every round, will  there?  </p><p>MIKE GAPES, BRITISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOUR PARTY:  Well, actually the  timeline is probably such that they won't be a comprehensive agreement in  time for March of 2019.  And they're going to have to work out transitional  arrangements, which could last several years what the government calls  interim arrangements.  </p><p>[16:10:00] But the fact is that the intricate details of 43 years of  integration of the U.K. economy, and regulations through the environment  and there's other things, are so complicated, it can't all be sorted out in  the short time.  </p><p>QUEST:  What do you think the Brexit bill should be?  How long is a piece  of string?  I realize you know, what's the number, what do you think the  number is.  </p><p>GAPES:  I can't give you an answer to that.  But the U.K. has entered into  obligations for example, the costs of pensions for former employees of the  European Union, the cost of infrastructure projects, which are partly  completed or planned.  There's a whole range of things which would require  a legal commitment and a requirement that we do meet our obligations.  </p><p>QUEST:  The hope is to settle the acquired rights, the Brexit bill and  potentially the Northern Ireland issue by October, when there will be the  potential to discuss the wider issues.  Do you think that is realistic?  </p><p>GAPES:  I think that's very optimistic.  I also think that we as members of  Parliament, we are in the dark.  The government is not telling us what its  position is.  It's not just Michel Barnier who saying the government needs  to give more detail.  Members of the House of Commons -- where of course,  Theresa May no longer has an overall majority -- are in the dark as well.   We are waiting to begin the legislative process in September for a repeal  bill to withdraw.  But we don't yet know what the British government's plan  is.  What it actually wants.  And I'm not sure they know.  </p><p>QUEST:  You would expect that the British government can't sort of  negotiate and at the same time, have an entire Parliament watching over its  back at every stage of the way.  Parliament is going to have its vote once  the process is over.  </p><p>GAPES:  Well the danger is that Theresa May still believes that somehow no  deal is better than a bad deal.  That position was killed in our general  election in June.  There is now going to be a position where Parliament is  going to assert itself.  Whether it does so this year or whether it does so  next year.  But there will be the necessity of having a broad consensus  within the House of Commons and also the House of Lords.  In order to  ensure that we are satisfied with the terms of these negotiations.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you still believe that Brexit will happen?  Or as I believe you  are of the opinion, that some shape or form will be found to keep the U.K.  within.  </p><p>GAPES:  I'm of the view that we need to mitigate the damage that any  leaving of the EU will put us into a dangerous position if we also leave  the single market and the customs union.  It will be disastrous for our  economy.  There are many of us -- it's not just in my party -- there are  many people across the House of Commons and in the House of Lords, that  want to have the closest possible ongoing relationship with the European  Union even if we have voted to leave.  And that means, as far as we can,  staying in the European economic area, the single market and that is  necessary for inward investment and prosperity of our people.  People  didn't vote to become poorer in the referendum.  </p><p>QUEST:  But would you say membership of EEA, in other words that the, you  have to eat Europe's rules, without having a seat at the table.  The Norway  option, you're familiar with it.  Would you say that is preferable to being  outside the single market.  </p><p>GAPES:  No, no, no.  It's actually, the choice staying in the single market  is fundamental, is preferable.  The best option, is to actually be involved  in the decision-making.  The best solution would be not to leave the  European Union.  If the British people have voted for that.  Then we've got  to try to get the next best.  Which is the mitigate the damage.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>GAPES:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Now Wall Street where trading continues.  The S&amp;P -- now look at  the markets.  We don't -- we have a fall of the Dow.  We have a fall of the  S&amp;P and there are record highs.  It was dragged down, by the way, by the  way, by Home Depot.  But the NASDAQ did eke out a very small gain.  Just  five points or so.  And that's the tenth straight session of gains.  And  therefore, the NASDAQ is at a record.  </p><p>But as you can see, the numbers we're talking about today are very small.   Which reinforces the general view at the moment, that the upward pressure  remains even though there is one or two.  </p><p>[16:15:00] This is, by the way, the longest streak in more than two years.   If you take Donald Trump's inauguration, you can see just the way -- you've  got the NASDAQ, which has been on the biggest tear of all.  The Dow  industrials and the Dow and the broader market of the S&amp;P are pretty much  mirroring each other which is fascinating, with one or two minor hiccups.   The NASDAQ is up 15 percent.  The Dow and the S&amp;P is up 9 percent.  All of  which prompts me to want to know from Rana Foroohar is with me, CNN's  global economist analyst and a columnist for the \"Financial Times.\"  </p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Hello, my friend.</p><p>QUEST:  Now look at those numbers, is everything as bad as everybody says?   And is there as much chaos and confusion out of the Trump administration  and there's as much worry about the economic agenda.  What's going on?  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think the most important line is the red line.  I think the  only game in town right now is tech.  And I think that what's really  interesting is in part because there's been so much chaos in Washington.   The fact you're probably not going to see tax reform.  You're not going to  see health care reform.  A lot of things that business wanted to see,  people are saying where can I find growth.  Where is that sure thing?  The  tech sector is where that's at.  </p><p>QUEST:  And the reason the tech sector is because we've all got smartphones  and we've all moving into more of these.  And we've got AI coming down the  road.  It's not rocket science that tech is going to be the cornerstone and  the concrete of the next century.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Well right, and I like the word concrete.  Because in some ways,  I think we're moving to a deeper period of how tech is going to disrupt  everything.  We already have our phones, right?  We've had the consumer  revolution.  Now we're moving into tech making its way into industrial,  disrupting the entire S&amp;P.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, when you see Amazon, today with the deal with Sears, Sears goes  up 20 percent.  Just because it's selling its Kenmore appliances with Alexa  capabilities.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>QUEST:  I mean, it got 10 percent.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Anything that's been touched by Amazon, Google or Facebook is  gold.  I think what's really interesting is I would count on fang  companies, the big tech companies to keep their valuations.  Everything  else I'm not so sure about.  Because we are really in frothy areas for a  lot of companies.  Not the biggest ones.  </p><p>QUEST:  Of course, the fangs will keep their value or will keep --</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Yes, because they are going to eat everything else.</p><p>QUEST:  They're the ones we're all using.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Right, absolutely.  And they have all of our data.  They're  monetizing even --</p><p>QUEST:  It's cause and effect, Rana.  It's a truism.  If we're all using  Facebook and Netflix and brawl using Amazon, they're the ones that are  going to rise.  It's the new ones like Blue Apron who may or may not.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  True enough.  But all of this is predicated on the fact that the  regulatory environment remains as it is, which is very light touch.  We'll  see what comes down from the EU and we'll see what happens in Washington.   In some ways if you look at politically, the 2018 and 2020, making a boogie  man out of big tech is a political possibility.  </p><p>QUEST:  By the way, I've been asking people this question.  By the way  Rana, when did you last buy something at Sears?  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Oh, my gosh.  Not since I was growing up in rural Indiana, I  don't think.  Sorry in all seriousness.  What can I say.  I bought  something this morning on Amazon.  </p><p>QUEST:  That's my point.  </p><p>Thank you.  We've been asking all sorts of people that question, when they  bought something at Sears.  I'll talk about it in Profitable Moment at the  end of the program.  </p><p>As we continue our QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  Tonight, a victory in the battle  against the dark web.  U.S. authorities say they've taken down an illegal  marketplace selling guns and drugs.  We have the details after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:20:54] QUEST:  More now on today's breaking news.  O.J. Simpson has  been granted parole.  Jeffrey Toobin is with me.  Were you surprised?  </p><p>JEFFERY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Not really.  He has served a  long time.  He's already 70 years old.  There are not many 70-year-olds in  prison in the United States.  And the state of Nevada has standards for  when people are granted parole.  And to all appearances, he met them and  the decision seemed reasonable to me.  </p><p>QUEST:  To the court of public opinion, from which he may have been  convicted for murder in an earlier case.  And those who say you should  never have been let loose again, your answer is what?  </p><p>TOOBIN:  Well, that I agree.  That he did get away with murder.  I wrote a  book, I studied that trial very carefully.  I think the jury -- I disagreed  with the jury decision in that case as many Americans did.  But this was a  separate case and in fact, I think he was punished unduly harshly in this  Nevada case, which was a crazy robbery, kidnapping in a, in a seedy Las  Vegas hotel.  That I think was payback for the murder.  </p><p>QUEST:  How strict from your experience are parole officers in terms of  enforcing a parolee?  </p><p>TOOBIN:  It vary as lot.  They tend to be pretty strict.  There are not --  there are people you are not supposed to associate with.  He is in a  somewhat unusual situation because he is going to try to do his parole in a  different state.  In Florida where he's lived before he was arrested again.   His life will be somewhat circumscribed.  But it will be a hell of a lot  better than being in prison.  </p><p>QUEST:  I need to turn to Donald Trump.  And I need to ask you, Donald  Trump said that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, should not investigate  the finances would be crossing the red line.  He doesn't really get much  say in the matter.</p><p>TOOBIN:  No, he doesn't.  Unless he decides to take the political risk of  ordering Mueller's firing.  It is true -- </p><p>QUEST:  That would be nuclear.  </p><p>TOOBIN:  We're talking about Donald Trump here.  If you had said to me, is  he going to fire the FBI director?  I'd say, of course not, no one would do  such a thing when the FBI director was investigating him.  I would not at  all put it past the president to fire Robert Mueller, if he feels like he  is getting too close to Trump or doing something that's outside his  jurisdiction.  Donald Trump is operating by his own rules.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is Jeff Sessions well and truly damaged goods as Attorney General  of the United States?  </p><p>TOOBIN:  It's a very peculiar situation.  This was a really scathing  attack.  But it didn't really take away any of Sessions' authority as  attorney general.  It was embarrassing for Sessions.  But I thought  Sessions' response today was pretty much the only one he could make.  I'm  the attorney general.  I'm going to continue fighting crime.  I'm proud of  the work that we're doing.  It is part of the continuing weirdness of the  Trump administration.  But I don't think it fundamentally changes Jeff  Sessions' authority.  </p><p>QUEST:  It is a strange world, Jeff Toobin.  </p><p>TOOBIN:  Mr. Quest, I could not agree more.  </p><p>QUEST:  When we start with O.J. Simpson and we end up with the attorney  general being criticized by his boss, the president of the United States.  </p><p>TOOBIN:  Sir, as always.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  </p><p>Jeffrey was talking about Jeff Sessions doing his job.  While the  Department of Justice says it's taken down a massive illegal online  marketplace.  Is called AlphaBay.  And it's operating on the dark web.  One  of the internet's inaccessible to the normal browsers.  The sort that you  and I might use on the web.  This sort of place is where drugs, guns and  stolen documents, fake goods have been sold according to the Department of  Justice.  Rob Wainwright is the director of Europol and to the DOJ  announcement in Washington.</p><p>[16:25:00] So, what is it that you took down?  And how difficult was it to  take it down?  </p><p>ROB WAINWRIGHT, DIRECTOR, EUROPOL:  Well, it's even better than you said,  Richard.  Because we took down in a coordinated action in Europe and the  United States two of the three largest criminal marketplaces that are  operating in the dark net.  And between them they were trading in over  350,000 different listings of drugs and other illicit commodities.  So  actually, we've punctured a pretty big hole in the infrastructure of a  multimillion dollar digital underground criminal economy.  And I think it's  a very good day for law enforcement.  And a worrying day for those that are  engaged in criminal activity online.  </p><p>QUEST:  I don't want to rain on a good day for law enforcement.  However,  you'll be familiar -- look, if you just squeeze it, it's like a balloon.   Squeeze one bit and it will pop out somewhere else.  What measures are you  taking that will prevent somebody else or another entity from opening up to  take advantage of a marketplace clearly exists on the dark web?  </p><p>WAINWRIGHT:  We are in a race against the criminals.  They will innovate  again.  They will reform, but they will do so with a high degree of risk  right now.  Because the really clever part of this operation, if I say so  myself, is the way we coordinated.  We took covert control of very large  market in Europe.  Left it running.  Therefore, being able to identify the  criminal activities of the users involved.  While then shutting down  AlphaBay here in America and watching while all of those criminal users  flocked to this other marketplace instead.  </p><p>So, we were able to capture eight times as much intelligence about the uses  in doing this coordinated hit.  And you know, the criminals, Richard, there  are not going to know what else we're doing already out there.  What we're  going to be doing tomorrow, next month and so on.  And we're already seen  reaction in the criminal underworld, which is saying to their people, don't  go on any marketplaces right now.  It's a dangerous place now.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you have the resources and the expertise necessary -- now look,  I've never met a policeman who didn't say he wanted more resources.  But  you know what I'm asking you here.  Are you state of the art or are the  criminals ahead of you?  </p><p>WAINWRIGHT:  I don't want any more resources, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  You don't believe that any more than I do.  </p><p>WAINWRIGHT:  Listen, we worked with an internet company firm in this case  that gave us a great additional lead-in to one of these cases.  But this is  really a story about coordinated law enforcement action across different  countries.  Fantastic coming together of Europol, FBI, DEA, Dutch police.   And when we combined the technical operation resources of our community,  you know, we can really do some damage against criminality on the internet.   So, I think it's a big deal.  </p><p>QUEST:  Rob, director, thank you very much.  Lovely to have you.  Always  grateful to have you on the program Appreciate it.  </p><p>QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tonight.  the president of the United States has a  warning for the special counsel I was talking about it with Jeffrey Toobin.   The counsel is investigating the Russian meddling in the U.S. election.   Now he's saying, stay out of my business.  Or at least my family's  finances.  We'll discuss that, after the break.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:30:28] Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  And in a moment, we'll be talking a millionaire who has a  plan to expand Heathrow Airport and believes it will save billions over the  existing plan for the expansion.</p><p>Elon Musk says he has government approval to build a hyperloop between  Washington and New York.  The trip would take half an hour.  While before  that this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first.</p><p>The former American football star O.J. Simpson has been granted parole  after serving nine years in prison for kidnapping and armed robbery.  His  fall from grace has fascinated people since his murder trial and acquittal  in the 1990s.  Simpson could be freed as soon as October.  </p><p>The U.S. Attorney General says he plans to keep doing his job.  Even though  president Donald Trump told \"The New York Times\" he would have hired  someone else, had he known that Jeff Sessions would recuse himself from the  Russian investigations.  The Attorney General Sessions did so, when it  became public he didn't disclose meetings with the Russian ambassador.  </p><p>Another leading voice of rock music has gone silent.  California  authorities found Chester Bennington, the front man for the band, Linkin  Park, dead of possible suicide at his home in Los Angeles on Thursday.   He's survived by his wife and six children.  It comes only months after  Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, a close friend of Bennington's, committed  suicide.</p><p>President Trump's issued a stark warning to the special counsel Robert  Mueller.  Investigating the Trump family finances beyond any Russian  connections, would in his words cross a red line.  In \"the New York times\"  and the president said, the special counsel's investigation was compromised  by a variety of conflicts of interest.  </p><p>Now the president's son and son-in-law, and along with the former campaign  chairman Paul Manafort, they were scheduled to testify before the Senate  Judicial Committee next week.  Jared Kushner is expected to appear before  the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday.  </p><p>Joining me now, Ian Bremmer, who broke the news of president Trump's  undisclosed meeting with President Putin at the G-20.  Ian is the president  of the Eurasia Group.  Before we get all this other stuff, Ian, just tell  me -- first of all, congratulations on the story.  But when they had this  meeting, which went on for the best part of an hour, were they just sitting  at the side of the dining room table with the other G-20 or 18 leaders,  just looking, wondering what on earth are they talking about?  </p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Yes, not immediately, right.   Because it's not that unusual to have step asides and this is meant to be  the opportunity for the leaders to get to know each other better.  But when  it's going on for half an hour, 45, and then you know basically an hour,  that's when the other leaders in the room are saying -- it's very clear  that you know, with despite the fact that a number of Trump's American's  allies are in the room.  That by far the relationship that he feels the  most comfortable with personally is a country they consider to be an  adversary.  </p><p>It's also the one country that if you look both at the campaign as well as  Trump as president, it's the one country, the one leader that Trump has  consistently taken every opportunity to never criticize.  I mean he'll  criticize the Japanese on trade.  The Germans for trade, not doing enough  on paying for security, the Chinese on currency, you name it, they're going  to take a hit from Trump at some point except Putin.  And so, I think  people just you know can't add it all up.  This is yet one more indication  of that.  </p><p>QUEST:  We don't know what they talked about.  We know that the president  said it was you know, the pleasantries a bit and they talked about  adoption.  And the Russian rules, law concerning that.  Do you buy that?  </p><p>BREMMER:  Adoption is sort of Russian code word for sanctions which are  linked to the adoption issue under this Magnitsky case.  And that's  something that the Russians, of course, are very interested in ensuring is  removed from them and their economy.  Putin talks about it a lot.  So yes,  that's not pleasantries.  Adoption is a significant issue.  Trump Jr., of  course, also said during his meeting that ended up being about getting  information on Clinton, that that was also about adoption that turns out  adoption is a very popular issue to discuss among pleasantries with  Russians.  </p><p>[16:35:06] QUEST:  Robert Mueller can investigate what he likes.  We know  that from the former special prosecutor of course, Ken Starr.  Whitewater  with the Clintons started as a bad land deal and ends up as a sexual  scandal involving the president, with many people caught up and convicted  on the way.  So, when the president says investigating my family finances  is a red line, what do we make of that?  </p><p>BREMMER:  Well I think that a lot of people on the Democratic side, believe  that the Starr investigation did get over-exuberant beyond its mandate.  It  was inappropriate, shouldn't have been done.  And that it became indeed a  witch hunt against Clinton.  And I do think that a lot of people on the  Republican side believe that the same thing is going to be true of the  Mueller investigation.  That you give these guys an inch -- we're a very  litigious society -- the investigators are going to find something.  I do  think there is reason for the Trump administration, for President Trump to  feel besieged as this investigation inevitably gets bigger and bigger.  But  that doesn't mean that he has any ability, any legal recourse to stop the  investigation from happening.  And if he were to fire Mueller, the  investigation is still going to proceed.  </p><p>QUEST:  Finally, look, viewers watching us tonight, -- of which there are  many, many delighted to have with us -- are wanting really to know one  simple thing.  This Russia issue, is it just going to rumble on for the  whole four years of the first administration?  Does it go anywhere?  Is  there a denouement?  Or are we just going to literally it's going to be  like watching the paint dry.</p><p>BREMMER:  The fact that the national security adviser was forced out in  record time as a consequence of lying about his Russian connections, is a  big deal.  And I do think that these investigations as they proceed and as  leaks inevitably come from them, you'll see people like Paul Manafort, who  ran the Trump campaign, maybe members of the Trump family are going to be  in trouble.  And that's can lead two big headlines.  So, I do think that  shoes will drop and consequences will be had.  </p><p>But I also think that the media does have a fundamental anti-Trump bias.   Certainly, in the United States.  And as a consequence, anything that  smells like Trump and Russia, whether it's a big deal or a small deal,  really blows up.  And I do think that some of the media coverage around  this story, but yes, I was the initial person breaking it.  Frankly, made  it out to be a bigger deal than the individual meeting actually was.  It  does matter that they're continuing to cover up all this stuff.  But I do  think that there is one-sidedness of it.  </p><p>QUEST:  Ian Bremmer, good to see you, sir.  </p><p>BREMMER:  You too, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Imagine taking a train from Manhattan to Washington, it takes three  hours at the moment.  You can fly and a drive to the airport, well that can  take two or three years.  Elon Musk believes he can cut the journey in the  corridor from D.C.  to New York, to half an hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:40:15] QUEST:  It's called the northeast corridor from Washington up to  Baltimore.  Philadelphia to New York.  A train journey that will take you  best part of three hours, even on Acela which is the high-speed train  service.  Now imagine you can do it in 29 minutes.  That is Elon Musk's  promise founder of Tesla, SpaceX and a company called the Boring Company.   He has just tweeted, received verbal government approval for the Boring  Company to build an underground New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore- Washington  hyperloop.  </p><p>Current journey, three hours, Musk says there could be up to a dozen entry  and exit elevators in each city.  Renee Marsh is CNN's regulation  correspondent.  She's at the other end of the line.  Now Renee, he says  he's got received verbal government approval.  What does that mean?  </p><p>RENEE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION CORRESPONDENT:  That is a great  question, Richard.  And at this point.  It's really unclear.  I can tell  you New York to D.C.  in 29 minutes it sounds great, and as you know, Elon  Musk talks about this for a long time.  His vision of this hyperloop.  This  mode of transportation comprised of the pods that travel through this  system of sealed tubes without any air resistance and can get you where you  need to go, but he talked about this verbal agreement that he received from  the government.  But he didn't quite say which entity of the U.S.  government gave him that verbal agreement.  </p><p>I can tell you, I spoke with the Department of Transportation.  They said  no comment.  Referred us to the White House.  We did reach out to the White  House, they didn't deny this.  But at the same time, they didn't confirm it  either.  Only saying that they had some good conversations with Mr. Musk  about, about advancing infrastructure.  So, it remains unclear what he's  exactly talking about.  </p><p>QUEST:  Listen to a guest we had on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS last week.  A week  before last this was Hyperloop 1, another project which you'll be familiar  with, which has already tested out west.  Listen to what the head of that  project said about the prospects for hyperloop.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERVIN PISHEVAR, CO-FOUNDER HYPERLOOP ONE:  We want to build this between  cities around the world.  We would love to have it, we're shooting for an  operational hyperloop somewhere in the world by 2021.  We have incredible  leadership from Rob Lloyd, our CEO as President of Cisco.  Brent  Kalinowski, treasurer of Google.  Launch this around the world.  We're in  government studies around the world and hope to be able to announce our  first projects in the future.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  So, Renee, everybody wants hyperloop.  But you know as well as I  do, they can't even build a high-speed train.  </p><p>MARSH:  That's right.  </p><p>QUEST:  They couldn't even spend the federal money that was available, they  were giving the money away and people still didn't want to spend it how  realistic is this hyperloop?  Or is it just hyper-hype?  </p><p>MARSH:  I think everyone gets excited about this prospect because it would  be quite an advancement.  But when you talk about a project like this,  first of all, one person can't just give you the sign-off.  You have to  have the state and local permits necessary to build this sort of  revolutionary transportation system.  And that in itself is very complex.   And it would take a long period of time.  To your point, they can't even  build high-speed rail, let alone hyperloop.  Which we've never seen  anything like that in our transportation system before.  So, the short  answer to your question is -- it's an extremely complicated process.  That  cannot certainly not happen overnight.  </p><p>QUEST:  It won't happen in my lifetime.  I'll put that money on it.  </p><p>MARSH:  Don't be so negative, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  Maybe I'll be old and decrepit and I'll actually get on  the hyperloop.  Good to see you, Rene.  Thank you.  </p><p>As we continue.  On QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we'll meet the man who says he  can slash the billions of dollars off the cost of Heathrow's third runway.   Although the penultimate installment of our series, India 2024.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:45:00] UPPMA VIRDI, FOUNDER CHAI WALLI (voiceover):  I am an  Indian/Australian and my aim is to bring the two cultures together and I  found that grounding through chai.  My name is Uppma Virdi, and I'm 27  years old and I run Chai Walla.  I my mission is to educate the world  through chai.  Chai was part of our daily ritual.  Warmth, family, unity.   Coming together for a common purpose.  Which is to bond over chai.  </p><p>Melbourne is definitely a coffee culture.  However, I was on a mission to  make all the cafes here make chai properly.  Because they weren't making it  how chai is meant to be made.  Every street corner India, every hundred or  two hundred meters you see or meet these people making chai.  My mission  and my purpose is to support small farmers and support small businesses in  India that probably don't sell to big tea companies.  There are many things  I have learned through my journey through Chai Walli.  But one thing that  always sticks with me is to listen to yourself.</p><p>(on camera) And that is the blend that my grandfather used to give me  growing up.</p><p>(voice-over) I feel that we all have the answers within us, we just need to  give ourselves the mental headspace to listen to those answers.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  So, we will never build a third runway at Heathrow Airport in  London.  Well, lawmakers from several British parties are forming a group  to question the case for this third runway.  And say there are unanswered  questions about noise levels and flight paths.  And yet at the same time  this is the plan, Heathrow East, Heathrow West with a new third runway that  goes at the top.  A hotel operator has come up with his own expansion  proposal.  </p><p>The founder of the royal group says his plan would save $8.6 billion and be  kinder to the environment and the neighbors.  You're going to see this is  the plan at the moment.  And this is what he's planning to do.  Basically,  he cuts off the last bit of the runway, to make it shorter.  But what that  means is, you don't have to do massive rescheduling work around the  motorways of the M-4 and the M-25, it would be cheaper, quicker and able to  be done in a lot less time.  </p><p>Surinder Arora is the founder and chairman of the Arora Group joins me from  London.  Sir, Willie Walsh of IAG likes your plan, a few others like your  plan.  But this has been looked at.  A gazillion times, including the idea  of a shorter runway to the north.  So why do you hope that you're going to  curry favor or find favor with this?  </p><p>SURINDER ARORA, FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN OF THE ARORA GROUP:  Richard, hi, I've  spent all my life around Heathrow for the last 45 years and I've worked,  and I've had businesses around the airport.  I used to do private flying  myself.  So, I love aviation.  And looking at the expansion plans at  Heathrow and especially last year after the Davies commission report was  produced, which recommended the expansion should happen at Heathrow, we've  been looking at it and being the largest land owner where the runway and  the new infrastructure is going to go, we looked at different schemes.  </p><p>[16:50:00] And our main scheme actually is the same as the Heathrow scheme,  with the runway over the M-25, within the red line that was put forward by  the government.  Except we're taking about 23 percent less land.  And go  ahead.  </p><p>QUEST:  One of the critics of your plan says that actually you will create  a greater noise level on the approach into Heathrow.  Therefore, yes, you  may gain on the round-about, but you'll lose on the swings.  There will be  more noise from arriving aircraft.  </p><p>ARORA:  If I may clarify, the main scheme, there was a red line put round  the expansion plan, round Heathrow.  The existing runway is actually, we've  gone with the 3,500-meter runway.  The scheme you are looking at on the  left, same as Heathrow.  We went with that except how we've managed to come  up with the savings of over $5.6 billion, the initial savings was by having  better layout, rather than having a satellite terminal connected by  underground train, working with the airlines and I feel that's one of the  things that Heathrow in my view have never done is actually sitting down  and discussing with their partners, customers.  </p><p>QUEST:  Isn't the reality of this, they've come up with 1,001 different  plans.  Those like Zach Goldsmith.  Those like Boris Johnson who are  implacably opposed to any form of expansion of Heathrow.  It doesn't matter  what you come up with.  It's not going to happen.  </p><p>ARORA:  No, no, no.  Look I when I came to England in '72, Heathrow was the  number one international airport in the world.  We have been falling  behind, compared to our European partners, compared to Dubai.  Compared to  Paris, other places.  Unless we do something about it, it is not just about  having more flights in and out of Heathrow, it is actually what is right  for the nation.  We just had the recent elections and the government is  still committed.  If you ask everyone round the world, where do people want  to fly in and out of Heathrow -- </p><p>QUEST:  The government doesn't have the support and the wherewithal to get  particularly post-election.  So, my final thought to you, sir, is do you  think we will see a third runway at Heathrow in your or my lifetime?  </p><p>ARORA:  I most definitely believe so.  I think we need it, I believe it  will happen, and I remember saying about 15 years ago, that the U.K. in the  southeast where we haven't built another runway since the mid '40s that  would need expansion and will need expansion of Heathrow, Gatwick and  Stanton over the next three or four decades, but Heathrow is where we need  the expansion desperately.  The Davies commission report recommended.  I  believe it will happen.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, we appreciate you coming in to talk about it  tonight, very important, thank you.</p><p>Business to bring to you, Microsoft shares at a new high in after-hours  reported strong earnings, Satya Nadella it has been driven by the cloud  platforms, we are familiar with that.  But look at the price up two  percent, shares at $75.4.  Share have gained 20 percent so far, this year  on Wall Street.  On Wall Street, shopping is the best way to describe, the  Dow was down, so no records, as indeed was the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ does  come in at a record.  But I think you've got to look at it the way in which  the market traded today, there was a lot of sort of just downright  choppiness.  </p><p>That forced it.  But at the same time, there is a strong view that there's  an underlying momentum higher which we saw with the S&amp;P 500 getting its  multi-record days.  And that is a breakout as they say in the chart view.   European stocks ended the day highly unchanged, mixed with FTSE eking out  the best of the day.  Not quite sure why, the euro jumped against the  dollar, ECB left rates unchanged.  But Mario Draghi at the ECB did say that  the ECB was, was committed to continuing their QE program at 60 billion to  70 billion euros, until at least December 2017.  If you want to follow the  podcast.  </p><p>[16:55:00] It is all at the usual iTunes, CNN/podcast.  We will have a  Profitable Moment after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment, it was 1886 that Sears Roebuck opened  its first store and over the next century became a bastion of American  retailing.  Particularly in the Midwest.  Everybody seemed to go to Sears  and you bought houses, cars, automobiles.  Bits and bobs for the house.   Sears, if you take a look at how that progressed, has been the hallmark of  American retailing.  And unfortunately, hard times have fallen on the  company of.  They've shut many, many stores and yet today, they came up  with an announcement that they were going to sell their Kenmore appliances  through Amazon and the stock rallied some 20 percent.  </p><p>What does it tell us?  It tells us very little about Sears.  Because Sears  is probably yesterday's retailer.  It tells us something about the  necessity to sell Kenmore on Amazon.  But what it really tells us, is about  Amazon itself.  This behemoth retailer of the 21st century.  Think about  it, in this week alone we've seen two examples, Sears sells on Amazon.  And  the price goes up 20 percent.  Blue Apron gets threatened by Amazon in the  meal kit industry, and their share price collapses.  </p><p>This is not about Sears or Blue Apron.  This is about Amazon.  And the  power of the $1,000 stock that is now ruling the retail world.  That's  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in New York, whatever  you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  We will do it  again tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

No records for the Dow.  The S&amp;P has a record.  They've made a right  cobbler of what was supposed to happen there between bells and gavels.   Anarchy seems to have broken out.  But it was a strong gavel.  Let me just  count.  No record for the Dow.  S&amp;P and NASDAQ at record highs.  The day is  over.  It's Thursday It's July the 20th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, Britain and the EU, the clash over the latest Brexit negotiations.   Also, the U.S. and Europol are shining light on the dark web.  Europol's  director will be live on this program tonight.  And the most famous  prisoner in America is to be freed soon.  O.J. Simpson has been granted  parole.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City,  where I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening.  O.J. Simpson has been granted parole.  The football star  turned object of cultural sensation and then convicted, was serving a nine  to 33-year sentence for kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly  weapon.  Having served the minimum, nine years in prison, he's now been  told he will soon be released on parole.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mr. Simpson, I do vote to grant parole when eligible,  and that will conclude this hearing.  </p><p> O.J. SIMPSON, IMPRISONED IN 2008 FOR KIDNAPPING, ARMED ROBBERY:  Thank you.   Thank you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  Simpson apologized.  He told the parole board he was a model  prisoner and he promised that he would have no conflicts if released.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMPSON:  I've done my time.  You know I've done it as well and as  respectfully as I think anybody can.  I think if you talk to the wardens  and them, they'll tell you I gave them my word, I believe in the jury  system.  I've honored their verdict.  I've not complained for nine years,  all I've done is try to be helpful, and encourage the guys around there,  hey, man, do your time.  Fight in court.  And don't do anything that's  going to extend your time.  And that's the life I've tried to live because  I want to get back to my kids and my family.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  There the picture is of the parole board.  Paul Vercammen is in  Lovelock, Nevada.  This really turns on a question of had he served enough  time.  Because all the other pieces of the jigsaw, no conflicts, no -- he  had behaved in prison.  There was no reason not to grant him parole if the  feeling was he had served enough time.  </p><p> PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's correct.  Richard.  It's  also very much a thing here in Nevada.  That they rely on what's called the  risk assessment profile.  O.J. Simpson is now 70 years old.  He had not  caused any problems in this prison behind me, Lovelock is what it's called.   It's in the high desert.  He had no run-ins.  He was the commissioner of  the softball league.  He said that he was a guy that other inmates could go  to if they had problems.  </p><p> So, all defense attorneys in Nevada will tell you they follow this grid,  these risk assessment guidelines and he just scored as a low risk.  And  another huge twist, as can only happen in the case of O.J. Simpson where  there's always drama.  So often we cover parole hearings and victims or  victim come up and they are teary-eyed, they are fearful and they are  scared.  And they say to that parole commission, please do not let this  inmate out, I am in fear for my life.  Instead, Bruce Fromong, the only  surviving victim of that armed robbery comes in here and says, basically,  free Simpson.  He should be out of here.  Fromong had told us repeatedly he  thought Simpson did too much time for the crime.  Richard?  </p><p> QUEST:  So, when realistically does the nine years minimum, when does that  deadline hit?  And how quickly will he be released?  It's not going to  happen tonight.  </p><p> VERCAMMEN:  No, it is not.  And here's what's going to happen.  We're in  northern Nevada.  At this place where it's -- amazingly hot today, what's  going to happen.  He's going to be here for a while.  October 1st is his  release date.  And from best we can tell, there could be a hiccup.  Because  there's got to be very specific rules on what he does after prison.  He's  going to go to another prison in the Las Vegas area or southern Nevada.   He'll be there for a couple of weeks and then he'll be released.  </p><p> [16:05:00] He has said repeatedly, we heard this in the hearing, he's going  to go to Florida.  That's where his children live, that's where his good  friend Tom Scotto lives.  I've talked to Scotto many times over the phone  he says he thinks Simpson will be able to be in a way protected there.   Maybe not be under the scrutiny that he would let's say in Los Angeles.   That's where we think he is headed with a very, very strict set of rules  imposed upon him by the patrol commission.  </p><p> QUEST:  Let's finish on that point, Paul.  Because this is parole.  This is  not acquittal.  This is not a vacating of the conviction.  This is parole.   And under the rules of parole, if you reoffend, or you break the terms, you  go back.  </p><p> VERCAMMEN:  Exactly.  And they made it a point.  Richard to underscore  that.  One of the commissioners staring him down and saying, if you  reoffend, you will be right back in Lovelock.  One thing we should note,  O.J. Simpson in this assessment was found to have had a problem by the  commissioners, with alcohol.  So, he's got to keep himself clean, from  drugs, alcohol, we're not saying that he took drugs.  We also know that  he's been told you can't consort with certain people.  Whether they are ex- cons or whatever the case may be.  They have not given us yet this list of  conditions, but we imagine it's going to be extensive.  It's going to be  detailed.  And the warning is O.J., you better watch your step even if you  do go to Florida.  </p><p> QUEST:  Paul, good to hear you, thank you for putting it into perspective.   Paul Vercammen out of Lovelock in Nevada.</p><p> So, to our business agenda tonight.  Round two of the Brexit negotiations  will come to an end.  And Europe says it's time for Britain to get its act  together.  The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he must have  more details about the U.K.'s position.  And what it's hoping to get.   Leading the talks from the British side, David Davies described the talks  as robust but constructive.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICHEL BARNIER, CHIEF BREXIT NEGOTIATOR, EUROPEAN COMMISSION (through  translator):  A clarification of the U.K. position, is indispensable for us  to negotiate and for us to make sufficient progress on this financial  dossier, which is inseparable from the other withdrawal dossiers.  </p><p> DAVID DAVIS, BRITISH SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EU:  We've had  robust, but constructive talks this week.  Clearly there's a lot left to  talk about and further work before we can resolve this.  Ultimately getting  to a solution will require flexibility from both sides.  But as Michel  said, we shouldn't expect incremental progress in every round.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  So, every round.  This was round two of the negotiations.  Thank  you.  The two sides have agreed to meet every month before March 2019,  which marks the two-year Article 50 deadline from UK's notification to  quit.  So, on round two, seconds away, let's look at the issue that they  dealt with so far.  And so far, the U.K. isn't managing to dodge too many  blows as the negotiations are under way.  </p><p> First of all, the Brexit costs, the amount the U.K. must pay.  The EU has  got it somewhere at $115 billion.  But Barnier says he needs vital details  from Britain.  Of course, your aware, some in Britain believe that there  shouldn't be a Brexit bill.  But the general acceptance is there will be a  bill to pay.  What they're arguing about is just how much.  </p><p> And then you have the very serious question of citizens' rights.  The  acquired rights of EU nationals in the U.K. and U.K. nationals elsewhere.   Citizens' rights, Barnier says, it's a fundamental divergence of the  opinion.  </p><p> Then finally, the EU says progress must be made on these issues, before  they start talking about a new trade deal.  At the same time business  remains worried.  The British Chamber of Commerce is calling for a more  sustained and some structured discussion on Brexit and Citigroup confirms  it may move business operations two Frankfurt.  And on last night's program  you had the Small Business Federation saying that they want greater clarity  as well.  </p><p> This is a negotiation that could go right down to the line.  Mike Gapes is  the Labour MP, he joins me from London.  We're watching these negotiations,  there's a very tight timeline, but as the minister, as David Davis says,  there won't be progress or incremental improvement in every round, will  there?  </p><p> MIKE GAPES, BRITISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOUR PARTY:  Well, actually the  timeline is probably such that they won't be a comprehensive agreement in  time for March of 2019.  And they're going to have to work out transitional  arrangements, which could last several years what the government calls  interim arrangements.  </p><p> [16:10:00] But the fact is that the intricate details of 43 years of  integration of the U.K. economy, and regulations through the environment  and there's other things, are so complicated, it can't all be sorted out in  the short time.  </p><p> QUEST:  What do you think the Brexit bill should be?  How long is a piece  of string?  I realize you know, what's the number, what do you think the  number is.  </p><p> GAPES:  I can't give you an answer to that.  But the U.K. has entered into  obligations for example, the costs of pensions for former employees of the  European Union, the cost of infrastructure projects, which are partly  completed or planned.  There's a whole range of things which would require  a legal commitment and a requirement that we do meet our obligations.  </p><p> QUEST:  The hope is to settle the acquired rights, the Brexit bill and  potentially the Northern Ireland issue by October, when there will be the  potential to discuss the wider issues.  Do you think that is realistic?  </p><p> GAPES:  I think that's very optimistic.  I also think that we as members of  Parliament, we are in the dark.  The government is not telling us what its  position is.  It's not just Michel Barnier who saying the government needs  to give more detail.  Members of the House of Commons -- where of course,  Theresa May no longer has an overall majority -- are in the dark as well.   We are waiting to begin the legislative process in September for a repeal  bill to withdraw.  But we don't yet know what the British government's plan  is.  What it actually wants.  And I'm not sure they know.  </p><p> QUEST:  You would expect that the British government can't sort of  negotiate and at the same time, have an entire Parliament watching over its  back at every stage of the way.  Parliament is going to have its vote once  the process is over.  </p><p> GAPES:  Well the danger is that Theresa May still believes that somehow no  deal is better than a bad deal.  That position was killed in our general  election in June.  There is now going to be a position where Parliament is  going to assert itself.  Whether it does so this year or whether it does so  next year.  But there will be the necessity of having a broad consensus  within the House of Commons and also the House of Lords.  In order to  ensure that we are satisfied with the terms of these negotiations.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you still believe that Brexit will happen?  Or as I believe you  are of the opinion, that some shape or form will be found to keep the U.K.  within.  </p><p> GAPES:  I'm of the view that we need to mitigate the damage that any  leaving of the EU will put us into a dangerous position if we also leave  the single market and the customs union.  It will be disastrous for our  economy.  There are many of us -- it's not just in my party -- there are  many people across the House of Commons and in the House of Lords, that  want to have the closest possible ongoing relationship with the European  Union even if we have voted to leave.  And that means, as far as we can,  staying in the European economic area, the single market and that is  necessary for inward investment and prosperity of our people.  People  didn't vote to become poorer in the referendum.  </p><p> QUEST:  But would you say membership of EEA, in other words that the, you  have to eat Europe's rules, without having a seat at the table.  The Norway  option, you're familiar with it.  Would you say that is preferable to being  outside the single market.  </p><p> GAPES:  No, no, no.  It's actually, the choice staying in the single market  is fundamental, is preferable.  The best option, is to actually be involved  in the decision-making.  The best solution would be not to leave the  European Union.  If the British people have voted for that.  Then we've got  to try to get the next best.  Which is the mitigate the damage.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p> GAPES:  Thank you.</p><p> QUEST:  Now Wall Street where trading continues.  The S&amp;P -- now look at  the markets.  We don't -- we have a fall of the Dow.  We have a fall of the  S&amp;P and there are record highs.  It was dragged down, by the way, by the  way, by Home Depot.  But the NASDAQ did eke out a very small gain.  Just  five points or so.  And that's the tenth straight session of gains.  And  therefore, the NASDAQ is at a record.  </p><p> But as you can see, the numbers we're talking about today are very small.   Which reinforces the general view at the moment, that the upward pressure  remains even though there is one or two.  </p><p> [16:15:00] This is, by the way, the longest streak in more than two years.   If you take Donald Trump's inauguration, you can see just the way -- you've  got the NASDAQ, which has been on the biggest tear of all.  The Dow  industrials and the Dow and the broader market of the S&amp;P are pretty much  mirroring each other which is fascinating, with one or two minor hiccups.   The NASDAQ is up 15 percent.  The Dow and the S&amp;P is up 9 percent.  All of  which prompts me to want to know from Rana Foroohar is with me, CNN's  global economist analyst and a columnist for the \"Financial Times.\"  </p><p> RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Hello, my friend.</p><p> QUEST:  Now look at those numbers, is everything as bad as everybody says?   And is there as much chaos and confusion out of the Trump administration  and there's as much worry about the economic agenda.  What's going on?  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  I think the most important line is the red line.  I think the  only game in town right now is tech.  And I think that what's really  interesting is in part because there's been so much chaos in Washington.   The fact you're probably not going to see tax reform.  You're not going to  see health care reform.  A lot of things that business wanted to see,  people are saying where can I find growth.  Where is that sure thing?  The  tech sector is where that's at.  </p><p> QUEST:  And the reason the tech sector is because we've all got smartphones  and we've all moving into more of these.  And we've got AI coming down the  road.  It's not rocket science that tech is going to be the cornerstone and  the concrete of the next century.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Well right, and I like the word concrete.  Because in some ways,  I think we're moving to a deeper period of how tech is going to disrupt  everything.  We already have our phones, right?  We've had the consumer  revolution.  Now we're moving into tech making its way into industrial,  disrupting the entire S&amp;P.  </p><p> QUEST:  So, when you see Amazon, today with the deal with Sears, Sears goes  up 20 percent.  Just because it's selling its Kenmore appliances with Alexa  capabilities.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p> QUEST:  I mean, it got 10 percent.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Anything that's been touched by Amazon, Google or Facebook is  gold.  I think what's really interesting is I would count on fang  companies, the big tech companies to keep their valuations.  Everything  else I'm not so sure about.  Because we are really in frothy areas for a  lot of companies.  Not the biggest ones.  </p><p> QUEST:  Of course, the fangs will keep their value or will keep --</p><p> FOROOHAR:  Yes, because they are going to eat everything else.</p><p> QUEST:  They're the ones we're all using.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Right, absolutely.  And they have all of our data.  They're  monetizing even --</p><p> QUEST:  It's cause and effect, Rana.  It's a truism.  If we're all using  Facebook and Netflix and brawl using Amazon, they're the ones that are  going to rise.  It's the new ones like Blue Apron who may or may not.  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  True enough.  But all of this is predicated on the fact that the  regulatory environment remains as it is, which is very light touch.  We'll  see what comes down from the EU and we'll see what happens in Washington.   In some ways if you look at politically, the 2018 and 2020, making a boogie  man out of big tech is a political possibility.  </p><p> QUEST:  By the way, I've been asking people this question.  By the way  Rana, when did you last buy something at Sears?  </p><p> FOROOHAR:  Oh, my gosh.  Not since I was growing up in rural Indiana, I  don't think.  Sorry in all seriousness.  What can I say.  I bought  something this morning on Amazon.  </p><p> QUEST:  That's my point.  </p><p> Thank you.  We've been asking all sorts of people that question, when they  bought something at Sears.  I'll talk about it in Profitable Moment at the  end of the program.  </p><p> As we continue our QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  Tonight, a victory in the battle  against the dark web.  U.S. authorities say they've taken down an illegal  marketplace selling guns and drugs.  We have the details after the break.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:20:54] QUEST:  More now on today's breaking news.  O.J. Simpson has  been granted parole.  Jeffrey Toobin is with me.  Were you surprised?  </p><p> JEFFERY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Not really.  He has served a  long time.  He's already 70 years old.  There are not many 70-year-olds in  prison in the United States.  And the state of Nevada has standards for  when people are granted parole.  And to all appearances, he met them and  the decision seemed reasonable to me.  </p><p> QUEST:  To the court of public opinion, from which he may have been  convicted for murder in an earlier case.  And those who say you should  never have been let loose again, your answer is what?  </p><p> TOOBIN:  Well, that I agree.  That he did get away with murder.  I wrote a  book, I studied that trial very carefully.  I think the jury -- I disagreed  with the jury decision in that case as many Americans did.  But this was a  separate case and in fact, I think he was punished unduly harshly in this  Nevada case, which was a crazy robbery, kidnapping in a, in a seedy Las  Vegas hotel.  That I think was payback for the murder.  </p><p> QUEST:  How strict from your experience are parole officers in terms of  enforcing a parolee?  </p><p> TOOBIN:  It vary as lot.  They tend to be pretty strict.  There are not --  there are people you are not supposed to associate with.  He is in a  somewhat unusual situation because he is going to try to do his parole in a  different state.  In Florida where he's lived before he was arrested again.   His life will be somewhat circumscribed.  But it will be a hell of a lot  better than being in prison.  </p><p> QUEST:  I need to turn to Donald Trump.  And I need to ask you, Donald  Trump said that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, should not investigate  the finances would be crossing the red line.  He doesn't really get much  say in the matter.</p><p> TOOBIN:  No, he doesn't.  Unless he decides to take the political risk of  ordering Mueller's firing.  It is true -- </p><p> QUEST:  That would be nuclear.  </p><p> TOOBIN:  We're talking about Donald Trump here.  If you had said to me, is  he going to fire the FBI director?  I'd say, of course not, no one would do  such a thing when the FBI director was investigating him.  I would not at  all put it past the president to fire Robert Mueller, if he feels like he  is getting too close to Trump or doing something that's outside his  jurisdiction.  Donald Trump is operating by his own rules.  </p><p> QUEST:  Is Jeff Sessions well and truly damaged goods as Attorney General  of the United States?  </p><p> TOOBIN:  It's a very peculiar situation.  This was a really scathing  attack.  But it didn't really take away any of Sessions' authority as  attorney general.  It was embarrassing for Sessions.  But I thought  Sessions' response today was pretty much the only one he could make.  I'm  the attorney general.  I'm going to continue fighting crime.  I'm proud of  the work that we're doing.  It is part of the continuing weirdness of the  Trump administration.  But I don't think it fundamentally changes Jeff  Sessions' authority.  </p><p> QUEST:  It is a strange world, Jeff Toobin.  </p><p> TOOBIN:  Mr. Quest, I could not agree more.  </p><p> QUEST:  When we start with O.J. Simpson and we end up with the attorney  general being criticized by his boss, the president of the United States.  </p><p> TOOBIN:  Sir, as always.  </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you.  </p><p> Jeffrey was talking about Jeff Sessions doing his job.  While the  Department of Justice says it's taken down a massive illegal online  marketplace.  Is called AlphaBay.  And it's operating on the dark web.  One  of the internet's inaccessible to the normal browsers.  The sort that you  and I might use on the web.  This sort of place is where drugs, guns and  stolen documents, fake goods have been sold according to the Department of  Justice.  Rob Wainwright is the director of Europol and to the DOJ  announcement in Washington.</p><p> [16:25:00] So, what is it that you took down?  And how difficult was it to  take it down?  </p><p> ROB WAINWRIGHT, DIRECTOR, EUROPOL:  Well, it's even better than you said,  Richard.  Because we took down in a coordinated action in Europe and the  United States two of the three largest criminal marketplaces that are  operating in the dark net.  And between them they were trading in over  350,000 different listings of drugs and other illicit commodities.  So  actually, we've punctured a pretty big hole in the infrastructure of a  multimillion dollar digital underground criminal economy.  And I think it's  a very good day for law enforcement.  And a worrying day for those that are  engaged in criminal activity online.  </p><p> QUEST:  I don't want to rain on a good day for law enforcement.  However,  you'll be familiar -- look, if you just squeeze it, it's like a balloon.   Squeeze one bit and it will pop out somewhere else.  What measures are you  taking that will prevent somebody else or another entity from opening up to  take advantage of a marketplace clearly exists on the dark web?  </p><p> WAINWRIGHT:  We are in a race against the criminals.  They will innovate  again.  They will reform, but they will do so with a high degree of risk  right now.  Because the really clever part of this operation, if I say so  myself, is the way we coordinated.  We took covert control of very large  market in Europe.  Left it running.  Therefore, being able to identify the  criminal activities of the users involved.  While then shutting down  AlphaBay here in America and watching while all of those criminal users  flocked to this other marketplace instead.  </p><p> So, we were able to capture eight times as much intelligence about the uses  in doing this coordinated hit.  And you know, the criminals, Richard, there  are not going to know what else we're doing already out there.  What we're  going to be doing tomorrow, next month and so on.  And we're already seen  reaction in the criminal underworld, which is saying to their people, don't  go on any marketplaces right now.  It's a dangerous place now.  </p><p> QUEST:  Do you have the resources and the expertise necessary -- now look,  I've never met a policeman who didn't say he wanted more resources.  But  you know what I'm asking you here.  Are you state of the art or are the  criminals ahead of you?  </p><p> WAINWRIGHT:  I don't want any more resources, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  You don't believe that any more than I do.  </p><p> WAINWRIGHT:  Listen, we worked with an internet company firm in this case  that gave us a great additional lead-in to one of these cases.  But this is  really a story about coordinated law enforcement action across different  countries.  Fantastic coming together of Europol, FBI, DEA, Dutch police.   And when we combined the technical operation resources of our community,  you know, we can really do some damage against criminality on the internet.   So, I think it's a big deal.  </p><p> QUEST:  Rob, director, thank you very much.  Lovely to have you.  Always  grateful to have you on the program Appreciate it.  </p><p> QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tonight.  the president of the United States has a  warning for the special counsel I was talking about it with Jeffrey Toobin.   The counsel is investigating the Russian meddling in the U.S. election.   Now he's saying, stay out of my business.  Or at least my family's  finances.  We'll discuss that, after the break.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:30:28] Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  And in a moment, we'll be talking a millionaire who has a  plan to expand Heathrow Airport and believes it will save billions over the  existing plan for the expansion.</p><p> Elon Musk says he has government approval to build a hyperloop between  Washington and New York.  The trip would take half an hour.  While before  that this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first.</p><p> The former American football star O.J. Simpson has been granted parole  after serving nine years in prison for kidnapping and armed robbery.  His  fall from grace has fascinated people since his murder trial and acquittal  in the 1990s.  Simpson could be freed as soon as October.  </p><p> The U.S. Attorney General says he plans to keep doing his job.  Even though  president Donald Trump told \"The New York Times\" he would have hired  someone else, had he known that Jeff Sessions would recuse himself from the  Russian investigations.  The Attorney General Sessions did so, when it  became public he didn't disclose meetings with the Russian ambassador.  </p><p> Another leading voice of rock music has gone silent.  California  authorities found Chester Bennington, the front man for the band, Linkin  Park, dead of possible suicide at his home in Los Angeles on Thursday.   He's survived by his wife and six children.  It comes only months after  Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, a close friend of Bennington's, committed  suicide.</p><p> President Trump's issued a stark warning to the special counsel Robert  Mueller.  Investigating the Trump family finances beyond any Russian  connections, would in his words cross a red line.  In \"the New York times\"  and the president said, the special counsel's investigation was compromised  by a variety of conflicts of interest.  </p><p> Now the president's son and son-in-law, and along with the former campaign  chairman Paul Manafort, they were scheduled to testify before the Senate  Judicial Committee next week.  Jared Kushner is expected to appear before  the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday.  </p><p> Joining me now, Ian Bremmer, who broke the news of president Trump's  undisclosed meeting with President Putin at the G-20.  Ian is the president  of the Eurasia Group.  Before we get all this other stuff, Ian, just tell  me -- first of all, congratulations on the story.  But when they had this  meeting, which went on for the best part of an hour, were they just sitting  at the side of the dining room table with the other G-20 or 18 leaders,  just looking, wondering what on earth are they talking about?  </p><p> IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Yes, not immediately, right.   Because it's not that unusual to have step asides and this is meant to be  the opportunity for the leaders to get to know each other better.  But when  it's going on for half an hour, 45, and then you know basically an hour,  that's when the other leaders in the room are saying -- it's very clear  that you know, with despite the fact that a number of Trump's American's  allies are in the room.  That by far the relationship that he feels the  most comfortable with personally is a country they consider to be an  adversary.  </p><p> It's also the one country that if you look both at the campaign as well as  Trump as president, it's the one country, the one leader that Trump has  consistently taken every opportunity to never criticize.  I mean he'll  criticize the Japanese on trade.  The Germans for trade, not doing enough  on paying for security, the Chinese on currency, you name it, they're going  to take a hit from Trump at some point except Putin.  And so, I think  people just you know can't add it all up.  This is yet one more indication  of that.  </p><p> QUEST:  We don't know what they talked about.  We know that the president  said it was you know, the pleasantries a bit and they talked about  adoption.  And the Russian rules, law concerning that.  Do you buy that?  </p><p> BREMMER:  Adoption is sort of Russian code word for sanctions which are  linked to the adoption issue under this Magnitsky case.  And that's  something that the Russians, of course, are very interested in ensuring is  removed from them and their economy.  Putin talks about it a lot.  So yes,  that's not pleasantries.  Adoption is a significant issue.  Trump Jr., of  course, also said during his meeting that ended up being about getting  information on Clinton, that that was also about adoption that turns out  adoption is a very popular issue to discuss among pleasantries with  Russians.  </p><p> [16:35:06] QUEST:  Robert Mueller can investigate what he likes.  We know  that from the former special prosecutor of course, Ken Starr.  Whitewater  with the Clintons started as a bad land deal and ends up as a sexual  scandal involving the president, with many people caught up and convicted  on the way.  So, when the president says investigating my family finances  is a red line, what do we make of that?  </p><p> BREMMER:  Well I think that a lot of people on the Democratic side, believe  that the Starr investigation did get over-exuberant beyond its mandate.  It  was inappropriate, shouldn't have been done.  And that it became indeed a  witch hunt against Clinton.  And I do think that a lot of people on the  Republican side believe that the same thing is going to be true of the  Mueller investigation.  That you give these guys an inch -- we're a very  litigious society -- the investigators are going to find something.  I do  think there is reason for the Trump administration, for President Trump to  feel besieged as this investigation inevitably gets bigger and bigger.  But  that doesn't mean that he has any ability, any legal recourse to stop the  investigation from happening.  And if he were to fire Mueller, the  investigation is still going to proceed.  </p><p> QUEST:  Finally, look, viewers watching us tonight, -- of which there are  many, many delighted to have with us -- are wanting really to know one  simple thing.  This Russia issue, is it just going to rumble on for the  whole four years of the first administration?  Does it go anywhere?  Is  there a denouement?  Or are we just going to literally it's going to be  like watching the paint dry.</p><p> BREMMER:  The fact that the national security adviser was forced out in  record time as a consequence of lying about his Russian connections, is a  big deal.  And I do think that these investigations as they proceed and as  leaks inevitably come from them, you'll see people like Paul Manafort, who  ran the Trump campaign, maybe members of the Trump family are going to be  in trouble.  And that's can lead two big headlines.  So, I do think that  shoes will drop and consequences will be had.  </p><p> But I also think that the media does have a fundamental anti-Trump bias.   Certainly, in the United States.  And as a consequence, anything that  smells like Trump and Russia, whether it's a big deal or a small deal,  really blows up.  And I do think that some of the media coverage around  this story, but yes, I was the initial person breaking it.  Frankly, made  it out to be a bigger deal than the individual meeting actually was.  It  does matter that they're continuing to cover up all this stuff.  But I do  think that there is one-sidedness of it.  </p><p> QUEST:  Ian Bremmer, good to see you, sir.  </p><p> BREMMER:  You too, Richard.</p><p> QUEST:  Imagine taking a train from Manhattan to Washington, it takes three  hours at the moment.  You can fly and a drive to the airport, well that can  take two or three years.  Elon Musk believes he can cut the journey in the  corridor from D.C.  to New York, to half an hour.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:40:15] QUEST:  It's called the northeast corridor from Washington up to  Baltimore.  Philadelphia to New York.  A train journey that will take you  best part of three hours, even on Acela which is the high-speed train  service.  Now imagine you can do it in 29 minutes.  That is Elon Musk's  promise founder of Tesla, SpaceX and a company called the Boring Company.   He has just tweeted, received verbal government approval for the Boring  Company to build an underground New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore- Washington  hyperloop.  </p><p> Current journey, three hours, Musk says there could be up to a dozen entry  and exit elevators in each city.  Renee Marsh is CNN's regulation  correspondent.  She's at the other end of the line.  Now Renee, he says  he's got received verbal government approval.  What does that mean?  </p><p> RENEE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION CORRESPONDENT:  That is a great  question, Richard.  And at this point.  It's really unclear.  I can tell  you New York to D.C.  in 29 minutes it sounds great, and as you know, Elon  Musk talks about this for a long time.  His vision of this hyperloop.  This  mode of transportation comprised of the pods that travel through this  system of sealed tubes without any air resistance and can get you where you  need to go, but he talked about this verbal agreement that he received from  the government.  But he didn't quite say which entity of the U.S.  government gave him that verbal agreement.  </p><p> I can tell you, I spoke with the Department of Transportation.  They said  no comment.  Referred us to the White House.  We did reach out to the White  House, they didn't deny this.  But at the same time, they didn't confirm it  either.  Only saying that they had some good conversations with Mr. Musk  about, about advancing infrastructure.  So, it remains unclear what he's  exactly talking about.  </p><p> QUEST:  Listen to a guest we had on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS last week.  A week  before last this was Hyperloop 1, another project which you'll be familiar  with, which has already tested out west.  Listen to what the head of that  project said about the prospects for hyperloop.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERVIN PISHEVAR, CO-FOUNDER HYPERLOOP ONE:  We want to build this between  cities around the world.  We would love to have it, we're shooting for an  operational hyperloop somewhere in the world by 2021.  We have incredible  leadership from Rob Lloyd, our CEO as President of Cisco.  Brent  Kalinowski, treasurer of Google.  Launch this around the world.  We're in  government studies around the world and hope to be able to announce our  first projects in the future.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUEST:  So, Renee, everybody wants hyperloop.  But you know as well as I  do, they can't even build a high-speed train.  </p><p> MARSH:  That's right.  </p><p> QUEST:  They couldn't even spend the federal money that was available, they  were giving the money away and people still didn't want to spend it how  realistic is this hyperloop?  Or is it just hyper-hype?  </p><p> MARSH:  I think everyone gets excited about this prospect because it would  be quite an advancement.  But when you talk about a project like this,  first of all, one person can't just give you the sign-off.  You have to  have the state and local permits necessary to build this sort of  revolutionary transportation system.  And that in itself is very complex.   And it would take a long period of time.  To your point, they can't even  build high-speed rail, let alone hyperloop.  Which we've never seen  anything like that in our transportation system before.  So, the short  answer to your question is -- it's an extremely complicated process.  That  cannot certainly not happen overnight.  </p><p> QUEST:  It won't happen in my lifetime.  I'll put that money on it.  </p><p> MARSH:  Don't be so negative, Richard.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right.  Maybe I'll be old and decrepit and I'll actually get on  the hyperloop.  Good to see you, Rene.  Thank you.  </p><p> As we continue.  On QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we'll meet the man who says he  can slash the billions of dollars off the cost of Heathrow's third runway.   Although the penultimate installment of our series, India 2024.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [16:45:00] UPPMA VIRDI, FOUNDER CHAI WALLI (voiceover):  I am an  Indian/Australian and my aim is to bring the two cultures together and I  found that grounding through chai.  My name is Uppma Virdi, and I'm 27  years old and I run Chai Walla.  I my mission is to educate the world  through chai.  Chai was part of our daily ritual.  Warmth, family, unity.   Coming together for a common purpose.  Which is to bond over chai.  </p><p> Melbourne is definitely a coffee culture.  However, I was on a mission to  make all the cafes here make chai properly.  Because they weren't making it  how chai is meant to be made.  Every street corner India, every hundred or  two hundred meters you see or meet these people making chai.  My mission  and my purpose is to support small farmers and support small businesses in  India that probably don't sell to big tea companies.  There are many things  I have learned through my journey through Chai Walli.  But one thing that  always sticks with me is to listen to yourself.</p><p> (on camera) And that is the blend that my grandfather used to give me  growing up.</p><p> (voice-over) I feel that we all have the answers within us, we just need to  give ourselves the mental headspace to listen to those answers.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  So, we will never build a third runway at Heathrow Airport in  London.  Well, lawmakers from several British parties are forming a group  to question the case for this third runway.  And say there are unanswered  questions about noise levels and flight paths.  And yet at the same time  this is the plan, Heathrow East, Heathrow West with a new third runway that  goes at the top.  A hotel operator has come up with his own expansion  proposal.  </p><p> The founder of the royal group says his plan would save $8.6 billion and be  kinder to the environment and the neighbors.  You're going to see this is  the plan at the moment.  And this is what he's planning to do.  Basically,  he cuts off the last bit of the runway, to make it shorter.  But what that  means is, you don't have to do massive rescheduling work around the  motorways of the M-4 and the M-25, it would be cheaper, quicker and able to  be done in a lot less time.  </p><p> Surinder Arora is the founder and chairman of the Arora Group joins me from  London.  Sir, Willie Walsh of IAG likes your plan, a few others like your  plan.  But this has been looked at.  A gazillion times, including the idea  of a shorter runway to the north.  So why do you hope that you're going to  curry favor or find favor with this?  </p><p> SURINDER ARORA, FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN OF THE ARORA GROUP:  Richard, hi, I've  spent all my life around Heathrow for the last 45 years and I've worked,  and I've had businesses around the airport.  I used to do private flying  myself.  So, I love aviation.  And looking at the expansion plans at  Heathrow and especially last year after the Davies commission report was  produced, which recommended the expansion should happen at Heathrow, we've  been looking at it and being the largest land owner where the runway and  the new infrastructure is going to go, we looked at different schemes.  </p><p> [16:50:00] And our main scheme actually is the same as the Heathrow scheme,  with the runway over the M-25, within the red line that was put forward by  the government.  Except we're taking about 23 percent less land.  And go  ahead.  </p><p> QUEST:  One of the critics of your plan says that actually you will create  a greater noise level on the approach into Heathrow.  Therefore, yes, you  may gain on the round-about, but you'll lose on the swings.  There will be  more noise from arriving aircraft.  </p><p> ARORA:  If I may clarify, the main scheme, there was a red line put round  the expansion plan, round Heathrow.  The existing runway is actually, we've  gone with the 3,500-meter runway.  The scheme you are looking at on the  left, same as Heathrow.  We went with that except how we've managed to come  up with the savings of over $5.6 billion, the initial savings was by having  better layout, rather than having a satellite terminal connected by  underground train, working with the airlines and I feel that's one of the  things that Heathrow in my view have never done is actually sitting down  and discussing with their partners, customers.  </p><p> QUEST:  Isn't the reality of this, they've come up with 1,001 different  plans.  Those like Zach Goldsmith.  Those like Boris Johnson who are  implacably opposed to any form of expansion of Heathrow.  It doesn't matter  what you come up with.  It's not going to happen.  </p><p> ARORA:  No, no, no.  Look I when I came to England in '72, Heathrow was the  number one international airport in the world.  We have been falling  behind, compared to our European partners, compared to Dubai.  Compared to  Paris, other places.  Unless we do something about it, it is not just about  having more flights in and out of Heathrow, it is actually what is right  for the nation.  We just had the recent elections and the government is  still committed.  If you ask everyone round the world, where do people want  to fly in and out of Heathrow -- </p><p> QUEST:  The government doesn't have the support and the wherewithal to get  particularly post-election.  So, my final thought to you, sir, is do you  think we will see a third runway at Heathrow in your or my lifetime?  </p><p> ARORA:  I most definitely believe so.  I think we need it, I believe it  will happen, and I remember saying about 15 years ago, that the U.K. in the  southeast where we haven't built another runway since the mid '40s that  would need expansion and will need expansion of Heathrow, Gatwick and  Stanton over the next three or four decades, but Heathrow is where we need  the expansion desperately.  The Davies commission report recommended.  I  believe it will happen.  </p><p> QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, we appreciate you coming in to talk about it  tonight, very important, thank you.</p><p> Business to bring to you, Microsoft shares at a new high in after-hours  reported strong earnings, Satya Nadella it has been driven by the cloud  platforms, we are familiar with that.  But look at the price up two  percent, shares at $75.4.  Share have gained 20 percent so far, this year  on Wall Street.  On Wall Street, shopping is the best way to describe, the  Dow was down, so no records, as indeed was the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ does  come in at a record.  But I think you've got to look at it the way in which  the market traded today, there was a lot of sort of just downright  choppiness.  </p><p> That forced it.  But at the same time, there is a strong view that there's  an underlying momentum higher which we saw with the S&amp;P 500 getting its  multi-record days.  And that is a breakout as they say in the chart view.   European stocks ended the day highly unchanged, mixed with FTSE eking out  the best of the day.  Not quite sure why, the euro jumped against the  dollar, ECB left rates unchanged.  But Mario Draghi at the ECB did say that  the ECB was, was committed to continuing their QE program at 60 billion to  70 billion euros, until at least December 2017.  If you want to follow the  podcast.  </p><p> [16:55:00] It is all at the usual iTunes, CNN/podcast.  We will have a  Profitable Moment after the break.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment, it was 1886 that Sears Roebuck opened  its first store and over the next century became a bastion of American  retailing.  Particularly in the Midwest.  Everybody seemed to go to Sears  and you bought houses, cars, automobiles.  Bits and bobs for the house.   Sears, if you take a look at how that progressed, has been the hallmark of  American retailing.  And unfortunately, hard times have fallen on the  company of.  They've shut many, many stores and yet today, they came up  with an announcement that they were going to sell their Kenmore appliances  through Amazon and the stock rallied some 20 percent.  </p><p> What does it tell us?  It tells us very little about Sears.  Because Sears  is probably yesterday's retailer.  It tells us something about the  necessity to sell Kenmore on Amazon.  But what it really tells us, is about  Amazon itself.  This behemoth retailer of the 21st century.  Think about  it, in this week alone we've seen two examples, Sears sells on Amazon.  And  the price goes up 20 percent.  Blue Apron gets threatened by Amazon in the  meal kit industry, and their share price collapses.  </p><p> This is not about Sears or Blue Apron.  This is about Amazon.  And the  power of the $1,000 stock that is now ruling the retail world.  That's  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in New York, whatever  you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  We will do it  again tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

No records for the Dow.  The S&amp;P has a record.  They've made a right  cobbler of what was supposed to happen there between bells and gavels.   Anarchy seems to have broken out.  But it was a strong gavel.  Let me just  count.  No record for the Dow.  S&amp;P and NASDAQ at record highs.  The day is  over.  It's Thursday It's July the 20th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, Britain and the EU, the clash over the latest Brexit negotiations.   Also, the U.S. and Europol are shining light on the dark web.  Europol's  director will be live on this program tonight.  And the most famous  prisoner in America is to be freed soon.  O.J. Simpson has been granted  parole.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City,  where I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  O.J. Simpson has been granted parole.  The football star  turned object of cultural sensation and then convicted, was serving a nine  to 33-year sentence for kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly  weapon.  Having served the minimum, nine years in prison, he's now been  told he will soon be released on parole.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mr. Simpson, I do vote to grant parole when eligible,  and that will conclude this hearing.  </p><p>O.J. SIMPSON, IMPRISONED IN 2008 FOR KIDNAPPING, ARMED ROBBERY:  Thank you.   Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Simpson apologized.  He told the parole board he was a model  prisoner and he promised that he would have no conflicts if released.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMPSON:  I've done my time.  You know I've done it as well and as  respectfully as I think anybody can.  I think if you talk to the wardens  and them, they'll tell you I gave them my word, I believe in the jury  system.  I've honored their verdict.  I've not complained for nine years,  all I've done is try to be helpful, and encourage the guys around there,  hey, man, do your time.  Fight in court.  And don't do anything that's  going to extend your time.  And that's the life I've tried to live because  I want to get back to my kids and my family.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  There the picture is of the parole board.  Paul Vercammen is in  Lovelock, Nevada.  This really turns on a question of had he served enough  time.  Because all the other pieces of the jigsaw, no conflicts, no -- he  had behaved in prison.  There was no reason not to grant him parole if the  feeling was he had served enough time.  </p><p>PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's correct.  Richard.  It's  also very much a thing here in Nevada.  That they rely on what's called the  risk assessment profile.  O.J. Simpson is now 70 years old.  He had not  caused any problems in this prison behind me, Lovelock is what it's called.   It's in the high desert.  He had no run-ins.  He was the commissioner of  the softball league.  He said that he was a guy that other inmates could go  to if they had problems.  </p><p>So, all defense attorneys in Nevada will tell you they follow this grid,  these risk assessment guidelines and he just scored as a low risk.  And  another huge twist, as can only happen in the case of O.J. Simpson where  there's always drama.  So often we cover parole hearings and victims or  victim come up and they are teary-eyed, they are fearful and they are  scared.  And they say to that parole commission, please do not let this  inmate out, I am in fear for my life.  Instead, Bruce Fromong, the only  surviving victim of that armed robbery comes in here and says, basically,  free Simpson.  He should be out of here.  Fromong had told us repeatedly he  thought Simpson did too much time for the crime.  Richard?  </p><p>QUEST:  So, when realistically does the nine years minimum, when does that  deadline hit?  And how quickly will he be released?  It's not going to  happen tonight.  </p><p>VERCAMMEN:  No, it is not.  And here's what's going to happen.  We're in  northern Nevada.  At this place where it's -- amazingly hot today, what's  going to happen.  He's going to be here for a while.  October 1st is his  release date.  And from best we can tell, there could be a hiccup.  Because  there's got to be very specific rules on what he does after prison.  He's  going to go to another prison in the Las Vegas area or southern Nevada.   He'll be there for a couple of weeks and then he'll be released.  </p><p>[16:05:00] He has said repeatedly, we heard this in the hearing, he's going  to go to Florida.  That's where his children live, that's where his good  friend Tom Scotto lives.  I've talked to Scotto many times over the phone  he says he thinks Simpson will be able to be in a way protected there.   Maybe not be under the scrutiny that he would let's say in Los Angeles.   That's where we think he is headed with a very, very strict set of rules  imposed upon him by the patrol commission.  </p><p>QUEST:  Let's finish on that point, Paul.  Because this is parole.  This is  not acquittal.  This is not a vacating of the conviction.  This is parole.   And under the rules of parole, if you reoffend, or you break the terms, you  go back.  </p><p>VERCAMMEN:  Exactly.  And they made it a point.  Richard to underscore  that.  One of the commissioners staring him down and saying, if you  reoffend, you will be right back in Lovelock.  One thing we should note,  O.J. Simpson in this assessment was found to have had a problem by the  commissioners, with alcohol.  So, he's got to keep himself clean, from  drugs, alcohol, we're not saying that he took drugs.  We also know that  he's been told you can't consort with certain people.  Whether they are ex- cons or whatever the case may be.  They have not given us yet this list of  conditions, but we imagine it's going to be extensive.  It's going to be  detailed.  And the warning is O.J., you better watch your step even if you  do go to Florida.  </p><p>QUEST:  Paul, good to hear you, thank you for putting it into perspective.   Paul Vercammen out of Lovelock in Nevada.</p><p>So, to our business agenda tonight.  Round two of the Brexit negotiations  will come to an end.  And Europe says it's time for Britain to get its act  together.  The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he must have  more details about the U.K.'s position.  And what it's hoping to get.   Leading the talks from the British side, David Davies described the talks  as robust but constructive.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, CHIEF BREXIT NEGOTIATOR, EUROPEAN COMMISSION (through  translator):  A clarification of the U.K. position, is indispensable for us  to negotiate and for us to make sufficient progress on this financial  dossier, which is inseparable from the other withdrawal dossiers.  </p><p>DAVID DAVIS, BRITISH SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EU:  We've had  robust, but constructive talks this week.  Clearly there's a lot left to  talk about and further work before we can resolve this.  Ultimately getting  to a solution will require flexibility from both sides.  But as Michel  said, we shouldn't expect incremental progress in every round.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  So, every round.  This was round two of the negotiations.  Thank  you.  The two sides have agreed to meet every month before March 2019,  which marks the two-year Article 50 deadline from UK's notification to  quit.  So, on round two, seconds away, let's look at the issue that they  dealt with so far.  And so far, the U.K. isn't managing to dodge too many  blows as the negotiations are under way.  </p><p>First of all, the Brexit costs, the amount the U.K. must pay.  The EU has  got it somewhere at $115 billion.  But Barnier says he needs vital details  from Britain.  Of course, your aware, some in Britain believe that there  shouldn't be a Brexit bill.  But the general acceptance is there will be a  bill to pay.  What they're arguing about is just how much.  </p><p>And then you have the very serious question of citizens' rights.  The  acquired rights of EU nationals in the U.K. and U.K. nationals elsewhere.   Citizens' rights, Barnier says, it's a fundamental divergence of the  opinion.  </p><p>Then finally, the EU says progress must be made on these issues, before  they start talking about a new trade deal.  At the same time business  remains worried.  The British Chamber of Commerce is calling for a more  sustained and some structured discussion on Brexit and Citigroup confirms  it may move business operations two Frankfurt.  And on last night's program  you had the Small Business Federation saying that they want greater clarity  as well.  </p><p>This is a negotiation that could go right down to the line.  Mike Gapes is  the Labour MP, he joins me from London.  We're watching these negotiations,  there's a very tight timeline, but as the minister, as David Davis says,  there won't be progress or incremental improvement in every round, will  there?  </p><p>MIKE GAPES, BRITISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOUR PARTY:  Well, actually the  timeline is probably such that they won't be a comprehensive agreement in  time for March of 2019.  And they're going to have to work out transitional  arrangements, which could last several years what the government calls  interim arrangements.  </p><p>[16:10:00] But the fact is that the intricate details of 43 years of  integration of the U.K. economy, and regulations through the environment  and there's other things, are so complicated, it can't all be sorted out in  the short time.  </p><p>QUEST:  What do you think the Brexit bill should be?  How long is a piece  of string?  I realize you know, what's the number, what do you think the  number is.  </p><p>GAPES:  I can't give you an answer to that.  But the U.K. has entered into  obligations for example, the costs of pensions for former employees of the  European Union, the cost of infrastructure projects, which are partly  completed or planned.  There's a whole range of things which would require  a legal commitment and a requirement that we do meet our obligations.  </p><p>QUEST:  The hope is to settle the acquired rights, the Brexit bill and  potentially the Northern Ireland issue by October, when there will be the  potential to discuss the wider issues.  Do you think that is realistic?  </p><p>GAPES:  I think that's very optimistic.  I also think that we as members of  Parliament, we are in the dark.  The government is not telling us what its  position is.  It's not just Michel Barnier who saying the government needs  to give more detail.  Members of the House of Commons -- where of course,  Theresa May no longer has an overall majority -- are in the dark as well.   We are waiting to begin the legislative process in September for a repeal  bill to withdraw.  But we don't yet know what the British government's plan  is.  What it actually wants.  And I'm not sure they know.  </p><p>QUEST:  You would expect that the British government can't sort of  negotiate and at the same time, have an entire Parliament watching over its  back at every stage of the way.  Parliament is going to have its vote once  the process is over.  </p><p>GAPES:  Well the danger is that Theresa May still believes that somehow no  deal is better than a bad deal.  That position was killed in our general  election in June.  There is now going to be a position where Parliament is  going to assert itself.  Whether it does so this year or whether it does so  next year.  But there will be the necessity of having a broad consensus  within the House of Commons and also the House of Lords.  In order to  ensure that we are satisfied with the terms of these negotiations.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you still believe that Brexit will happen?  Or as I believe you  are of the opinion, that some shape or form will be found to keep the U.K.  within.  </p><p>GAPES:  I'm of the view that we need to mitigate the damage that any  leaving of the EU will put us into a dangerous position if we also leave  the single market and the customs union.  It will be disastrous for our  economy.  There are many of us -- it's not just in my party -- there are  many people across the House of Commons and in the House of Lords, that  want to have the closest possible ongoing relationship with the European  Union even if we have voted to leave.  And that means, as far as we can,  staying in the European economic area, the single market and that is  necessary for inward investment and prosperity of our people.  People  didn't vote to become poorer in the referendum.  </p><p>QUEST:  But would you say membership of EEA, in other words that the, you  have to eat Europe's rules, without having a seat at the table.  The Norway  option, you're familiar with it.  Would you say that is preferable to being  outside the single market.  </p><p>GAPES:  No, no, no.  It's actually, the choice staying in the single market  is fundamental, is preferable.  The best option, is to actually be involved  in the decision-making.  The best solution would be not to leave the  European Union.  If the British people have voted for that.  Then we've got  to try to get the next best.  Which is the mitigate the damage.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, thank you.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>GAPES:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Now Wall Street where trading continues.  The S&amp;P -- now look at  the markets.  We don't -- we have a fall of the Dow.  We have a fall of the  S&amp;P and there are record highs.  It was dragged down, by the way, by the  way, by Home Depot.  But the NASDAQ did eke out a very small gain.  Just  five points or so.  And that's the tenth straight session of gains.  And  therefore, the NASDAQ is at a record.  </p><p>But as you can see, the numbers we're talking about today are very small.   Which reinforces the general view at the moment, that the upward pressure  remains even though there is one or two.  </p><p>[16:15:00] This is, by the way, the longest streak in more than two years.   If you take Donald Trump's inauguration, you can see just the way -- you've  got the NASDAQ, which has been on the biggest tear of all.  The Dow  industrials and the Dow and the broader market of the S&amp;P are pretty much  mirroring each other which is fascinating, with one or two minor hiccups.   The NASDAQ is up 15 percent.  The Dow and the S&amp;P is up 9 percent.  All of  which prompts me to want to know from Rana Foroohar is with me, CNN's  global economist analyst and a columnist for the \"Financial Times.\"  </p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST:  Hello, my friend.</p><p>QUEST:  Now look at those numbers, is everything as bad as everybody says?   And is there as much chaos and confusion out of the Trump administration  and there's as much worry about the economic agenda.  What's going on?  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think the most important line is the red line.  I think the  only game in town right now is tech.  And I think that what's really  interesting is in part because there's been so much chaos in Washington.   The fact you're probably not going to see tax reform.  You're not going to  see health care reform.  A lot of things that business wanted to see,  people are saying where can I find growth.  Where is that sure thing?  The  tech sector is where that's at.  </p><p>QUEST:  And the reason the tech sector is because we've all got smartphones  and we've all moving into more of these.  And we've got AI coming down the  road.  It's not rocket science that tech is going to be the cornerstone and  the concrete of the next century.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Well right, and I like the word concrete.  Because in some ways,  I think we're moving to a deeper period of how tech is going to disrupt  everything.  We already have our phones, right?  We've had the consumer  revolution.  Now we're moving into tech making its way into industrial,  disrupting the entire S&amp;P.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, when you see Amazon, today with the deal with Sears, Sears goes  up 20 percent.  Just because it's selling its Kenmore appliances with Alexa  capabilities.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>QUEST:  I mean, it got 10 percent.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Anything that's been touched by Amazon, Google or Facebook is  gold.  I think what's really interesting is I would count on fang  companies, the big tech companies to keep their valuations.  Everything  else I'm not so sure about.  Because we are really in frothy areas for a  lot of companies.  Not the biggest ones.  </p><p>QUEST:  Of course, the fangs will keep their value or will keep --</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Yes, because they are going to eat everything else.</p><p>QUEST:  They're the ones we're all using.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Right, absolutely.  And they have all of our data.  They're  monetizing even --</p><p>QUEST:  It's cause and effect, Rana.  It's a truism.  If we're all using  Facebook and Netflix and brawl using Amazon, they're the ones that are  going to rise.  It's the new ones like Blue Apron who may or may not.  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  True enough.  But all of this is predicated on the fact that the  regulatory environment remains as it is, which is very light touch.  We'll  see what comes down from the EU and we'll see what happens in Washington.   In some ways if you look at politically, the 2018 and 2020, making a boogie  man out of big tech is a political possibility.  </p><p>QUEST:  By the way, I've been asking people this question.  By the way  Rana, when did you last buy something at Sears?  </p><p>FOROOHAR:  Oh, my gosh.  Not since I was growing up in rural Indiana, I  don't think.  Sorry in all seriousness.  What can I say.  I bought  something this morning on Amazon.  </p><p>QUEST:  That's my point.  </p><p>Thank you.  We've been asking all sorts of people that question, when they  bought something at Sears.  I'll talk about it in Profitable Moment at the  end of the program.  </p><p>As we continue our QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  Tonight, a victory in the battle  against the dark web.  U.S. authorities say they've taken down an illegal  marketplace selling guns and drugs.  We have the details after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:20:54] QUEST:  More now on today's breaking news.  O.J. Simpson has  been granted parole.  Jeffrey Toobin is with me.  Were you surprised?  </p><p>JEFFERY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Not really.  He has served a  long time.  He's already 70 years old.  There are not many 70-year-olds in  prison in the United States.  And the state of Nevada has standards for  when people are granted parole.  And to all appearances, he met them and  the decision seemed reasonable to me.  </p><p>QUEST:  To the court of public opinion, from which he may have been  convicted for murder in an earlier case.  And those who say you should  never have been let loose again, your answer is what?  </p><p>TOOBIN:  Well, that I agree.  That he did get away with murder.  I wrote a  book, I studied that trial very carefully.  I think the jury -- I disagreed  with the jury decision in that case as many Americans did.  But this was a  separate case and in fact, I think he was punished unduly harshly in this  Nevada case, which was a crazy robbery, kidnapping in a, in a seedy Las  Vegas hotel.  That I think was payback for the murder.  </p><p>QUEST:  How strict from your experience are parole officers in terms of  enforcing a parolee?  </p><p>TOOBIN:  It vary as lot.  They tend to be pretty strict.  There are not --  there are people you are not supposed to associate with.  He is in a  somewhat unusual situation because he is going to try to do his parole in a  different state.  In Florida where he's lived before he was arrested again.   His life will be somewhat circumscribed.  But it will be a hell of a lot  better than being in prison.  </p><p>QUEST:  I need to turn to Donald Trump.  And I need to ask you, Donald  Trump said that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, should not investigate  the finances would be crossing the red line.  He doesn't really get much  say in the matter.</p><p>TOOBIN:  No, he doesn't.  Unless he decides to take the political risk of  ordering Mueller's firing.  It is true -- </p><p>QUEST:  That would be nuclear.  </p><p>TOOBIN:  We're talking about Donald Trump here.  If you had said to me, is  he going to fire the FBI director?  I'd say, of course not, no one would do  such a thing when the FBI director was investigating him.  I would not at  all put it past the president to fire Robert Mueller, if he feels like he  is getting too close to Trump or doing something that's outside his  jurisdiction.  Donald Trump is operating by his own rules.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is Jeff Sessions well and truly damaged goods as Attorney General  of the United States?  </p><p>TOOBIN:  It's a very peculiar situation.  This was a really scathing  attack.  But it didn't really take away any of Sessions' authority as  attorney general.  It was embarrassing for Sessions.  But I thought  Sessions' response today was pretty much the only one he could make.  I'm  the attorney general.  I'm going to continue fighting crime.  I'm proud of  the work that we're doing.  It is part of the continuing weirdness of the  Trump administration.  But I don't think it fundamentally changes Jeff  Sessions' authority.  </p><p>QUEST:  It is a strange world, Jeff Toobin.  </p><p>TOOBIN:  Mr. Quest, I could not agree more.  </p><p>QUEST:  When we start with O.J. Simpson and we end up with the attorney  general being criticized by his boss, the president of the United States.  </p><p>TOOBIN:  Sir, as always.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  </p><p>Jeffrey was talking about Jeff Sessions doing his job.  While the  Department of Justice says it's taken down a massive illegal online  marketplace.  Is called AlphaBay.  And it's operating on the dark web.  One  of the internet's inaccessible to the normal browsers.  The sort that you  and I might use on the web.  This sort of place is where drugs, guns and  stolen documents, fake goods have been sold according to the Department of  Justice.  Rob Wainwright is the director of Europol and to the DOJ  announcement in Washington.</p><p>[16:25:00] So, what is it that you took down?  And how difficult was it to  take it down?  </p><p>ROB WAINWRIGHT, DIRECTOR, EUROPOL:  Well, it's even better than you said,  Richard.  Because we took down in a coordinated action in Europe and the  United States two of the three largest criminal marketplaces that are  operating in the dark net.  And between them they were trading in over  350,000 different listings of drugs and other illicit commodities.  So  actually, we've punctured a pretty big hole in the infrastructure of a  multimillion dollar digital underground criminal economy.  And I think it's  a very good day for law enforcement.  And a worrying day for those that are  engaged in criminal activity online.  </p><p>QUEST:  I don't want to rain on a good day for law enforcement.  However,  you'll be familiar -- look, if you just squeeze it, it's like a balloon.   Squeeze one bit and it will pop out somewhere else.  What measures are you  taking that will prevent somebody else or another entity from opening up to  take advantage of a marketplace clearly exists on the dark web?  </p><p>WAINWRIGHT:  We are in a race against the criminals.  They will innovate  again.  They will reform, but they will do so with a high degree of risk  right now.  Because the really clever part of this operation, if I say so  myself, is the way we coordinated.  We took covert control of very large  market in Europe.  Left it running.  Therefore, being able to identify the  criminal activities of the users involved.  While then shutting down  AlphaBay here in America and watching while all of those criminal users  flocked to this other marketplace instead.  </p><p>So, we were able to capture eight times as much intelligence about the uses  in doing this coordinated hit.  And you know, the criminals, Richard, there  are not going to know what else we're doing already out there.  What we're  going to be doing tomorrow, next month and so on.  And we're already seen  reaction in the criminal underworld, which is saying to their people, don't  go on any marketplaces right now.  It's a dangerous place now.  </p><p>QUEST:  Do you have the resources and the expertise necessary -- now look,  I've never met a policeman who didn't say he wanted more resources.  But  you know what I'm asking you here.  Are you state of the art or are the  criminals ahead of you?  </p><p>WAINWRIGHT:  I don't want any more resources, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  You don't believe that any more than I do.  </p><p>WAINWRIGHT:  Listen, we worked with an internet company firm in this case  that gave us a great additional lead-in to one of these cases.  But this is  really a story about coordinated law enforcement action across different  countries.  Fantastic coming together of Europol, FBI, DEA, Dutch police.   And when we combined the technical operation resources of our community,  you know, we can really do some damage against criminality on the internet.   So, I think it's a big deal.  </p><p>QUEST:  Rob, director, thank you very much.  Lovely to have you.  Always  grateful to have you on the program Appreciate it.  </p><p>QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tonight.  the president of the United States has a  warning for the special counsel I was talking about it with Jeffrey Toobin.   The counsel is investigating the Russian meddling in the U.S. election.   Now he's saying, stay out of my business.  Or at least my family's  finances.  We'll discuss that, after the break.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:30:28] Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in  just a moment.  And in a moment, we'll be talking a millionaire who has a  plan to expand Heathrow Airport and believes it will save billions over the  existing plan for the expansion.</p><p>Elon Musk says he has government approval to build a hyperloop between  Washington and New York.  The trip would take half an hour.  While before  that this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first.</p><p>The former American football star O.J. Simpson has been granted parole  after serving nine years in prison for kidnapping and armed robbery.  His  fall from grace has fascinated people since his murder trial and acquittal  in the 1990s.  Simpson could be freed as soon as October.  </p><p>The U.S. Attorney General says he plans to keep doing his job.  Even though  president Donald Trump told \"The New York Times\" he would have hired  someone else, had he known that Jeff Sessions would recuse himself from the  Russian investigations.  The Attorney General Sessions did so, when it  became public he didn't disclose meetings with the Russian ambassador.  </p><p>Another leading voice of rock music has gone silent.  California  authorities found Chester Bennington, the front man for the band, Linkin  Park, dead of possible suicide at his home in Los Angeles on Thursday.   He's survived by his wife and six children.  It comes only months after  Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, a close friend of Bennington's, committed  suicide.</p><p>President Trump's issued a stark warning to the special counsel Robert  Mueller.  Investigating the Trump family finances beyond any Russian  connections, would in his words cross a red line.  In \"the New York times\"  and the president said, the special counsel's investigation was compromised  by a variety of conflicts of interest.  </p><p>Now the president's son and son-in-law, and along with the former campaign  chairman Paul Manafort, they were scheduled to testify before the Senate  Judicial Committee next week.  Jared Kushner is expected to appear before  the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday.  </p><p>Joining me now, Ian Bremmer, who broke the news of president Trump's  undisclosed meeting with President Putin at the G-20.  Ian is the president  of the Eurasia Group.  Before we get all this other stuff, Ian, just tell  me -- first of all, congratulations on the story.  But when they had this  meeting, which went on for the best part of an hour, were they just sitting  at the side of the dining room table with the other G-20 or 18 leaders,  just looking, wondering what on earth are they talking about?  </p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Yes, not immediately, right.   Because it's not that unusual to have step asides and this is meant to be  the opportunity for the leaders to get to know each other better.  But when  it's going on for half an hour, 45, and then you know basically an hour,  that's when the other leaders in the room are saying -- it's very clear  that you know, with despite the fact that a number of Trump's American's  allies are in the room.  That by far the relationship that he feels the  most comfortable with personally is a country they consider to be an  adversary.  </p><p>It's also the one country that if you look both at the campaign as well as  Trump as president, it's the one country, the one leader that Trump has  consistently taken every opportunity to never criticize.  I mean he'll  criticize the Japanese on trade.  The Germans for trade, not doing enough  on paying for security, the Chinese on currency, you name it, they're going  to take a hit from Trump at some point except Putin.  And so, I think  people just you know can't add it all up.  This is yet one more indication  of that.  </p><p>QUEST:  We don't know what they talked about.  We know that the president  said it was you know, the pleasantries a bit and they talked about  adoption.  And the Russian rules, law concerning that.  Do you buy that?  </p><p>BREMMER:  Adoption is sort of Russian code word for sanctions which are  linked to the adoption issue under this Magnitsky case.  And that's  something that the Russians, of course, are very interested in ensuring is  removed from them and their economy.  Putin talks about it a lot.  So yes,  that's not pleasantries.  Adoption is a significant issue.  Trump Jr., of  course, also said during his meeting that ended up being about getting  information on Clinton, that that was also about adoption that turns out  adoption is a very popular issue to discuss among pleasantries with  Russians.  </p><p>[16:35:06] QUEST:  Robert Mueller can investigate what he likes.  We know  that from the former special prosecutor of course, Ken Starr.  Whitewater  with the Clintons started as a bad land deal and ends up as a sexual  scandal involving the president, with many people caught up and convicted  on the way.  So, when the president says investigating my family finances  is a red line, what do we make of that?  </p><p>BREMMER:  Well I think that a lot of people on the Democratic side, believe  that the Starr investigation did get over-exuberant beyond its mandate.  It  was inappropriate, shouldn't have been done.  And that it became indeed a  witch hunt against Clinton.  And I do think that a lot of people on the  Republican side believe that the same thing is going to be true of the  Mueller investigation.  That you give these guys an inch -- we're a very  litigious society -- the investigators are going to find something.  I do  think there is reason for the Trump administration, for President Trump to  feel besieged as this investigation inevitably gets bigger and bigger.  But  that doesn't mean that he has any ability, any legal recourse to stop the  investigation from happening.  And if he were to fire Mueller, the  investigation is still going to proceed.  </p><p>QUEST:  Finally, look, viewers watching us tonight, -- of which there are  many, many delighted to have with us -- are wanting really to know one  simple thing.  This Russia issue, is it just going to rumble on for the  whole four years of the first administration?  Does it go anywhere?  Is  there a denouement?  Or are we just going to literally it's going to be  like watching the paint dry.</p><p>BREMMER:  The fact that the national security adviser was forced out in  record time as a consequence of lying about his Russian connections, is a  big deal.  And I do think that these investigations as they proceed and as  leaks inevitably come from them, you'll see people like Paul Manafort, who  ran the Trump campaign, maybe members of the Trump family are going to be  in trouble.  And that's can lead two big headlines.  So, I do think that  shoes will drop and consequences will be had.  </p><p>But I also think that the media does have a fundamental anti-Trump bias.   Certainly, in the United States.  And as a consequence, anything that  smells like Trump and Russia, whether it's a big deal or a small deal,  really blows up.  And I do think that some of the media coverage around  this story, but yes, I was the initial person breaking it.  Frankly, made  it out to be a bigger deal than the individual meeting actually was.  It  does matter that they're continuing to cover up all this stuff.  But I do  think that there is one-sidedness of it.  </p><p>QUEST:  Ian Bremmer, good to see you, sir.  </p><p>BREMMER:  You too, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Imagine taking a train from Manhattan to Washington, it takes three  hours at the moment.  You can fly and a drive to the airport, well that can  take two or three years.  Elon Musk believes he can cut the journey in the  corridor from D.C.  to New York, to half an hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:40:15] QUEST:  It's called the northeast corridor from Washington up to  Baltimore.  Philadelphia to New York.  A train journey that will take you  best part of three hours, even on Acela which is the high-speed train  service.  Now imagine you can do it in 29 minutes.  That is Elon Musk's  promise founder of Tesla, SpaceX and a company called the Boring Company.   He has just tweeted, received verbal government approval for the Boring  Company to build an underground New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore- Washington  hyperloop.  </p><p>Current journey, three hours, Musk says there could be up to a dozen entry  and exit elevators in each city.  Renee Marsh is CNN's regulation  correspondent.  She's at the other end of the line.  Now Renee, he says  he's got received verbal government approval.  What does that mean?  </p><p>RENEE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION CORRESPONDENT:  That is a great  question, Richard.  And at this point.  It's really unclear.  I can tell  you New York to D.C.  in 29 minutes it sounds great, and as you know, Elon  Musk talks about this for a long time.  His vision of this hyperloop.  This  mode of transportation comprised of the pods that travel through this  system of sealed tubes without any air resistance and can get you where you  need to go, but he talked about this verbal agreement that he received from  the government.  But he didn't quite say which entity of the U.S.  government gave him that verbal agreement.  </p><p>I can tell you, I spoke with the Department of Transportation.  They said  no comment.  Referred us to the White House.  We did reach out to the White  House, they didn't deny this.  But at the same time, they didn't confirm it  either.  Only saying that they had some good conversations with Mr. Musk  about, about advancing infrastructure.  So, it remains unclear what he's  exactly talking about.  </p><p>QUEST:  Listen to a guest we had on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS last week.  A week  before last this was Hyperloop 1, another project which you'll be familiar  with, which has already tested out west.  Listen to what the head of that  project said about the prospects for hyperloop.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERVIN PISHEVAR, CO-FOUNDER HYPERLOOP ONE:  We want to build this between  cities around the world.  We would love to have it, we're shooting for an  operational hyperloop somewhere in the world by 2021.  We have incredible  leadership from Rob Lloyd, our CEO as President of Cisco.  Brent  Kalinowski, treasurer of Google.  Launch this around the world.  We're in  government studies around the world and hope to be able to announce our  first projects in the future.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  So, Renee, everybody wants hyperloop.  But you know as well as I  do, they can't even build a high-speed train.  </p><p>MARSH:  That's right.  </p><p>QUEST:  They couldn't even spend the federal money that was available, they  were giving the money away and people still didn't want to spend it how  realistic is this hyperloop?  Or is it just hyper-hype?  </p><p>MARSH:  I think everyone gets excited about this prospect because it would  be quite an advancement.  But when you talk about a project like this,  first of all, one person can't just give you the sign-off.  You have to  have the state and local permits necessary to build this sort of  revolutionary transportation system.  And that in itself is very complex.   And it would take a long period of time.  To your point, they can't even  build high-speed rail, let alone hyperloop.  Which we've never seen  anything like that in our transportation system before.  So, the short  answer to your question is -- it's an extremely complicated process.  That  cannot certainly not happen overnight.  </p><p>QUEST:  It won't happen in my lifetime.  I'll put that money on it.  </p><p>MARSH:  Don't be so negative, Richard.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right.  Maybe I'll be old and decrepit and I'll actually get on  the hyperloop.  Good to see you, Rene.  Thank you.  </p><p>As we continue.  On QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we'll meet the man who says he  can slash the billions of dollars off the cost of Heathrow's third runway.   Although the penultimate installment of our series, India 2024.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:45:00] UPPMA VIRDI, FOUNDER CHAI WALLI (voiceover):  I am an  Indian/Australian and my aim is to bring the two cultures together and I  found that grounding through chai.  My name is Uppma Virdi, and I'm 27  years old and I run Chai Walla.  I my mission is to educate the world  through chai.  Chai was part of our daily ritual.  Warmth, family, unity.   Coming together for a common purpose.  Which is to bond over chai.  </p><p>Melbourne is definitely a coffee culture.  However, I was on a mission to  make all the cafes here make chai properly.  Because they weren't making it  how chai is meant to be made.  Every street corner India, every hundred or  two hundred meters you see or meet these people making chai.  My mission  and my purpose is to support small farmers and support small businesses in  India that probably don't sell to big tea companies.  There are many things  I have learned through my journey through Chai Walli.  But one thing that  always sticks with me is to listen to yourself.</p><p>(on camera) And that is the blend that my grandfather used to give me  growing up.</p><p>(voice-over) I feel that we all have the answers within us, we just need to  give ourselves the mental headspace to listen to those answers.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  So, we will never build a third runway at Heathrow Airport in  London.  Well, lawmakers from several British parties are forming a group  to question the case for this third runway.  And say there are unanswered  questions about noise levels and flight paths.  And yet at the same time  this is the plan, Heathrow East, Heathrow West with a new third runway that  goes at the top.  A hotel operator has come up with his own expansion  proposal.  </p><p>The founder of the royal group says his plan would save $8.6 billion and be  kinder to the environment and the neighbors.  You're going to see this is  the plan at the moment.  And this is what he's planning to do.  Basically,  he cuts off the last bit of the runway, to make it shorter.  But what that  means is, you don't have to do massive rescheduling work around the  motorways of the M-4 and the M-25, it would be cheaper, quicker and able to  be done in a lot less time.  </p><p>Surinder Arora is the founder and chairman of the Arora Group joins me from  London.  Sir, Willie Walsh of IAG likes your plan, a few others like your  plan.  But this has been looked at.  A gazillion times, including the idea  of a shorter runway to the north.  So why do you hope that you're going to  curry favor or find favor with this?  </p><p>SURINDER ARORA, FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN OF THE ARORA GROUP:  Richard, hi, I've  spent all my life around Heathrow for the last 45 years and I've worked,  and I've had businesses around the airport.  I used to do private flying  myself.  So, I love aviation.  And looking at the expansion plans at  Heathrow and especially last year after the Davies commission report was  produced, which recommended the expansion should happen at Heathrow, we've  been looking at it and being the largest land owner where the runway and  the new infrastructure is going to go, we looked at different schemes.  </p><p>[16:50:00] And our main scheme actually is the same as the Heathrow scheme,  with the runway over the M-25, within the red line that was put forward by  the government.  Except we're taking about 23 percent less land.  And go  ahead.  </p><p>QUEST:  One of the critics of your plan says that actually you will create  a greater noise level on the approach into Heathrow.  Therefore, yes, you  may gain on the round-about, but you'll lose on the swings.  There will be  more noise from arriving aircraft.  </p><p>ARORA:  If I may clarify, the main scheme, there was a red line put round  the expansion plan, round Heathrow.  The existing runway is actually, we've  gone with the 3,500-meter runway.  The scheme you are looking at on the  left, same as Heathrow.  We went with that except how we've managed to come  up with the savings of over $5.6 billion, the initial savings was by having  better layout, rather than having a satellite terminal connected by  underground train, working with the airlines and I feel that's one of the  things that Heathrow in my view have never done is actually sitting down  and discussing with their partners, customers.  </p><p>QUEST:  Isn't the reality of this, they've come up with 1,001 different  plans.  Those like Zach Goldsmith.  Those like Boris Johnson who are  implacably opposed to any form of expansion of Heathrow.  It doesn't matter  what you come up with.  It's not going to happen.  </p><p>ARORA:  No, no, no.  Look I when I came to England in '72, Heathrow was the  number one international airport in the world.  We have been falling  behind, compared to our European partners, compared to Dubai.  Compared to  Paris, other places.  Unless we do something about it, it is not just about  having more flights in and out of Heathrow, it is actually what is right  for the nation.  We just had the recent elections and the government is  still committed.  If you ask everyone round the world, where do people want  to fly in and out of Heathrow -- </p><p>QUEST:  The government doesn't have the support and the wherewithal to get  particularly post-election.  So, my final thought to you, sir, is do you  think we will see a third runway at Heathrow in your or my lifetime?  </p><p>ARORA:  I most definitely believe so.  I think we need it, I believe it  will happen, and I remember saying about 15 years ago, that the U.K. in the  southeast where we haven't built another runway since the mid '40s that  would need expansion and will need expansion of Heathrow, Gatwick and  Stanton over the next three or four decades, but Heathrow is where we need  the expansion desperately.  The Davies commission report recommended.  I  believe it will happen.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, we appreciate you coming in to talk about it  tonight, very important, thank you.</p><p>Business to bring to you, Microsoft shares at a new high in after-hours  reported strong earnings, Satya Nadella it has been driven by the cloud  platforms, we are familiar with that.  But look at the price up two  percent, shares at $75.4.  Share have gained 20 percent so far, this year  on Wall Street.  On Wall Street, shopping is the best way to describe, the  Dow was down, so no records, as indeed was the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ does  come in at a record.  But I think you've got to look at it the way in which  the market traded today, there was a lot of sort of just downright  choppiness.  </p><p>That forced it.  But at the same time, there is a strong view that there's  an underlying momentum higher which we saw with the S&amp;P 500 getting its  multi-record days.  And that is a breakout as they say in the chart view.   European stocks ended the day highly unchanged, mixed with FTSE eking out  the best of the day.  Not quite sure why, the euro jumped against the  dollar, ECB left rates unchanged.  But Mario Draghi at the ECB did say that  the ECB was, was committed to continuing their QE program at 60 billion to  70 billion euros, until at least December 2017.  If you want to follow the  podcast.  </p><p>[16:55:00] It is all at the usual iTunes, CNN/podcast.  We will have a  Profitable Moment after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's Profitable Moment, it was 1886 that Sears Roebuck opened  its first store and over the next century became a bastion of American  retailing.  Particularly in the Midwest.  Everybody seemed to go to Sears  and you bought houses, cars, automobiles.  Bits and bobs for the house.   Sears, if you take a look at how that progressed, has been the hallmark of  American retailing.  And unfortunately, hard times have fallen on the  company of.  They've shut many, many stores and yet today, they came up  with an announcement that they were going to sell their Kenmore appliances  through Amazon and the stock rallied some 20 percent.  </p><p>What does it tell us?  It tells us very little about Sears.  Because Sears  is probably yesterday's retailer.  It tells us something about the  necessity to sell Kenmore on Amazon.  But what it really tells us, is about  Amazon itself.  This behemoth retailer of the 21st century.  Think about  it, in this week alone we've seen two examples, Sears sells on Amazon.  And  the price goes up 20 percent.  Blue Apron gets threatened by Amazon in the  meal kit industry, and their share price collapses.  </p><p>This is not about Sears or Blue Apron.  This is about Amazon.  And the  power of the $1,000 stock that is now ruling the retail world.  That's  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in New York, whatever  you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.  We will do it  again tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

No records for the Dow. The S&amp;P has a record. They've made a right cobbler of what was supposed to happen there between bells and gavels. Anarchy seems to have broken out. But it was a strong gavel. Let me just count. No record for the Dow. S&amp;P and NASDAQ at record highs. The day is over. It's Thursday It's July the 20th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, Britain and the EU, the clash over the latest Brexit negotiations. Also, the U.S. and Europol are shining light on the dark web. Europol's director will be live on this program tonight. And the most famous prisoner in America is to be freed soon. O.J. Simpson has been granted parole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital, New York City, where I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. O.J. Simpson has been granted parole. The football star turned object of cultural sensation and then convicted, was serving a nine to 33-year sentence for kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Having served the minimum, nine years in prison, he's now been told he will soon be released on parole.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Simpson, I do vote to grant parole when eligible, and that will conclude this hearing.</p><p>O.J. SIMPSON, IMPRISONED IN 2008 FOR KIDNAPPING, ARMED ROBBERY: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Simpson apologized. He told the parole board he was a model prisoner and he promised that he would have no conflicts if released.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMPSON: I've done my time. You know I've done it as well and as respectfully as I think anybody can. I think if you talk to the wardens and them, they'll tell you I gave them my word, I believe in the jury system. I've honored their verdict. I've not complained for nine years, all I've done is try to be helpful, and encourage the guys around there, hey, man, do your time. Fight in court. And don't do anything that's going to extend your time. And that's the life I've tried to live because I want to get back to my kids and my family.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: There the picture is of the parole board. Paul Vercammen is in Lovelock, Nevada. This really turns on a question of had he served enough time. Because all the other pieces of the jigsaw, no conflicts, no -- he had behaved in prison. There was no reason not to grant him parole if the feeling was he had served enough time.</p><p>PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's correct. Richard. It's also very much a thing here in Nevada. That they rely on what's called the risk assessment profile. O.J. Simpson is now 70 years old. He had not caused any problems in this prison behind me, Lovelock is what it's called. It's in the high desert. He had no run-ins. He was the commissioner of the softball league. He said that he was a guy that other inmates could go to if they had problems.</p><p>So, all defense attorneys in Nevada will tell you they follow this grid, these risk assessment guidelines and he just scored as a low risk. And another huge twist, as can only happen in the case of O.J. Simpson where there's always drama. So often we cover parole hearings and victims or victim come up and they are teary-eyed, they are fearful and they are scared. And they say to that parole commission, please do not let this inmate out, I am in fear for my life. Instead, Bruce Fromong, the only surviving victim of that armed robbery comes in here and says, basically, free Simpson. He should be out of here. Fromong had told us repeatedly he thought Simpson did too much time for the crime. Richard?</p><p>QUEST: So, when realistically does the nine years minimum, when does that deadline hit? And how quickly will he be released? It's not going to happen tonight.</p><p>VERCAMMEN: No, it is not. And here's what's going to happen. We're in northern Nevada. At this place where it's -- amazingly hot today, what's going to happen. He's going to be here for a while. October 1st is his release date. And from best we can tell, there could be a hiccup. Because there's got to be very specific rules on what he does after prison. He's going to go to another prison in the Las Vegas area or southern Nevada. He'll be there for a couple of weeks and then he'll be released.</p><p>[16:05:00] He has said repeatedly, we heard this in the hearing, he's going to go to Florida. That's where his children live, that's where his good friend Tom Scotto lives. I've talked to Scotto many times over the phone he says he thinks Simpson will be able to be in a way protected there. Maybe not be under the scrutiny that he would let's say in Los Angeles. That's where we think he is headed with a very, very strict set of rules imposed upon him by the patrol commission.</p><p>QUEST: Let's finish on that point, Paul. Because this is parole. This is not acquittal. This is not a vacating of the conviction. This is parole. And under the rules of parole, if you reoffend, or you break the terms, you go back.</p><p>VERCAMMEN: Exactly. And they made it a point. Richard to underscore that. One of the commissioners staring him down and saying, if you reoffend, you will be right back in Lovelock. One thing we should note, O.J. Simpson in this assessment was found to have had a problem by the commissioners, with alcohol. So, he's got to keep himself clean, from drugs, alcohol, we're not saying that he took drugs. We also know that he's been told you can't consort with certain people. Whether they are ex- cons or whatever the case may be. They have not given us yet this list of conditions, but we imagine it's going to be extensive. It's going to be detailed. And the warning is O.J., you better watch your step even if you do go to Florida.</p><p>QUEST: Paul, good to hear you, thank you for putting it into perspective. Paul Vercammen out of Lovelock in Nevada.</p><p>So, to our business agenda tonight. Round two of the Brexit negotiations will come to an end. And Europe says it's time for Britain to get its act together. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he must have more details about the U.K.'s position. And what it's hoping to get. Leading the talks from the British side, David Davies described the talks as robust but constructive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHEL BARNIER, CHIEF BREXIT NEGOTIATOR, EUROPEAN COMMISSION (through translator): A clarification of the U.K. position, is indispensable for us to negotiate and for us to make sufficient progress on this financial dossier, which is inseparable from the other withdrawal dossiers.</p><p>DAVID DAVIS, BRITISH SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EXITING THE EU: We've had robust, but constructive talks this week. Clearly there's a lot left to talk about and further work before we can resolve this. Ultimately getting to a solution will require flexibility from both sides. But as Michel said, we shouldn't expect incremental progress in every round.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So, every round. This was round two of the negotiations. Thank you. The two sides have agreed to meet every month before March 2019, which marks the two-year Article 50 deadline from UK's notification to quit. So, on round two, seconds away, let's look at the issue that they dealt with so far. And so far, the U.K. isn't managing to dodge too many blows as the negotiations are under way.</p><p>First of all, the Brexit costs, the amount the U.K. must pay. The EU has got it somewhere at $115 billion. But Barnier says he needs vital details from Britain. Of course, your aware, some in Britain believe that there shouldn't be a Brexit bill. But the general acceptance is there will be a bill to pay. What they're arguing about is just how much.</p><p>And then you have the very serious question of citizens' rights. The acquired rights of EU nationals in the U.K. and U.K. nationals elsewhere. Citizens' rights, Barnier says, it's a fundamental divergence of the opinion.</p><p>Then finally, the EU says progress must be made on these issues, before they start talking about a new trade deal. At the same time business remains worried. The British Chamber of Commerce is calling for a more sustained and some structured discussion on Brexit and Citigroup confirms it may move business operations two Frankfurt. And on last night's program you had the Small Business Federation saying that they want greater clarity as well.</p><p>This is a negotiation that could go right down to the line. Mike Gapes is the Labour MP, he joins me from London. We're watching these negotiations, there's a very tight timeline, but as the minister, as David Davis says, there won't be progress or incremental improvement in every round, will there?</p><p>MIKE GAPES, BRITISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOUR PARTY: Well, actually the timeline is probably such that they won't be a comprehensive agreement in time for March of 2019. And they're going to have to work out transitional arrangements, which could last several years what the government calls interim arrangements.</p><p>[16:10:00] But the fact is that the intricate details of 43 years of integration of the U.K. economy, and regulations through the environment and there's other things, are so complicated, it can't all be sorted out in the short time.</p><p>QUEST: What do you think the Brexit bill should be? How long is a piece of string? I realize you know, what's the number, what do you think the number is.</p><p>GAPES: I can't give you an answer to that. But the U.K. has entered into obligations for example, the costs of pensions for former employees of the European Union, the cost of infrastructure projects, which are partly completed or planned. There's a whole range of things which would require a legal commitment and a requirement that we do meet our obligations.</p><p>QUEST: The hope is to settle the acquired rights, the Brexit bill and potentially the Northern Ireland issue by October, when there will be the potential to discuss the wider issues. Do you think that is realistic?</p><p>GAPES: I think that's very optimistic. I also think that we as members of Parliament, we are in the dark. The government is not telling us what its position is. It's not just Michel Barnier who saying the government needs to give more detail. Members of the House of Commons -- where of course, Theresa May no longer has an overall majority -- are in the dark as well. We are waiting to begin the legislative process in September for a repeal bill to withdraw. But we don't yet know what the British government's plan is. What it actually wants. And I'm not sure they know.</p><p>QUEST: You would expect that the British government can't sort of negotiate and at the same time, have an entire Parliament watching over its back at every stage of the way. Parliament is going to have its vote once the process is over.</p><p>GAPES: Well the danger is that Theresa May still believes that somehow no deal is better than a bad deal. That position was killed in our general election in June. There is now going to be a position where Parliament is going to assert itself. Whether it does so this year or whether it does so next year. But there will be the necessity of having a broad consensus within the House of Commons and also the House of Lords. In order to ensure that we are satisfied with the terms of these negotiations.</p><p>QUEST: Do you still believe that Brexit will happen? Or as I believe you are of the opinion, that some shape or form will be found to keep the U.K. within.</p><p>GAPES: I'm of the view that we need to mitigate the damage that any leaving of the EU will put us into a dangerous position if we also leave the single market and the customs union. It will be disastrous for our economy. There are many of us -- it's not just in my party -- there are many people across the House of Commons and in the House of Lords, that want to have the closest possible ongoing relationship with the European Union even if we have voted to leave. And that means, as far as we can, staying in the European economic area, the single market and that is necessary for inward investment and prosperity of our people. People didn't vote to become poorer in the referendum.</p><p>QUEST: But would you say membership of EEA, in other words that the, you have to eat Europe's rules, without having a seat at the table. The Norway option, you're familiar with it. Would you say that is preferable to being outside the single market.</p><p>GAPES: No, no, no. It's actually, the choice staying in the single market is fundamental, is preferable. The best option, is to actually be involved in the decision-making. The best solution would be not to leave the European Union. If the British people have voted for that. Then we've got to try to get the next best. Which is the mitigate the damage.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir, thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p>GAPES: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Now Wall Street where trading continues. The S&amp;P -- now look at the markets. We don't -- we have a fall of the Dow. We have a fall of the S&amp;P and there are record highs. It was dragged down, by the way, by the way, by Home Depot. But the NASDAQ did eke out a very small gain. Just five points or so. And that's the tenth straight session of gains. And therefore, the NASDAQ is at a record.</p><p>But as you can see, the numbers we're talking about today are very small. Which reinforces the general view at the moment, that the upward pressure remains even though there is one or two.</p><p>[16:15:00] This is, by the way, the longest streak in more than two years. If you take Donald Trump's inauguration, you can see just the way -- you've got the NASDAQ, which has been on the biggest tear of all. The Dow industrials and the Dow and the broader market of the S&amp;P are pretty much mirroring each other which is fascinating, with one or two minor hiccups. The NASDAQ is up 15 percent. The Dow and the S&amp;P is up 9 percent. All of which prompts me to want to know from Rana Foroohar is with me, CNN's global economist analyst and a columnist for the \"Financial Times.\"</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: Hello, my friend.</p><p>QUEST: Now look at those numbers, is everything as bad as everybody says? And is there as much chaos and confusion out of the Trump administration and there's as much worry about the economic agenda. What's going on?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I think the most important line is the red line. I think the only game in town right now is tech. And I think that what's really interesting is in part because there's been so much chaos in Washington. The fact you're probably not going to see tax reform. You're not going to see health care reform. A lot of things that business wanted to see, people are saying where can I find growth. Where is that sure thing? The tech sector is where that's at.</p><p>QUEST: And the reason the tech sector is because we've all got smartphones and we've all moving into more of these. And we've got AI coming down the road. It's not rocket science that tech is going to be the cornerstone and the concrete of the next century.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well right, and I like the word concrete. Because in some ways, I think we're moving to a deeper period of how tech is going to disrupt everything. We already have our phones, right? We've had the consumer revolution. Now we're moving into tech making its way into industrial, disrupting the entire S&amp;P.</p><p>QUEST: So, when you see Amazon, today with the deal with Sears, Sears goes up 20 percent. Just because it's selling its Kenmore appliances with Alexa capabilities.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes, that's right.</p><p>QUEST: I mean, it got 10 percent.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Anything that's been touched by Amazon, Google or Facebook is gold. I think what's really interesting is I would count on fang companies, the big tech companies to keep their valuations. Everything else I'm not so sure about. Because we are really in frothy areas for a lot of companies. Not the biggest ones.</p><p>QUEST: Of course, the fangs will keep their value or will keep --</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes, because they are going to eat everything else.</p><p>QUEST: They're the ones we're all using.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Right, absolutely. And they have all of our data. They're monetizing even --</p><p>QUEST: It's cause and effect, Rana. It's a truism. If we're all using Facebook and Netflix and brawl using Amazon, they're the ones that are going to rise. It's the new ones like Blue Apron who may or may not.</p><p>FOROOHAR: True enough. But all of this is predicated on the fact that the regulatory environment remains as it is, which is very light touch. We'll see what comes down from the EU and we'll see what happens in Washington. In some ways if you look at politically, the 2018 and 2020, making a boogie man out of big tech is a political possibility.</p><p>QUEST: By the way, I've been asking people this question. By the way Rana, when did you last buy something at Sears?</p><p>FOROOHAR: Oh, my gosh. Not since I was growing up in rural Indiana, I don't think. Sorry in all seriousness. What can I say. I bought something this morning on Amazon.</p><p>QUEST: That's my point.</p><p>Thank you. We've been asking all sorts of people that question, when they bought something at Sears. I'll talk about it in Profitable Moment at the end of the program.</p><p>As we continue our QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Tonight, a victory in the battle against the dark web. U.S. authorities say they've taken down an illegal marketplace selling guns and drugs. We have the details after the break.</p><p>[16:20:54] QUEST: More now on today's breaking news. O.J. Simpson has been granted parole. Jeffrey Toobin is with me. Were you surprised?</p><p>JEFFERY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Not really. He has served a long time. He's already 70 years old. There are not many 70-year-olds in prison in the United States. And the state of Nevada has standards for when people are granted parole. And to all appearances, he met them and the decision seemed reasonable to me.</p><p>QUEST: To the court of public opinion, from which he may have been convicted for murder in an earlier case. And those who say you should never have been let loose again, your answer is what?</p><p>TOOBIN: Well, that I agree. That he did get away with murder. I wrote a book, I studied that trial very carefully. I think the jury -- I disagreed with the jury decision in that case as many Americans did. But this was a separate case and in fact, I think he was punished unduly harshly in this Nevada case, which was a crazy robbery, kidnapping in a, in a seedy Las Vegas hotel. That I think was payback for the murder.</p><p>QUEST: How strict from your experience are parole officers in terms of enforcing a parolee?</p><p>TOOBIN: It vary as lot. They tend to be pretty strict. There are not -- there are people you are not supposed to associate with. He is in a somewhat unusual situation because he is going to try to do his parole in a different state. In Florida where he's lived before he was arrested again. His life will be somewhat circumscribed. But it will be a hell of a lot better than being in prison.</p><p>QUEST: I need to turn to Donald Trump. And I need to ask you, Donald Trump said that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, should not investigate the finances would be crossing the red line. He doesn't really get much say in the matter.</p><p>TOOBIN: No, he doesn't. Unless he decides to take the political risk of ordering Mueller's firing. It is true --</p><p>QUEST: That would be nuclear.</p><p>TOOBIN: We're talking about Donald Trump here. If you had said to me, is he going to fire the FBI director? I'd say, of course not, no one would do such a thing when the FBI director was investigating him. I would not at all put it past the president to fire Robert Mueller, if he feels like he is getting too close to Trump or doing something that's outside his jurisdiction. Donald Trump is operating by his own rules.</p><p>QUEST: Is Jeff Sessions well and truly damaged goods as Attorney General of the United States?</p><p>TOOBIN: It's a very peculiar situation. This was a really scathing attack. But it didn't really take away any of Sessions' authority as attorney general. It was embarrassing for Sessions. But I thought Sessions' response today was pretty much the only one he could make. I'm the attorney general. I'm going to continue fighting crime. I'm proud of the work that we're doing. It is part of the continuing weirdness of the Trump administration. But I don't think it fundamentally changes Jeff Sessions' authority.</p><p>QUEST: It is a strange world, Jeff Toobin.</p><p>TOOBIN: Mr. Quest, I could not agree more.</p><p>QUEST: When we start with O.J. Simpson and we end up with the attorney general being criticized by his boss, the president of the United States.</p><p>TOOBIN: Sir, as always.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>Jeffrey was talking about Jeff Sessions doing his job. While the Department of Justice says it's taken down a massive illegal online marketplace. Is called AlphaBay. And it's operating on the dark web. One of the internet's inaccessible to the normal browsers. The sort that you and I might use on the web. This sort of place is where drugs, guns and stolen documents, fake goods have been sold according to the Department of Justice. Rob Wainwright is the director of Europol and to the DOJ announcement in Washington.</p><p>[16:25:00] So, what is it that you took down? And how difficult was it to take it down?</p><p>ROB WAINWRIGHT, DIRECTOR, EUROPOL: Well, it's even better than you said, Richard. Because we took down in a coordinated action in Europe and the United States two of the three largest criminal marketplaces that are operating in the dark net. And between them they were trading in over 350,000 different listings of drugs and other illicit commodities. So actually, we've punctured a pretty big hole in the infrastructure of a multimillion dollar digital underground criminal economy. And I think it's a very good day for law enforcement. And a worrying day for those that are engaged in criminal activity online.</p><p>QUEST: I don't want to rain on a good day for law enforcement. However, you'll be familiar -- look, if you just squeeze it, it's like a balloon. Squeeze one bit and it will pop out somewhere else. What measures are you taking that will prevent somebody else or another entity from opening up to take advantage of a marketplace clearly exists on the dark web?</p><p>WAINWRIGHT: We are in a race against the criminals. They will innovate again. They will reform, but they will do so with a high degree of risk right now. Because the really clever part of this operation, if I say so myself, is the way we coordinated. We took covert control of very large market in Europe. Left it running. Therefore, being able to identify the criminal activities of the users involved. While then shutting down AlphaBay here in America and watching while all of those criminal users flocked to this other marketplace instead.</p><p>So, we were able to capture eight times as much intelligence about the uses in doing this coordinated hit. And you know, the criminals, Richard, there are not going to know what else we're doing already out there. What we're going to be doing tomorrow, next month and so on. And we're already seen reaction in the criminal underworld, which is saying to their people, don't go on any marketplaces right now. It's a dangerous place now.</p><p>QUEST: Do you have the resources and the expertise necessary -- now look, I've never met a policeman who didn't say he wanted more resources. But you know what I'm asking you here. Are you state of the art or are the criminals ahead of you?</p><p>WAINWRIGHT: I don't want any more resources, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: You don't believe that any more than I do.</p><p>WAINWRIGHT: Listen, we worked with an internet company firm in this case that gave us a great additional lead-in to one of these cases. But this is really a story about coordinated law enforcement action across different countries. Fantastic coming together of Europol, FBI, DEA, Dutch police. And when we combined the technical operation resources of our community, you know, we can really do some damage against criminality on the internet. So, I think it's a big deal.</p><p>QUEST: Rob, director, thank you very much. Lovely to have you. Always grateful to have you on the program Appreciate it.</p><p>QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, tonight. the president of the United States has a warning for the special counsel I was talking about it with Jeffrey Toobin. The counsel is investigating the Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Now he's saying, stay out of my business. Or at least my family's finances. We'll discuss that, after the break. It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:30:28] Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There is more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. And in a moment, we'll be talking a millionaire who has a plan to expand Heathrow Airport and believes it will save billions over the existing plan for the expansion.</p><p>Elon Musk says he has government approval to build a hyperloop between Washington and New York. The trip would take half an hour. While before that this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first.</p><p>The former American football star O.J. Simpson has been granted parole after serving nine years in prison for kidnapping and armed robbery. His fall from grace has fascinated people since his murder trial and acquittal in the 1990s. Simpson could be freed as soon as October.</p><p>The U.S. Attorney General says he plans to keep doing his job. Even though president Donald Trump told \"The New York Times\" he would have hired someone else, had he known that Jeff Sessions would recuse himself from the Russian investigations. The Attorney General Sessions did so, when it became public he didn't disclose meetings with the Russian ambassador.</p><p>Another leading voice of rock music has gone silent. California authorities found Chester Bennington, the front man for the band, Linkin Park, dead of possible suicide at his home in Los Angeles on Thursday. He's survived by his wife and six children. It comes only months after Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, a close friend of Bennington's, committed suicide.</p><p>President Trump's issued a stark warning to the special counsel Robert Mueller. Investigating the Trump family finances beyond any Russian connections, would in his words cross a red line. In \"the New York times\" and the president said, the special counsel's investigation was compromised by a variety of conflicts of interest.</p><p>Now the president's son and son-in-law, and along with the former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, they were scheduled to testify before the Senate Judicial Committee next week. Jared Kushner is expected to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday.</p><p>Joining me now, Ian Bremmer, who broke the news of president Trump's undisclosed meeting with President Putin at the G-20. Ian is the president of the Eurasia Group. Before we get all this other stuff, Ian, just tell me -- first of all, congratulations on the story. But when they had this meeting, which went on for the best part of an hour, were they just sitting at the side of the dining room table with the other G-20 or 18 leaders, just looking, wondering what on earth are they talking about?</p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP: Yes, not immediately, right. Because it's not that unusual to have step asides and this is meant to be the opportunity for the leaders to get to know each other better. But when it's going on for half an hour, 45, and then you know basically an hour, that's when the other leaders in the room are saying -- it's very clear that you know, with despite the fact that a number of Trump's American's allies are in the room. That by far the relationship that he feels the most comfortable with personally is a country they consider to be an adversary.</p><p>It's also the one country that if you look both at the campaign as well as Trump as president, it's the one country, the one leader that Trump has consistently taken every opportunity to never criticize. I mean he'll criticize the Japanese on trade. The Germans for trade, not doing enough on paying for security, the Chinese on currency, you name it, they're going to take a hit from Trump at some point except Putin. And so, I think people just you know can't add it all up. This is yet one more indication of that.</p><p>QUEST: We don't know what they talked about. We know that the president said it was you know, the pleasantries a bit and they talked about adoption. And the Russian rules, law concerning that. Do you buy that?</p><p>BREMMER: Adoption is sort of Russian code word for sanctions which are linked to the adoption issue under this Magnitsky case. And that's something that the Russians, of course, are very interested in ensuring is removed from them and their economy. Putin talks about it a lot. So yes, that's not pleasantries. Adoption is a significant issue. Trump Jr., of course, also said during his meeting that ended up being about getting information on Clinton, that that was also about adoption that turns out adoption is a very popular issue to discuss among pleasantries with Russians.</p><p>[16:35:06] QUEST: Robert Mueller can investigate what he likes. We know that from the former special prosecutor of course, Ken Starr. Whitewater with the Clintons started as a bad land deal and ends up as a sexual scandal involving the president, with many people caught up and convicted on the way. So, when the president says investigating my family finances is a red line, what do we make of that?</p><p>BREMMER: Well I think that a lot of people on the Democratic side, believe that the Starr investigation did get over-exuberant beyond its mandate. It was inappropriate, shouldn't have been done. And that it became indeed a witch hunt against Clinton. And I do think that a lot of people on the Republican side believe that the same thing is going to be true of the Mueller investigation. That you give these guys an inch -- we're a very litigious society -- the investigators are going to find something. I do think there is reason for the Trump administration, for President Trump to feel besieged as this investigation inevitably gets bigger and bigger. But that doesn't mean that he has any ability, any legal recourse to stop the investigation from happening. And if he were to fire Mueller, the investigation is still going to proceed.</p><p>QUEST: Finally, look, viewers watching us tonight, -- of which there are many, many delighted to have with us -- are wanting really to know one simple thing. This Russia issue, is it just going to rumble on for the whole four years of the first administration? Does it go anywhere? Is there a denouement? Or are we just going to literally it's going to be like watching the paint dry.</p><p>BREMMER: The fact that the national security adviser was forced out in record time as a consequence of lying about his Russian connections, is a big deal. And I do think that these investigations as they proceed and as leaks inevitably come from them, you'll see people like Paul Manafort, who ran the Trump campaign, maybe members of the Trump family are going to be in trouble. And that's can lead two big headlines. So, I do think that shoes will drop and consequences will be had.</p><p>But I also think that the media does have a fundamental anti-Trump bias. Certainly, in the United States. And as a consequence, anything that smells like Trump and Russia, whether it's a big deal or a small deal, really blows up. And I do think that some of the media coverage around this story, but yes, I was the initial person breaking it. Frankly, made it out to be a bigger deal than the individual meeting actually was. It does matter that they're continuing to cover up all this stuff. But I do think that there is one-sidedness of it.</p><p>QUEST: Ian Bremmer, good to see you, sir.</p><p>BREMMER: You too, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Imagine taking a train from Manhattan to Washington, it takes three hours at the moment. You can fly and a drive to the airport, well that can take two or three years. Elon Musk believes he can cut the journey in the corridor from D.C. to New York, to half an hour.</p><p>[16:40:15] QUEST: It's called the northeast corridor from Washington up to Baltimore. Philadelphia to New York. A train journey that will take you best part of three hours, even on Acela which is the high-speed train service. Now imagine you can do it in 29 minutes. That is Elon Musk's promise founder of Tesla, SpaceX and a company called the Boring Company. He has just tweeted, received verbal government approval for the Boring Company to build an underground New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore- Washington hyperloop.</p><p>Current journey, three hours, Musk says there could be up to a dozen entry and exit elevators in each city. Renee Marsh is CNN's regulation correspondent. She's at the other end of the line. Now Renee, he says he's got received verbal government approval. What does that mean?</p><p>RENEE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATION CORRESPONDENT: That is a great question, Richard. And at this point. It's really unclear. I can tell you New York to D.C. in 29 minutes it sounds great, and as you know, Elon Musk talks about this for a long time. His vision of this hyperloop. This mode of transportation comprised of the pods that travel through this system of sealed tubes without any air resistance and can get you where you need to go, but he talked about this verbal agreement that he received from the government. But he didn't quite say which entity of the U.S. government gave him that verbal agreement.</p><p>I can tell you, I spoke with the Department of Transportation. They said no comment. Referred us to the White House. We did reach out to the White House, they didn't deny this. But at the same time, they didn't confirm it either. Only saying that they had some good conversations with Mr. Musk about, about advancing infrastructure. So, it remains unclear what he's exactly talking about.</p><p>QUEST: Listen to a guest we had on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS last week. A week before last this was Hyperloop 1, another project which you'll be familiar with, which has already tested out west. Listen to what the head of that project said about the prospects for hyperloop.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERVIN PISHEVAR, CO-FOUNDER HYPERLOOP ONE: We want to build this between cities around the world. We would love to have it, we're shooting for an operational hyperloop somewhere in the world by 2021. We have incredible leadership from Rob Lloyd, our CEO as President of Cisco. Brent Kalinowski, treasurer of Google. Launch this around the world. We're in government studies around the world and hope to be able to announce our first projects in the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So, Renee, everybody wants hyperloop. But you know as well as I do, they can't even build a high-speed train.</p><p>MARSH: That's right.</p><p>QUEST: They couldn't even spend the federal money that was available, they were giving the money away and people still didn't want to spend it how realistic is this hyperloop? Or is it just hyper-hype?</p><p>MARSH: I think everyone gets excited about this prospect because it would be quite an advancement. But when you talk about a project like this, first of all, one person can't just give you the sign-off. You have to have the state and local permits necessary to build this sort of revolutionary transportation system. And that in itself is very complex. And it would take a long period of time. To your point, they can't even build high-speed rail, let alone hyperloop. Which we've never seen anything like that in our transportation system before. So, the short answer to your question is -- it's an extremely complicated process. That cannot certainly not happen overnight.</p><p>QUEST: It won't happen in my lifetime. I'll put that money on it.</p><p>MARSH: Don't be so negative, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Maybe I'll be old and decrepit and I'll actually get on the hyperloop. Good to see you, Rene. Thank you.</p><p>As we continue. On QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we'll meet the man who says he can slash the billions of dollars off the cost of Heathrow's third runway. Although the penultimate installment of our series, India 2024.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:45:00] UPPMA VIRDI, FOUNDER CHAI WALLI (voiceover): I am an Indian/Australian and my aim is to bring the two cultures together and I found that grounding through chai. My name is Uppma Virdi, and I'm 27 years old and I run Chai Walla. I my mission is to educate the world through chai. Chai was part of our daily ritual. Warmth, family, unity. Coming together for a common purpose. Which is to bond over chai.</p><p>Melbourne is definitely a coffee culture. However, I was on a mission to make all the cafes here make chai properly. Because they weren't making it how chai is meant to be made. Every street corner India, every hundred or two hundred meters you see or meet these people making chai. My mission and my purpose is to support small farmers and support small businesses in India that probably don't sell to big tea companies. There are many things I have learned through my journey through Chai Walli. But one thing that always sticks with me is to listen to yourself.</p><p>(on camera) And that is the blend that my grandfather used to give me growing up.</p><p>(voice-over) I feel that we all have the answers within us, we just need to give ourselves the mental headspace to listen to those answers.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: So, we will never build a third runway at Heathrow Airport in London. Well, lawmakers from several British parties are forming a group to question the case for this third runway. And say there are unanswered questions about noise levels and flight paths. And yet at the same time this is the plan, Heathrow East, Heathrow West with a new third runway that goes at the top. A hotel operator has come up with his own expansion proposal.</p><p>The founder of the royal group says his plan would save $8.6 billion and be kinder to the environment and the neighbors. You're going to see this is the plan at the moment. And this is what he's planning to do. Basically, he cuts off the last bit of the runway, to make it shorter. But what that means is, you don't have to do massive rescheduling work around the motorways of the M-4 and the M-25, it would be cheaper, quicker and able to be done in a lot less time.</p><p>Surinder Arora is the founder and chairman of the Arora Group joins me from London. Sir, Willie Walsh of IAG likes your plan, a few others like your plan. But this has been looked at. A gazillion times, including the idea of a shorter runway to the north. So why do you hope that you're going to curry favor or find favor with this?</p><p>SURINDER ARORA, FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN OF THE ARORA GROUP: Richard, hi, I've spent all my life around Heathrow for the last 45 years and I've worked, and I've had businesses around the airport. I used to do private flying myself. So, I love aviation. And looking at the expansion plans at Heathrow and especially last year after the Davies commission report was produced, which recommended the expansion should happen at Heathrow, we've been looking at it and being the largest land owner where the runway and the new infrastructure is going to go, we looked at different schemes.</p><p>[16:50:00] And our main scheme actually is the same as the Heathrow scheme, with the runway over the M-25, within the red line that was put forward by the government. Except we're taking about 23 percent less land. And go ahead.</p><p>QUEST: One of the critics of your plan says that actually you will create a greater noise level on the approach into Heathrow. Therefore, yes, you may gain on the round-about, but you'll lose on the swings. There will be more noise from arriving aircraft.</p><p>ARORA: If I may clarify, the main scheme, there was a red line put round the expansion plan, round Heathrow. The existing runway is actually, we've gone with the 3,500-meter runway. The scheme you are looking at on the left, same as Heathrow. We went with that except how we've managed to come up with the savings of over $5.6 billion, the initial savings was by having better layout, rather than having a satellite terminal connected by underground train, working with the airlines and I feel that's one of the things that Heathrow in my view have never done is actually sitting down and discussing with their partners, customers.</p><p>QUEST: Isn't the reality of this, they've come up with 1,001 different plans. Those like Zach Goldsmith. Those like Boris Johnson who are implacably opposed to any form of expansion of Heathrow. It doesn't matter what you come up with. It's not going to happen.</p><p>ARORA: No, no, no. Look I when I came to England in '72, Heathrow was the number one international airport in the world. We have been falling behind, compared to our European partners, compared to Dubai. Compared to Paris, other places. Unless we do something about it, it is not just about having more flights in and out of Heathrow, it is actually what is right for the nation. We just had the recent elections and the government is still committed. If you ask everyone round the world, where do people want to fly in and out of Heathrow --</p><p>QUEST: The government doesn't have the support and the wherewithal to get particularly post-election. So, my final thought to you, sir, is do you think we will see a third runway at Heathrow in your or my lifetime?</p><p>ARORA: I most definitely believe so. I think we need it, I believe it will happen, and I remember saying about 15 years ago, that the U.K. in the southeast where we haven't built another runway since the mid '40s that would need expansion and will need expansion of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stanton over the next three or four decades, but Heathrow is where we need the expansion desperately. The Davies commission report recommended. I believe it will happen.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir, we appreciate you coming in to talk about it tonight, very important, thank you.</p><p>Business to bring to you, Microsoft shares at a new high in after-hours reported strong earnings, Satya Nadella it has been driven by the cloud platforms, we are familiar with that. But look at the price up two percent, shares at $75.4. Share have gained 20 percent so far, this year on Wall Street. On Wall Street, shopping is the best way to describe, the Dow was down, so no records, as indeed was the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ does come in at a record. But I think you've got to look at it the way in which the market traded today, there was a lot of sort of just downright choppiness.</p><p>That forced it. But at the same time, there is a strong view that there's an underlying momentum higher which we saw with the S&amp;P 500 getting its multi-record days. And that is a breakout as they say in the chart view. European stocks ended the day highly unchanged, mixed with FTSE eking out the best of the day. Not quite sure why, the euro jumped against the dollar, ECB left rates unchanged. But Mario Draghi at the ECB did say that the ECB was, was committed to continuing their QE program at 60 billion to 70 billion euros, until at least December 2017. If you want to follow the podcast.</p><p>[16:55:00] It is all at the usual iTunes, CNN/podcast. We will have a Profitable Moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment, it was 1886 that Sears Roebuck opened its first store and over the next century became a bastion of American retailing. Particularly in the Midwest. Everybody seemed to go to Sears and you bought houses, cars, automobiles. Bits and bobs for the house. Sears, if you take a look at how that progressed, has been the hallmark of American retailing. And unfortunately, hard times have fallen on the company of. They've shut many, many stores and yet today, they came up with an announcement that they were going to sell their Kenmore appliances through Amazon and the stock rallied some 20 percent.</p><p>What does it tell us? It tells us very little about Sears. Because Sears is probably yesterday's retailer. It tells us something about the necessity to sell Kenmore on Amazon. But what it really tells us, is about Amazon itself. This behemoth retailer of the 21st century. Think about it, in this week alone we've seen two examples, Sears sells on Amazon. And the price goes up 20 percent. Blue Apron gets threatened by Amazon in the meal kit industry, and their share price collapses.</p><p>This is not about Sears or Blue Apron. This is about Amazon. And the power of the $1,000 stock that is now ruling the retail world. That's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York, whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. We will do it again tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017072001cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P2V-WPV1-DXH2-62V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7345\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 20, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>EUROPEAN POLICE OFFICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Prisons</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Drugs (Narcotics)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Meetings</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Infrastructure</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

As we move into the 2020's with these long-simmering trends continuing to erupt, how will the  race to regulate 'big tech' play out?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology providers have been forced to rethink the Silicon Valley mantra 'move fast and break things', yet regulators have demonstrated the contrary, signalling they are unafraid to implement change.  However, the reactive and piecemeal manner in which laws have been swiftly passed lack a holistic, global view of the digital ecosystem.</p><p>As public concerns that regulation is failing to keep pace continued to increase, we saw a greater openness to use regulatory alternatives to 'fill' the gaps.   Internationally, consideration is being paid to the capability of human rights and more prominently ethical frameworks in responding to new and emerging technologies, in particular artificial intelligence.</p><p>So what's on the cards for 2020?</p><p>As January has already proven, many of the concerns motivating the 'techlash' in 2019 will remain at the forefront of technology regulation in the new decade. In particular, with the rise of artificial intelligence and the corresponding capability of new and emerging technologies to store, consume, learn from and generate ever-increasing amounts of (highly personalised) data, technology providers will continue to reckon with the broader issues and implications of their solutions. The question of whether all companies, not just technology providers, can maintain their social licence to operate in the digital economy will remain.</p><p>The techlash gets broader... but perhaps not deeper</p><p>This is demonstrated in the way that the 'techlash', initially focused on the market power of, and the use (and potential misuse) of data by, 'big tech', has expanded outwards  a trend that is likely to continue.</p><p>2020 kicked off with Microsoft's plan to be carbon negative by 2030, a goal that extends through its supply chain. This announcement reflects the reality that, although the technology sector is confronting its own unique challenges, it is also not immune from the environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors influencing other companies in a wide variety of industries. Indeed, technology providers could have a particularly central role to play, given their size, influence and capacity to contribute to innovative technological solutions in these areas.</p><p>Conversely, although the sector is likely to need to respond to a broader range of issues and public concerns, it is not clear that the current focus on big tech will materially intensify. For example, although a number of market regulators have commenced, or are considering, various actions in relation to large technology providers, we are unlikely in the short term to see successful proposals to 'break up' these companies.</p><p>Global consensus proves elusive</p><p>The piecemeal, reactive global approach to technology regulation that was emblematic of 2019 has continued into 2020. The clearest example of this is in the current debate over the use of facial recognition technology, largely by government and law enforcement agencies. That debate suffers from a  narrowness of focus in relation to facial recognition technology as used by the public sector, rather than considering the broad universe of both private and public sector applications of biometric identification technologies. It is also evidence of clear and pronounced divergences in regulatory responses  in the absence of global consensus, not only have federal and state regulators differed in their approaches, but local regulators have often stepped in to set their own approach (for example, in San Francisco's proposed ban on such technologies).</p><p>This failure to reach substantive consensus on specific technology regulatory issues is also compounded by broader geopolitical factors, including trade wars and political concerns of data sovereignty. In 2020, although there will be greater recognition of the value of greater harmonisation in technology regulation, this is unlikely to truly materialise.</p><p>Mind the gaps: Giving teeth to ethical approaches</p><p>In the absence of this harmonisation, the buzz around 'ethics in AI' and other public policy-based approaches to emerging technology will not abate. However, we are likely to see increased scepticism of the practical ability of many of these ethical frameworks and principles, as they currently stand, to effect meaningful industry-wide change. This is especially the case where  as today  these frameworks are fast proliferating, but are often specific to individual companies or smaller groups of providers.</p><p>In order to avoid charges of 'ethics-washing', these frameworks will need to quickly mature. In 2020, all stakeholders are likely to need to move faster to not only define and adhere to widely accepted norms of 'ethical' conduct, but also to ensure that the consequences for failing to meet these norms are clear and robust.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Firms that allow harmful material to flourish or don't remove it quickly could be sanctioned. Ofcom currently keeps tabs on radio and television broadcasters, and has the power to levy fines or even kick repeat offenders off the air. The government said it was 'minded' to make the changes, but new legislation will be needed for it to take effect. It said officials were working 'at pace' to draft a new law. Ofcom will hold companies to account if they don't deal with harmful material, and platforms will have to remove 'illegal content' quickly and 'minimize the risk of it appearing.\" In order to safeguard freedom of expression, the rules won't ban people from accessing or posting offensive but legal content, though the government indicated it would let internet companies decide what material is tolerated. Online companies 'will be required to explicitly state what content and behaviour is acceptable on their sites in clear and accessible terms and conditions and enforce these effectively, consistently and transparently,' the government said.  Tech companies welcomed the regulations.  'Facebook has long called for new regulations to set high standards across the internet,' said Rebecca Stimson, the social network's head of U.K. public policy.
