Benioff was not specific about how the government should regulate tech, but praised senators like Mark Warner for scrutinizing the industry. </p><p>Tech billionaire Marc Benioff has previously compared Facebook to cigarettes, and on Wednesday renewed his attack on the social network in aninterview with Kara Swisher for MSNBC News[1]. \"I've been saying this now for a while... You look at what's going on with brands like Facebook. Facebook is the new cigarettes. It's addictive, it's not good for you, there's people trying to get you to use that even you don't understand what's going on,\" the Salesforce CEO said. Benioff called for tighter regulation of the social network, saying: \"The government needs to step in, the government needs to really regulate what's happening.\" He said this was particularly urgent because Facebook targets children as users. Benioff was not specific about how exactly the government should regulate tech, but returned to the comparison with cigarettes. \"This is the role of government, to protect us... at times of severe change, and you know they did that with the cigarette industry, they need to do that with the technology industry,\" he said.

Benioff has got form in speaking his mind about his tech contemporaries. He publicly admonished Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in October[4] for his opposition to San Francsico's Proposition C, a tax on tech companies to raise funds for the city's homelessness crisis.

But in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow Wednesday he went one significant step further and added his name to the list of those who support breaking up the social media giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's addictive, it's not good for you, they're after your kids, they're running political ads that aren't true ... and they're also acquiring other companies and co-mingling [data those companies have on their users] into theirs,\" Benioff said, referencing Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp and other tech platforms. \"And I think at that point, because they're now doing that, that they probably should be broken up. Because they're having an undue influence as the largest social media platform on the planet,\" he said.</p><p>Despite being the head of a massive Silicon Valley company himself, Benioff is known for his sharp critiques of leadership styles in the technology industry and has not shied away from calling out his peers, especially at Facebook. In his interview with Harlow, he also went after a bit of US law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, that has enabled the internet to become what it is today by protecting platforms from certain liabilities.</p><p>Benioff is on a media tour for his new book \"Trailblazer,\" published Tuesday, which centers on what he says is the need for today's CEOs to consider returns not just for shareholders, but for all stakeholders in their companies, including customers and employees.</p><p>The question of whether Facebook is a monopoly that should be broken up has become an increasingly frequent topic of conversation, especially on the 2020 campaign trail. Facebook and fellow tech giants Google, Amazon and Apple have been at the center of a recent effort by regulators to evaluate whether big tech companies are violating antitrust rules. </p><p>For its part, Facebook has said that breaking it and other tech companies up would only make it harder for those companies to tackle pressing issues on their platforms such as election interference. Facebook declined to comment on Benioff's remarks. </p><p>Benioff first called out Facebook at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2018, at which he likened the platform to \"cigarettes.\" After that comment, Benioff said, he got a call from Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p>He declined to comment to CNN on the specifics of his conversation with Sandberg, but said he has essentially the same message every time he talks to other CEOs, the same one he has for customers and employees. </p><p>\"We're in a world where very advanced technologies are at our fingertips, and where we can do magical things,\" Benioff said. \"But that also means that trust must be our highest value. And you have to ask yourself: Is trust your highest value? If it's not your highest value, then what is it?\"</p><p>Benioff said seeking higher levels of trust with consumers is \"the most important thing in the industry today. Period.\"</p><p>In particular, Benioff took issue with Facebook's recent decision to run political advertisements from the Trump campaign which contain false claims. Benioff said there is \"no question\" that he would not run such advertisements if he were the head of Facebook, and called on Congress to pass legislation that would require truthful advertising on social media platforms. </p><p>\"I think this is extremely important in the age of social media, because they have the information of who those persuadables are, and various political organizations are targeting those groups,\" he said. \"That's the insight from the 2016 election. It's a very vulnerable moment right now.\"</p><p>One of the reasons tech platforms are able to publish such content without consequences is the law typically shorthanded as Section 230, which allows internet platform providers to moderate some content without fear of being held liable for most of what users do on their platforms. </p><p>Benioff called Section 230 \"the most dangerous law on the books right now,\" and said it should be \"abolished.\" </p><p>\"On these platforms, it's well documented what's happening,\" he said. \"And this cannot continue. It is deeply affecting our society.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Ein Foto aus dem Jahr 1977 zeigt die ?Eiserne Lady? im Gespr\u00e4ch mit dem ersten d\u00e4nischen EU-Kommissar Finn Olav Gundelach. Vestager h\u00e4ngt an diesem Foto ? wie an vielen anderen auch: Sie wei\u00df um die Kraft von Bildern. In ihrem B\u00fcro mit grandiosem Blick \u00fcber Br\u00fcssel hat sie Dutzende Bilder auf einem lang gezogenen Sideboard aufgestellt. Sie zeigen die Familie, Weggef\u00e4hrten einer beeindruckenden politischen Karriere, die Kinder. Vestager begr\u00fc\u00dft uns mit warmem, festem H\u00e4ndedruck, bestellt einen Tee. Der Terminkalender der Kommissarin ist selbst Ende Dezember eng getaktet ? nach dem Gespr\u00e4ch wird Frau Vestager aufspringen, loseilen, der deutsche Minister wartet bereits. Es wird ein wenig l\u00e4nger dauern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A wie Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Frau Digitalkommissarin, wem vertrauen Sie: k\u00fcnstlicher oder menschlicher Intelligenz? Ich w\u00fcrde immer auf menschliche Intelligenz setzen. Elon Musk warnt: Die Menschheit k\u00f6nnte als bessere Hauskatze enden. Die Maschinen dienen uns ? das muss immer klar sein. Wir definieren, angelehnt an unsere Werte und ethischen Grundlagen, Grenzen und Regeln. Dennoch d\u00fcrfen wir in der Diskussion nicht vergessen, wie hilfreich k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, etwa in der Krebsforschung, sein kann: KI kann Tausende Befunde und Scans analysieren ? und erstellt mit immer besserer Rechenleistung viel genauere Diagnosen in wesentlich k\u00fcrzerer Zeit. Werden Roboter und Software Steuern zahlen? Mir gen\u00fcgt, wenn Menschen und Firmen Steuern zahlen. Deshalb: A wie Amazon. Okay. Amazons Marktmacht, Datenschatz und Kriegskasse werden immer gigantischer. Deshalb haben wir eine Untersuchung eingeleitet, die herausfinden soll, wie Amazon seine herausragende Stellung im Markt nutzt, und zwar in den unterschiedlichsten Gesch\u00e4ftsfeldern. Ich teile die Einsch\u00e4tzung, dass mit einer marktdominierenden Stellung eine besondere Verantwortung einhergeht. Zumal Amazon zugleich Schiedsrichter und Spieler ist. Was wir in einem Spiel niemals akzeptieren w\u00fcrden. Sind unsere Spielregeln denn ad\u00e4quat genug f\u00fcr den entfesselten Datenkapitalismus des 21. Jahrhunderts? Die Grunds\u00e4tze gelten noch immer, denn diese regeln menschliche Verhaltensweisen ? und werden von Gier, Angst und Macht geleitet. Da wir Menschen uns kaum \u00e4ndern, bleiben die Motive gleich. Was sich ver\u00e4ndert, sind die Dynamiken, die Marginalkosten und Netzwerkeffekte und auch die grunds\u00e4tzlichen Faktoren, wenn etwa Daten zu Rohstoffen werden. Mit Alexa ist Amazon gro\u00df ins Datengesch\u00e4ft eingestiegen: Lassen Sie die KI in Ihr Heim, in Ihre K\u00fcche, ins Wohnzimmer oder in die Schlafzimmer? Nein. Wobei ich zugeben muss, dass auch ich nicht wirklich konsequent bin: Bisher habe ich Siri auf meinem Telefon nicht deaktiviert. Warum nicht? Ich war schlichtweg zu bequem. Zeichnen die Ger\u00e4te nicht ohnehin st\u00e4ndig unsere Gespr\u00e4che auf, ungeachtet der Einstellungen? Auch dieser Frage m\u00fcssen wir dringend nachgehen, sie ist eine der fundamentalsten \u00fcberhaupt. Viele Menschen kleben die Kamera des Laptops ab ? bei Ihrem Ger\u00e4t ist dies nicht der Fall. Normalerweise schon, aber mein Laptop wurde gerade neu aufgesetzt.</p><p>B wie Brussels</p><p>Ihre zweite Runde als K\u00e4mpferin f\u00fcr europ\u00e4ische Verbraucher hat gerade begonnen: Sie haben noch mehr Verantwortung und Macht. Herzlichen Gl\u00fcckwunsch! Danke. Und ich denke, die zweite Amtszeit wird sehr anders sein. Was nicht nur an der unglaublichen Geschwindigkeit liegt, mit der sich unsere Welt ver\u00e4ndert, sondern auch an der neuen Aufstellung, die wir hier in Br\u00fcssel haben. Gibt es schon erste Anzeichen eines Kulturwandels? Durchaus. In welcher Form? Die Mobiltelefone sind aus den Sitzungen verbannt ? alle m\u00fcssen die Ger\u00e4te in einen kleinen Schrank sperren, was ich sehr begr\u00fc\u00dfe, denn jetzt h\u00f6ren wir uns zwangsl\u00e4ufig sehr viel besser zu. Mit wem haben Sie, bevor Sie Frau von der Leyen zusagten, die Entscheidung besprochen? Mit der Familie, zumal mein Mann und unsere j\u00fcngste Tochter seit 2017 wieder in Kopenhagen leben und sich nichts lieber w\u00fcnschten, als wieder zusammenzuwohnen. Und? Die Familie wei\u00df, wie gerne ich diesen Job mache ? und wie sehr mich dieser erf\u00fcllt. Gr\u00f6\u00dferen Widerstand gab es jedoch in Br\u00fcssel. Inwiefern? Als ich vor geraumer Zeit erw\u00e4hnte, wie gut ich mir den Job der Wettbewerbskommissarin auch f\u00fcr eine zweite Amtszeit vorstellen k\u00f6nnte, hie\u00df es nur: ?Sweet! Aber daraus wird nie und nimmer etwas.? Und doch sitzen wir hier. Sch\u00f6n, oder? Allerdings nicht mehr im zehnten, sondern im zw\u00f6lften Stock. Die Aussicht im zehnten Stock war besser. In Runde eins haben Sie Alphabet 6,7 Milliarden Euro an Strafen verpasst ? und Apple zur Zahlung von 13 Milliarden Euro verdonnert. Was muss Big Tech in Runde zwei bef\u00fcrchten? Es geht hier ja nicht um Strafen, sondern darum, das eigene Verhalten infrage zu stellen.</p><p>C wie Computer</p><p>K\u00f6nnen Sie sich an Ihren ersten Computer erinnern? Ein gro\u00dfer, grauer Kasten, schwarzer Bildschirm, gelbe, blinkende Schrift: Ich war an der Uni und musste darauf eine Hausarbeit schreiben ? der Drucker machte mich wahnsinnig. K\u00f6nnen Sie sich an Ihre erste E-Mail-Adresse erinnern? Nein. Wie viele E-Mail-Adressen benutzt die Digitalkommissarin heute? Drei. Wie regelm\u00e4\u00dfig checken Sie Ihre Mails? Unter der Woche zwischen Meetings ? am Wochenende morgens und abends.</p><p>D wie Data</p><p>Sowohl Facebook als auch Google waren 2018 in massive Datenskandale verwickelt: Mark Zuckerberg musste dem US-Kongress f\u00fcnf Stunden lang erkl\u00e4ren, was Facebook und Cambridge Analytica mit dem Wahlergebnis der Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahl 2016 zu tun hatten. Es scheint, als w\u00e4re 2018 das Jahr gewesen, in dem Daten nicht nur Rohstoff, sondern vor allem Risiko geworden sind. Das h\u00e4tte ich nicht besser sagen k\u00f6nnen ? je gr\u00f6\u00dfer das Potenzial, desto gr\u00f6\u00dfer das Risiko. Wobei Daten zudem noch sehr viel m\u00e4chtiger sind als klassische Rohstoffe wie beispielsweise Gold oder \u00d6l. Machen Daten Ihnen mehr Hoffnung oder eher Angst? Beides ? und das sehr ambivalent: Mit der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung konnten wir die digitalen Rechte der B\u00fcrger Europas jedoch entscheidend st\u00e4rken. Brauchen wir in Europa eigene Cloud-Dienste, um in Zukunft weniger von Amerika oder China abh\u00e4ngig zu sein? Daf\u00fcr bedarf es neben den Faktoren Verschl\u00fcsselung und Verf\u00fcgbarkeit vor allem einer Finanzierung: Die gro\u00dfen Cloud-Dienste, die bisher das Feld bestellen, sind eigentlich Zusatzgesch\u00e4fte der gro\u00dfen Tech-Firmen. Dennoch hoffe ich, dass sich alternative Cloud-Projekte wie etwa Gaia X durchsetzen k\u00f6nnen: Die Sicherheit und Verf\u00fcgbarkeit der eigenen Daten geh\u00f6ren f\u00fcr mich absolut zu den Grundrechten des 21. Jahrhunderts.</p><p>E wie Europe</p><p>Bitte beschreiben Sie Europa in einem Wort. Heimat. Was ist Europa minus Gro\u00dfbritannien? Europa. Wie schmeckt Europa? Sehr unterschiedlich ? und das ist gut so! W\u00e4re Europa ein Men\u00fc, welche Gerichte geh\u00f6rten dazu? Ich w\u00fcrde als Vorspeise Lachs servieren, als Hauptgericht Vol-au-vents mit einer F\u00fcllung aus H\u00fchnchen und Spargel. Und als Dessert dann Panna cotta. Grappa oder Espresso? Am liebsten Tee.</p><p>F wie Facebook</p><p>Frau Vestager, schadet Facebook unserer Demokratie? Auch das. F\u00fcr Plattformen ist die Verweildauer der Nutzer die wichtigste W\u00e4hrung. Engagement wird vor allem durch Emotionen wie Hass und Angst gef\u00f6rdert: Glauben Sie, dass YouTube und Facebook wirklich ein Interesse haben, etwas gegen die demokratiegef\u00e4hrdende Ausbreitung von Fake News und Hate Speech zu tun? Zumindest bisher haben diese Firmen kaum etwas aus Eigeninitiative heraus getan, was dem eigenen Gesch\u00e4ftsinteresse schaden k\u00f6nnte. Deshalb mussten meine Kollegen der Kommission und ich ja auch sagen: Entweder ihr regelt das ? oder wir regeln es f\u00fcr euch! Selbst bei illegalen Inhalten redeten und redeten und redeten wir auf die Firmen ein, aber nichts geschah ? nicht bei Anleitungen, wie man Bomben baut, nicht bei sehr offensichtlicher Propaganda f\u00fcr Terrorismus, nicht einmal bei schrecklichen Dingen wie Kinderpornografie. Also sagten wir: ?Wenn ihr das nicht innerhalb einer Stunde runternehmt, werden wir euch zwingen.? Regulierung funktioniert. In diesen Bereichen scheint Druck das entscheidende Mittel, wenn es Ver\u00e4nderungen bedarf. Sie haben einst zugestimmt, dass Zuckerberg WhatsApp kaufen kann. W\u00fcrden Sie das wieder tun? Das h\u00e4ngt von der Analyse ab. Damals wurden Sie von Facebook get\u00e4uscht ? woraufhin Sie eine Millionenstrafe verh\u00e4ngten. Man sollte Strafverfolgungsbeh\u00f6rden niemals anl\u00fcgen! Die FTC verh\u00e4ngte 2019 gar f\u00fcnf Milliarden Dollar Strafzahlungen gegen Facebook ? aber wie wirksam sind Rekordstrafen angesichts von Hunderten Milliarden in den Kriegskassen dieser Tech-Firmen? Es geht ja nicht um die H\u00f6he der Strafe, da Strafe lediglich illegale Verhaltensweisen sanktioniert. Worum dann? Dass die Firmen ihre Gesch\u00e4ftspraktiken \u00e4ndern. Tun sie das denn? Ein gewisser Wandel findet statt ? ob dieser allerdings ausreicht, wird man sehen. Der Aktienkurs von Facebook stieg nach dem FTC-Urteil paradoxerweise sprunghaft an. Die B\u00f6rse mag keine Unsicherheiten ? nach dem Urteil war wieder klar, wo man eigentlich steht. Anscheinend an einem Punkt, an dem sich Mark Zuckerberg von jeder Schuld freikaufen kann. Nat\u00fcrlich bedarf es auch mittelfristiger Ma\u00dfnahmen. Aber immerhin haben wir zum ersten Mal wirklich durchgezogen und gesagt: ?Stopp, hier handelt es sich um illegales Verhalten!? Und sind dagegen entschieden vorgegangen. Mit welchem der f\u00fcnf m\u00e4chtigsten Tech-CEOs streiten Sie am liebsten? Ich streite \u00fcberhaupt nicht gerne.</p><p>G wie Google</p><p>Sollten wir tats\u00e4chlich Steine auf den Google-Bus werfen, wie der amerikanische Digitalphilosoph Douglas Rushkoff es einst forderte? Nein. Dennoch waren Ihre fettesten Steine drei Strafzahlungen gegen das Unternehmen aus Mountain View: Die erste betrug 2,42 Milliarden, die zweite 4,34 Milliarden Euro, die dritte dann 1,49 Milliarden Euro. Richtig. Ist Google gut oder b\u00f6se? Das m\u00fcssen Sie Google fragen. In den Neunzigern und fr\u00fchen Zweitausendern war das Internet ein positiver, fast optimistischer Ort. Wann ist es gekippt? Als aus Daten ein Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell wurde: All unsere Daten wurden pl\u00f6tzlich zu Big Data ? und da die Rechenleistungen immer gigantischer wurden, konnte man diese auch noch analysieren, ordnen, verarbeiten und kapitalisieren. Erst das hat den Datenkapitalismus richtig entfesselt ? und \u00fcberhaupt erst erm\u00f6glicht, dass Firmen in k\u00fcrzester Zeit historisch einzigartig hohe Milliardengewinne einfahren konnten. Untersch\u00e4tzen Sie nie die Macht der Daten! Tun wir das nicht alle? Darf ich Ihnen etwas erz\u00e4hlen, was ich bisher nicht nachpr\u00fcfen konnte? Ich bitte darum! Ein Bekannter berichtete mir Folgendes: Selbst wenn man noch nie einen Dienst von Google benutzt und auch nie etwas bei Google Search gesucht hat, keine eingehenden Mails von Gmail zul\u00e4sst und noch nie ein Video bei YouTube auf dem eigenen Rechner gesehen hat, wei\u00df Google zu 80 Prozent, wer wir sind, wen wir kennen und was unsere W\u00fcnsche sind. Wie ist das m\u00f6glich? Weil alle Anbieter Tracker benutzen, also die Seiten von Google durchpfl\u00fcgen lassen, und Google Analytics kostenlos ist. Also werden wir aus zweiter Hand durchleuchtet. Daran erkennen Sie, wie viel wertvoller als herk\u00f6mmliche Rohstoffe Daten sind: Sie definieren, wer wir sind, und definieren, wen wir kennen und was wir wollen oder nicht wollen. Wenn man gen\u00fcgend Daten zu einer Person besitzt, kann man aus diesen Datenpunkten selbst vermeintlich anonyme Daten wie den Namen oder das Geburtsdatum destillieren. Die entscheidende Frage lautet: Wie k\u00f6nnen wir sicherstellen, dass die Menschen selbst entscheiden k\u00f6nnen, was mit ihren Daten geschieht? Ist es daf\u00fcr schon zu sp\u00e4t? Viele Menschen wollen ja, dass ihre Daten zum Wohle aller eingesetzt werden, damit das Gesundheitswesen besser wird und der Verkehr flie\u00dft und nicht steht. Und doch lehnen sie ab, wenn irgendwelche Firmen mit ihren Daten unermesslich viel Geld sch\u00f6pfen. Die emeritierte Harvard-Professorin Shoshana Zuboff hat f\u00fcr diesen Auswuchs des Kapitalismus den Begriff ?\u00dcberwachungskapitalismus? gepr\u00e4gt. Ein ziemlich passender Begriff, ja. Wobei es sich immer um wirtschaftliche Kreisl\u00e4ufe handelt. Und auch in der heutigen Digitalwirtschaft wird am Ende doch das meiste Geld durch Anzeigenums\u00e4tze generiert. Damit hat Alphabet, also Google, 2018 fast schon unanst\u00e4ndige 136 Milliarden Dollar umgesetzt ? eine Verdreieinhalbfachung der Einnahmen in gerade mal sieben Jahren. Ja. Brauchen wir angesichts dieser Entwicklungen, der Gefahren des digitalen Terrorismus und der Risiken in Sachen k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz wom\u00f6glich einen supranationalen Ethikrat? Daran sitzen wir bereits: 52 Experten aus unterschiedlichen Bereichen haben gerade sieben ethische Prinzipien f\u00fcr den Umgang mit KI festgelegt. Und 450 Firmen haben sich verpflichtet, diese in der Entwicklung von KI zu implementieren und im Alltag auszuprobieren. Funktioniert das? Wir beginnen gerade erst, die Daten auszuwerten. Also Big Data im Einsatz gegen Big Data. Ganz genau (lacht).</p><p>H wie Home</p><p>Google plant gerade, einen Stadtteil von Toronto zu einer ?Smart City? aufzur\u00fcsten: W\u00fcrde es Sie reizen, in einer voll vernetzten Stadt zu wohnen? Nein. Wie smart ist denn Ihr Zuhause? Nicht smart, aber ganz chic ? zumindest f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack.</p><p>I wie Infrastructure</p><p>Ein Schl\u00fcsselprojekt europ\u00e4ischer Infrastrukturpolitik ist die geplante F\u00f6rderung im Batteriebereich mit 3,2 Milliarden Euro, um nicht von China oder Tesla abh\u00e4ngig zu sein. Richtig. Derzeit sind wir in der Batterieherstellung beispielsweise noch hochgradig abh\u00e4ngig von Rohstoffen, die nur sehr eingeschr\u00e4nkt verf\u00fcgbar sind. Muss das so bleiben? Wie kann die n\u00e4chste Generation von Batterien aussehen? Welche technischen M\u00f6glichkeiten gibt es? K\u00f6nnen wir die Rohstoffe sinnvoller recyceln? Sie ahnen: Innovationen sind ebenso wichtig wie die Batterien selbst. Bedarf es daf\u00fcr staatlicher Einmischung? Ja, wenn wir den entscheidenden Schritt weitergehen wollen ? Also bef\u00fcrworten auch Sie die von Wirtschaftsminister Peter Altmaier geforderte staatliche Industriepolitik? Der Markt geht immer nur so weit, wie er muss. Batterien, Server und Sendemasten geh\u00f6ren klassischerweise zur Infrastruktur, geh\u00f6ren Browser und Suchmaschinen auch dazu? Absolut. Zumal Google mittlerweile so dominierend ist, dass Google nicht nur Suchmaschine, sondern Teil der Infrastruktur und damit Gatekeeper ist: Google entscheidet, wer oder was sichtbar ist ? und was nicht. Googeln Sie denn nicht? Ich benutze Cliqz, auch wenn die Resultate dieser Suchmaschinen von den Ergebnissen einer Google-Suche abweichen k\u00f6nnen. Bei Cliqz sieht man daf\u00fcr, wer welche Cookies aussendet, nach unseren Daten fischt ? und kann das effektiv blocken.</p><p>J wie Joy</p><p>Der Alltag einer Digitalkommissarin scheint dystopisch: Was entlockt Ihnen ein L\u00e4cheln? Ein guter Gedanke, ein sch\u00f6n formulierter Satz mit dem richtigen Timing f\u00fcr einen Witz. Ansonsten: meine Familie und meine Freunde. Wie lautet das Mission Statement von Margrethe Vestager? K\u00fcrzlich schrieb ich: ?Technologie, die dem Menschen dient, M\u00e4rkte, die den Konsumenten dienen, und Gesellschaften, in denen man sich zu Hause f\u00fchlt auf unserem wunderbaren Planeten.? Sind Sie Optimistin oder Pessimistin? Optimistin, schon aus moralischer Pflicht: Pessimisten bekommen nie etwas gebacken! Wer gibt sich noch M\u00fche, wenn man denkt, morgen wird eh alles schlimmer?</p><p>K wie Kids</p><p>Sie sagten k\u00fcrzlich: ?Jedes Kind hat ein Recht auf Bildung und auf Schutz, sowohl im physischen als auch digitalen Leben.? Das muss unser aller Ziel sein, ja. Was macht Kinder stark? Ihr analoges Leben. Welche Werte k\u00f6nnen wir unseren Kindern mitgeben? Sie sollten r\u00fccksichtsvoll, begeisterungsf\u00e4hig und neugierig bleiben. Sollten meine Kinder eher Mandarin sprechen oder Code schreiben k\u00f6nnen? Das kommt sehr auf Ihre Kinder an. Wie streng war die digitale Agenda im Hause Vestager? Meine Kinder sind ja ein wenig \u00e4lter ? und fr\u00fcher war alles sehr viel einfacher. Wobei ich feststelle, dass diese Generation viel strenger, mindestens aber bewusster ist, wenn es um die Nutzung digitaler Medien geht. Sind Sie eine strenge Mutter? Nie streng genug (lacht).</p><p>M wie Margrethe</p><p>Wie muss man sich Ihre Kindheit in Westj\u00fctland vorstellen? Ruhig. Sie sind in einem Pfarrershaushalt aufgewachsen: Wie wichtig ist der Glaube f\u00fcr Ihr heutiges Leben? Ich w\u00fcrde mich als gl\u00e4ubige Christin bezeichnen ? aber wenn ich einen Slogan br\u00e4uchte, hie\u00dfe der: ?Vertraue in Gott und f\u00fcrchte die Kirche!? Was machen Ihre Eltern heute? Jetzt gerade? Mein Vater hat gerade den ganzen Kierkegaard durchgelesen, zum dritten Mal schon. Und Mutter wechselt vermutlich die Hauptplatine irgendeines Computers. Wie muss man sich die Sch\u00fclerin Margrethe vorstellen? Ich habe es geliebt, in die Schule zu gehen. Was w\u00fcrde die 16-j\u00e4hrige Margrethe zu Frau Vestager sagen, die heute hier sitzt? Wow, du hast viel dazugelernt! Mit 25 Jahren wurden Sie bereits Parteichefin der Radikale Venstre, der Radikalen Linken. Was war das Radikalste, das Sie in Ihrer Jugend gemacht haben? Als Kind war ich auf den Osterm\u00e4rschen ? und viel radikaler wurde es bei mir nie. Aber auch diese friedliche Form der Demokratie war durchaus pr\u00e4gend f\u00fcr mich: Bei Wind und Wetter mit all den anderen Menschen drau\u00dfen zu sein ? und gemeinsam f\u00fcr eine Sache einzustehen ? und zu singen ? und zu singen (lacht). Bevor Sie nach Br\u00fcssel gingen, waren Sie Vizeministerpr\u00e4sidentin D\u00e4nemarks; die Karriere verlief spektakul\u00e4r. Was vermissen Sie aus der Politik Ihres Heimatlands am meisten, wenn es um Prozesse und das Handwerk einer Politik f\u00fcr 28 Mitgliedsstaaten geht? In D\u00e4nemark ist man seit Jahrzehnten gewohnt, \u00fcber Parteilinien hinweg Kompromisse zu suchen und diese auch zu finden ? jeder muss mit jedem zusammenarbeiten, wenn es darum geht, Mehrheiten zu finden. Als Minister wei\u00df man am Morgen nie, wie man bis zum Lunch eine Mehrheit zusammenbekommt. Das d\u00e4nische Modell scheint gerade en vogue: Selbst in Deutschland ist eine Minderheitsregierung nicht mehr ausgeschlossen. Ich muss jedoch warnen: Wer gewohnt ist, andere zu ignorieren und entlang der Parteigrenzen dichtzumachen, weil er eine sichere Mehrheit hinter sich wusste, braucht Zeit, sich daran zu gew\u00f6hnen. Wie vehement Parteilinien verteidigt werden k\u00f6nnen, kann man derzeit live im Fernsehen w\u00e4hrend des Impeachment-Verfahrens gegen Pr\u00e4sident Trump mitverfolgen. Ich hatte leider noch keine Zeit, mir das anzuschauen. Die d\u00e4nische Variante von ?House of Cards? hei\u00dft ?Borgen?, das h\u00f6chste Amt des Staates bekleidet in der TV-Serie eine Frau namens Birgitte Nyborg. Wie viel Vestager steckt in Nyborg? Wir haben Gemeinsamkeiten ? Allerdings wirken Sie nicht so kaltherzig ... Es muss auch Unterschiede geben ? Und sind nicht geschieden! Bitte keine Spoiler!</p><p>N wie (Green) New Deal</p><p>Ursula von der Leyens ?Green New Deal? d\u00fcrfte die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Herausforderung der EU seit der Einf\u00fchrung des Euro werden. Er wird unser Leben in allen Bereichen ver\u00e4ndern, ohne Frage. Die EU soll bis 2050 kohlenstoffneutral werden. Nein, nicht kohlenstoffneutral, sondern klimaneutral, ein himmelweiter Unterschied. Wir brauchen f\u00fcr so ziemlich alle Bereiche des Lebens neue Konzepte: vom Verkehr \u00fcber Verzehr bis hin zum Verzicht. Kann Europa das \u00fcberhaupt leisten? Ja. Auch finanziell? Ja! Wie wichtig wird digitale Transformation f\u00fcr den Klimaschutz? Sehr wichtig. Auch wenn wir erst einmal ein gro\u00dfes Paradox aufl\u00f6sen m\u00fcssen, denn Klimaschutz ist auf digitale L\u00f6sungen angewiesen ? doch diese fressen immer mehr Energie auf. Also: Schauen Sie nie allein Netflix, niemals! Eine erbauliche Ansage in Zeiten digitaler Vereinsamung. Streaming frisst unglaublich viel Strom: In Paris werden Pools mit der Strahlungsw\u00e4rme von Servern beheizt. Wissenschaftler des franz\u00f6sischen Thinktanks ?The Shift Project? haben gerade errechnet, dass E-Mails, Streaming und Cloud-Dienste vier Prozent der weltweiten C02-Emission ausmachen. Und der Datenverkehr w\u00e4chst um 25 Prozent pro Jahr. Denken Sie mal, was das f\u00fcr die C02-Belastung eines autonom fahrenden Autos bedeutet: Diese werden wie herk\u00f6mmliche Autos betrieben und fressen Strom wie Hochleistungscomputer. Wenn wir nicht bald hinbekommen, die Energiekosten f\u00fcr vernetzte Digitalit\u00e4t drastisch zu reduzieren, verdoppeln wir sie so auf einen Schlag. Schauen Sie wirklich nie Netflix? Doch. Wie gesagt: Meine Generation ist nicht so konsequent, wie sie gerne w\u00e4re. Ich w\u00fcrde wetten, dass Sie ?The Crown? gesehen haben. Nein. Sondern? ?RuPaul?s Drag Race?! Noch besser? Viel besser!</p><p>O wie Originality</p><p>Ist eine digitale Renaissance in Europa n\u00f6tig? Dringend! Manche Experten sagen, China besitze die Daten, Amerika habe das Geld. Was bleibt? Die europ\u00e4ischen Werte ? und die einmalige Chance, den Binnenmarkt der 500 Millionen Europ\u00e4erinnen und Europ\u00e4er endlich zu nutzen. Zumal wir mitunter die besten Universit\u00e4ten der Welt auf unserem Kontinent wissen; ein Programm k\u00f6nnte hei\u00dfen: Uni first, Unicorns later! Eine zauberhafte Formulierung! Aber: Wir Europ\u00e4er m\u00fcssen entscheiden, ob wir den Weg zusammen gehen wollen. Sollte Europa, und davon bin ich zu einhundert Prozent \u00fcberzeugt, wirklich einmal zusammenfinden, sind wir unschlagbar.</p><p>P wie Privacy</p><p>Sind wir zu naiv im Umgang mit unserer digitalen Privatsph\u00e4re? Definitiv. Ist es zu schlicht gedacht, die gro\u00dfen Tech-Firmen daf\u00fcr verantwortlich zu machen? Warum sollte es das sein? M\u00f6glicherweise ist das Konzept von Privatsph\u00e4re in einer Zeit, in der unsere Gesellschaft ihr Leben live streamt, postet und sendet, schlichtweg obsolet. Selbst wenn das, was Sie so anstellen, es wert w\u00e4re, auf Titelseiten vermeldet zu werden, bedeutet das noch lange nicht, dass auch Ihre Mutter dies bis in alle Ewigkeit im Internet nachlesen k\u00f6nnen muss. Lesen Sie eigentlich immer die Nutzungsbedingungen, neumodisch auch Terms and Conditions genannt? Ja, zumindest versuche ich es. Es gibt YouTube-Videos, die ich deshalb nie gesehen habe. Wie steht es um Ihre Datenhygiene? Gut, hoffe ich (lacht). Wechseln Sie regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Ihre Passw\u00f6rter? Ja. Was ist das Beste, das die digitale Transformation bisher hervorgebracht hat? Bequemlichkeit. Was ist das Analogste im Leben einer Digitalkommissarin? Ich stricke und backe. Ihre Spezialit\u00e4t? Roggenbrot. Was war das letzte Buch, das Sie auf Papier gelesen haben? Ein Buch, das ich gestern in der Hand hielt, war ?The Guilty Feminist? von Deborah Frances-White. F\u00fchlen Sie sich schuldig? Ha!</p><p>Q wie Quality</p><p>Was macht f\u00fcr Sie Quality Time aus? Meine K\u00fcche. Was ist Ihr liebstes Werkzeug? Meine Messer! Keramik oder Stahl? Stahl. Wie wichtig ist Politik? Sehr wichtig. Gef\u00e4llt es Ihnen, mehr Macht als fr\u00fcher zu haben? Macht ist ein Werkzeug, das man verliehen bekommt, um Ziele zu erreichen. Ist das Leben mit Macht komfortabler? Macht macht nicht bequem, allenfalls s\u00fcchtig.</p><p>R wie Regulations</p><p>Menschen wie Jeff Bezos behaupten, Regulierung sei innovationsfeindlich. Was so nicht stimmt ? um das zu verstehen, gen\u00fcgt ein Blick nach China. Was ist schlimmer: \u00dcberwachungskapitalismus oder \u00dcberwachungskommunismus? Wir wollen weder noch ? zumal nicht jede Innovation automatisch gesund sein muss. Es gibt \u00fcbrigens eine sehr wirksame Methode gegen all diese Ausw\u00fcchse ? Und die w\u00e4re? Einfach die Ger\u00e4te ab und zu mal ausschalten.</p><p>S wie Surveillance Capitalism</p><p>Neben Frau Zuboff warnt auch NSA-Whistleblower Edward Snowden in seinem Buch ?Permanent Record? vor den Ausw\u00fcchsen des \u00dcberwachungskapitalismus: M\u00fcssen wir \u00e4ngstlich oder sehr \u00e4ngstlich sein? Das oberste Gebot lautet: keine Panik!</p><p>T wie Taxes</p><p>Das ?Time Magazine? bezeichnete Sie unl\u00e4ngst als ?Googles schlimmsten Albtraum?, Pr\u00e4sident Trump nennt Sie die ?Tax Lady?: Wann haben Sie erkannt, dass Steuern und Regulierungen Ihre Waffen der Wahl werden w\u00fcrden? Am allerersten Tag in diesem Job. Es ist nicht okay, wenn viele kleine Wettbewerber Steuern zahlen ? und zusehen m\u00fcssen, wie andere Wettbewerber diese ignorieren und umgehen. Es hei\u00dft, Apple-Chef Tim Cook habe die Fassung verloren, als Sie ihn hier in Ihrem B\u00fcro \u00fcber die Strafzahlung von 13 Milliarden Euro informierten. Ich lehne es grunds\u00e4tzlich ab, \u00fcber Treffen dieser Art \u00f6ffentlich zu sprechen. Zumal das Treffen ohnehin zwei Stockwerke tiefer stattgefunden haben d\u00fcrfte. Richtig (l\u00e4chelt).</p><p>U wie Ursula von der Leyen</p><p>Haben Sie die neue Kommissionspr\u00e4sidentin auf Kurzwahl? Ich gestehe: Ich benutze keine Kurzwahl! Wie oft sprechen Sie mit der Kommissionspr\u00e4sidentin? Ziemlich oft.</p><p>V wie Vestager</p><p>Wann beginnt der Tag im Leben von Margrethe Vestager? Gegen sechs Uhr. Wecker oder iPhone? iPhone. Tee oder Kaffee? Tee. Wie halten Sie sich fit? Laufen. Di\u00e4t? Keine Di\u00e4t! Mittagsschlaf? Unbedingt! Wie viele Telefone benutzen Sie? Drei. Und Sie schalten die Ger\u00e4te selbst nachts nicht aus? Ja. Warum? Weil die Kinder anrufen k\u00f6nnten. Macht Ihnen ein leerer Akku Angst? Nein.</p><p>W wie Women</p><p>W\u00e4re die Welt ein besserer Ort, wenn mehr Frauen das Sagen h\u00e4tten? Wir sind auf dem richtigen Weg. Und dieser ist, wenn man sich die neue Kommission anschaut, viel farbenfroher. In der Tat: Man sieht deutlich weniger Anz\u00fcge! Wir sind 12 Frauen und 15 M\u00e4nner ? und man merkt sogleich, wie sich die Fragen, die diskutiert werden, ver\u00e4ndern. Wir denken nicht mehr alle gleich, uniform, und verstecken uns auch nicht hinter Uniformen. Was tragen Sie lieber: Parisian Chic oder Danish Design? Es scheint so, als t\u00e4ten sich d\u00e4nische Designer leichter mit den Ma\u00dfen, die ich trage. Haben Sie fr\u00fcher auch Kleider selbst gen\u00e4ht? Nicht nur fr\u00fcher: Das Kleid, das ich heute trage, ist selbst gen\u00e4ht! Wow! Handarbeiten wie N\u00e4hen oder Stricken sind mentale Wellness f\u00fcr mich ? sie bringen mich wirklich runter.</p><p>X wie Xmas</p><p>Wie haben Sie Weihnachten verbracht? Im Kreis der Familie, zu Hause. Waren Sie auch in der weihnachtlichen Andacht? Ja. Welches ist Ihr liebstes Weihnachtslied? ?Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht?. Was wird bei Familie Vestager an Weihnachten serviert? Entenbraten, Schweinebraten, dreierlei Arten Kartoffeln, zwei Sorten Kohl und ein vegetarisches Gericht. Wer kocht? Alle zusammen. Haben Sie in diesem Jahr Geschenke bei Amazon bestellt? Nein! Was ist das sch\u00f6nste Geschenk, das man nicht kaufen kann? Zeit. Oder Liebe? Auch an ihr wird man scheitern, wenn man denkt, man k\u00f6nne sie kaufen.</p><p>Y wie Youth</p><p>M\u00fcssen wir uns um die Jugend Europas Sorgen machen? Warum sollten wir? Die Jugend ist uns um L\u00e4ngen voraus! Ich f\u00fcrchte, es sind meine Generation und die noch \u00c4lteren, die jedwedem Wandel im Weg stehen ? und das nicht nur, was die Herausforderungen des Klimawandels angeht! Die j\u00fcngere Generation trinkt nicht, raucht nicht, treibt mehr Sport, ist weniger gewaltt\u00e4tig, weniger korrupt ? und ern\u00e4hrt sich deutlich ges\u00fcnder. Kurz gesagt: Die Jungen sind auf Spur! Hatte Greta Recht, als sie mahnte: ?How dare you?? Wir alle k\u00f6nnen von den J\u00fcngeren lernen. Die Jugend hat Greta, wir hatten Interrail: Was haben Sie auf den Reisen durch Europa gelernt? Das Gef\u00fchl, Teil von etwas Gro\u00dfem sein zu d\u00fcrfen ? selbst nachts, wenn man sich an irgendeinem Bahnhof als Gruppe findet, sich austauscht und f\u00fcreinander da ist.</p><p>Z wie Zuckerberg</p><p>Sind Sie bereit, auch Mark Zuckerbergs gr\u00f6\u00dfter Albtraum zu werden? Ich bevorzuge, niemandes gr\u00f6\u00dfter Albtraum zu sein. Darf ich mich dennoch f\u00fcr Ihren Einsatz bedanken? Wieso, das Gespr\u00e4ch hat doch Spa\u00df gemacht.</p><p>Mitarbeit: Eric Bonse</p><p>?Die entscheidende Frage lautet: Wie k\u00f6nnen wir sicherstellen, dass die Menschen selbst entscheiden k\u00f6nnen, was mit ihren Daten geschieht??</p><p>1 Die Kommissarin Margrethe Vestager, im April 1968 geboren, aufgewachsen in einem Pastorenhaushalt in Westj\u00fctland, politisiert in der Partei Radikale Venstre, mitgegr\u00fcndet vom Ururgro\u00dfvater</p><p>2 Das Berlaymont Der Hauptsitz der EU-Kommission, Donnerstagmorgen im Dezember, 8.40 Uhr.

The bloc's competition commissioner talks endlessly about how she is turning Brussels into a self-proclaimed regulatory superpower and how she's the only person willing to stand up to the power of Big Tech, dishing out fines so huge they are now a major source of EU revenues. Vestager is the closest thing the European Commission has to a superstar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there is a problem. It is increasingly becoming clear that she is also out of control and that her frequently illegal decisions, and her absurd faith in the power of regulation, are doing huge damage to the European economy.\u00a0</p><h>The courts row back</h><p>Last week, the EU's second-highest court overturned her decision of four years ago to block the merger of the O2 and Three mobile networks in Britain. There were, it concluded, \"errors of law\" in the decision and the EU had failed to prove that consumers would be harmed. That is not the first time Vestager has been overruled by the EU's own courts. Last year an order to make Starbucks pay back (EURO)30m in taxes to the Netherlands was overturned. Many more appeals are making their way through the legal system. Google is fighting back against the fines it has been forced to pay and the changes demanded to its business model. Apple is fighting back against the vast fine levied on it for basing its operations in Ireland. Legal experts argue both cases have a good chance of success.\u00a0</p><p>Many of Vestager's decisions are simply bizarre. It is hard to understand why Apple's tax arrangements were a \"competition\" issue rather than, er, a tax one. Likewise, the EU's insistence that Amazon and Google somehow harm competition won't make much sense to consumers or businesses. Open search and sales platforms have made most markets much more competitive than they used to be and price competition is often so brutal that it is virtually impossible for anyone to make any money.</p><p>Meanwhile, a few favourite European companies appear to be able to do anything they want to. Germany's massive bail out of the airline Lufthansa, along with a block on any foreign takeovers, appears to have been just fine with the Commission. Competition laws are being suspended to prevent Chinese takeovers, while Volkswagen's manipulation of diesel emissions, probably the worst corporate scandal of the last decade, doesn't seem to have prompted any serious criticism from Brussels.\u00a0</p><h>Industrial strategy by the back door</h><p>In truth, Vestager has been waging a campaign to use competition policy to create a European industrial strategy. But it isn't obvious that people in Europe want an industrial strategy cooked up in Brussels and even if they did they probably couldn't agree on what it should be. Her war on technology more often seems waged on behalf of old vested interests than for consumers. Perhaps most seriously of all, Vestager's insistence that Europe can regulate its way to success is simply crazy. She makes a lot of noise about using the size of the European market to impose global regulatory standards that companies everywhere will have to follow. But while that might be great for the regulators in Brussels, it doesn't make the European economy any stronger.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Vestager herself comes under very little scrutiny. Before Brussels made her the most powerful regulator in the world, she was an obscure Danish minor-party politician who had never held a proper job and was shuffled off to the EU as part of a complex coalition deal. Danish voters never thought much of her, never mind voters anywhere else. It is as if we suddenly found Jo Swinson - remember her? - was in charge of European industry. A few of us might be scratching our heads and wondering how that happened. Vestager symbolises everything that is wrong with the EU. Unelected, unaccountable and out of control, it is hard to see how the continent can ever prosper with someone wielding so much power over the economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPMONW-httpsmoneyweekcomeconomyeueconomy601448margrethevestagerasymbolofallthatswrongwiththeeu</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPMONW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6030-FCK1-JB2G-R000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464402</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Dennis Publishing Ltd.

Seit einer halben Stunde sitzt die EU-Kommissarin f\u00fcr Wettbewerb bei der re:publica in Berlin-Kreuzberg auf der B\u00fchne. Die gro\u00dfe Konferenz rund ums Infotainment in der Digitalgesellschaft ist f\u00fcr Vestager die perfekte Gelegenheit, um ein paar Grunds\u00e4tzlichkeiten \u00fcber Fairness und Wettbewerb in der Facebook- und Google-Welt loszuwerden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Der Moderator hat die D\u00e4nin im Stil eines Marktschreiers als \u00c2,,Popstar der EU-Kommission\u00c2\" und eine der \u00c2,,gef\u00fcrchtetsten Frauen im Silicon Valley\u00c2\" angek\u00fcndigt. Doch was folgt, ist eine beh\u00e4bige Fragerunde. Das Interesse des Publikums am Gast aus Br\u00fcssel ist begrenzt, viele scrollen auf Smartphones durch ihre Mails und Twitter-Accounts. Bis es Vestager reicht. Sie wei\u00df, was ihre Fans im Auditorium h\u00f6ren wollen, sagt: \u00c2,,Ich glaube, viele hier teilen meine Frustration mit der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung: Es ist gut, dass wir diese digitalen B\u00fcrgerrechte jetzt haben. Aber es w\u00e4re noch sch\u00f6ner, wenn wir sie auch ausprobieren k\u00f6nnten.\u00c2\" Endlich horcht der Saal auf. Vestager legt nach: \u00c2,,Das h\u00e4tte jetzt aber einen viel, viel gr\u00f6\u00dferen Applaus geben m\u00fcssen.\u00c2\" Gel\u00e4chter, gel\u00f6ste Mienen, gro\u00dfer Applaus. Na also.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Handeln und Wandeln</p><p>Vestager ist es gewohnt, dass sie das Tempo und die Richtung bestimmt. Sie hat die Milliardenfusion von O2 und Hutchison abgelehnt und den Zusammenschluss der B\u00f6rsen in Frankfurt und London verhindert. Sie hat ein Lkw-Kartell zerschlagen und die in Berlin und Paris erw\u00fcnschte Zusammenlegung der Bahnsparten von Siemens und Alstom abgeblasen. Derzeit pr\u00fcft sie, ob deutsche Autobauer illegale Absprachen trafen, um die Einf\u00fchrung umweltfreundlicher Technologie zu verz\u00f6gern. Und nat\u00fcrlich legt sie sich immer wieder mit Big-Tech an.</p><p>2016 verdonnerte Vestager Apple zu einer Steuernachzahlung von 13 Milliarden Euro, die der US-Konzern im Mitgliedsland Irland zu wenig entrichtet hatte. Sie f\u00fchrte gleich drei Verfahren gegen Google: weil der Konzern Produkte seiner Tochterunternehmen bei Suchanfragen bevorzugte, weil Google \u00fcber sein Handybetriebssystem Android seine Suchmaschine zum Standard machte und weil Google seine marktbeherrschende Stellung missbrauchte. Am Ende standen Milliardenstrafen.</p><p>Seit Wochen denkt Vestager laut \u00fcber eine Zerschlagung von Facebook nach, wenn auch als \u00c2,,last resort\u00c2\" der EU-Kartellpolitik. Und sie untersucht, ob Amazon die Daten von kleinen Verk\u00e4ufern auf seiner Handelsplattform missbraucht, um sich ihnen gegen\u00fcber einen unrechtm\u00e4\u00dfigen Vorteil zu verschaffen. Man m\u00fcsse dar\u00fcber nachdenken, sagt Vestager, ob diese Daten wirklich Amazon geh\u00f6rten \u00c2- oder ob es daf\u00fcr nicht eine quasistaatliche, unabh\u00e4ngige Daten-Verwaltungs-Agentur br\u00e4uchte.</p><p>Vestagers Handeln, ihre Auftritte, beeindrucken viele. Von der Netzelite wird sie gefeiert, von Konzernchefs gef\u00fcrchtet, von Politikern bewundert, von Journalisten gew\u00fcrdigt, inzwischen auch in den USA. F\u00fcr den \u00c2,,Atlantic\u00c2\" ist sie \u00c2,,the most important technocrat of the century\u00c2\", f\u00fcr das \u00c2,,Wall Street Journal\u00c2\" die \u00c2,,Regulatorin des Silicon Valley\u00c2\", f\u00fcr \u00c2,,Foreign Policy\u00c2\" eine der zehn einflussreichsten \u00c2,,globalen Denkerinnen\u00c2\" der vergangenen zehn Jahre. Selbst US-Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump, dessen Europakenntnisse sich oft darauf beschr\u00e4nken, dass er Belgien f\u00fcr eine \u00c2,,wundersch\u00f6ne Stadt\u00c2\" h\u00e4lt, huldigt Vestager fast ehrf\u00fcrchtig als \u00c2,,tax lady\u00c2\".</p><p>Weltweit ist der Name Vestager in den vergangenen Monaten fast schon zu einem Synonym geworden f\u00fcr die Selbstbehauptung Europas \u00c2- f\u00fcr eine EU, die sich als Hort einer regelbasierten Wirtschaft begreift, als ordnungspolitische Alternative zum vulg\u00e4ren Nationalkapitalismus in den USA und zum Kaderkapitalismus in China.</p><p>Liberale Regierungschefs, darunter Frankreichs Staatspr\u00e4sident Emmanuel Macron, verhehlen nicht, dass sie sich die D\u00e4nin als Nachfolgerin von EU-Kommissionspr\u00e4sident Jean-Claude Juncker w\u00fcnschen. Auch Kanzlerin Angela Merkel sch\u00e4tzt ihre Sachkenntnis und Entschlossenheit.</p><p>Bauchgef\u00fchl und Kopfkritik</p><p>Und doch ist Vestagers Kr\u00f6nung nicht sicher. Nicht nur wird immer wieder Kritik laut am F\u00fchrungsstil der Kommissarin. Auch sind zuletzt eine Reihe ihrer so popul\u00e4ren Entscheidungen von Gerichten wieder kassiert worden. Vor allem aber gestaltet sich das Personal-Puzzle nach der Wahl zusehends schwierig. Zu viele Posten sind neu zu besetzen, zu viele Proportionalit\u00e4ten zu ber\u00fccksichtigen: Wer leitet k\u00fcnftig die Europ\u00e4ische Zentralbank? Wer wird Hoher Au\u00dfenbeauftragter? Eine Chance auf den Top-Job hat Vestager wohl nur, wenn sich Macron und Merkel auf sie verst\u00e4ndigen \u00c2- und das Europaparlament davon abl\u00e4sst, nur Spitzenkandidaten als Kommissionschef zuzulassen. Vestager ist eben das nicht. Und ihre liberale Fraktion mit ziemlicher Sicherheit nicht st\u00e4rkste Kraft im Parlament.</p><p>Es ist ein Dilemma: Alle sind sich einig, dass niemand in Europa der liberalen D\u00e4nin derzeit das Wasser reicht, wenn es um wertegeleitete Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit und Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit geht, um Sachinteresse und Tatkraft. Dennoch hat sie ihre Zukunft nicht mehr selbst in der Hand.</p><p>Wer Vestager trifft, erlebt eine zuvorkommende, h\u00f6fliche Frau, die doch ihr Selbst- und Machtbewusstsein kaum verhehlen kann. Nat\u00fcrlich, argumentiert Vestager, gehe es im Kampf gegen die \u00dcbermacht der Valley-Konzerne nie nur um ein paar Milliarden Euro. Sondern darum, wer die \u00c2,,Regeln f\u00fcr das n\u00e4chste Jahrhundert\u00c2\" setzt: Facebook und Google \u00c2- oder sie, Margrethe Vestager, im Interesse von 500 Millionen Europ\u00e4ern.</p><p>Die Kommissarin agiert, anders als ihr Vorg\u00e4nger Joaqu\u00c3\u00adn Almunia, mit einer Mischung aus politischer Feinf\u00fchligkeit und Unnachgiebigkeit: um Popularit\u00e4t bem\u00fcht, ohne populistisch zu sein. Sie ignoriert in ihren Reden Europas Radikale, weil sie sie in der Minderheit wei\u00df, sie nicht durch Aufmerksamkeit aufwerten will. Stattdessen lobt sie Europa als den \u00c2,,besten Platz zum Leben\u00c2\", auch wenn verst\u00e4ndlich sei, warum sich viele Menschen von der EU abwendeten: Br\u00fcssel sei oft zu kompliziert, gewiss, zu un\u00fcbersichtlich. Br\u00fcssel habe ein \u00c2,,Ort der L\u00f6sungen, nicht des Streits\u00c2\" zu sein.</p><p>Kopenhagen, ein regnerischer Freitag, zwei Wochen vor der Europawahl. Margrethe Vestager hat sich einen schwarz-neongelben Schutzanzug \u00fcber ihr farbfroh-gebl\u00fcmtes Seidenkleid gezogen und im Yachthafen, gleich hinter der Meerjungfrau, ein Speedboat bestiegen. Es geht zum Europe Youth Summit, ein Politik-Festival, das auf der k\u00fcnstlichen Insel im Hafen der d\u00e4nischen Hauptstadt 200 Jugendliche versammelt.</p><p>Merkel oder Macron w\u00e4ren wohl mit dem Helikopter eingeflogen. Doch das passt nicht zum Auftritt der 51-J\u00e4hrigen. Sie will ein neues, kraftvolles, dynamisches Europa verk\u00f6rpern, sich dabei buchst\u00e4blich Wind und Wetter stellen. Und so steht sie, kaum angekommen, den Regen noch im kurzen, grauen, markant geschnittenen Haar, schon auf dem Kai und gibt Interviews, ruft wenig sp\u00e4ter, den Jugendlichen im Saal zu: \u00c2,,Es war meine Generation, die nicht verstanden hat, was der Klimawandel bedeutet. Wir brauchen euch, um Europa den richtigen Weg zu weisen. Wir brauchen euch, um unsere gemeinsame Zukunft zu bauen.\u00c2\" Frenetischer Applaus. Ovationen im Stehen. Vestager \u00c2,,rockt\u00c2\", sagt einer der Organisatoren.</p><p>Sie hat das: ein Gesp\u00fcr f\u00fcr Situationen und Stimmungen. Kann sich in junge Menschen ebenso hineinversetzen wie in Professoren. Als die Mutter dreier Kinder Anfang Februar einen H\u00f6rsaal an der Universit\u00e4t Cambridge betritt, liest sie den Raum wie eines ihrer Kommissionspapiere. Sie sucht den Blickkontakt zu den Zuh\u00f6rern, saugt die Stimmung auf, sagt dann, noch bevor sie \u00fcber die neuen Herausforderungen f\u00fcr das EU-Wettbewerbsrecht referiert: \u00c2,,Ich biete Ihnen heute einen Brexit-freien Moment an.\u00c2\" Sto\u00dfartig, als h\u00e4tte jemand gut gel\u00fcftet, weicht die Spannung aus dem Raum, macht Platz f\u00fcr eine lockere, offene Debatte.</p><p>Bauchgef\u00fchl ist ihr politischer Kompass, ihr Instinkt legend\u00e4r. Als Vestager in Br\u00fcssel ankam, dachte sie dar\u00fcber nach: Wie f\u00fchre ich am besten die Generaldirektion Wettbewerb? Am Ende, sagt sie, sei ihr \u00c2,,nichts wirklich Gutes\u00c2\" eingefallen. \u00c2,,Also habe ich es gemacht wie immer.\u00c2\" Auf die \u00c2,,skandinavische Art\u00c2\": Jeder kann in seiner Rolle zum Erfolg beitragen. Hierarchie ist nicht so wichtig. Die T\u00fcr steht offen.</p><p>Supermacht und Kontrollverlust</p><p>Bei ihren Beamten kommt das gut an. Vestager schenkt ihnen schon mal pers\u00f6nlich Kaffee ein, h\u00f6rt gut zu, durchdringt die Themen, gibt ihren Leuten das Gef\u00fchl, wichtig zu sein. Doch sie kann auch anders. Lob verteilt sie gerne pers\u00f6nlich, Tadel indes l\u00e4sst sie \u00fcberbringen \u00c2- oder wird ihn vor versammelter Mannschaft los. Wie beim deutschen Juristen Johannes Laitenberger, ihrem obersten Beamten, den sie vor der Truppe zurechtwies, weil er auf Fachtagungen zu explizit angedeutet hatte, in welche Richtung sich die Kommission in Sachen Wettbewerbsrecht bewegen k\u00f6nnte. Sie sei die Kommissarin, beschied Vestager ihm. Sie verbreite Neuigkeiten. Niemand sonst.</p><p>Den Job erledigen. Die \u00d6ffentlichkeit wissen lassen, dass man ihn erledigt. Gut, gewissenhaft, kraftvoll. Der Rest kommt von allein. Das ist Vestagers Machtgeheimnis.</p><p>Wenngleich es daran auch Kritik gibt. Als sie gleich nach der Amts\u00fcbernahme 2014 den ersten Google-Fall neu aufrollte und dekretierte, der US-Konzern habe Wettbewerber in seiner Shopping-Suchmaschine prominent zu listen, da gab es daf\u00fcr viel Applaus. Laut Vestager hat sich seither einiges getan, kommen kleinere Google-Wettbewerber zum Zug. Kritiker aber monieren, dass Google sich nicht an die Auflagen halte, \u00c2,,Vestager will das Thema aussitzen\u00c2\" , so Fairsearch, eine Anti-Google-Lobbygruppe.</p><p>Auch andere prominente F\u00e4lle haken. Das EU-Gericht, die Instanz unter dem Europ\u00e4ischen Gerichtshof, hob zuletzt eine Serie von Vestagers Entscheidungen wieder auf, kam etwa zu dem Schluss, dass Belgien mit seinen Steuerrabatten f\u00fcr multinationale Konzerne nicht das EU-Recht verletze, wie von Vestager festgestellt. Das Urteil best\u00e4tigt jene Juristen, die davon ausgehen, dass auch Vestagers 13-Milliarden-Steuer-Nachforderung an Apple nicht Bestand haben wird.</p><p>Vestager ficht das nicht an. Ihre D\u00e4nen sind ohnehin stolz auf die machtbewusste Kommissarin. Margarethe die Dritte nennen sie Vestager hier, als w\u00e4re sie eine Nachfahrin der K\u00f6nigin. Schon als Vize-Premier schrieb man ihr mehr Einfluss zu als der damaligen Regierungschefin Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Diesen \u00c2,,Machtinstinkt\u00c2\" habe sie in Br\u00fcssel gesch\u00e4rft, sagt eine alte Weggef\u00e4hrtin. Auch viele Europ\u00e4er w\u00fcnschen sich eine furchtlosere EU mit einer resoluten Kommissionsspitze. Und es ist kein Geheimnis, dass Vestager sich die Juncker-Nachfolge zutrauen w\u00fcrde. Als \u00d6konomin verf\u00fcgt sie auch theoretisch \u00fcber das R\u00fcstzeug, um Europa im Systemwettbewerb richtig zu verorten, gerade gegen\u00fcber China. Dort gebe es \u00c2,,noch viel Spielraum f\u00fcr Europa, hartn\u00e4ckiger zu sein, etwa beim globalen Handel\u00c2\", sagt Vestager. Das sei wohl ein Job f\u00fcr die Kommissionsspitze. Ein Job f\u00fcr sie.</p><p>Ist Vestager am Ende die richtige Frau, zur richtigen Zeit \u00c2- nur in der falschen Partei? Um wirklich etwas zu \u00e4ndern, sagt Margrethe Vestager gerne, auch an die Adresse der Regierungschefs gerichtet, m\u00fcsse man sich selbst \u00fcberwinden. \u00c2,,Das ist das Mutigste, was ein Mensch tun kann.\u00c2\"</p><p>Damit das geschieht, muss es jedoch gl\u00fccklich laufen f\u00fcr sie: am Sonntag in Europa. Und bei den Wahlen in D\u00e4nemark Anfang Juni. Und auch wenn es derzeit nicht danach aussieht, als ob Vestagers liberale Partei der n\u00e4chsten Koalition in Kopenhagen angeh\u00f6ren wird \u00c2- vielleicht hilft ihr am Ende der Br\u00fcsseler Erfolg. \u00c2,,Ich bin in Kopenhagen beliebt, weil ich nicht hier bin\u00c2\", sagt sie.</p><p>In Europa ist es eher umgekehrt: Sie macht sich bei den Richtigen unbeliebt \u00c2- und man freut sich, dass sie in Br\u00fcssel ist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WRTONL-WW_2437251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRTONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6C-FT11-JDTJ-X4BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">430692</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1963\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Handelsblatt GmbH - ein Unternehmen der Verlagsgruppe Handelsblatt GmbH &amp; Co.

We just have the video which I think sets the scene both for this session and the one after. Big picture view of technology but I suspect our job is to get down the nitty-gritty.  </p><p>      We have you in front of us possibly the most frightening women to big pet, the E.U. Commissioner. You find Google, you chase and live Apple tax bill, now you've announced an early stage probe into Amazon.  </p><p>      And I wondered what the aim about was? I know you came to stress that you want to encourage investment but what exactly you're looking as on Apple -- on Amazon?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well Amazon is a --it's a two sided of market. They have dual functions. They both host the little guy, so can he can enter into e-commerce. They provide a number of services which allows also smaller businesses to be active e-commerce and to grab the opportunities and that's great.   </p><p>      There are also big guy themselves, bookstore, you know, everything, groceries, movies, the works. And they of course get all the data from the little guy and we want to understand how these data is being used. Because this is all about competition. Because when we say innovation, well, competition is the most important driver for innovation for you to stay ahead of you competitor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  Would you think the future is a bit like telecom companies or maybe what happened was Microsoft many years ago where you have a platform company which is then force to let other people trade and have access to that platform.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, I think that's very difficult to say because as it was just set in the video this is a -- this is a revolution, things changed. And we haven't even what is coming with quantum computing, blockchains, sort of really pulling of.   </p><p>      So, we probably have a platform economy that's much more diverse than what we have seen, which is why of course it's important for us to understand, well, what is the new big? How companies that benefit from network effects from huge amount of data, from marginal cost approaching zero, how do they compete? And for us that, of course, is the important thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  Do you think in some ways competition lower is being left behind by big tech? You have these companies where you talked about network effects. It is very difficult to intervene until of that they have created this a space there in monopoly and some people would see them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  I think -- I think our principles are fine because they are about human nature and rhythm change, unfortunately. With all our good sides and bad sides, I think we remain the same. But of course in the regulation we need to stay alert, because you can be big. In Europe, you can be successful. But you should misuse your power.  </p><p>      This is actually the story of the two Google fines. Very successful, very welcome in Europe but we find that they misused their power for competitive not be as innovative as they ought to, for consumers not to be able to enjoy the benefits of choice, innovation, affordable prices. And that of course is where we have to be very, very vigilant.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  And isn't it the Google thing of an example of what I just said, you know, it took you seven years in tech. Seven years is a lifetime.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Yes, part of that is part of the game because there is an asymmetry in every kind of law enforcement. Because (INAUDIBLE) it takes five minutes to break into to your home. It will take the police and the court system quite some time to find the guilty person, to get him or her convicted in its way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  That's with not seven years?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  No, but you still have responsibility to do process. Because we live in a union base under the rule of law and we will never ever compromise on your right to defend yourself. That being said, of course, we can use algorithms too. We can too use all the tools of the digital world in order for us to be more speedy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  Do you thing tech homes of simply become too big in some cases?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  No I don't as such that you can make that conclusion but I think they can be much more transparent. My colleagues have made, I think very, very, good proposals to ensure transparency in the relationship between the smaller business and the platform and that I think is very much needed to transparency, the willingness actually to deal with people. And to be much more sort of clear that they respect your privacy, your ownership of your own data so that we are citizen feel that we can built trust with technology.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  And do you thing (INAUDIBLE) scenario where the EU could take a lead?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, I think the rights that are now much more clear. If you own your data, that you have a right to be forgotten, that you have a right to know what is out there with you that you have for ability so you can move your data.  </p><p>      I think in not only having the rules but also implementing the rules. Of course, this is something that's important for us as Europeans. And we do hope that we can inspire around the world because I think that respect of a citizen is what builds trust.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  But you know what some people in this audience will think specially Americans, they will think, look, this is Europe doesn't have any big tech companies or circling enough from the scale the America does and that China is where we surely see.  </p><p>      And this is Europe just trying to pull back America. Do you think that what is your -- what is your analysis to that suspicion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  What I think the reason why business in Europe is because they do very good business. And you see a number of the US companies they are dominant in the European markets and they are more than welcome to be that.  </p><p>      An when you see, look at our tax growths, because you're more than welcome as a European members states within or outside of union so set your own level of corporate taxation. But you're not supposed to handout specific favors that be to Apple or to Starbucks or to some of the European companies where we've seen that happen as well.  </p><p>      It's not about your flag. It's not about whether you're privately a publicly earned. It's about your competitors spirit. You're supposed to compete for you business in Europe.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  And when you look at these new cases you're taking on, do you look back to old cases like IBM many yeas ago or Microsoft, and trying to see there's sort of like inspiration for this? Are there lessons you can learn from past periods of antitrust?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  I think there's an important lesson of that speed as you just said. Because if things takes forever then it's not the antitrust enforcement that sort of make sure that what we do as authorities leave sufficient room for all the many, many, many businesses who compete by the book who do their best, scale them for years, trying to make it in the marketplace. They should know, of course, that justice is sufficiently fast for them to enjoy a competitive marketplace.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  Do you think there's something different about technology with government now? You look at other industries and government can leave them alone and these sort of industries there is a tendency as you said because of network affects towards having monopolies, towards having that form of effect. And so in some way, is government to rethink.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  I think in order to be able to do that we have to work with the fact everything did utilizes. Agriculture, health, administration, everything digitalizes. So, if you want to accommodate and make a good business environment for that, of course, you have to be able to understand it. And this is why the partnership with business in order how to get that right. That's important for us. That's important for government.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  Well, a very quick last question, (INAUDIBLE) because you mentioned in earlier and Theresa May did -- she talks about Britain now having the lowest corporation tax. Do you think that is a good way to negotiate with the Europe Union?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well it doesn't change much because also within the union in the very basic treaties are some member state, you have the right to set your level of corporate taxation, and that, you can do within the union or outside of the union.   </p><p>      What we don't want within the union is that member states puts money in one business pocket not allowing anyone else to have the same thing, because that's not fair competition. But on the level of corporate taxation, you can compete within and without the European Union.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICKLETHWAIT</emphasis>:  Thank you very much commissioner.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC4-SYK1-JDPT-T2JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Coming up, Margrethe Vestager goes to Washington.  It is her job to keep big tech in check.  The European Commissioner for Competition joins us for a wide ranging interview.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  But first to our lead, European regulators are stepping up their pressure on U.S. Tech companies with European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager at the helm.  The E.U. has announced massive fines against Apple and Google.  </p><p>      This week, she's in the U.S. visiting her American counterpart as well as tough political leaders.  So what is on the agenda?  I want to get straight now to my colleague David Gura who is in Washington. David, take it away.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Emily, thank you very much.  Commissioner Vestager, thank you very much for your time this afternoon, always very busy day for you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Great to be with you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Let me start by asking about the meetings that you had today that you met with folks with FTC in the Department of Justice. Just share if you could, the substance of those conversation.  What were you talking to those kind of reports events today?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, we don't share the substance.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Because very often, we have the opportunity just to takes trunk (ph) of open cases.  And since they're open, of course, this is not something that we can share with the wider audience.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Keeping that what we've read in the news about making fees of these departments, the fact that you have people in an intern basis feeling a lot of these rules at the FTC at the Department of Justice. Is that nearly a frustration or is that proven to be difficult as you work with counterparts across the Atlantic area?  Is it somehow different not having permit political appointees in place to these organizations?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well maybe to some degree in the beginning I wonder, but now I got to know both Maureen Ohasen (ph) and Venderfrench Rutherwell (ph).  I met a couple of times and there is such a strong culture, a very concrete cooperation between the case teams because they share this culture of serving the consumer in the market.  And therefore, you know, it is very concrete.  It's very directed.  It's a very good corporation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  According to this (ph), give me some insight into that cooperation.  You're doing your investigations, working on your own cases that's happening here in U.S. as well.  What's the ideal relationship like between your office and the FTC say with the Department of Justice?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, to some degree, actually we have a different legal basis.  So it's not just all just the same.  But with the necessary wavers and businesses, we can discuss an exchange to test hypothesis about would this be a competition concern?  How do you see this?  </p><p>      So the case team, they called each other.  Sometimes they come together.  We have had a U.S., people coming over for somewhat we're hearings.  We go here.  It's something you can create happening.  So it's quite into twins.  Of course, very respectful of the differences but also they're concrete on making it right.  I guess you have very high quality in the case works.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  A question to you as an observer of this place, I think you and I last spoke, you were here after the election.  So you've spent some time in D.C..  Does the train look different from you? Does the rhetoric about anti-trust for instance or computational regulations sound different coming to Washington now seven, eighth months into this president's throne?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, I -- if you could see, there is a renewed interests, more debates.  I saw it over the -- in the election campaign.  There is a sort of -- I think there is more debate that how to make sure that consumers is a well-served.  How to make sure that you have right in competition, because competition is a driver not only for low prices and choice but also for innovation to be able to in the future to produce affordable prices and choice and a lots of going on here.  And I find out they're very inspiring.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  A couple of days ago since senators on Capitol Hill proposed an emergency (ph) from enforcement, senator Amy Klobuchar among them.  And the point that she was making as I understand is the rules, the policies were outdated.  We need to refresh them.  Taking as a broad perspective on that, when you look at policy, enforcement policy broadly speaking, that need to be updated, do you think?  Do you feel that policy haven't get step with where things when it comes to technology say?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, for obvious reason, I've been looking at the European Situation.  And of course, we've been off guard sort of the same question because markets are developing very fast.  Things are changing.  Tech introduce life session, it's forming out society.  But I find that our basic rules, they're fine because some of the narratives, were there the same.  </p><p>      It's great.  It's fear combine with power that can be a very, very strong combination.  And we can do with us.  Our challenge is of course to keep our chores sharp.  And also to develop new tools because we have to be a skilled when it comes to going through massive amounts of data as anyone else.  And that of course is the challenge but we accept it to develop with the phase of the market participants.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Which one do that cooperation help problematic if you guys are not on the same page?  I think when you have been or with Albert (ph), and that was huge for instance, when you look at call coming the next day, and you're in different counts, it seems like what kind of problems does that post if any when you and U.S. are doing the same page?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, exactly.  In this example that certainly mentioned should be seen because we're not done yet.  But it happens quite rarely.  When it happens, I think very often, they are very concrete reasons that the market situation is not the same.  The market participants play different roles.  So very often I find that you have adaptive reasons when we divide in how we look at, let's say, other case.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  How do you use that the advocacy of what you're doing?  I think we first spoke after you left into that's fund on Apple, the 13 billion Euros.  Have you started to see changes as a result of that? Do you see companies where reconsidering -- publicly reconsidering, privately talking about the way that they apply their taxes.  We're going to pay their taxes because they have an affect in the way companies, that work with policy perspective?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, yes I think that change is coming.  It is slow because it take sometime and I think it will be far so when our courts have that with the cases.  But you also see members states starting themselves to change the legislation.  In Luxembourg and try first on the financing companies, in Ireland on the legislation allowing for what we called a double Irish which is being out phase.  </p><p>      And then of course, the legislative phase in Europe Union as a such has also a changed.  There is much more bigger.  And member say, it's a much more ready to say, well, we want the level flying field. And we want our tax priorities to work together in order to get it right because we see so many businesses.  They pay their taxes exactly as one would expect.  That do not just be for the many, it should be for everyone.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  You speak today with North of Kremlin looking to buy orbital ATK.  You're seeing a lot of consolidation of very big companies reducing the size of the plain field.  There are number of sectors that there are on space, your defense.  Is that inherently a problematic thing?  Does it raise concerns to see big companies merging, acquiring and the field of players becoming smaller?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, it always depends because sometimes we see that it may be possible for a merger to enable -- there were process to consumers that efficiency is going to be passed on to consumers.  So we never have sort of an opinion beforehand.  We go into the analysis with an open mind to make sure that also post merger, that consumers will be real tough (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Just to assume inside if you're willing to -- how do you decide which case is to take up with the processes like it leads to investigation of the opening of the case.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, merges, they just knocking our door, so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Yes.  And that's been the many times to have fun. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Yes.  So those, we just do head on.  In the anti-trust cases, for instance the council investigation, we would start sort of looking into under the radar to see, is there something here?  Then we may due an announce inspections to see, well, is there evidence to supports our hypothesis.  And then eventually, we were send me an update if we find that we have a strong case.  </p><p>      It is of course for any company, very troublesome to be in the search slide of -- into trust investigation.  So we are very careful to make sure that we find -- that we have a strong case.  That doesn't mean that we have anything brought up preliminary, look in a case when we start it.  But of course it has to be something serious.  Otherwise we shouldn't do it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  There is a perception here, rightly or wrong, whether you're targeting American companies.  I look back at the Google fine of recent weeks, a two billion Euros.  It seems to give risk to those who think that you are going after American companies.  </p><p>      I mentioned a lot of what you're doing here when you trouble to the U.S. as explaining yourself in the process and what companies you're looking at.  What do you say to somebody who does suggest that? Who feels as though you are unfairly seeking out of American companies through action?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, I take this very seriously.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Because by and as no place, no home in European anti- trust.  It would be completely legitimatizing what we are doing because the point is that you have a single market.  It's open for business but it's not open for bending the rules deciding the prices in the back office.  And we also actually do have the statistics on our side when you look at mergers or anti-trust enforcement.  </p><p>      You do not find any kind of U.S. files.  And that of course is a very, very important because it is not the flock of the company, the ownership of the company.  It's the behavior in the markets that we concerned with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  All right, let's come back and talk a bit about Google in particular if we can lead much more.  Much more with Commissioner Vestager coming up on Bloomberg Technology, this is Bloomberg.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology, I'm Emily Chang. Let's get back to Washington with Bloomberg, David Gura who's standing by with the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager who was auditive to the United States.  David, take it away.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Emily, thank you very much again.  Let's get into Google a little bit here.  I think a lot of people are good to serve that issue in particular.  Google has 10 days as I understand to comply with the rule in the issue a few weeks back.  What are you hoping to see by then?  Have you seen a draft at this point?  Do you have any sense of what Google's going to try to do with regard to shopping?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Yes, now it seemed to be nine days ago.  We took the decision that we have found that Google is dominant in the European market of general search.  And that Google has been misusing this very strong and dominant position to promote itself and what the Google shopping products and to demotes competitors.  </p><p>      On average, you would find competitors on page four in a such result.  And the U.S. can also sell, well, how often do I go there? While you were always finding glue shopping top left corner in the best placement.  And the decision says that you have to try a principle of eco-treatment between go shopping and competitors because you're dominant.  </p><p>      And now, we talked to Google to figure out on how to this. Because this is the only way to make a remedy future proof, because assigned will change, screen sizes well change.  Everything will change.  But we still need this to be adhered to.  So of course we remains to be seen how Google will leave up to this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  At Bloomberg, as reporting today that the Google is proposing certain option system.  They would sell space to rival companies.  And that something I proposed in 2013.  That with another, can you confirm that that case that they uploaded out as an idea?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Yes, we got the first draft to what they were thinking.  I think in that two weeks ago.  So we got to ruled outlined about what they're thinking.  But the thing is that, it's not for us to prove, it is for Google to find a way to leave up to legislation. And this is of course, very important because if Google does not leave up to the decision then hen we will sort of investigating.  Well, what is the situation and is competition still home (ph) so that consumers have best of choices that they would otherwise have.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  So if come to 29th of September or however many days after you're not satisfied, but when does finding start?  When do you begin to calculate and assess fines against Google if they hadn't meet the burden that you'd like them to meet?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, actually we can sort of back date the fine so that it will start from the first day that we fine that there's been a none-compliance with the decision.  So obviously if we find, for instance not compared -- market competitors that complain, the consumers may complain to say, well, this is not what it was supposed to be.  </p><p>      If we find a reason, we will start investigating and then we can free date the fines if we find that there is a bridge of the following up in the decision.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Can you give us any sense of the time table here with these two other Google cases.  It was the absence case in the Android case as well.  How close you to resolution of those two?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, they are very different.  The two cases because the absence case concerns placement they've asked on third party sites.  And whether or not, that market was foreclosed.  The Android cases, how Android is used to stay dominant also when we all go mobile.  So that's sort of the experience from the box when you open the box of, you know, phone is a Google experience.  </p><p>      We treat both cases as high priority cases, but it's very difficult to say when we will be able to take a final decision.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  And so which is farther long in the other, or they both kind of proceeding in tandem?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, as I said, they are different, so we have two cases and I don't know if they're competing as well.  But we will put a lot of efforts into this because it is important for all market participants to know what will be final decision.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Couple of months ago, we speak with Dara Khosrowshahi who is then the head of Expedia.  He's now of course at Uber and he was expressing concern about Google with regard to travel services.  When you look at the name (ph) with apparatus with this Google, are there other parts of the business that concern you with, it might lead to investigations?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Well, we have quite a lot of the complaints on other verticals.  And the thing is that with the Google shopping decision, having a stuff, of course, the Google is dominant in general search. And when the company is dominant, well obviously competition is already weakened a little if you hold 90 percent of the market, and this is where the special responsibility comes from that you should -- and you should used your powers and your own market on neighboring markets.  </p><p>      So this gives us another starting point looking at travel or locals.  So in that respective, we still take a strong interest in Google behavior, and this now the markets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  I asked you the Apple tech's case it was that our companies to adjust.  In the context of Google, you've let with this two billion Euro fine, have you seen that company begin to change its ways to work with your office to personal (ph) further finding of that company in particular.  Is there a dialog between you and the company I guess?  It's what I'm asking.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Oh yes, there is a dialogue and I find them to be very, very professional.  We don't agree on these issues, but I think it is important, no matter this agreement.  In here, we are talking about a decision by the commission on the fine.  I should say 2.4 billion Euros.  </p><p>      But it is s important to have a professional relationship because we want a change in market behavior to enable competition so that the market serve the consumer and then that hopefully, we can find a way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Commissioner Vestager, thank you very much for giving us your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VESTAGER</emphasis>:  Yes, thank you very much. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Appreciate it.  Margrethe Vestager joined me here at the E.U. Delegations headquarters in Washington.  Back to you Emily in San Francisco.    </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And how do you show that you actually meet your obligations?,' the commissioner said.</p><p>Ms Vestager's tough line on Big Tech has won her both admirers and political enemies on both sides of the Atlantic during her first term in Brussels. The commissioner levied more than pound 8bn in antitrust fines on Google and demanded that Apple cough up pound 13bn in an illegal state aid case.

'If we find cases where interim measures is the right tool to use, we will use it again.'</p><p>Among various ongoing inquiries, the commission was looking into Marketplace, Facebook's ecommerce app, and submitted a list of preliminary questions to the US company. 'We are still in the process of looking at the different answers, because obviously if we don't have a case, we don't have a case,' Ms Vestager said.</p><p>The commission has also set eyes on Apple Pay and it is exploring allegations that Wallet, the payment app on the iPhone, refuses to carry other payment apps.</p><p>Ms Vestager said the commission has also received calls from Google rivals to implement interim measures against the Silicon Valley company on Google Local and Google Travel, even though a probe is not imminent.</p><p>'I'd say sometimes, people ask for it, but sometimes, look at the Broadcom case, obviously, that was high priority, and yet, it takes a year before you get there,' she said.

At this point, you might be feeling a little overwhelmed. Technology is growing fast. Misinformation is spreading quicker, and our digital economy is controlled by tech giants. If you want to shop, you go to Amazon. Social media - head to Facebook or Instagram, which Facebook owns. Searching the Web - you Google it. What's missing in all of this? A choice in the services we use, something one woman is working very hard to change.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 My name is Margrethe Vestager. I am the European commissioner for competition.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 And Margrethe says it's tough to ensure the Internet is safe and fair if the playing field is skewed.             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 I work with competition law enforcement, making sure that companies don't do cartels.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 By cartels, she means businesses coming together to form monopolies.             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 You cannot buy yourself a nice cartel. You cannot come together as businesses in secrecy squeezing out your competitors.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 You probably don't know many EU commissioners, but you might know Margrethe as the woman who's been fining tech companies for not following European law.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1:                 Breaking news this morning.

You know...             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 The purpose is to ensure competition and innovation for the benefits of European consumers.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 And that, she says, is the key to building an Internet we can trust.             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 Part of building trust is that you know there is a consequence if someone betrays your trust and do something illegal, something that they shouldn't do. Because if it's without consequence to betray people's trust, well, then trust disappears. And I think that is what is eroding societies and democracies. We need trust to make our society work.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 In just a moment, Margrethe Vestager explains how she's working to build that trust. On the show today - writing new rules for our online lives. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR.             </p><p>                It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And on the show today - ideas about building trust in the internet.             </p><p>                We just heard from EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who says the best way to build that trust is to make competition fair. And to do that, Margrethe is looking to the past to the very first time that Europe built a fair marketplace across its borders.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 Let's go back to 1957 - Europe was destroyed.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 Here's Margrethe on the TED stage.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 A world war had emerged from Europe. The human suffering was unbelievable and unprecedented.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR:                 The sound of ruin is silence. The smell of ruin is sick with the scent of dead and dust.             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 In order to avoid Europe being sort of the cradle (ph) of a third world war, we have to do something radical. We have to work together in a different way.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR:                 Will there be peace or war?             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)                </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 Representatives from six European countries had come to Rome to sign the treaty that were to create the European Union. And one of the many building blocks was a common European market.             </p><p>                Part of the inspiration came from the U.S. because in the U.S., that was already sort of part of the societal contract for decades by the Sherman Act. So they took the inspiration from antitrust to say, well, you have to be innovative. You have to offer affordable prices, good service, high quality, come up with the latest.             </p><p>                So we put a frame around this market to control bad behavior, and within that framework, we say now go compete. Now let the market powers work so that the customers and consumers, they get the best of what a market can offer.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 So how unlikely was it that people would actually come together to agree on this standard set of rules?             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 Well, I think back then, it was almost a miracle because we have a history of fighting our neighbors.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 Coming together and agreeing, not only on values, but also how you put values into real life, that was a manmade miracle. And here, literally men because it was men who was writing these rules.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 But the thing is that it worked. Europe has been at peace ever since.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 But the key difference now is that we have a global economy that's driven by big tech companies, right? They have the highest valuations of any corporations. They operate around the world and on the Internet, and governments haven't really placed boundaries on them. So where are we now when we look back at 1957 in terms of applying those ideas?             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 Well, we still have some way to go, to say it mildly, but the fundamentals are the same. The reason why it was necessary to frame the market in this respect was human nature. And human nature doesn't change with digital technology because it's about greed and fear and power. Of course, we are profoundly challenged to fully grasp a fully digital economy because the dynamics are different from how it was in the old days, 10 years ago - also because we're in the midst sort of of breaking the fiction of the Web as a place of freedom.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 The Web is a very commercial place. It's a place where you also find some of the things that we have long, long time agreed on in the real world that we will not accept, like, you know, handing out bomb recipes, child abuse, incitement to terrorism. So there are temptations, there are conflicts, there are evil things that we'll have to deal with. And I think we are better off and much wiser if we look at the digital part of our society, of our market with the same eyes as we would look at the rest of the world because otherwise, I don't think that we can maintain democracy.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 So with that in mind, as commissioner, what sort of scenarios prompt you to do an investigation? Like, in my head, I'm thinking maybe small businesses who are selling their stuff on Amazon but struggling to compete with Amazon itself.             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 Exactly. And we do have an Amazon investigation in issues exactly as the one you just described. Because on the one hand side, it is great that small vendors can find a marketplace where they can be helped with shipping and payments and, you know, the things that makes it easy to do e-commerce. On the other hand side, it's not that good if the one who holds the marketplace also takes all the data that comes from your sale. And they have this information from all the vendors, then they themselves becomes an incredible competitor to you.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 Because imagine sort of an old-school marketplace where you have people coming in with their different products. You would never accept if the municipality who owned the marketplace had a giant shop where they would sell things that were similar to the products that the vendors who had paid for their stalls in the marketplace that they would sell. And there's a lot of parallels in sort of the real world where we have discussed in depth how we would like things to be and agreed upon it and enforced it over decades. And I think only because we have had this illusion of the Internets and the digital world being special and free and innovative, we have kind of let go of some of the things that were fundamental to us.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 So, clearly, small businesses benefit from your work, but what about the big guys? Some of them are kind of trying to beat you to the punch. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, for example, has said he wants to be regulated. Please, put framework around our company so we know when we're complying and not complying, he's basically said. Do you think that's just lip service?             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 Of course, I'm not in Mark Zuckerberg's head, but I think he's right that regulation is needed. But if you want regulation, you would also start with yourself. You would consider your business to say, well, I know it takes time for a regulator to get the legislation right, so I will start with myself to make sure that my fundamental values and the values reflected in the society where I do my business, that they are also reflected in the way I do business.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 Do you think that people are starting to understand that what happens online in the digital space really does affect what happens in the real world, that the two aren't that separate?             </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 I think so. I think slowly but surely.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER:                 For me, the important thing is that we live in a world with consequences, that be a digital world or a physical world or when the two things they kind of melt together as they do now. Just as there's no such thing as a free lunch, I'd say there's no such thing as a paradise without a snake.             </p><p>MANOUSH ZOMORODI:                 That's EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.

After years on the defensive against a worldwide \"techlash\" that threatened to break up their empires, tech giants have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">suddenly become essential services</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governments need them to control misinformation and track disease; citizens rely on them simply to work and stay sane; their rivals are drowning, while their own cash reserves are gigantic. Surely, then, this is their hour of domination?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not if Margrethe Vestager has anything to do with it. Asked whether she is concerned that American tech firms will exploit the coronavirus crisis to cement their power by snapping up rivals or conquering new markets, the European Union's top monopoly enforcer only retorts: \"Well, not with me!\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking to the Telegraph from the EU's hulking Berlaymont building in Brussels, now empty save for a tiny core of staff who are not working from home, the former Danish finance minister, who turned 52 this month, vows that her office will remain \"vigilant\". </p><p>\"We have not changed our perspective when it comes to the obligations of a dominant company,\" she says. \"If they do something that is illegal, we'll have to pursue those cases.\" Indeed, the EU is still pressing forward with new regulations - a necessity that she says the crisis only \"enhances\".</p><p>It is a strong signal from a woman who has already levied billions of dollars in fines against Big Tech. As the European Commission's competition minister since 2014, she has launched probes into Google, Apple and Amazon that drew the ire of Donald Trump (as well as a typical Trumpian sobriquet: \"the tax lady\"). </p><p>In December, under the new Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, she was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">promoted to oversee of all digital affairs</url>- widely taken as a sign that Brussels' war on Silicon Valley would only heat up.</p><p>Now there is a bigger battle. The fiscally unthinkable has become routine almost overnight, and state aid to private companies - a core target of Ms Vestager's office - is one of the only things keeping the European economy afloat. </p><p>The Commission has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">relaxed those rules</url>, pledging to do       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">\"whatever is necessary\"</url>, but member states are now squabbling over relief measures along the same north-south divide that bedevilled the last crash.</p><p>That makes Ms Vestager's work rather hectic. When she speaks to the Telegraph she has just finished eating a quick dinner microwaved in her office, where she also keeps a small ceramic sculpture of an upthrust middle finger to remind her that she can't please everybody.</p><p>Despite being in the hotseat for the Great Recession, she says this is like nothing she's faced: \"This doesn't compare to anything. It is unprecedented, historic in every respect.\" The risks, too, are \"quite profound\": hostile takeovers by powerful companies sensing opportunity in crisis, smaller companies desperate for a saviour, and hugely increased cybercrime and fraud.</p><p>One potential sign of the potential consolidation dangers is Facebook's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">recent deal with the Indian mobile giant Reliance Jio</url>. Facebook will pay $5.7bn (\u00a34.6bn), its largest ever single investment, for10pc of the biggest mobile operator in a country where it has long coveted expansion.</p><p>The crisis has also caused the US telecom firm Verizon to bite the bullet on a long-mooted acquisition of BlueJeans, a video-conferencing service and rival to the ascendant but vulnerable Zoom.</p><p>Ms Vestager, however, is keen to stress business as usual. She declines to be drawn on whether the pandemic actually increases the risk of Silicon Valley dominance. Surrounded by tremendous upheaval, she insists on continuities in the EU's approach. She grants that US tech firms are always on the hunt, but says that has been true for years.</p><p>One thing she is not cagey about is the threat of takeovers by foreign state-backed companies. With Europe's economy on life support, she warns that there is more danger than ever of such companies using their generous access to government credit to \"import unfair competition\" into the EU and acquire rivals while they are in a vulnerable state.</p><p>\"Since we have been hit by the virus in different stages, it's also probable that we could recover in different stages,\" she says. \"So one could imagine that European businesses would be in a weakened position when other regions have recovered. </p><p>\"Here, I think it's important to send the signal that we will be vigilant... that we would actually stand by [strategic] companies.\"</p><p>In a past interview <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">with the Belgian magazine Knack</url>, Ms Vestager singled out       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">China in particular</url>, saying that its companies are now in a \"later phase of the crisis\". Indeed, Britain recently blocked a plan by a Beijing-backed venture capitalists to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">tighten control over Imagination Technologies</url>, a UK chip designer.</p><p>But she also cites Germans' fury over <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">a report</url> that Donald Trump had offered $1bn to a home-grown pharma company for exclusive rights to its vaccine. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has likewise been shopping for bargains.</p><p>To prevent that, she has given EU member states her blessing to buy defensive stakes of their own, and is working on more aggressive methods of screening foreign investments. Those signals, she said last week, are \"intended for both camps\".</p><p>Even so, how strict can she really afford to be, given the scale of the crisis? The British Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) spent almost a year scrutinising Amazon's investment in Deliveroo, but on April 17 it<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">suddenly gave it a provisional green light</url>. </p><p>The reason was simple: the potential damage to consumers of Amazon taking a stake were now totally eclipsed by the risk of Deliveroo going bust.</p><p>Ms Vestager does accept that regulators will often end up more lenient in effect. Mergers that might otherwise have been denied could be approved if the alternative is one company collapsing; collaborations between companies that might normally be banned by anti-cartel laws <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">are already being authorised</url> in the name of keeping up supplies. </p><p>EU rules allow exceptions for \"dramatic, extraordinary events\", she says, and this is one.</p><p>\"But,\" she adds, \"the world is still inhabited by humans. Just as we see businesses go to extraordinary lengths to produce ventilators and protective gear, you will also see that there are some crisis privateers... it's important to be extremely helpful where it makes sense, and at the same time to stay vigilant so that people do not fall victim.\" </p><p>For what it's worth, she says she trusts tech giants not to be privateers - if only because everyone is watching them.</p><p>Not that tech's new eminence has convinced her that big is beautiful. While she demurs at the idea that internet services should be treated like public utilities, she does argue that greater dominance confers greater duty. </p><p>She cites new EU laws, taking effect this summer, that will force digital marketplaces such as Amazon and Google to explain their search rankings, disclose how they are boosting their own products and give their sellers the right to appeal against decisions.</p><p>\"If you win the market, you become a de factor regulator of that market, setting the rules of the game,\" she says. \"You're more than welcome to be successful, but you're not supposed to misuse your powers to promote yourself.\" </p><p>Her strongest response is to the suggestion that competition laws should take a back seat in a crisis of this scale. \"Actually I think that competition law enforcement is an essential necessity. It is anything but a luxury,\" she says. </p><p>When the US suspended some antitrust action after 2008, it actually postponed the recession. \"You need competition to ensure that companies that create jobs can survive, that companies that are innovative survive.\"</p><p>Her vision is that much of this competition will come from Europe itself. She lists areas where European firms could excel, and sees the very risk of American predation as proof of their potential. </p><p>\"There is more to digitisation than what the giants are providing right now,\" she says, seeing in the recovery a chance to \"accelerate\" EU prowess.</p><p>That truly would be a historic conclusion to the great isolation: triumph not for Californian incumbents but for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/26/tech-giants-will-emerge-coronavirus-winners/\">long-prophesied, ever-elusive</url> European Google.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-62396823</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRS-P4X1-JCJY-G30V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1365\"/><timeReceived>5:58 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 25, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN MICKLETHWAIT, BLOOMBERG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  Thank you very much.  We  just have the video which I think sets the scene both for this session and  the one after.  Big picture view of technology but I suspect our job is to  get down the nitty-gritty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have you in front of us possibly the most frightening women to big pet,  the E.U. Commissioner.  You find Google, you chase and live Apple tax bill,  now you've announced an early stage probe into Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And I wondered what the aim about was?  I know you came to stress that you  want to encourage investment but what exactly you're looking as on Apple --  on Amazon?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EU COMPETITON COMMISSIONER:  Well Amazon is a --it's a  two sided of market.  They have dual functions.  They both host the little  guy, so can he can enter into e-commerce.  They provide a number of  services which allows also smaller businesses to be active e-commerce and  to grab the opportunities and that's great.</p><p>There are also big guy themselves, bookstore, you know, everything,  groceries, movies, the works.  And they of course get all the data from the  little guy and we want to understand how these data is being used.  Because  this is all about competition.  Because when we say innovation, well,  competition is the most important driver for innovation for you to stay  ahead of you competitor.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  Would you think the future is a bit like telecom companies  or maybe what happened was Microsoft many years ago where you have a  platform company which is then force to let other people trade and have  access to that platform.</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, I think that's very difficult to say because as it was  just set in the video this is a -- this is a revolution, things changed.   And we haven't even what is coming with quantum computing, blockchains,  sort of really pulling of.</p><p>So, we probably have a platform economy that's much more diverse than what  we have seen, which is why of course it's important for us to understand,  well, what is the new big?  How companies that benefit from network effects  from huge amount of data, from marginal cost approaching zero, how do they  compete?  And for us that, of course, is the important thing.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  Do you think in some ways competition lower is being left  behind by big tech?  You have these companies where you talked about  network effects.  It is very difficult to intervene until of that they have  created this a space there in monopoly and some people would see them?</p><p>VESTAGER:  I think -- I think our principles are fine because they are  about human nature and rhythm change, unfortunately.  With all our good  sides and bad sides, I think we remain the same.  But of course in the  regulation we need to stay alert, because you can be big.  In Europe, you  can be successful.  But you should misuse your power.</p><p>This is actually the story of the two Google fines.  Very successful, very  welcome in Europe but we find that they misused their power for competitive  not be as innovative as they ought to, for consumers not to be able to  enjoy the benefits of choice, innovation, affordable prices.  And that of  course is where we have to be very, very vigilant.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  And isn't it the Google thing of an example of what I just  said, you know, it took you seven years in tech.  Seven years is a  lifetime.</p><p>VESTAGER:  Yes, part of that is part of the game because there is an  asymmetry in every kind of law enforcement.  Because (INAUDIBLE) it takes  five minutes to break into to your home.  It will take the police and the  court system quite some time to find the guilty person, to get him or her  convicted in its way.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  That's with not seven years?</p><p>VESTAGER:  No, but you still have responsibility to do process.  Because we  live in a union base under the rule of law and we will never ever  compromise on your right to defend yourself.  That being said, of course,  we can use algorithms too.  We can too use all the tools of the digital  world in order for us to be more speedy.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  Do you thing tech homes of simply become too big in some  cases?</p><p>VESTAGER:  No I don't as such that you can make that conclusion but I think  they can be much more transparent.  My colleagues have made, I think very,  very, good proposals to ensure transparency in the relationship between the  smaller business and the platform and that I think is very much needed to  transparency, the willingness actually to deal with people.  And to be much  more sort of clear that they respect your privacy, your ownership of your  own data so that we are citizen feel that we can built trust with  technology.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  And do you thing (INAUDIBLE) scenario where the EU could  take a lead?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, I think the rights that are now much more clear.  If you  own your data, that you have a right to be forgotten, that you have a right  to know what is out there with you that you have for ability so you can  move your data.</p><p>I think in not only having the rules but also implementing the rules.  Of  course, this is something that's important for us as Europeans.  And we do  hope that we can inspire around the world because I think that respect of a  citizen is what builds trust.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  But you know what some people in this audience will think  specially Americans, they will think, look, this is Europe doesn't have any  big tech companies or circling enough from the scale the America does and  that China is where we surely see.</p><p>And this is Europe just trying to pull back America.  Do you think that  what is your -- what is your analysis to that suspicion.</p><p>VESTAGER:  What I think the reason why business in Europe is because they  do very good business.  And you see a number of the US companies they are  dominant in the European markets and they are more than welcome to be that.</p><p>An when you see, look at our tax growths, because you're more than welcome  as a European members states within or outside of union so set your own  level of corporate taxation.  But you're not supposed to handout specific  favors that be to Apple or to Starbucks or to some of the European  companies where we've seen that happen as well.</p><p>It's not about your flag.  It's not about whether you're privately a  publicly earned.  It's about your competitors spirit.  You're supposed to  compete for you business in Europe.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  And when you look at these new cases you're taking on, do  you look back to old cases like IBM many yeas ago or Microsoft, and trying  to see there's sort of like inspiration for this?  Are there lessons you  can learn from past periods of antitrust?</p><p>VESTAGER:  I think there's an important lesson of that speed as you just  said.  Because if things takes forever then it's not the antitrust  enforcement that sort of make sure that what we do as authorities leave  sufficient room for all the many, many, many businesses who compete by the  book who do their best, scale them for years, trying to make it in the  marketplace.  They should know, of course, that justice is sufficiently  fast for them to enjoy a competitive marketplace.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  Do you think there's something different about technology  with government now?  You look at other industries and government can leave  them alone and these sort of industries there is a tendency as you said  because of network affects towards having monopolies, towards having that  form of effect.  And so in some way, is government to rethink.</p><p>VESTAGER:  I think in order to be able to do that we have to work with the  fact everything did utilizes.  Agriculture, health, administration,  everything digitalizes.  So, if you want to accommodate and make a good  business environment for that, of course, you have to be able to understand  it.  And this is why the partnership with business in order how to get that  right.   That's important for us.  That's important for government.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  Well, a very quick last question, (INAUDIBLE) because you  mentioned in earlier and Theresa May did -- she talks about Britain now  having the lowest corporation tax.  Do you think that is a good way to  negotiate with the Europe Union?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well it doesn't change much because also within the union in the  very basic treaties are some member state, you have the right to set your  level of corporate taxation, and that, you can do within the union or  outside of the union.</p><p>What we don't want within the union is that member states puts money in one  business pocket not allowing anyone else to have the same thing, because  that's not fair competition.  But on the level of corporate taxation, you  can compete within and without the European Union.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT:  Thank you very much commissioner.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN MICKLETHWAIT, BLOOMBERG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: Thank you very much. We just have the video which I think sets the scene both for this session and the one after. Big picture view of technology but I suspect our job is to get down the nitty-gritty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have you in front of us possibly the most frightening women to big pet, the E.U. Commissioner. You find Google, you chase and live Apple tax bill, now you've announced an early stage probe into Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And I wondered what the aim about was? I know you came to stress that you want to encourage investment but what exactly you're looking as on Apple -- on Amazon?</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EU COMPETITON COMMISSIONER: Well Amazon is a --it's a two sided of market. They have dual functions. They both host the little guy, so can he can enter into e-commerce. They provide a number of services which allows also smaller businesses to be active e-commerce and to grab the opportunities and that's great.</p><p>There are also big guy themselves, bookstore, you know, everything, groceries, movies, the works. And they of course get all the data from the little guy and we want to understand how these data is being used. Because this is all about competition. Because when we say innovation, well, competition is the most important driver for innovation for you to stay ahead of you competitor.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: Would you think the future is a bit like telecom companies or maybe what happened was Microsoft many years ago where you have a platform company which is then force to let other people trade and have access to that platform.</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, I think that's very difficult to say because as it was just set in the video this is a -- this is a revolution, things changed. And we haven't even what is coming with quantum computing, blockchains, sort of really pulling of.</p><p>So, we probably have a platform economy that's much more diverse than what we have seen, which is why of course it's important for us to understand, well, what is the new big? How companies that benefit from network effects from huge amount of data, from marginal cost approaching zero, how do they compete? And for us that, of course, is the important thing.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: Do you think in some ways competition lower is being left behind by big tech? You have these companies where you talked about network effects. It is very difficult to intervene until of that they have created this a space there in monopoly and some people would see them?</p><p>VESTAGER: I think -- I think our principles are fine because they are about human nature and rhythm change, unfortunately. With all our good sides and bad sides, I think we remain the same. But of course in the regulation we need to stay alert, because you can be big. In Europe, you can be successful. But you should misuse your power.</p><p>This is actually the story of the two Google fines. Very successful, very welcome in Europe but we find that they misused their power for competitive not be as innovative as they ought to, for consumers not to be able to enjoy the benefits of choice, innovation, affordable prices. And that of course is where we have to be very, very vigilant.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: And isn't it the Google thing of an example of what I just said, you know, it took you seven years in tech. Seven years is a lifetime.</p><p>VESTAGER: Yes, part of that is part of the game because there is an asymmetry in every kind of law enforcement. Because (INAUDIBLE) it takes five minutes to break into to your home. It will take the police and the court system quite some time to find the guilty person, to get him or her convicted in its way.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: That's with not seven years?</p><p>VESTAGER: No, but you still have responsibility to do process. Because we live in a union base under the rule of law and we will never ever compromise on your right to defend yourself. That being said, of course, we can use algorithms too. We can too use all the tools of the digital world in order for us to be more speedy.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: Do you thing tech homes of simply become too big in some cases?</p><p>VESTAGER: No I don't as such that you can make that conclusion but I think they can be much more transparent. My colleagues have made, I think very, very, good proposals to ensure transparency in the relationship between the smaller business and the platform and that I think is very much needed to transparency, the willingness actually to deal with people. And to be much more sort of clear that they respect your privacy, your ownership of your own data so that we are citizen feel that we can built trust with technology.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: And do you thing (INAUDIBLE) scenario where the EU could take a lead?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, I think the rights that are now much more clear. If you own your data, that you have a right to be forgotten, that you have a right to know what is out there with you that you have for ability so you can move your data.</p><p>I think in not only having the rules but also implementing the rules. Of course, this is something that's important for us as Europeans. And we do hope that we can inspire around the world because I think that respect of a citizen is what builds trust.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: But you know what some people in this audience will think specially Americans, they will think, look, this is Europe doesn't have any big tech companies or circling enough from the scale the America does and that China is where we surely see.</p><p>And this is Europe just trying to pull back America. Do you think that what is your -- what is your analysis to that suspicion.</p><p>VESTAGER: What I think the reason why business in Europe is because they do very good business. And you see a number of the US companies they are dominant in the European markets and they are more than welcome to be that.</p><p>An when you see, look at our tax growths, because you're more than welcome as a European members states within or outside of union so set your own level of corporate taxation. But you're not supposed to handout specific favors that be to Apple or to Starbucks or to some of the European companies where we've seen that happen as well.</p><p>It's not about your flag. It's not about whether you're privately a publicly earned. It's about your competitors spirit. You're supposed to compete for you business in Europe.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: And when you look at these new cases you're taking on, do you look back to old cases like IBM many yeas ago or Microsoft, and trying to see there's sort of like inspiration for this? Are there lessons you can learn from past periods of antitrust?</p><p>VESTAGER: I think there's an important lesson of that speed as you just said. Because if things takes forever then it's not the antitrust enforcement that sort of make sure that what we do as authorities leave sufficient room for all the many, many, many businesses who compete by the book who do their best, scale them for years, trying to make it in the marketplace. They should know, of course, that justice is sufficiently fast for them to enjoy a competitive marketplace.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: Do you think there's something different about technology with government now? You look at other industries and government can leave them alone and these sort of industries there is a tendency as you said because of network affects towards having monopolies, towards having that form of effect. And so in some way, is government to rethink.</p><p>VESTAGER: I think in order to be able to do that we have to work with the fact everything did utilizes. Agriculture, health, administration, everything digitalizes. So, if you want to accommodate and make a good business environment for that, of course, you have to be able to understand it. And this is why the partnership with business in order how to get that right. That's important for us. That's important for government.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: Well, a very quick last question, (INAUDIBLE) because you mentioned in earlier and Theresa May did -- she talks about Britain now having the lowest corporation tax. Do you think that is a good way to negotiate with the Europe Union?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well it doesn't change much because also within the union in the very basic treaties are some member state, you have the right to set your level of corporate taxation, and that, you can do within the union or outside of the union.</p><p>What we don't want within the union is that member states puts money in one business pocket not allowing anyone else to have the same thing, because that's not fair competition. But on the level of corporate taxation, you can compete within and without the European Union.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: Thank you very much commissioner.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

We  just have the video which I think sets the scene both for this session and  the one after.  Big picture view of technology but I suspect our job is to  get down the nitty-gritty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We have you in front of us possibly the most frightening women to big pet,  the E.U. Commissioner.  You find Google, you chase and live Apple tax bill,  now you've announced an early stage probe into Amazon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And I wondered what the aim about was?  I know you came to stress that you  want to encourage investment but what exactly you're looking as on Apple --  on Amazon?</p><p> MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EU COMPETITON COMMISSIONER:  Well Amazon is a --it's a  two sided of market.  They have dual functions.  They both host the little  guy, so can he can enter into e-commerce.  They provide a number of  services which allows also smaller businesses to be active e-commerce and  to grab the opportunities and that's great.</p><p> There are also big guy themselves, bookstore, you know, everything,  groceries, movies, the works.  And they of course get all the data from the  little guy and we want to understand how these data is being used.  Because  this is all about competition.  Because when we say innovation, well,  competition is the most important driver for innovation for you to stay  ahead of you competitor.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  Would you think the future is a bit like telecom companies  or maybe what happened was Microsoft many years ago where you have a  platform company which is then force to let other people trade and have  access to that platform.</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, I think that's very difficult to say because as it was  just set in the video this is a -- this is a revolution, things changed.   And we haven't even what is coming with quantum computing, blockchains,  sort of really pulling of.</p><p> So, we probably have a platform economy that's much more diverse than what  we have seen, which is why of course it's important for us to understand,  well, what is the new big?  How companies that benefit from network effects  from huge amount of data, from marginal cost approaching zero, how do they  compete?  And for us that, of course, is the important thing.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  Do you think in some ways competition lower is being left  behind by big tech?  You have these companies where you talked about  network effects.  It is very difficult to intervene until of that they have  created this a space there in monopoly and some people would see them?</p><p> VESTAGER:  I think -- I think our principles are fine because they are  about human nature and rhythm change, unfortunately.  With all our good  sides and bad sides, I think we remain the same.  But of course in the  regulation we need to stay alert, because you can be big.  In Europe, you  can be successful.  But you should misuse your power.</p><p> This is actually the story of the two Google fines.  Very successful, very  welcome in Europe but we find that they misused their power for competitive  not be as innovative as they ought to, for consumers not to be able to  enjoy the benefits of choice, innovation, affordable prices.  And that of  course is where we have to be very, very vigilant.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  And isn't it the Google thing of an example of what I just  said, you know, it took you seven years in tech.  Seven years is a  lifetime.</p><p> VESTAGER:  Yes, part of that is part of the game because there is an  asymmetry in every kind of law enforcement.  Because (INAUDIBLE) it takes  five minutes to break into to your home.  It will take the police and the  court system quite some time to find the guilty person, to get him or her  convicted in its way.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  That's with not seven years?</p><p> VESTAGER:  No, but you still have responsibility to do process.  Because we  live in a union base under the rule of law and we will never ever  compromise on your right to defend yourself.  That being said, of course,  we can use algorithms too.  We can too use all the tools of the digital  world in order for us to be more speedy.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  Do you thing tech homes of simply become too big in some  cases?</p><p> VESTAGER:  No I don't as such that you can make that conclusion but I think  they can be much more transparent.  My colleagues have made, I think very,  very, good proposals to ensure transparency in the relationship between the  smaller business and the platform and that I think is very much needed to  transparency, the willingness actually to deal with people.  And to be much  more sort of clear that they respect your privacy, your ownership of your  own data so that we are citizen feel that we can built trust with  technology.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  And do you thing (INAUDIBLE) scenario where the EU could  take a lead?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, I think the rights that are now much more clear.  If you  own your data, that you have a right to be forgotten, that you have a right  to know what is out there with you that you have for ability so you can  move your data.</p><p> I think in not only having the rules but also implementing the rules.  Of  course, this is something that's important for us as Europeans.  And we do  hope that we can inspire around the world because I think that respect of a  citizen is what builds trust.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  But you know what some people in this audience will think  specially Americans, they will think, look, this is Europe doesn't have any  big tech companies or circling enough from the scale the America does and  that China is where we surely see.</p><p> And this is Europe just trying to pull back America.  Do you think that  what is your -- what is your analysis to that suspicion.</p><p> VESTAGER:  What I think the reason why business in Europe is because they  do very good business.  And you see a number of the US companies they are  dominant in the European markets and they are more than welcome to be that.</p><p> An when you see, look at our tax growths, because you're more than welcome  as a European members states within or outside of union so set your own  level of corporate taxation.  But you're not supposed to handout specific  favors that be to Apple or to Starbucks or to some of the European  companies where we've seen that happen as well.</p><p> It's not about your flag.  It's not about whether you're privately a  publicly earned.  It's about your competitors spirit.  You're supposed to  compete for you business in Europe.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  And when you look at these new cases you're taking on, do  you look back to old cases like IBM many yeas ago or Microsoft, and trying  to see there's sort of like inspiration for this?  Are there lessons you  can learn from past periods of antitrust?</p><p> VESTAGER:  I think there's an important lesson of that speed as you just  said.  Because if things takes forever then it's not the antitrust  enforcement that sort of make sure that what we do as authorities leave  sufficient room for all the many, many, many businesses who compete by the  book who do their best, scale them for years, trying to make it in the  marketplace.  They should know, of course, that justice is sufficiently  fast for them to enjoy a competitive marketplace.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  Do you think there's something different about technology  with government now?  You look at other industries and government can leave  them alone and these sort of industries there is a tendency as you said  because of network affects towards having monopolies, towards having that  form of effect.  And so in some way, is government to rethink.</p><p> VESTAGER:  I think in order to be able to do that we have to work with the  fact everything did utilizes.  Agriculture, health, administration,  everything digitalizes.  So, if you want to accommodate and make a good  business environment for that, of course, you have to be able to understand  it.  And this is why the partnership with business in order how to get that  right.   That's important for us.  That's important for government.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  Well, a very quick last question, (INAUDIBLE) because you  mentioned in earlier and Theresa May did -- she talks about Britain now  having the lowest corporation tax.  Do you think that is a good way to  negotiate with the Europe Union?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well it doesn't change much because also within the union in the  very basic treaties are some member state, you have the right to set your  level of corporate taxation, and that, you can do within the union or  outside of the union.</p><p> What we don't want within the union is that member states puts money in one  business pocket not allowing anyone else to have the same thing, because  that's not fair competition.  But on the level of corporate taxation, you  can compete within and without the European Union.</p><p> MICKLETHWAIT:  Thank you very much commissioner.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

And to be much more sort of clear that they respect your privacy, your ownership of your own data so that we are citizen feel that we can built trust with technology.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: And do you thing (INAUDIBLE) scenario where the EU could take a lead?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, I think the rights that are now much more clear. If you own your data, that you have a right to be forgotten, that you have a right to know what is out there with you that you have for ability so you can move your data.</p><p>I think in not only having the rules but also implementing the rules. Of course, this is something that's important for us as Europeans. And we do hope that we can inspire around the world because I think that respect of a citizen is what builds trust.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: But you know what some people in this audience will think specially Americans, they will think, look, this is Europe doesn't have any big tech companies or circling enough from the scale the America does and that China is where we surely see.</p><p>And this is Europe just trying to pull back America. Do you think that what is your -- what is your analysis to that suspicion.</p><p>VESTAGER: What I think the reason why business in Europe is because they do very good business. And you see a number of the US companies they are dominant in the European markets and they are more than welcome to be that.</p><p>An when you see, look at our tax growths, because you're more than welcome as a European members states within or outside of union so set your own level of corporate taxation. But you're not supposed to handout specific favors that be to Apple or to Starbucks or to some of the European companies where we've seen that happen as well.</p><p>It's not about your flag. It's not about whether you're privately a publicly earned. It's about your competitors spirit. You're supposed to compete for you business in Europe.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: And when you look at these new cases you're taking on, do you look back to old cases like IBM many yeas ago or Microsoft, and trying to see there's sort of like inspiration for this? Are there lessons you can learn from past periods of antitrust?</p><p>VESTAGER: I think there's an important lesson of that speed as you just said. Because if things takes forever then it's not the antitrust enforcement that sort of make sure that what we do as authorities leave sufficient room for all the many, many, many businesses who compete by the book who do their best, scale them for years, trying to make it in the marketplace. They should know, of course, that justice is sufficiently fast for them to enjoy a competitive marketplace.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: Do you think there's something different about technology with government now? You look at other industries and government can leave them alone and these sort of industries there is a tendency as you said because of network affects towards having monopolies, towards having that form of effect. And so in some way, is government to rethink.</p><p>VESTAGER: I think in order to be able to do that we have to work with the fact everything did utilizes. Agriculture, health, administration, everything digitalizes. So, if you want to accommodate and make a good business environment for that, of course, you have to be able to understand it. And this is why the partnership with business in order how to get that right. That's important for us. That's important for government.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: Well, a very quick last question, (INAUDIBLE) because you mentioned in earlier and Theresa May did -- she talks about Britain now having the lowest corporation tax. Do you think that is a good way to negotiate with the Europe Union?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well it doesn't change much because also within the union in the very basic treaties are some member state, you have the right to set your level of corporate taxation, and that, you can do within the union or outside of the union.</p><p>What we don't want within the union is that member states puts money in one business pocket not allowing anyone else to have the same thing, because that's not fair competition. But on the level of corporate taxation, you can compete within and without the European Union.</p><p>MICKLETHWAIT: Thank you very much commissioner.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Coming up, Margrethe Vestager goes to Washington. It is her job to keep big tech in check. The European Commissioner for Competition joins us for a wide ranging interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHANG: But first to our lead, European regulators are stepping up their pressure on U.S. Tech companies with European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager at the helm. The E.U. has announced massive fines against Apple and Google.</p><p>This week, she's in the U.S. visiting her American counterpart as well as tough political leaders. So what is on the agenda? I want to get straight now to my colleague David Gura who is in Washington. David, take it away.</p><p>DAVID GURA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Emily, thank you very much. Commissioner Vestager, thank you very much for your time this afternoon, always very busy day for you.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION, DENMARK: Great to be with you.</p><p>GURA: Let me start by asking about the meetings that you had today that you met with folks with FTC in the Department of Justice. Just share if you could, the substance of those conversation. What were you talking to those kind of reports events today?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, we don't share the substance.</p><p>GURA: Yes.</p><p>VESTAGER: Because very often, we have the opportunity just to takes trunk (ph) of open cases. And since they're open, of course, this is not something that we can share with the wider audience.</p><p>GURA: Keeping that what we've read in the news about making fees of these departments, the fact that you have people in an intern basis feeling a lot of these rules at the FTC at the Department of Justice. Is that nearly a frustration or is that proven to be difficult as you work with counterparts across the Atlantic area? Is it somehow different not having permit political appointees in place to these organizations?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well maybe to some degree in the beginning I wonder, but now I got to know both Maureen Ohasen (ph) and Venderfrench Rutherwell (ph). I met a couple of times and there is such a strong culture, a very concrete cooperation between the case teams because they share this culture of serving the consumer in the market. And therefore, you know, it is very concrete. It's very directed. It's a very good corporation.</p><p>GURA: According to this (ph), give me some insight into that cooperation. You're doing your investigations, working on your own cases that's happening here in U.S. as well. What's the ideal relationship like between your office and the FTC say with the Department of Justice?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, to some degree, actually we have a different legal basis. So it's not just all just the same. But with the necessary wavers and businesses, we can discuss an exchange to test hypothesis about would this be a competition concern? How do you see this?</p><p>So the case team, they called each other. Sometimes they come together. We have had a U.S., people coming over for somewhat we're hearings. We go here. It's something you can create happening. So it's quite into twins. Of course, very respectful of the differences but also they're concrete on making it right. I guess you have very high quality in the case works.</p><p>GURA: A question to you as an observer of this place, I think you and I last spoke, you were here after the election. So you've spent some time in D.C.. Does the train look different from you? Does the rhetoric about anti-trust for instance or computational regulations sound different coming to Washington now seven, eighth months into this president's throne?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, I -- if you could see, there is a renewed interests, more debates. I saw it over the -- in the election campaign. There is a sort of -- I think there is more debate that how to make sure that consumers is a well-served. How to make sure that you have right in competition, because competition is a driver not only for low prices and choice but also for innovation to be able to in the future to produce affordable prices and choice and a lots of going on here. And I find out they're very inspiring.</p><p>GURA: A couple of days ago since senators on Capitol Hill proposed an emergency (ph) from enforcement, senator Amy Klobuchar among them. And the point that she was making as I understand is the rules, the policies were outdated. We need to refresh them. Taking as a broad perspective on that, when you look at policy, enforcement policy broadly speaking, that need to be updated, do you think? Do you feel that policy haven't get step with where things when it comes to technology say?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, for obvious reason, I've been looking at the European Situation. And of course, we've been off guard sort of the same question because markets are developing very fast. Things are changing. Tech introduce life session, it's forming out society. But I find that our basic rules, they're fine because some of the narratives, were there the same.</p><p>It's great. It's fear combine with power that can be a very, very strong combination. And we can do with us. Our challenge is of course to keep our chores sharp. And also to develop new tools because we have to be a skilled when it comes to going through massive amounts of data as anyone else. And that of course is the challenge but we accept it to develop with the phase of the market participants.</p><p>GURA: Which one do that cooperation help problematic if you guys are not on the same page? I think when you have been or with Albert (ph), and that was huge for instance, when you look at call coming the next day, and you're in different counts, it seems like what kind of problems does that post if any when you and U.S. are doing the same page?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, exactly. In this example that certainly mentioned should be seen because we're not done yet. But it happens quite rarely. When it happens, I think very often, they are very concrete reasons that the market situation is not the same. The market participants play different roles. So very often I find that you have adaptive reasons when we divide in how we look at, let's say, other case.</p><p>GURA: How do you use that the advocacy of what you're doing? I think we first spoke after you left into that's fund on Apple, the 13 billion Euros. Have you started to see changes as a result of that? Do you see companies where reconsidering -- publicly reconsidering, privately talking about the way that they apply their taxes. We're going to pay their taxes because they have an affect in the way companies, that work with policy perspective?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, yes I think that change is coming. It is slow because it take sometime and I think it will be far so when our courts have that with the cases. But you also see members states starting themselves to change the legislation. In Luxembourg and try first on the financing companies, in Ireland on the legislation allowing for what we called a double Irish which is being out phase.</p><p>And then of course, the legislative phase in Europe Union as a such has also a changed. There is much more bigger. And member say, it's a much more ready to say, well, we want the level flying field. And we want our tax priorities to work together in order to get it right because we see so many businesses. They pay their taxes exactly as one would expect. That do not just be for the many, it should be for everyone.</p><p>GURA: You speak today with North of Kremlin looking to buy orbital ATK. You're seeing a lot of consolidation of very big companies reducing the size of the plain field. There are number of sectors that there are on space, your defense. Is that inherently a problematic thing? Does it raise concerns to see big companies merging, acquiring and the field of players becoming smaller?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, it always depends because sometimes we see that it may be possible for a merger to enable -- there were process to consumers that efficiency is going to be passed on to consumers. So we never have sort of an opinion beforehand. We go into the analysis with an open mind to make sure that also post merger, that consumers will be real tough (ph).</p><p>GURA: Just to assume inside if you're willing to -- how do you decide which case is to take up with the processes like it leads to investigation of the opening of the case.</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, merges, they just knocking our door, so.</p><p>GURA: Yes. And that's been the many times to have fun.</p><p>VESTAGER: Yes. So those, we just do head on. In the anti-trust cases, for instance the council investigation, we would start sort of looking into under the radar to see, is there something here? Then we may due an announce inspections to see, well, is there evidence to supports our hypothesis. And then eventually, we were send me an update if we find that we have a strong case.</p><p>It is of course for any company, very troublesome to be in the search slide of -- into trust investigation. So we are very careful to make sure that we find -- that we have a strong case. That doesn't mean that we have anything brought up preliminary, look in a case when we start it. But of course it has to be something serious. Otherwise we shouldn't do it.</p><p>GURA: There is a perception here, rightly or wrong, whether you're targeting American companies. I look back at the Google fine of recent weeks, a two billion Euros. It seems to give risk to those who think that you are going after American companies.</p><p>I mentioned a lot of what you're doing here when you trouble to the U.S. as explaining yourself in the process and what companies you're looking at. What do you say to somebody who does suggest that? Who feels as though you are unfairly seeking out of American companies through action?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, first of all, I take this very seriously.</p><p>GURA: OK.</p><p>VESTAGER: Because by and as no place, no home in European anti-trust. It would be completely legitimatizing what we are doing because the point is that you have a single market. It's open for business but it's not open for bending the rules deciding the prices in the back office. And we also actually do have the statistics on our side when you look at mergers or anti-trust enforcement.</p><p>You do not find any kind of U.S. files. And that of course is a very, very important because it is not the flock of the company, the ownership of the company. It's the behavior in the markets that we concerned with.</p><p>GURA: All right, let's come back and talk a bit about Google in particular if we can lead much more. Much more with Commissioner Vestager coming up on Bloomberg Technology, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHANG: Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology, I'm Emily Chang. Let's get back to Washington with Bloomberg, David Gura who's standing by with the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager who was auditive to the United States. David, take it away.</p><p>GURA: Emily, thank you very much again. Let's get into Google a little bit here. I think a lot of people are good to serve that issue in particular. Google has 10 days as I understand to comply with the rule in the issue a few weeks back. What are you hoping to see by then? Have you seen a draft at this point? Do you have any sense of what Google's going to try to do with regard to shopping?</p><p>VESTAGER: Yes, now it seemed to be nine days ago. We took the decision that we have found that Google is dominant in the European market of general search. And that Google has been misusing this very strong and dominant position to promote itself and what the Google shopping products and to demotes competitors.</p><p>On average, you would find competitors on page four in a such result. And the U.S. can also sell, well, how often do I go there? While you were always finding glue shopping top left corner in the best placement. And the decision says that you have to try a principle of eco-treatment between go shopping and competitors because you're dominant.</p><p>And now, we talked to Google to figure out on how to this. Because this is the only way to make a remedy future proof, because assigned will change, screen sizes well change. Everything will change. But we still need this to be adhered to. So of course we remains to be seen how Google will leave up to this.</p><p>GURA: At Bloomberg, as reporting today that the Google is proposing certain option system. They would sell space to rival companies. And that something I proposed in 2013. That with another, can you confirm that that case that they uploaded out as an idea?</p><p>VESTAGER: Yes, we got the first draft to what they were thinking. I think in that two weeks ago. So we got to ruled outlined about what they're thinking. But the thing is that, it's not for us to prove, it is for Google to find a way to leave up to legislation. And this is of course, very important because if Google does not leave up to the decision then hen we will sort of investigating. Well, what is the situation and is competition still home (ph) so that consumers have best of choices that they would otherwise have.</p><p>GURA: So if come to 29th of September or however many days after you're not satisfied, but when does finding start? When do you begin to calculate and assess fines against Google if they hadn't meet the burden that you'd like them to meet?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, actually we can sort of back date the fine so that it will start from the first day that we fine that there's been a none-compliance with the decision. So obviously if we find, for instance not compared -- market competitors that complain, the consumers may complain to say, well, this is not what it was supposed to be.</p><p>If we find a reason, we will start investigating and then we can free date the fines if we find that there is a bridge of the following up in the decision.</p><p>GURA: Can you give us any sense of the time table here with these two other Google cases. It was the absence case in the Android case as well. How close you to resolution of those two?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, they are very different. The two cases because the absence case concerns placement they've asked on third party sites. And whether or not, that market was foreclosed. The Android cases, how Android is used to stay dominant also when we all go mobile. So that's sort of the experience from the box when you open the box of, you know, phone is a Google experience.</p><p>We treat both cases as high priority cases, but it's very difficult to say when we will be able to take a final decision.</p><p>GURA: And so which is farther long in the other, or they both kind of proceeding in tandem?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, as I said, they are different, so we have two cases and I don't know if they're competing as well. But we will put a lot of efforts into this because it is important for all market participants to know what will be final decision.</p><p>GURA: Couple of months ago, we speak with Dara Khosrowshahi who is then the head of Expedia. He's now of course at Uber and he was expressing concern about Google with regard to travel services. When you look at the name (ph) with apparatus with this Google, are there other parts of the business that concern you with, it might lead to investigations?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, we have quite a lot of the complaints on other verticals. And the thing is that with the Google shopping decision, having a stuff, of course, the Google is dominant in general search. And when the company is dominant, well obviously competition is already weakened a little if you hold 90 percent of the market, and this is where the special responsibility comes from that you should -- and you should used your powers and your own market on neighboring markets.</p><p>So this gives us another starting point looking at travel or locals. So in that respective, we still take a strong interest in Google behavior, and this now the markets.</p><p>GURA: I asked you the Apple tech's case it was that our companies to adjust. In the context of Google, you've let with this two billion Euro fine, have you seen that company begin to change its ways to work with your office to personal (ph) further finding of that company in particular. Is there a dialog between you and the company I guess? It's what I'm asking.</p><p>VESTAGER: Oh yes, there is a dialogue and I find them to be very, very professional. We don't agree on these issues, but I think it is important, no matter this agreement. In here, we are talking about a decision by the commission on the fine. I should say 2.4 billion Euros.</p><p>But it is s important to have a professional relationship because we want a change in market behavior to enable competition so that the market serve the consumer and then that hopefully, we can find a way.</p><p>GURA: Commissioner Vestager, thank you very much for giving us your time.</p><p>VESTAGER: Yes, thank you very much.</p><p>GURA: Appreciate it. Margrethe Vestager joined me here at the E.U. Delegations headquarters in Washington. Back to you Emily in San Francisco.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Coming up, Margrethe Vestager goes to Washington.  It is her  job to keep big tech in check.  The European Commissioner for Competition  joins us for a wide ranging interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHANG:  But first to our lead, European regulators are stepping up their  pressure on U.S. Tech companies with European Commissioner for Competition,  Margrethe Vestager at the helm.  The E.U. has announced massive fines  against Apple and Google.</p><p>This week, she's in the U.S. visiting her American counterpart as well as  tough political leaders.  So what is on the agenda?  I want to get straight  now to my colleague David Gura who is in Washington.  David, take it away.</p><p>DAVID GURA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Emily, thank you very much.  Commissioner  Vestager, thank you very much for your time this afternoon, always very  busy day for you.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION, DENMARK:  Great  to be with you.</p><p>GURA:  Let me start by asking about the meetings that you had today that  you met with folks with FTC in the Department of Justice.  Just share if  you could, the substance of those conversation.  What were you talking to  those kind of reports events today?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, we don't share the substance.</p><p>GURA:  Yes.</p><p>VESTAGER:  Because very often, we have the opportunity just to takes trunk  (ph) of open cases.  And since they're open, of course, this is not  something that we can share with the wider audience.</p><p>GURA:  Keeping that what we've read in the news about making fees of these  departments, the fact that you have people in an intern basis feeling a lot  of these rules at the FTC at the Department of Justice.  Is that nearly a  frustration or is that proven to be difficult as you work with counterparts  across the Atlantic area?  Is it somehow different not having permit  political appointees in place to these organizations?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well maybe to some degree in the beginning I wonder, but now I  got to know both Maureen Ohasen (ph) and Venderfrench Rutherwell (ph).  I  met a couple of times and there is such a strong culture, a very concrete  cooperation between the case teams because they share this culture of  serving the consumer in the market.  And therefore, you know, it is very  concrete.  It's very directed.  It's a very good corporation.</p><p>GURA:  According to this (ph), give me some insight into that cooperation.   You're doing your investigations, working on your own cases that's  happening here in U.S. as well.  What's the ideal relationship like between  your office and the FTC say with the Department of Justice?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, to some degree, actually we have a different legal basis.   So it's not just all just the same.  But with the necessary wavers and  businesses, we can discuss an exchange to test hypothesis about would this  be a competition concern?  How do you see this?</p><p>So the case team, they called each other.  Sometimes they come together.   We have had a U.S., people coming over for somewhat we're hearings.  We go  here.  It's something you can create happening.  So it's quite into twins.   Of course, very respectful of the differences but also they're concrete on  making it right.  I guess you have very high quality in the case works.</p><p>GURA:  A question to you as an observer of this place, I think you and I  last spoke, you were here after the election.  So you've spent some time in  D.C..  Does the train look different from you?  Does the rhetoric about  anti-trust for instance or computational regulations sound different coming  to Washington now seven, eighth months into this president's throne?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, I -- if you could see, there is a renewed interests, more  debates.  I saw it over the -- in the election campaign.  There is a sort  of -- I think there is more debate that how to make sure that consumers is  a well-served.  How to make sure that you have right in competition,  because competition is a driver not only for low prices and choice but also  for innovation to be able to in the future to produce affordable prices and  choice and a lots of going on here.  And I find out they're very inspiring.</p><p>GURA:  A couple of days ago since senators on Capitol Hill proposed an  emergency (ph) from enforcement, senator Amy Klobuchar among them.  And the  point that she was making as I understand is the rules, the policies were  outdated.  We need to refresh them.  Taking as a broad perspective on that,  when you look at policy, enforcement policy broadly speaking, that need to  be updated, do you think?  Do you feel that policy haven't get step with  where things when it comes to technology say?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, for obvious reason, I've been looking at the European  Situation.  And of course, we've been off guard sort of the same question  because markets are developing very fast.  Things are changing.  Tech  introduce life session, it's forming out society.  But I find that our  basic rules, they're fine because some of the narratives, were there the  same.</p><p>It's great.  It's fear combine with power that can be a very, very strong  combination.  And we can do with us.  Our challenge is of course to keep  our chores sharp.  And also to develop new tools because we have to be a  skilled when it comes to going through massive amounts of data as anyone  else.  And that of course is the challenge but we accept it to develop with  the phase of the market participants.</p><p>GURA:  Which one do that cooperation help problematic if you guys are not  on the same page?  I think when you have been or with Albert (ph), and that  was huge for instance, when you look at call coming the next day, and  you're in different counts, it seems like what kind of problems does that  post if any when you and U.S. are doing the same page?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, exactly.  In this example that certainly mentioned should  be seen because we're not done yet.  But it happens quite rarely.  When it  happens, I think very often, they are very concrete reasons that the market  situation is not the same.  The market participants play different roles.   So very often I find that you have adaptive reasons when we divide in how  we look at, let's say, other case.</p><p>GURA:  How do you use that the advocacy of what you're doing?  I think we  first spoke after you left into that's fund on Apple, the 13 billion Euros.   Have you started to see changes as a result of that?  Do you see companies  where reconsidering -- publicly reconsidering, privately talking about the  way that they apply their taxes.  We're going to pay their taxes because  they have an affect in the way companies, that work with policy  perspective?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, yes I think that change is coming.  It is slow because it  take sometime and I think it will be far so when our courts have that with  the cases.  But you also see members states starting themselves to change  the legislation.  In Luxembourg and try first on the financing companies,  in Ireland on the legislation allowing for what we called a double Irish  which is being out phase.</p><p>And then of course, the legislative phase in Europe Union as a such has  also a changed.  There is much more bigger.  And member say, it's a much  more ready to say, well, we want the level flying field.  And we want our  tax priorities to work together in order to get it right because we see so  many businesses.  They pay their taxes exactly as one would expect.  That  do not just be for the many, it should be for everyone.</p><p>GURA:  You speak today with North of Kremlin looking to buy orbital ATK.   You're seeing a lot of consolidation of very big companies reducing the  size of the plain field.  There are number of sectors that there are on  space, your defense.  Is that inherently a problematic thing?  Does it  raise concerns to see big companies merging, acquiring and the field of  players becoming smaller?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, it always depends because sometimes we see that it may be  possible for a merger to enable -- there were process to consumers that  efficiency is going to be passed on to consumers.  So we never have sort of  an opinion beforehand.  We go into the analysis with an open mind to make  sure that also post merger, that consumers will be real tough (ph).</p><p>GURA:  Just to assume inside if you're willing to -- how do you decide  which case is to take up with the processes like it leads to investigation  of the opening of the case.</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, merges, they just knocking our door, so.</p><p>GURA:  Yes.  And that's been the many times to have fun.</p><p>VESTAGER:  Yes.  So those, we just do head on.  In the anti-trust cases,  for instance the council investigation, we would start sort of looking into  under the radar to see, is there something here?  Then we may due an  announce inspections to see, well, is there evidence to supports our  hypothesis.  And then eventually, we were send me an update if we find that  we have a strong case.</p><p>It is of course for any company, very troublesome to be in the search slide  of -- into trust investigation.  So we are very careful to make sure that  we find -- that we have a strong case.  That doesn't mean that we have  anything brought up preliminary, look in a case when we start it.  But of  course it has to be something serious.  Otherwise we shouldn't do it.</p><p>GURA:  There is a perception here, rightly or wrong, whether you're  targeting American companies.  I look back at the Google fine of recent  weeks, a two billion Euros.  It seems to give risk to those who think that  you are going after American companies.</p><p>I mentioned a lot of what you're doing here when you trouble to the U.S. as  explaining yourself in the process and what companies you're looking at.   What do you say to somebody who does suggest that?  Who feels as though you  are unfairly seeking out of American companies through action?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, first of all, I take this very seriously.</p><p>GURA:  OK.</p><p>VESTAGER:  Because by and as no place, no home in European anti-trust.  It  would be completely legitimatizing what we are doing because the point is  that you have a single market.  It's open for business but it's not open  for bending the rules deciding the prices in the back office.  And we also  actually do have the statistics on our side when you look at mergers or  anti-trust enforcement.</p><p>You do not find any kind of U.S. files.  And that of course is a very, very  important because it is not the flock of the company, the ownership of the  company.  It's the behavior in the markets that we concerned with.</p><p>GURA:  All right, let's come back and talk a bit about Google in particular  if we can lead much more.  Much more with Commissioner Vestager coming up  on Bloomberg Technology, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHANG:  Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology, I'm Emily Chang.  Let's get  back to Washington with Bloomberg, David Gura who's standing by with the  European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager who was auditive  to the United States.  David, take it away.</p><p>GURA:  Emily, thank you very much again.  Let's get into Google a little  bit here.  I think a lot of people are good to serve that issue in  particular.  Google has 10 days as I understand to comply with the rule in  the issue a few weeks back.  What are you hoping to see by then?  Have you  seen a draft at this point?  Do you have any sense of what Google's going  to try to do with regard to shopping?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Yes, now it seemed to be nine days ago.  We took the decision  that we have found that Google is dominant in the European market of  general search.  And that Google has been misusing this very strong and  dominant position to promote itself and what the Google shopping products  and to demotes competitors.</p><p>On average, you would find competitors on page four in a such result.  And  the U.S. can also sell, well, how often do I go there?  While you were  always finding glue shopping top left corner in the best placement.  And  the decision says that you have to try a principle of eco-treatment between  go shopping and competitors because you're dominant.</p><p>And now, we talked to Google to figure out on how to this.  Because this is  the only way to make a remedy future proof, because assigned will change,  screen sizes well change.  Everything will change.  But we still need this  to be adhered to.  So of course we remains to be seen how Google will leave  up to this.</p><p>GURA:  At Bloomberg, as reporting today that the Google is proposing  certain option system.  They would sell space to rival companies.  And that  something I proposed in 2013.  That with another, can you confirm that that  case that they uploaded out as an idea?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Yes, we got the first draft to what they were thinking.  I think  in that two weeks ago.  So we got to ruled outlined about what they're  thinking.  But the thing is that, it's not for us to prove, it is for  Google to find a way to leave up to legislation.  And this is of course,  very important because if Google does not leave up to the decision then hen  we will sort of investigating.  Well, what is the situation and is  competition still home (ph) so that consumers have best of choices that  they would otherwise have.</p><p>GURA:  So if come to 29th of September or however many days after you're  not satisfied, but when does finding start?  When do you begin to calculate  and assess fines against Google if they hadn't meet the burden that you'd  like them to meet?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, actually we can sort of back date the fine so that it will  start from the first day that we fine that there's been a none-compliance  with the decision.  So obviously if we find, for instance not compared --  market competitors that complain, the consumers may complain to say, well,  this is not what it was supposed to be.</p><p>If we find a reason, we will start investigating and then we can free date  the fines if we find that there is a bridge of the following up in the  decision.</p><p>GURA:  Can you give us any sense of the time table here with these two  other Google cases.  It was the absence case in the Android case as well.   How close you to resolution of those two?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, they are very different.  The two cases because the  absence case concerns placement they've asked on third party sites.  And  whether or not, that market was foreclosed.  The Android cases, how Android  is used to stay dominant also when we all go mobile.  So that's sort of the  experience from the box when you open the box of, you know, phone is a  Google experience.</p><p>We treat both cases as high priority cases, but it's very difficult to say  when we will be able to take a final decision.</p><p>GURA:  And so which is farther long in the other, or they both kind of  proceeding in tandem?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, as I said, they are different, so we have two cases and I  don't know if they're competing as well.  But we will put a lot of efforts  into this because it is important for all market participants to know what  will be final decision.</p><p>GURA:  Couple of months ago, we speak with Dara Khosrowshahi who is then  the head of Expedia.  He's now of course at Uber and he was expressing  concern about Google with regard to travel services.  When you look at the  name (ph) with apparatus with this Google, are there other parts of the  business that concern you with, it might lead to investigations?</p><p>VESTAGER:  Well, we have quite a lot of the complaints on other verticals.   And the thing is that with the Google shopping decision, having a stuff, of  course, the Google is dominant in general search.  And when the company is  dominant, well obviously competition is already weakened a little if you  hold 90 percent of the market, and this is where the special responsibility  comes from that you should -- and you should used your powers and your own  market on neighboring markets.</p><p>So this gives us another starting point looking at travel or locals.  So in  that respective, we still take a strong interest in Google behavior, and  this now the markets.</p><p>GURA:  I asked you the Apple tech's case it was that our companies to  adjust.  In the context of Google, you've let with this two billion Euro  fine, have you seen that company begin to change its ways to work with your  office to personal (ph) further finding of that company in particular.  Is  there a dialog between you and the company I guess?  It's what I'm asking.</p><p>VESTAGER:  Oh yes, there is a dialogue and I find them to be very, very  professional.  We don't agree on these issues, but I think it is important,  no matter this agreement.  In here, we are talking about a decision by the  commission on the fine.  I should say 2.4 billion Euros.</p><p>But it is s important to have a professional relationship because we want a  change in market behavior to enable competition so that the market serve  the consumer and then that hopefully, we can find a way.</p><p>GURA:  Commissioner Vestager, thank you very much for giving us your time.</p><p>VESTAGER:  Yes, thank you very much.</p><p>GURA:  Appreciate it.  Margrethe Vestager joined me here at the E.U.  Delegations headquarters in Washington.  Back to you Emily in San  Francisco.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Coming up, Margrethe Vestager goes to Washington. It is her job to keep big tech in check. The European Commissioner for Competition joins us for a wide ranging interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHANG: But first to our lead, European regulators are stepping up their pressure on U.S. Tech companies with European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager at the helm. The E.U. has announced massive fines against Apple and Google.</p><p>This week, she's in the U.S. visiting her American counterpart as well as tough political leaders. So what is on the agenda? I want to get straight now to my colleague David Gura who is in Washington. David, take it away.</p><p>DAVID GURA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Emily, thank you very much. Commissioner Vestager, thank you very much for your time this afternoon, always very busy day for you.</p><p>MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION, DENMARK: Great to be with you.</p><p>GURA: Let me start by asking about the meetings that you had today that you met with folks with FTC in the Department of Justice. Just share if you could, the substance of those conversation. What were you talking to those kind of reports events today?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, we don't share the substance.</p><p>GURA: Yes.</p><p>VESTAGER: Because very often, we have the opportunity just to takes trunk (ph) of open cases. And since they're open, of course, this is not something that we can share with the wider audience.</p><p>GURA: Keeping that what we've read in the news about making fees of these departments, the fact that you have people in an intern basis feeling a lot of these rules at the FTC at the Department of Justice. Is that nearly a frustration or is that proven to be difficult as you work with counterparts across the Atlantic area? Is it somehow different not having permit political appointees in place to these organizations?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well maybe to some degree in the beginning I wonder, but now I got to know both Maureen Ohasen (ph) and Venderfrench Rutherwell (ph). I met a couple of times and there is such a strong culture, a very concrete cooperation between the case teams because they share this culture of serving the consumer in the market. And therefore, you know, it is very concrete. It's very directed. It's a very good corporation.</p><p>GURA: According to this (ph), give me some insight into that cooperation. You're doing your investigations, working on your own cases that's happening here in U.S. as well. What's the ideal relationship like between your office and the FTC say with the Department of Justice?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, to some degree, actually we have a different legal basis. So it's not just all just the same. But with the necessary wavers and businesses, we can discuss an exchange to test hypothesis about would this be a competition concern? How do you see this?</p><p>So the case team, they called each other. Sometimes they come together. We have had a U.S., people coming over for somewhat we're hearings. We go here. It's something you can create happening. So it's quite into twins. Of course, very respectful of the differences but also they're concrete on making it right. I guess you have very high quality in the case works.</p><p>GURA: A question to you as an observer of this place, I think you and I last spoke, you were here after the election. So you've spent some time in D.C.. Does the train look different from you? Does the rhetoric about anti-trust for instance or computational regulations sound different coming to Washington now seven, eighth months into this president's throne?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, I -- if you could see, there is a renewed interests, more debates. I saw it over the -- in the election campaign. There is a sort of -- I think there is more debate that how to make sure that consumers is a well-served. How to make sure that you have right in competition, because competition is a driver not only for low prices and choice but also for innovation to be able to in the future to produce affordable prices and choice and a lots of going on here. And I find out they're very inspiring.</p><p>GURA: A couple of days ago since senators on Capitol Hill proposed an emergency (ph) from enforcement, senator Amy Klobuchar among them. And the point that she was making as I understand is the rules, the policies were outdated. We need to refresh them. Taking as a broad perspective on that, when you look at policy, enforcement policy broadly speaking, that need to be updated, do you think? Do you feel that policy haven't get step with where things when it comes to technology say?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, for obvious reason, I've been looking at the European Situation. And of course, we've been off guard sort of the same question because markets are developing very fast. Things are changing. Tech introduce life session, it's forming out society. But I find that our basic rules, they're fine because some of the narratives, were there the same.</p><p>It's great. It's fear combine with power that can be a very, very strong combination. And we can do with us. Our challenge is of course to keep our chores sharp. And also to develop new tools because we have to be a skilled when it comes to going through massive amounts of data as anyone else. And that of course is the challenge but we accept it to develop with the phase of the market participants.</p><p>GURA: Which one do that cooperation help problematic if you guys are not on the same page? I think when you have been or with Albert (ph), and that was huge for instance, when you look at call coming the next day, and you're in different counts, it seems like what kind of problems does that post if any when you and U.S. are doing the same page?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, exactly. In this example that certainly mentioned should be seen because we're not done yet. But it happens quite rarely. When it happens, I think very often, they are very concrete reasons that the market situation is not the same. The market participants play different roles. So very often I find that you have adaptive reasons when we divide in how we look at, let's say, other case.</p><p>GURA: How do you use that the advocacy of what you're doing? I think we first spoke after you left into that's fund on Apple, the 13 billion Euros. Have you started to see changes as a result of that? Do you see companies where reconsidering -- publicly reconsidering, privately talking about the way that they apply their taxes. We're going to pay their taxes because they have an affect in the way companies, that work with policy perspective?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, yes I think that change is coming. It is slow because it take sometime and I think it will be far so when our courts have that with the cases. But you also see members states starting themselves to change the legislation. In Luxembourg and try first on the financing companies, in Ireland on the legislation allowing for what we called a double Irish which is being out phase.</p><p>And then of course, the legislative phase in Europe Union as a such has also a changed. There is much more bigger. And member say, it's a much more ready to say, well, we want the level flying field. And we want our tax priorities to work together in order to get it right because we see so many businesses. They pay their taxes exactly as one would expect. That do not just be for the many, it should be for everyone.</p><p>GURA: You speak today with North of Kremlin looking to buy orbital ATK. You're seeing a lot of consolidation of very big companies reducing the size of the plain field. There are number of sectors that there are on space, your defense. Is that inherently a problematic thing? Does it raise concerns to see big companies merging, acquiring and the field of players becoming smaller?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, it always depends because sometimes we see that it may be possible for a merger to enable -- there were process to consumers that efficiency is going to be passed on to consumers. So we never have sort of an opinion beforehand. We go into the analysis with an open mind to make sure that also post merger, that consumers will be real tough (ph).</p><p>GURA: Just to assume inside if you're willing to -- how do you decide which case is to take up with the processes like it leads to investigation of the opening of the case.</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, merges, they just knocking our door, so.</p><p>GURA: Yes. And that's been the many times to have fun.</p><p>VESTAGER: Yes. So those, we just do head on. In the anti-trust cases, for instance the council investigation, we would start sort of looking into under the radar to see, is there something here? Then we may due an announce inspections to see, well, is there evidence to supports our hypothesis. And then eventually, we were send me an update if we find that we have a strong case.</p><p>It is of course for any company, very troublesome to be in the search slide of -- into trust investigation. So we are very careful to make sure that we find -- that we have a strong case. That doesn't mean that we have anything brought up preliminary, look in a case when we start it. But of course it has to be something serious. Otherwise we shouldn't do it.</p><p>GURA: There is a perception here, rightly or wrong, whether you're targeting American companies. I look back at the Google fine of recent weeks, a two billion Euros. It seems to give risk to those who think that you are going after American companies.</p><p>I mentioned a lot of what you're doing here when you trouble to the U.S. as explaining yourself in the process and what companies you're looking at. What do you say to somebody who does suggest that? Who feels as though you are unfairly seeking out of American companies through action?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, first of all, I take this very seriously.</p><p>GURA: OK.</p><p>VESTAGER: Because by and as no place, no home in European anti-trust. It would be completely legitimatizing what we are doing because the point is that you have a single market. It's open for business but it's not open for bending the rules deciding the prices in the back office. And we also actually do have the statistics on our side when you look at mergers or anti-trust enforcement.</p><p>You do not find any kind of U.S. files. And that of course is a very, very important because it is not the flock of the company, the ownership of the company. It's the behavior in the markets that we concerned with.</p><p>GURA: All right, let's come back and talk a bit about Google in particular if we can lead much more. Much more with Commissioner Vestager coming up on Bloomberg Technology, this is Bloomberg.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CHANG: Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology, I'm Emily Chang. Let's get back to Washington with Bloomberg, David Gura who's standing by with the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager who was auditive to the United States. David, take it away.</p><p>GURA: Emily, thank you very much again. Let's get into Google a little bit here. I think a lot of people are good to serve that issue in particular. Google has 10 days as I understand to comply with the rule in the issue a few weeks back. What are you hoping to see by then? Have you seen a draft at this point? Do you have any sense of what Google's going to try to do with regard to shopping?</p><p>VESTAGER: Yes, now it seemed to be nine days ago. We took the decision that we have found that Google is dominant in the European market of general search. And that Google has been misusing this very strong and dominant position to promote itself and what the Google shopping products and to demotes competitors.</p><p>On average, you would find competitors on page four in a such result. And the U.S. can also sell, well, how often do I go there? While you were always finding glue shopping top left corner in the best placement. And the decision says that you have to try a principle of eco-treatment between go shopping and competitors because you're dominant.</p><p>And now, we talked to Google to figure out on how to this. Because this is the only way to make a remedy future proof, because assigned will change, screen sizes well change. Everything will change. But we still need this to be adhered to. So of course we remains to be seen how Google will leave up to this.</p><p>GURA: At Bloomberg, as reporting today that the Google is proposing certain option system. They would sell space to rival companies. And that something I proposed in 2013. That with another, can you confirm that that case that they uploaded out as an idea?</p><p>VESTAGER: Yes, we got the first draft to what they were thinking. I think in that two weeks ago. So we got to ruled outlined about what they're thinking. But the thing is that, it's not for us to prove, it is for Google to find a way to leave up to legislation. And this is of course, very important because if Google does not leave up to the decision then hen we will sort of investigating. Well, what is the situation and is competition still home (ph) so that consumers have best of choices that they would otherwise have.</p><p>GURA: So if come to 29th of September or however many days after you're not satisfied, but when does finding start? When do you begin to calculate and assess fines against Google if they hadn't meet the burden that you'd like them to meet?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, actually we can sort of back date the fine so that it will start from the first day that we fine that there's been a none-compliance with the decision. So obviously if we find, for instance not compared -- market competitors that complain, the consumers may complain to say, well, this is not what it was supposed to be.</p><p>If we find a reason, we will start investigating and then we can free date the fines if we find that there is a bridge of the following up in the decision.</p><p>GURA: Can you give us any sense of the time table here with these two other Google cases. It was the absence case in the Android case as well. How close you to resolution of those two?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, they are very different. The two cases because the absence case concerns placement they've asked on third party sites. And whether or not, that market was foreclosed. The Android cases, how Android is used to stay dominant also when we all go mobile. So that's sort of the experience from the box when you open the box of, you know, phone is a Google experience.</p><p>We treat both cases as high priority cases, but it's very difficult to say when we will be able to take a final decision.</p><p>GURA: And so which is farther long in the other, or they both kind of proceeding in tandem?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, as I said, they are different, so we have two cases and I don't know if they're competing as well. But we will put a lot of efforts into this because it is important for all market participants to know what will be final decision.</p><p>GURA: Couple of months ago, we speak with Dara Khosrowshahi who is then the head of Expedia. He's now of course at Uber and he was expressing concern about Google with regard to travel services. When you look at the name (ph) with apparatus with this Google, are there other parts of the business that concern you with, it might lead to investigations?</p><p>VESTAGER: Well, we have quite a lot of the complaints on other verticals. And the thing is that with the Google shopping decision, having a stuff, of course, the Google is dominant in general search. And when the company is dominant, well obviously competition is already weakened a little if you hold 90 percent of the market, and this is where the special responsibility comes from that you should -- and you should used your powers and your own market on neighboring markets.</p><p>So this gives us another starting point looking at travel or locals. So in that respective, we still take a strong interest in Google behavior, and this now the markets.</p><p>GURA: I asked you the Apple tech's case it was that our companies to adjust. In the context of Google, you've let with this two billion Euro fine, have you seen that company begin to change its ways to work with your office to personal (ph) further finding of that company in particular. Is there a dialog between you and the company I guess? It's what I'm asking.</p><p>VESTAGER: Oh yes, there is a dialogue and I find them to be very, very professional. We don't agree on these issues, but I think it is important, no matter this agreement. In here, we are talking about a decision by the commission on the fine. I should say 2.4 billion Euros.</p><p>But it is s important to have a professional relationship because we want a change in market behavior to enable competition so that the market serve the consumer and then that hopefully, we can find a way.</p><p>GURA: Commissioner Vestager, thank you very much for giving us your time.</p><p>VESTAGER: Yes, thank you very much.</p><p>GURA: Appreciate it. Margrethe Vestager joined me here at the E.U. Delegations headquarters in Washington. Back to you Emily in San Francisco.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Coming up, Margrethe Vestager goes to Washington.  It is her  job to keep big tech in check.  The European Commissioner for Competition  joins us for a wide ranging interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BREAK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CHANG:  But first to our lead, European regulators are stepping up their  pressure on U.S. Tech companies with European Commissioner for Competition,  Margrethe Vestager at the helm.  The E.U. has announced massive fines  against Apple and Google.</p><p> This week, she's in the U.S. visiting her American counterpart as well as  tough political leaders.  So what is on the agenda?  I want to get straight  now to my colleague David Gura who is in Washington.  David, take it away.</p><p> DAVID GURA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Emily, thank you very much.  Commissioner  Vestager, thank you very much for your time this afternoon, always very  busy day for you.</p><p> MARGRETHE VESTAGER, EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR COMPETITION, DENMARK:  Great  to be with you.</p><p> GURA:  Let me start by asking about the meetings that you had today that  you met with folks with FTC in the Department of Justice.  Just share if  you could, the substance of those conversation.  What were you talking to  those kind of reports events today?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, we don't share the substance.</p><p> GURA:  Yes.</p><p> VESTAGER:  Because very often, we have the opportunity just to takes trunk  (ph) of open cases.  And since they're open, of course, this is not  something that we can share with the wider audience.</p><p> GURA:  Keeping that what we've read in the news about making fees of these  departments, the fact that you have people in an intern basis feeling a lot  of these rules at the FTC at the Department of Justice.  Is that nearly a  frustration or is that proven to be difficult as you work with counterparts  across the Atlantic area?  Is it somehow different not having permit  political appointees in place to these organizations?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well maybe to some degree in the beginning I wonder, but now I  got to know both Maureen Ohasen (ph) and Venderfrench Rutherwell (ph).  I  met a couple of times and there is such a strong culture, a very concrete  cooperation between the case teams because they share this culture of  serving the consumer in the market.  And therefore, you know, it is very  concrete.  It's very directed.  It's a very good corporation.</p><p> GURA:  According to this (ph), give me some insight into that cooperation.   You're doing your investigations, working on your own cases that's  happening here in U.S. as well.  What's the ideal relationship like between  your office and the FTC say with the Department of Justice?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, to some degree, actually we have a different legal basis.   So it's not just all just the same.  But with the necessary wavers and  businesses, we can discuss an exchange to test hypothesis about would this  be a competition concern?  How do you see this?</p><p> So the case team, they called each other.  Sometimes they come together.   We have had a U.S., people coming over for somewhat we're hearings.  We go  here.  It's something you can create happening.  So it's quite into twins.   Of course, very respectful of the differences but also they're concrete on  making it right.  I guess you have very high quality in the case works.</p><p> GURA:  A question to you as an observer of this place, I think you and I  last spoke, you were here after the election.  So you've spent some time in  D.C..  Does the train look different from you?  Does the rhetoric about  anti-trust for instance or computational regulations sound different coming  to Washington now seven, eighth months into this president's throne?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, I -- if you could see, there is a renewed interests, more  debates.  I saw it over the -- in the election campaign.  There is a sort  of -- I think there is more debate that how to make sure that consumers is  a well-served.  How to make sure that you have right in competition,  because competition is a driver not only for low prices and choice but also  for innovation to be able to in the future to produce affordable prices and  choice and a lots of going on here.  And I find out they're very inspiring.</p><p> GURA:  A couple of days ago since senators on Capitol Hill proposed an  emergency (ph) from enforcement, senator Amy Klobuchar among them.  And the  point that she was making as I understand is the rules, the policies were  outdated.  We need to refresh them.  Taking as a broad perspective on that,  when you look at policy, enforcement policy broadly speaking, that need to  be updated, do you think?  Do you feel that policy haven't get step with  where things when it comes to technology say?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, for obvious reason, I've been looking at the European  Situation.  And of course, we've been off guard sort of the same question  because markets are developing very fast.  Things are changing.  Tech  introduce life session, it's forming out society.  But I find that our  basic rules, they're fine because some of the narratives, were there the  same.</p><p> It's great.  It's fear combine with power that can be a very, very strong  combination.  And we can do with us.  Our challenge is of course to keep  our chores sharp.  And also to develop new tools because we have to be a  skilled when it comes to going through massive amounts of data as anyone  else.  And that of course is the challenge but we accept it to develop with  the phase of the market participants.</p><p> GURA:  Which one do that cooperation help problematic if you guys are not  on the same page?  I think when you have been or with Albert (ph), and that  was huge for instance, when you look at call coming the next day, and  you're in different counts, it seems like what kind of problems does that  post if any when you and U.S. are doing the same page?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, exactly.  In this example that certainly mentioned should  be seen because we're not done yet.  But it happens quite rarely.  When it  happens, I think very often, they are very concrete reasons that the market  situation is not the same.  The market participants play different roles.   So very often I find that you have adaptive reasons when we divide in how  we look at, let's say, other case.</p><p> GURA:  How do you use that the advocacy of what you're doing?  I think we  first spoke after you left into that's fund on Apple, the 13 billion Euros.   Have you started to see changes as a result of that?  Do you see companies  where reconsidering -- publicly reconsidering, privately talking about the  way that they apply their taxes.  We're going to pay their taxes because  they have an affect in the way companies, that work with policy  perspective?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, yes I think that change is coming.  It is slow because it  take sometime and I think it will be far so when our courts have that with  the cases.  But you also see members states starting themselves to change  the legislation.  In Luxembourg and try first on the financing companies,  in Ireland on the legislation allowing for what we called a double Irish  which is being out phase.</p><p> And then of course, the legislative phase in Europe Union as a such has  also a changed.  There is much more bigger.  And member say, it's a much  more ready to say, well, we want the level flying field.  And we want our  tax priorities to work together in order to get it right because we see so  many businesses.  They pay their taxes exactly as one would expect.  That  do not just be for the many, it should be for everyone.</p><p> GURA:  You speak today with North of Kremlin looking to buy orbital ATK.   You're seeing a lot of consolidation of very big companies reducing the  size of the plain field.  There are number of sectors that there are on  space, your defense.  Is that inherently a problematic thing?  Does it  raise concerns to see big companies merging, acquiring and the field of  players becoming smaller?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, it always depends because sometimes we see that it may be  possible for a merger to enable -- there were process to consumers that  efficiency is going to be passed on to consumers.  So we never have sort of  an opinion beforehand.  We go into the analysis with an open mind to make  sure that also post merger, that consumers will be real tough (ph).</p><p> GURA:  Just to assume inside if you're willing to -- how do you decide  which case is to take up with the processes like it leads to investigation  of the opening of the case.</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, merges, they just knocking our door, so.</p><p> GURA:  Yes.  And that's been the many times to have fun.</p><p> VESTAGER:  Yes.  So those, we just do head on.  In the anti-trust cases,  for instance the council investigation, we would start sort of looking into  under the radar to see, is there something here?  Then we may due an  announce inspections to see, well, is there evidence to supports our  hypothesis.  And then eventually, we were send me an update if we find that  we have a strong case.</p><p> It is of course for any company, very troublesome to be in the search slide  of -- into trust investigation.  So we are very careful to make sure that  we find -- that we have a strong case.  That doesn't mean that we have  anything brought up preliminary, look in a case when we start it.  But of  course it has to be something serious.  Otherwise we shouldn't do it.</p><p> GURA:  There is a perception here, rightly or wrong, whether you're  targeting American companies.  I look back at the Google fine of recent  weeks, a two billion Euros.  It seems to give risk to those who think that  you are going after American companies.</p><p> I mentioned a lot of what you're doing here when you trouble to the U.S. as  explaining yourself in the process and what companies you're looking at.   What do you say to somebody who does suggest that?  Who feels as though you  are unfairly seeking out of American companies through action?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, first of all, I take this very seriously.</p><p> GURA:  OK.</p><p> VESTAGER:  Because by and as no place, no home in European anti-trust.  It  would be completely legitimatizing what we are doing because the point is  that you have a single market.  It's open for business but it's not open  for bending the rules deciding the prices in the back office.  And we also  actually do have the statistics on our side when you look at mergers or  anti-trust enforcement.</p><p> You do not find any kind of U.S. files.  And that of course is a very, very  important because it is not the flock of the company, the ownership of the  company.  It's the behavior in the markets that we concerned with.</p><p> GURA:  All right, let's come back and talk a bit about Google in particular  if we can lead much more.  Much more with Commissioner Vestager coming up  on Bloomberg Technology, this is Bloomberg.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> CHANG:  Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology, I'm Emily Chang.  Let's get  back to Washington with Bloomberg, David Gura who's standing by with the  European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager who was auditive  to the United States.  David, take it away.</p><p> GURA:  Emily, thank you very much again.  Let's get into Google a little  bit here.  I think a lot of people are good to serve that issue in  particular.  Google has 10 days as I understand to comply with the rule in  the issue a few weeks back.  What are you hoping to see by then?  Have you  seen a draft at this point?  Do you have any sense of what Google's going  to try to do with regard to shopping?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Yes, now it seemed to be nine days ago.  We took the decision  that we have found that Google is dominant in the European market of  general search.  And that Google has been misusing this very strong and  dominant position to promote itself and what the Google shopping products  and to demotes competitors.</p><p> On average, you would find competitors on page four in a such result.  And  the U.S. can also sell, well, how often do I go there?  While you were  always finding glue shopping top left corner in the best placement.  And  the decision says that you have to try a principle of eco-treatment between  go shopping and competitors because you're dominant.</p><p> And now, we talked to Google to figure out on how to this.  Because this is  the only way to make a remedy future proof, because assigned will change,  screen sizes well change.  Everything will change.  But we still need this  to be adhered to.  So of course we remains to be seen how Google will leave  up to this.</p><p> GURA:  At Bloomberg, as reporting today that the Google is proposing  certain option system.  They would sell space to rival companies.  And that  something I proposed in 2013.  That with another, can you confirm that that  case that they uploaded out as an idea?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Yes, we got the first draft to what they were thinking.  I think  in that two weeks ago.  So we got to ruled outlined about what they're  thinking.  But the thing is that, it's not for us to prove, it is for  Google to find a way to leave up to legislation.  And this is of course,  very important because if Google does not leave up to the decision then hen  we will sort of investigating.  Well, what is the situation and is  competition still home (ph) so that consumers have best of choices that  they would otherwise have.</p><p> GURA:  So if come to 29th of September or however many days after you're  not satisfied, but when does finding start?  When do you begin to calculate  and assess fines against Google if they hadn't meet the burden that you'd  like them to meet?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, actually we can sort of back date the fine so that it will  start from the first day that we fine that there's been a none-compliance  with the decision.  So obviously if we find, for instance not compared --  market competitors that complain, the consumers may complain to say, well,  this is not what it was supposed to be.</p><p> If we find a reason, we will start investigating and then we can free date  the fines if we find that there is a bridge of the following up in the  decision.</p><p> GURA:  Can you give us any sense of the time table here with these two  other Google cases.  It was the absence case in the Android case as well.   How close you to resolution of those two?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, they are very different.  The two cases because the  absence case concerns placement they've asked on third party sites.  And  whether or not, that market was foreclosed.  The Android cases, how Android  is used to stay dominant also when we all go mobile.  So that's sort of the  experience from the box when you open the box of, you know, phone is a  Google experience.</p><p> We treat both cases as high priority cases, but it's very difficult to say  when we will be able to take a final decision.</p><p> GURA:  And so which is farther long in the other, or they both kind of  proceeding in tandem?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, as I said, they are different, so we have two cases and I  don't know if they're competing as well.  But we will put a lot of efforts  into this because it is important for all market participants to know what  will be final decision.</p><p> GURA:  Couple of months ago, we speak with Dara Khosrowshahi who is then  the head of Expedia.  He's now of course at Uber and he was expressing  concern about Google with regard to travel services.  When you look at the  name (ph) with apparatus with this Google, are there other parts of the  business that concern you with, it might lead to investigations?</p><p> VESTAGER:  Well, we have quite a lot of the complaints on other verticals.   And the thing is that with the Google shopping decision, having a stuff, of  course, the Google is dominant in general search.  And when the company is  dominant, well obviously competition is already weakened a little if you  hold 90 percent of the market, and this is where the special responsibility  comes from that you should -- and you should used your powers and your own  market on neighboring markets.</p><p> So this gives us another starting point looking at travel or locals.  So in  that respective, we still take a strong interest in Google behavior, and  this now the markets.</p><p> GURA:  I asked you the Apple tech's case it was that our companies to  adjust.  In the context of Google, you've let with this two billion Euro  fine, have you seen that company begin to change its ways to work with your  office to personal (ph) further finding of that company in particular.  Is  there a dialog between you and the company I guess?  It's what I'm asking.</p><p> VESTAGER:  Oh yes, there is a dialogue and I find them to be very, very  professional.  We don't agree on these issues, but I think it is important,  no matter this agreement.  In here, we are talking about a decision by the  commission on the fine.  I should say 2.4 billion Euros.</p><p> But it is s important to have a professional relationship because we want a  change in market behavior to enable competition so that the market serve  the consumer and then that hopefully, we can find a way.</p><p> GURA:  Commissioner Vestager, thank you very much for giving us your time.</p><p> VESTAGER:  Yes, thank you very much.</p><p> GURA:  Appreciate it.  Margrethe Vestager joined me here at the E.U.  Delegations headquarters in Washington.  Back to you Emily in San  Francisco.</p><p> [*]</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Not so Denmark's Margrethe Vestager, who may be the world's most famous corporate umpire. The European Union's competition commissioner, who began an unprecedented second term last November, is something of a global celebrity: She's a sought-after speaker, a female icon, and the person seen as most likely to rein in the unfettered dominance of the world's biggest technology firms.Vestager has made news with the huge fines for anti-competitive behavior she has leveled at companies such as Google and Apple. But those punitive measures were limited to Vestager's jurisdiction\u2014the common European market\u2014and represent only minor stumbles for the world's most powerful corporations. </p><p>That's why Vestager is redoubling her efforts and hoping other countries will follow her lead. foreign policy's Ravi Agrawal recently spoke with the Brussels-based Vestager about the future of regulation and competition in technology\u2014and how the pandemic may have the strange effect of boosting her mission. Foreign Policy: I'll start with an easy question. How has the coronavirus pandemic affected your work? Margrethe Vestager: I have been busier than ever before. It has been very intense. Of course, this is nothing compared to all the people who are working in hospitals and saving lives. But from the moment we realized the enormous effects of the lockdown, we knew we had to make sure that first aid is available fast and that it's managed in such a way that our single market doesn't become completely fragmented. FP: Despite the historic job losses caused by the pandemic, the world's biggest tech firms all seem to be performing strongly in the stock market and further entrenching their market dominance. Does that worry you?MV: Well, it makes the regulatory approaches that we were considering even more urgent. Because we have now had a crash course, a full-scale experiment, in doing everything digitally: remote working, learning, socializing, even exercising. We see all the benefits that come with digital technologies. But the downsides are clearer now too. And that is a huge driver to make sure that a digital world is based on fairness and market access. We are pushing even more strongly now on the things we were already working on. We have ongoing investigations\u2014some preliminary, some more advanced\u2014into Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple. We have this sense of urgency to make sure that the innovative potential of digital technologies can be fulfilled and that we still have an open market where one can have a go at it. FP: There are all these theories about how the pandemic will change the world. What do you think it means for Big Tech and the fight to regulate it, not just in Europe but globally? MV: We now see so clearly how much digital technologies will be an integrated part of every aspect of our lives, that if anyone doubted the need to make sure that we have the right regulatory framework on technology, they must now be convinced that you cannot have a laissez-faire approach to something that's so involved in everything we do. I think that what was there already\u2014a nascent public feeling in favor of regulation\u2014is now growing and maturing much faster than it would otherwise have done. FP: But this could go two ways. One is that the pandemic boosts the appetite for regulation, but the other is that we could all become so much more reliant on some technologies and strengthen the market dominance of a few giant firms.MV: I tend to think the first scenario is more likely. You do not want to depend on someone who holds a lot of market power because you would want to have choice. You would want to have openings for newcomers. All of us now have experience with several ways of remote working\u2014Skype, Webex, Zoom, and so on\u2014and I find it quite intriguing to see the different facilities and really appreciate that there is choice. One product suits one situation; another product suits another situation. We would be served quite poorly if there were no choice. FP: While you have been lauded for fining companies such as Google and Apple for their antitrust and anti-competitive behavior, critics say those punishments are the equivalent of a mere parking ticket. MV: Yes. Our work here is still a work in progress. In these individual cases, the fine is a punishment for past illegal behavior. The second element in such a decision is a cease-and-desist order. And then we have the third element, which is a more restorative approach. Because what we have seen in Google's case is that even when the illegal behavior stops, that doesn't necessarily open the markets. Once you own a particular market, it takes a lot of effort to open that market for competitors. And this is why we also need a regulatory approach. We need to spell out more clearly to big digital gatekeepers that there are explicit dos and don'ts, and one of the obvious don'ts could be that you cannot promote yourself if you are a digital gatekeeper. FP: You're in Brussels, but the world's biggest tech firms are in the United States. Newer tech giants are emerging in Asia. Your role gives you power to regulate and fine companies for their business in Europe but not the rest of the world. Is there a way for countries to collaborate more on regulation and antitrust law? MV: Yes, I definitely think so. The interest in and the momentum of this cooperation is increasing. We have what we call the International Competition Network, where we discuss things like this. We have the General Data Protection Regulation [or GDPR, a landmark EU regulation on data protection and privacy]. And we also conduct outreach. For instance, the European Commission was in Addis Ababa to meet with the African Union Commission, and officials there were extremely interested in how to deal with privacy, competition, and making sure that markets are contestable. I think there is a very strong interest in these matters and an openness to not necessarily copy but to take inspiration as to what is needed to make sure that national and regional businesses get a fair chance in these markets.  FP: How do you feel about companies such as Apple and Google creating contact-tracing apps? MV: For me, the fundamental thing to look at is not the company but the behavior of the company. No matter who develops a virus-tracking app, what is very important is that it comes with an open protocol that third parties can verify\u2014and ensure that the app is not doing anything other than what it is said to be doing. And a decentralized system is ideal. But transparency is the main thing here. And of course, that companies enable the phones to work with different apps and across borders and operating systems. Otherwise these apps will not be useful. FP: Should surveillance be left to companies or countries? South Korea's Corona 100m app, for example, alerts users if they are within 100 meters of a coronavirus patient, but it has been criticized for being cavalier with patients' data. In India, the Aarogya Setu app has been downloaded by 120 million people, but that's mostly because the government made it mandatory. Obviously, neither of those cases are under your jurisdiction, but what do you make of them? MV: What has been important for us\u2014and that in itself has been quite challenging\u2014is for the European member states to come together on one approach. And that is slowly but surely happening. The more you can have a coordinated approach, the easier it is to make sure that different apps can work together. For us, the fundamental thing here has been whether or not people would trust the technology. Obviously it would have to be voluntary whether you would download such an app or not, and you would only make that choice if you trusted the technology to do what it says and nothing else\u2014that it would respect your privacy. And this is very important for us because, just before the pandemic, we launched a European strategy on data and a white paper[1] on artificial intelligence, and the main takeaway here is to say we really believe in the benefits of digital technologies but only if we can trust these technologies to serve humans\u2014and not just a few humans and not just a few companies. My guess is, because we can see how the GDPR has inspired other countries to take up similar measures, that citizens all around the world have a preoccupation with being able to trust their apps and what they do. People don't want to be part of the launch of a surveillance society for the next generation.FP: In many of your public speeches and interviews, you often talk about the concept of trust in society. In your 2017 TED Talk[2], for example, you described how a lack of trust in the market can lead to wider social dissatisfaction. Do you think that people should put their trust in these companies' intentions? MV: This is my sixth year as a law enforcer, and I see so many businesses that really make an effort to do things by the book and that struggle to innovate and to present the best possible service to their customers. And then I see a few companies\u2014some that are returning customers where we keep receiving complaints\u2014and we keep finding issues that give us reason to hand out big fines. I see both sides of this. I have a mixed feeling about this question because I also see the many good things and many companies that I would never have an issue with. FP: You have expressed concern[3] about Chinese companies taking over European ones, especially amid the pandemic, but your concern is primarily based on the notion that it may be unfair competition if the Chinese company is state-backed. But aren't those lines, in China and in other countries, murky? And if so, how do you deal with that? MV: We've reassessed our relationship with China and basically retired the idea that China is a developing economy. China is in some areas a partner, for instance when it comes to fighting climate change, but also a strategic competitor. And that has been informing a lot of the work that we've been doing. We're in the process of finalizing a white paper[4] on how to deal with foreign subsidiaries, both when it comes to reciprocity in market access and how to deal with state-owned or state-backed companies acquiring businesses within the single market. We felt a strong need to step up and act where we found a risk of unfair competition. The worry we have on acquisitions now is that there is a risk of a staggered global recovery. If some regions of the world recover faster than others, then there is the chance that some may think they should take advantage of it. We are very vigilant when it comes to that kind of risk.

The EU's competition commissioner says that only makes her fight more urgent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANTITRUST REGULATORS ARE RARELY WELL KNOWN outside of trade lobbies and industry circles. Not so Denmark's Margrethe Vestager, who may be the world's most famous corporate umpire. The European Union's competition commissioner, who began an unprecedented second term last November, is something of a global celebrity: She's a sought-after speaker, a female icon, and the person seen as most likely to rein in the unfettered dominance of the world's biggest technology firms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vestager has made news with the huge fines for anti-competitive behavior she has leveled at companies such as Google and Apple. But those punitive measures were limited to Vestager's jurisdiction--the common European market--and represent only minor stumbles for the world's most powerful corporations. That's why Vestager is redoubling her efforts and hoping other countries will follow her lead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FOREIGN POLICY'S Ravi Agrawal recently spoke with the Brussels-based Vestager about the future of regulation and competition in technology--and how the pandemic may have the strange effect of boosting her mission.</p><p>FOREIGN POLICY: I'll start with an easy question. How has the coronavirus pandemic affected your work? MARGRETHE VESTAGER: I have been busier than ever before. It has been very intense. Of course, this is nothing compared to all the people who are working in hospitals and saving lives. But from the moment we realized the enormous effects of the lockdown, we knew we had to make sure that first aid is available fast and that it's managed in such a way that our single market doesn't become completely fragmented.</p><p>FP: Despite the historic job losses caused by the pandemic, the world's biggest tech firms all seem to be performing strongly in the stock market and further entrenching their market dominance. Does that worry you?</p><p>MV: Well, it makes the regulatory approaches that we were considering even more urgent. Because we have now had a crash course, a full-scale experiment, in doing everything digitally: remote working, learning, socializing, even exercising. We see all the benefits that come with digital technologies. But the downsides are clearer now too. And that is a huge driver to make sure that a digital world is based on fairness and market access. We are pushing even more strongly now on the things we were already working on. We have ongoing investigations--some preliminary, some more advanced--into Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple. We have this sense of urgency to make sure that the innovative potential of digital technologies can be fulfilled and that we still have an open market where one can have a go at it.</p><p>FP: There are all these theories about how the pandemic will change the world. What do you think it means for Big Tech and the fight to regulate it, not just in Europe but globally?</p><p>MV: We now see so clearly how much digital technologies will be an integrated part of every aspect of our lives, that if anyone doubted the need to make sure that we have the right regulatory framework on technology, they must now be convinced that you cannot have a laissez-faire approach to something that's so involved in everything we do. I think that what was there already--a nascent public feeling in favor of regulation--is now growing and maturing much faster than it would otherwise have done.</p><p>FP: But this could go two ways. One is that the pandemic boosts the appetite for regulation, but the other is that we could all become so much more reliant on some technologies and strengthen the market dominance of a few giant firms.</p><p>MV: I tend to think the first scenario is more likely. You do not want to depend on someone who holds a lot of market power because you would want to have choice. You would want to have openings for newcomers. All of us now have experience with several ways of remote working--Skype, Webex, Zoom, and so on--and I find it quite intriguing to see the different facilities and really appreciate that there is choice. One product suits one situation; another product suits another situation. We would be served quite poorly if there were no choice.</p><p>FP: While you have been lauded for fining companies such as Google and Apple for their antitrust and anti-competitive behavior, critics say those punishments are the equivalent of a mere parking ticket.</p><p>MV: Yes. Our work here is still a work in progress. In these individual cases, the fine is a punishment for past illegal behavior. The second element in such a decision is a cease-and-desist order. And then we have the third element, which is a more restorative approach. Because what we have seen in Google's case is that even when the illegal behavior stops, that doesn't necessarily open the markets. Once you own a particular market, it takes a lot of effort to open that market for competitors. And this is why we also need a regulatory approach. We need to spell out more clearly to big digital gatekeepers that there are explicit dos and don'ts, and one of the obvious don'ts could be that you cannot promote yourself if you are a digital gatekeeper.</p><p>FP: You're in Brussels, but the world's biggest tech firms are in the United States. Newer tech giants are emerging in Asia. Your role gives you power to regulate and fine companies for their business in Europe but not the rest of the world. Is there a way for countries to collaborate more on regulation and antitrust law?</p><p>MV: Yes, I definitely think so. The interest in and the momentum of this cooperation is increasing. We have what we call the International Competition Network, where we discuss things like this. We have the General Data Protection Regulation [or GDPR, a landmark EU regulation on data protection and privacy], And we also conduct outreach. For instance, the European Commission was in Addis Ababa to meet with the African Union Commission, and officials there were extremely interested in how to deal with privacy, competition, and making sure that markets are contestable. I think there is a very strong interest in these matters and an openness to not necessarily copy but to take inspiration as to what is needed to make sure that national and regional businesses get a fair chance in these markets.</p><p>FP: How do you feel about companies such as Apple and Google creating contact-tracing apps?</p><p>MV: For me, the fundamental thing to look at is not the company but the behavior of the company. No matter who develops a virus-tracking app, what is very important is that it comes with an open protocol that third parties can verify--and ensure that the app is not doing anything other than what it is said to be doing. And a decentralized system is ideal. But transparency is the main thing here. And of course, that companies enable the phones to work with different apps and across borders and operating systems. Otherwise these apps will not be useful.</p><p>FP: Should surveillance be left to companies or countries? South Korea's Corona 100m app, for example, alerts users if they are within 100 meters of a coronavirus patient, but it has been criticized for being cavalier with patients' data. In India, the Aarogya Setu app has been downloaded by 120 million people, but that's mostly because the government made it mandatory. Obviously, neither of those cases are under your jurisdiction, but what do you make of them?</p><p>MV: What has been important for us--and that in itself has been quite challenging--is for the European member states to come together on one approach. And that is slowly but surely happening. The more you can have a coordinated approach, the easier it is to make sure that different apps can work together. For us, the fundamental thing here has been whether or not people would trust the technology. Obviously it would have to be voluntary whether you would download such an app or not, and you would only make that choice if you trusted the technology to do what it says and nothing else--that it would respect your privacy. And this is very important for us because, just before the pandemic, we launched a European strategy on data and a white paper on artificial intelligence, and the main takeaway here is to say we really believe in the benefits of digital technologies but only if we can trust these technologies to serve humans--and not just a few humans and not just a few companies. My guess is, because we can see how the GDPR has inspired other countries to take up similar measures, that citizens all around the world have a preoccupation with being able to trust their apps and what they do. People don't want to be part of the launch of a surveillance society for the next generation.</p><p>FP: In many of your public speeches and interviews, you often talk about the concept of trust in society. In your 2017 TED Talk, for example, you described how a lack of trust in the market can lead to wider social dissatisfaction. Do you think that people should put their trust in these companies' intentions?</p><p>MV: This is my sixth year as a law enforcer, and I see so many businesses that really make an effort to do things by the book and that struggle to innovate and to present the best possible service to their customers. And then I see a few companies--some that are returning customers where we keep receiving complaints--and we keep finding issues that give us reason to hand out big fines. I see both sides of this. I have a mixed feeling about this question because I also see the many good things and many companies that I would never have an issue with.</p><p>FP: You have expressed concern about Chinese companies taking over European ones, especially amid the pandemic, but your concern is primarily based on the notion that it may be unfair competition if the Chinese company is state-backed. But aren't those lines, in China and in other countries, murky? And if so, how do you deal with that?</p><p>MV: We've reassessed our relationship with China and basically retired the idea that China is a developing economy. China is in some areas a partner, for instance when it comes to fighting climate change, but also a strategic competitor. And that has been informing a lot of the work that we've been doing. We're in the process of finalizing a white paper on how to deal with foreign subsidiaries, both when it comes to reciprocity in market access and how to deal with state-owned or state-backed companies acquiring businesses within the single market. We felt a strong need to step up and act where we found a risk of unfair competition. The worry we have on acquisitions now is that there is a risk of a staggered global recovery.

By the evening, a crust of white had settled on the crown of Godfrey of Bouillon, the 11th-century crusader whose statue dominates the Place Royale. Not far away, people filed into a concert hall at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, renowned for hosting great conductor-composers such as Stravinsky and Rachmaninov. However, they were not there to listen to music; they had come to hear Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner who has been called the \u201cmost powerful woman in Europe\u201d and whose mission is to hold to account the world\u2019s biggest technology companies.</p><p>  Since 2014, the arts centre has hosted an annual series of debates about the future of the EU. These have been notable both for reflecting the sense of crisis on the continent \u2013 the themes have been \u201cReinventing Europe\u201d, \u201cNow or Never\u201d, \u201cLast Chance\u201d and \u201cThe End of Europe?\u201d \u2013 and for the quality of the speakers, one of whom was Emmanuel Macron, who appeared in 2014 and 2016, while he was France\u2019s economy minister. Vestager, who is 49, shared the stage with Macron both times.</p><p>  Vestager (pronounced Vest-ayer) was little known outside her native Denmark when she became Europe\u2019s commissioner for competition three years ago. The EU was already investigating tech companies including Google and Apple for abusing their dominant market positions or their tax structures. But Vestager, who is eloquent, charming (she smiles <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a lot</emphasis>) and supremely confident in her convictions, quickly concluded that more decisive action was needed.</p><p>  In January 2016, she hosted Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, in her Brussels office to discuss concerns about the company\u2019s tax affairs in Ireland, where it had sub\u00adsidiaries that handled its sales outside the Americas. Cook reportedly tried to lecture the commissioner and talked over her repeatedly. Neither the tone nor the message were appreciated by Vestager, who has said that \u201csome of the rich and the powerful\u201d of the world are playing the public \u201cfor fools\u201d when it comes to tax.</p><p>  \u201cThere\u2019s no economic rationale behind the way some of these companies are set up,\u201d she told me when we met in her tenth-floor office in the Berlaymont, the vast cruciform headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels. \u201cIt\u2019s not to serve the purpose of the company; it\u2019s to serve the purpose of avoiding tax.\u201d</p><p>  Seven months after meeting Cook, Ves\u00adtager ordered Ireland to recover \u20ac13bn from Apple, ruling that the government had granted tax benefits to the company that broke the EU\u2019s rules on state aid. Cook denounced the decision as \u201ctotal political crap\u201d. The US government agreed. So did the Irish authorities. Yet it was hard to believe that Apple, whose revenues for its most recent financial year were $229bn, did not have it coming. It is possible to admire the iPhone \u2013 Vestager likes hers \u2013 and also agree that an arrangement enabling the world\u2019s most valuable company to pay a tax rate that was, according to the European Commission, as low as 0.005 per cent on its European sales in 2014 was non-political crap. (Apple, which pays most of its tax in the US, handed over $11.6bn, or 18.1 per cent of its total profits, to the tax authorities worldwide in the year to 30 September 2017.)</p><p>  Vestager was just getting started. In May 2017, she fined Facebook, which has more than two billion unique users and is the world\u2019s most popular social network, \u20ac110m for misleading regulators during its purchase of WhatsApp. In October, it was Amazon \u2013 not only the West\u2019s largest e-commerce site but also the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing company and speaker brand \u2013 in the crosshairs, instructed to pay \u20ac250m to Luxembourg for the illegal tax benefits it received there. The biggest penalty was reserved for Google, whose founding motto was \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d. Vestager decided it had been just that, hitting it with a record \u20ac2.4bn fine for abusing its dominant position in the search market at the expense of smaller rivals.</p><p>  Not everyone agrees that all the penalties were merited, or that the rulings were strictly in accordance with competition law. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Economist</emphasis> has suggested that Vestager has been making decisions to advance her career. Nevertheless, by holding some of the world\u2019s largest companies to account and shaming member states into administering corporation tax more fairly, she has achieved that rare feat \u2013 inspiring some admiration for the European Commission.</p><p>  \u201cPeople look at her and think: hey, maybe the commission is worth having,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance in Brussels, who has represented US clients on both sides of Vestager\u2019s decisions. \u201cShe communicates far better than any other commissioner I have seen.\u201d</p><p>  Those skills and her political nous were on display when Vestager \u2013 a striking figure of over 6ft tall with close-cropped dark hair \u2013 stepped on to the stage for the debate at the Palais des Beaux-Arts. The theme was \u201cEurope: Yes We Can!\u201d, supposedly reflecting the changed mood on the continent in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. This optimism was merited, Vestager said. Economic growth in the EU was up, unemployment down, and Donald Trump and Brexit had brought the other 27 member states closer together. Asked to name her favourite Belgian beer, she noted that the country had more than a thousand beers \u2013 but dodged the question. And no, the competition commission was not unfair towards large tech companies. \u201cYou can be big, and you can be successful,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you cannot abuse your power to stop others from challenging you from being the next big thing in five or ten years.\u201d</p><p>  ***</p><p>  Competition law can be dry and dull, and so can the commissioners. Vestager, who was born near Copenhagen in 1968, is not. One lawyer in Brussels even designed a trivia quiz for her staff based on Vestager\u2019s backstory and habits. What animal toys does she knit as gifts for colleagues? Elephants with big ears to remind them to listen. What does she like to bake? Cinnamon buns. What hit Danish TV show used her as a model for the lead character?\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Borgen</emphasis>. What does she have in common with Theresa May and Angela Merkel? Their fathers were all clergymen.</p><p>  Vestager\u2019s mother was a clergywoman, too, and the pair of Lutheran pastors ministered to the people of \u00d8lgod, a village on the windswept flatlands of western Denmark. Their door was always open. Vestager remembers waking up as a child to the sound of a car pulling up outside and an exhausted father coming in with the paperwork for a newly arrived child. Sometimes the phone would ring late at night, requesting her parents to come out because something terrible had happened.</p><p>  \u201cOurs was a never a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">religious</emphasis>religious home, because my parents thought of religion as something you do: it\u2019s the way you engage in the local community,\u201d Vestager told me. \u201cThat has meant a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>  At school and at the University of Copenhagen, where she studied economics, Vestager engaged in student politics but never intended to pursue it as a career. When she was 21, she was contacted by officials seeking parliamentary candidates for Radikale Venstre (Social Liberals), a small, centre-left party co-founded by her maternal great-great-grandfather. She agreed to stand, knowing that she would not win but eager to see if she could \u201ctell a coherent story about what I believed in\u201d.</p><p>  She became the party chairwoman soon after and was appointed minister for education and ecclesiastical affairs in 1998, but Radikale Venstre was struggling when she was made leader in 2007. In the election that year, it won just 5.1 per cent of the vote. Two years later, it was polling at 3 per cent. There was talk that she was killing the party.</p><p>  Henrik Kjerrumgaard, its head of communications at the time, told me that Vestager\u2019s children were asking her: \u201cIs it true that you\u2019re the worst politician in Denmark?\u201d He recalls a turning point in the summer of 2009. At the party headquarters, everyone was in a grim mood. But Vestager arrived for work one day in high spirits. Kjerrumgaard asked her why she was so happy. \u201cShe said, \u2018I have figured out that nobody asked me to be here. If I want to take my carpet and roll it up and leave politics, I can do that. It also means: if I am strong, I can do what I want to do. Being a leader is saying we move in a specific direction and I am going to do that.\u2019\u201d</p><p>  Vestager\u2019s new approach meant talking to everybody yet sticking strongly to her beliefs: she is pro-immigration, pro-gay marriage and pro-Europe, but also fiscally conservative. It worked. In the 2011 election, the party won 9.5 per cent of the vote, its highest share for nearly 40 years. Vestager agreed to form a coalition government with the Social Democrats and the Socialist People\u2019s Party, but only after securing for herself the interior and economy portfolios.</p><p>  Her insistence on cutting welfare payments led to a clash with trade unions. One sent Vestager a fist with a raised middle digit, cast in white plaster, which she kept and christened the \u201cFuck Finger\u201d. Other parts of the job were more enjoyable. In the first half of 2012, Denmark held the EU presidency; Vestager led meetings, in Brussels, of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin), comprised of finance ministers across the trading bloc. \u201cWe had a lot to do, because it was in the aftermath of the financial crisis, so there was a lot of legislation on the banking sector,\u201d Vestager said. Even after her term as Ecofin president ended, she never skipped a meeting. \u201cIf you want to be part of the discussion, you have to be there\u2026 I really liked it.\u201d</p><p>  When the then Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who was leader of the Social Democrats and is married to the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, needed to nominate someone to the European Commission in 2014, Vestager was the choice.</p><p>  ***</p><p>  Each member of the EU has one commissioner, with portfolios that are similar to that of a national government minister, such as trade, or transport. Commissioners spend much of their time trying to convince their colleagues and governments of the merits of their proposed policies. The competition commissioner has a great deal more autonomy than the others. She has both investigative and decision-making powers: in effect, she is the judge, jury and executioner.</p><p>  \u201cThe competition commission is seen as the crown jewel of the European Commission\u2019s work,\u201d said Peter Guilford, a previous competition spokesman who is the chairman of GPLUS, a public affairs firm in Brussels, when we met for coffee. \u201cAll the best officials want to go there and the other commissioners tend to rally around the person. They don\u2019t have all the crap that other commissioners have to deal with.\u201d</p><p>  Vestager arrived in Brussels determined to stamp her style on the job. She redesigned the commissioner\u2019s office to make it more like a living room, with carpets on the light-wood floor, a blue-grey sofa and coffee table, and modern artwork and cloth butterflies made by Tibetan orphans on the walls. Next to her desk there is a symbolic wooden stepladder: \u201cA woman who wants to go places needs to bring her own ladder,\u201d she has said. Numerous photos of her family \u2013 her husband, Thomas, a maths teacher, and their three daughters, aged 14, 18 and 21 \u2013 sit on top of a low filing cabinet.</p><p>  Jens Thomsen, who wrote a book about Vestager\u2019s first 100 days as commissioner, told me that she chose the narrow meeting table that bisects the room so she would be close to her guests when they sat opposite her. Rather than sending an aide to escort visitors from the waiting room to her office, Vestager collects them in person, as she did with me. \u201cShe\u2019s very shrewd \u2013 more than she may appear,\u201d Thomsen said.</p><p>  After we sat down at the narrow table, I asked Vestager what she considered to be the main purpose of the competition commission. \u201cIn these years where you have increasing concentration in almost every sector, the consumer feels smaller and smaller because the businesses they deal with become bigger and bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you have digitalisation, which makes people feel increasingly less in control of their data, of who they are dealing with, what happens when they have done their deals. I think antitrust and competition law enforcement can play a role to say, \u2018Well, we are actually watching to empower you still to be a consumer with buying power.\u2019\u201d</p><p>  Part of Vestager\u2019s job is to smash cartels, such as the car parts manufacturers who colluded to maximise profits in the EU and have been fined \u20ac1.6bn, and to approve or block mergers. But the 900 staff under Vestager have spent much more time looking at the technology sector than under previous commissioners.</p><p>  IT companies have always attracted scrutiny because of their potential to dominate a particular sector. In 2004, the EU fined Microsoft \u20ac497m for anti-competitive behaviour and, five years later, hit Intel with a \u20ac1.06bn penalty, then the largest ever. But at that point Big Tech was only Medium Tech. The five largest global companies in March 2009 were ExxonMobil, PetroChina, Walmart, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Mobile, according to the consulting firm PwC. Today, they are Apple, Alphabet (the parent of Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. It is not only the size of the tech giants that concerns regulators. \u201cThey are shaping our societies,\u201d said Vestager, \u201cso that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s a priority to look at digital issues.\u201d</p><p>  Vestager has witnessed a backlash against technology firms in her own family. Her eldest daughter is on a \u201csort of digital detox\u201d. \u201cShe says it disables her ability to concentrate. Also, when you\u2019re with other people, you should be with other people and not with someone by your phone. And I like that very much.\u201d</p><p>  Vestager says she is a \u201ctech optimist\u201d \u2013 she is active on Twitter, with 230,000 followers, and has two smartphones. Yet she is also a \u201ccurious user\u201d, and experiments with different services, such as the DuckDuckGo search engine, which does not track its users. \u201cBack in the day, everyone was talking about cookies. Now this is so old-school, and everyone is talking about tracking, how to deal with it, what comes out of it. It\u2019s very interesting.\u201d</p><p>  Few technology companies are better at tracking users than Google, whose share of internet searches exceeds 90 per cent in most EU countries, and whose business practices have sparked several investigations by the commission. The most prominent of these related to Google\u2019s \u201cshopping\u201d service, which competitors in the US and Europe said unfairly discriminated against them. When you search Google for a product, the company\u2019s own price comparison results appear at the top of the page, before the search results. Rival price comparison services, meanwhile, were demoted well down the list of results, according to the complainants.</p><p>  The commission agreed that Google had abused its dominant position and sought unsuccessfully to reach a settlement with the company. When Vestager took over the case, in 2014, she poured additional resources into the investigation before slapping the company with the \u20ac2.4bn fine. Google is appealing the decision. \u201cOf course it would have been better if this case had been solved fast, because then everyone could move on,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, that was not doable, so we had to find another direction.\u201d</p><p>  Writing in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Harvard Business Review</emphasis> this summer, Bala Iyer, Mohan Subramaniam and U Srinivasa Rangan argued that competition law needs to be updated for the digital age. Tomorrow\u2019s monopolies would not be judged only in terms of how much they sell, they wrote, but also how much they know about us and how much better they can predict our behaviour than their competitors.</p><p>  Vestager agrees. \u201cThis is a way of saying that data becomes an asset. There\u2019s no such thing as a free search or anything like that, so obviously you pay, and your payment then becomes an asset\u2026 We look very closely at these issues. We haven\u2019t had a big data case yet\u2026 but we try to look very carefully.\u201d</p><p>  ***</p><p>  Fairness is a word that Vestager often uses, especially where it pertains to tax. Under EU law, a government can set its tax rate as low as it likes so long as it\u2019s the same for all companies. But approving tax schemes that only benefit certain corporations \u2013 usually a multinational corporation that the country is trying to woo \u2013 is illegal under EU \u201cstate aid\u201d regulations.</p><p>  The largest, most egregious state aid cases have involved technology companies \u2013 Apple and Amazon. Yet other global firms have also been caught out. In 2015, Vestager ruled that the Netherlands and Luxembourg had granted selective advantages to Starbucks and Fiat respectively, and ordered the companies each to pay between \u20ac20m and \u20ac30m in back taxes. A few months later, she instructed Belgium to recover \u20ac700m from 35 multinationals. McDonalds, Ikea and the French energy company Engie are also under investigation over their tax affairs.</p><p>  The UK has not escaped scrutiny. Last autumn, Vestager announced that she was looking into a government-approved scheme called \u201cgroup financing exemption\u201d that might allow multinationals to avoid tax.</p><p>  \u201cEveryone is talking about the small and medium-size businesses being the backbone of the European economy. Well, they\u2019re also the backbone of public budgets, because it\u2019s the smaller companies who pay their taxes, it is small earners who pay their taxes,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cI think it is unfair that many contribute, but not all are contributing, because everyone is benefiting from what makes a decent society: roads, digital infrastructure, health system, education. And none of these come for free.\u201d</p><p>  ***</p><p>  Towards the end of my interview with Vestager, I asked where the \u201cFuck Finger\u201d was. \u201cBehind you,\u201d she said, pointing to the coffee table. \u201cIt\u2019s there so people don\u2019t have to see it, because most people don\u2019t like it \u2013 they don\u2019t know where to look. But it\u2019s not for them, it\u2019s for me. I need to be reminded that there will always be someone who disagrees with me, and that is their right, and sometimes they will be correct.\u201d The big tech companies she has penalised believe that they will eventually be proved correct in court, and some legal experts in Brussels agree. \u201cWith state aid, she\u2019s stretched the law and it\u2019s quite possible she will lose,\u201d one lawyer told me.</p><p>  Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform in London, said that he supported the EU\u2019s tax crackdown and the way that Vestager is standing up to the technology companies. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s also true that Germany sees the commission as a vehicle to protect its own digital industries. So how much of this is principle, and how much is to protect local industries?\u201d</p><p>  Andrea Renda, the head of regulatory policy at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, also had a nuanced view of Vestager\u2019s achievements. \u201cConsumers will say, \u2018I trust her, she\u2019s strong,\u2019 and the general view of her is positive. Mine is a bit more mixed, because she lacks transparency. She needs to explain more in terms of competition law why she is doing things.\u201d</p><p>  Irrespective of the strict merits of the cases, Vestager has won praise and respect for advancing the debate about how to regulate technology companies in the 21st century. \u201cDigital penetration of markets and our lives gets greater every day,\u201d said Georgios Petropoulos, a fellow at the Bruegel economics think tank in Brussels. \u201cWe have to establish some red lines about behaviour.\u201d</p><p>  Vestager\u2019s term has nearly two years left to run. One of her biggest ongoing investigations relates to Gazprom, the Russian energy giant that supplies about a third of the EU\u2019s gas \u2013 Germany is the biggest buyer \u2013 and that stands accused of overcharging and restricting its customers\u2019 ability to sell gas across borders.</p><p>  Other large cases currently under way involve Google, again. Competition officials are investigating whether its Android mobile operating system has built-in monopolies, and whether the AdSense program unfairly blocks competitors from advertising on third-party websites.</p><p>  Speculation over Vestager\u2019s next move is mounting, and although she can serve a second term, it\u2019s clear that her interests and, seemingly, her ambition, extend beyond competition. She was animated talking about Brexit. \u201cNone of us took it for granted that it would be Remain, yet when [the Leave victory] happened, it was awful, because\u2026 we really have been doing our best to accommodate the interests of the Brits in European democracy. So it was an avalanche of cold water, not just a bucket.</p><p>  \u201cBut then, it\u2019s always good advice from your mother: sleep on it, the next day things look different\u2026 We\u2019re 27 [member states], and we have something going for us, and we have citizens who expect us to make it work: handling illegal immigration, protecting refugees, handling climate change, enabling jobs to be created. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d</p><p>  There has been talk that she could succeed Christine Lagarde as head of the International Monetary Fund. In Brussels, however, it is the suggestion that she may follow Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission when he stands down next year that has got people excited.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Politico</emphasis> reported in November that Emmanuel Macron had told officials that Vestager was his choice for the commission\u2019s top job. They are mutual admirers. When I asked Vestager about the French president, she said: \u201cI think everyone who has met him would say he is amazing. Not only for his education, but the way he engages with people.\u201d</p><p>  The EC presidency may be a long shot. Denmark is not in the eurozone, and Vestager is part of the Liberal political group in Brussels, only the fourth-biggest alliance. Her decision to investigate the tax breaks granted by governments to multinationals may also have  created some ill will towards her.</p><p>  \u201cFrankly, I think she would be great,\u201d said Alec Burnside, a competition partner at the law firm Dechert. \u201cTo take on these people and cases, to withstand the fury of the US tech industry and government: that\u2019s a ballsy thing \u2013 if that\u2019s the right term \u2013  to have done.\u201d</p><p>  Margrethe Vestager has not confirmed an interest in the presidency \u2013 but neither has she denied it. On the stage at the Palais des Beaux-Arts on 30 November, her interviewer remarked that a local newspaper had a story that day suggesting that she may be the next president of the EC. Vestager smiled. \u201cI have learned that European politics is very much like Danish politics,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have all the rumours.\u201d l</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTP-WC01-JCF0-N2BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 New Statesman Ltd.

By the evening, a crust of white had settled on the crown of Godfrey of Bouillon, the 11th-century crusader whose statue dominates the Place Royale. Not far away, people filed into a concert hall at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, renowned for hosting great conductor-composers such as Stravinsky and Rachmaninov. However, they were not there to listen to music; they had come to hear Margrethe Vestager, the EU commissioner who has been called the \u201cmost powerful woman in Europe\u201d and whose mission is to hold to account the world\u2019s biggest technology companies.</p><p>  Since 2014, the arts centre has hosted an annual series of debates about the future of the EU. These have been notable both for reflecting the sense of crisis on the continent \u2013 the themes have been \u201cReinventing Europe\u201d, \u201cNow or Never\u201d, \u201cLast Chance\u201d and \u201cThe End of Europe?\u201d \u2013 and for the quality of the speakers, one of whom was Emmanuel Macron, who appeared in 2014 and 2016, while he was France\u2019s economy minister. Vestager, who is 49, shared the stage with Macron both times.</p><p>  Vestager (pronounced Vest-ayer) was little known outside her native Denmark when she became Europe\u2019s commissioner for competition three years ago. The EU was already investigating tech companies including Google and Apple for abusing their dominant market positions or their tax structures. But Vestager, who is eloquent, charming (she smiles <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a lot</emphasis>) and supremely confident in her convictions, quickly concluded that more decisive action was needed.</p><p>  In January 2016, she hosted Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, in her Brussels office to discuss concerns about the company\u2019s tax affairs in Ireland, where it had sub\u00adsidiaries that handled its sales outside the Americas. Cook reportedly tried to lecture the commissioner and talked over her repeatedly. Neither the tone nor the message were appreciated by Vestager, who has said that \u201csome of the rich and the powerful\u201d of the world are playing the public \u201cfor fools\u201d when it comes to tax.</p><p>  \u201cThere\u2019s no economic rationale behind the way some of these companies are set up,\u201d she told me when we met in her tenth-floor office in the Berlaymont, the vast cruciform headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels. \u201cIt\u2019s not to serve the purpose of the company; it\u2019s to serve the purpose of avoiding tax.\u201d</p><p>  Seven months after meeting Cook, Ves\u00adtager ordered Ireland to recover \u20ac13bn from Apple, ruling that the government had granted tax benefits to the company that broke the EU\u2019s rules on state aid. Cook denounced the decision as \u201ctotal political crap\u201d. The US government agreed. So did the Irish authorities. Yet it was hard to believe that Apple, whose revenues for its most recent financial year were $229bn, did not have it coming. It is possible to admire the iPhone \u2013 Vestager likes hers \u2013 and also agree that an arrangement enabling the world\u2019s most valuable company to pay a tax rate that was, according to the European Commission, as low as 0.005 per cent on its European sales in 2014 was non-political crap. (Apple, which pays most of its tax in the US, handed over $11.6bn, or 18.1 per cent of its total profits, to the tax authorities worldwide in the year to 30 September 2017.)</p><p>  Vestager was just getting started. In May 2017, she fined Facebook, which has more than two billion unique users and is the world\u2019s most popular social network, \u20ac110m for misleading regulators during its purchase of WhatsApp. In October, it was Amazon \u2013 not only the West\u2019s largest e-commerce site but also the world\u2019s biggest cloud computing company and speaker brand \u2013 in the crosshairs, instructed to pay \u20ac250m to Luxembourg for the illegal tax benefits it received there. The biggest penalty was reserved for Google, whose founding motto was \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d. Vestager decided it had been just that, hitting it with a record \u20ac2.4bn fine for abusing its dominant position in the search market at the expense of smaller rivals.</p><p>  Not everyone agrees that all the penalties were merited, or that the rulings were strictly in accordance with competition law. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Economist</emphasis> has suggested that Vestager has been making decisions to advance her career. Nevertheless, by holding some of the world\u2019s largest companies to account and shaming member states into administering corporation tax more fairly, she has achieved that rare feat \u2013 inspiring some admiration for the European Commission.</p><p>  \u201cPeople look at her and think: hey, maybe the commission is worth having,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance in Brussels, who has represented US clients on both sides of Vestager\u2019s decisions. \u201cShe communicates far better than any other commissioner I have seen.\u201d</p><p>  Those skills and her political nous were on display when Vestager \u2013 a striking figure of over 6ft tall with close-cropped dark hair \u2013 stepped on to the stage for the debate at the Palais des Beaux-Arts. The theme was \u201cEurope: Yes We Can!\u201d, supposedly reflecting the changed mood on the continent in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. This optimism was merited, Vestager said. Economic growth in the EU was up, unemployment down, and Donald Trump and Brexit had brought the other 27 member states closer together. Asked to name her favourite Belgian beer, she noted that the country had more than a thousand beers \u2013 but dodged the question. And no, the competition commission was not unfair towards large tech companies. \u201cYou can be big, and you can be successful,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you cannot abuse your power to stop others from challenging you from being the next big thing in five or ten years.\u201d</p><p>  ***</p><p>  Competition law can be dry and dull, and so can the commissioners. Vestager, who was born near Copenhagen in 1968, is not. One lawyer in Brussels even designed a trivia quiz for her staff based on Vestager\u2019s backstory and habits. What animal toys does she knit as gifts for colleagues? Elephants with big ears to remind them to listen. What does she like to bake? Cinnamon buns. What hit Danish TV show used her as a model for the lead character?\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Borgen</emphasis>. What does she have in common with Theresa May and Angela Merkel? Their fathers were all clergymen.</p><p>  Vestager\u2019s mother was a clergywoman, too, and the pair of Lutheran pastors ministered to the people of \u00d8lgod, a village on the windswept flatlands of western Denmark. Their door was always open. Vestager remembers waking up as a child to the sound of a car pulling up outside and an exhausted father coming in with the paperwork for a newly arrived child. Sometimes the phone would ring late at night, requesting her parents to come out because something terrible had happened.</p><p>  \u201cOurs was a never a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">religious</emphasis>religious home, because my parents thought of religion as something you do: it\u2019s the way you engage in the local community,\u201d Vestager told me. \u201cThat has meant a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>  At school and at the University of Copenhagen, where she studied economics, Vestager engaged in student politics but never intended to pursue it as a career. When she was 21, she was contacted by officials seeking parliamentary candidates for Radikale Venstre (Social Liberals), a small, centre-left party co-founded by her maternal great-great-grandfather. She agreed to stand, knowing that she would not win but eager to see if she could \u201ctell a coherent story about what I believed in\u201d.</p><p>  She became the party chairwoman soon after and was appointed minister for education and ecclesiastical affairs in 1998, but Radikale Venstre was struggling when she was made leader in 2007. In the election that year, it won just 5.1 per cent of the vote. Two years later, it was polling at 3 per cent. There was talk that she was killing the party.</p><p>  Henrik Kjerrumgaard, its head of communications at the time, told me that Vestager\u2019s children were asking her: \u201cIs it true that you\u2019re the worst politician in Denmark?\u201d He recalls a turning point in the summer of 2009. At the party headquarters, everyone was in a grim mood. But Vestager arrived for work one day in high spirits. Kjerrumgaard asked her why she was so happy. \u201cShe said, \u2018I have figured out that nobody asked me to be here. If I want to take my carpet and roll it up and leave politics, I can do that. It also means: if I am strong, I can do what I want to do. Being a leader is saying we move in a specific direction and I am going to do that.\u2019\u201d</p><p>  Vestager\u2019s new approach meant talking to everybody yet sticking strongly to her beliefs: she is pro-immigration, pro-gay marriage and pro-Europe, but also fiscally conservative. It worked. In the 2011 election, the party won 9.5 per cent of the vote, its highest share for nearly 40 years. Vestager agreed to form a coalition government with the Social Democrats and the Socialist People\u2019s Party, but only after securing for herself the interior and economy portfolios.</p><p>  Her insistence on cutting welfare payments led to a clash with trade unions. One sent Vestager a fist with a raised middle digit, cast in white plaster, which she kept and christened the \u201cFuck Finger\u201d. Other parts of the job were more enjoyable. In the first half of 2012, Denmark held the EU presidency; Vestager led meetings, in Brussels, of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin), comprised of finance ministers across the trading bloc. \u201cWe had a lot to do, because it was in the aftermath of the financial crisis, so there was a lot of legislation on the banking sector,\u201d Vestager said. Even after her term as Ecofin president ended, she never skipped a meeting. \u201cIf you want to be part of the discussion, you have to be there\u2026 I really liked it.\u201d</p><p>  When the then Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who was leader of the Social Democrats and is married to the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, needed to nominate someone to the European Commission in 2014, Vestager was the choice.</p><p>  ***</p><p>  Each member of the EU has one commissioner, with portfolios that are similar to that of a national government minister, such as trade, or transport. Commissioners spend much of their time trying to convince their colleagues and governments of the merits of their proposed policies. The competition commissioner has a great deal more autonomy than the others. She has both investigative and decision-making powers: in effect, she is the judge, jury and executioner.</p><p>  \u201cThe competition commission is seen as the crown jewel of the European Commission\u2019s work,\u201d said Peter Guilford, a previous competition spokesman who is the chairman of GPLUS, a public affairs firm in Brussels, when we met for coffee. \u201cAll the best officials want to go there and the other commissioners tend to rally around the person. They don\u2019t have all the crap that other commissioners have to deal with.\u201d</p><p>  Vestager arrived in Brussels determined to stamp her style on the job. She redesigned the commissioner\u2019s office to make it more like a living room, with carpets on the light-wood floor, a blue-grey sofa and coffee table, and modern artwork and cloth butterflies made by Tibetan orphans on the walls. Next to her desk there is a symbolic wooden stepladder: \u201cA woman who wants to go places needs to bring her own ladder,\u201d she has said. Numerous photos of her family \u2013 her husband, Thomas, a maths teacher, and their three daughters, aged 14, 18 and 21 \u2013 sit on top of a low filing cabinet.</p><p>  Jens Thomsen, who wrote a book about Vestager\u2019s first 100 days as commissioner, told me that she chose the narrow meeting table that bisects the room so she would be close to her guests when they sat opposite her. Rather than sending an aide to escort visitors from the waiting room to her office, Vestager collects them in person, as she did with me. \u201cShe\u2019s very shrewd \u2013 more than she may appear,\u201d Thomsen said.</p><p>  After we sat down at the narrow table, I asked Vestager what she considered to be the main purpose of the competition commission. \u201cIn these years where you have increasing concentration in almost every sector, the consumer feels smaller and smaller because the businesses they deal with become bigger and bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you have digitalisation, which makes people feel increasingly less in control of their data, of who they are dealing with, what happens when they have done their deals. I think antitrust and competition law enforcement can play a role to say, \u2018Well, we are actually watching to empower you still to be a consumer with buying power.\u2019\u201d</p><p>  Part of Vestager\u2019s job is to smash cartels, such as the car parts manufacturers who colluded to maximise profits in the EU and have been fined \u20ac1.6bn, and to approve or block mergers. But the 900 staff under Vestager have spent much more time looking at the technology sector than under previous commissioners.</p><p>  IT companies have always attracted scrutiny because of their potential to dominate a particular sector. In 2004, the EU fined Microsoft \u20ac497m for anti-competitive behaviour and, five years later, hit Intel with a \u20ac1.06bn penalty, then the largest ever. But at that point Big Tech was only Medium Tech. The five largest global companies in March 2009 were ExxonMobil, PetroChina, Walmart, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Mobile, according to the consulting firm PwC. Today, they are Apple, Alphabet (the parent of Google), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. It is not only the size of the tech giants that concerns regulators. \u201cThey are shaping our societies,\u201d said Vestager, \u201cso that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s a priority to look at digital issues.\u201d</p><p>  Vestager has witnessed a backlash against technology firms in her own family. Her eldest daughter is on a \u201csort of digital detox\u201d. \u201cShe says it disables her ability to concentrate. Also, when you\u2019re with other people, you should be with other people and not with someone by your phone. And I like that very much.\u201d</p><p>  Vestager says she is a \u201ctech optimist\u201d \u2013 she is active on Twitter, with 230,000 followers, and has two smartphones. Yet she is also a \u201ccurious user\u201d, and experiments with different services, such as the DuckDuckGo search engine, which does not track its users. \u201cBack in the day, everyone was talking about cookies. Now this is so old-school, and everyone is talking about tracking, how to deal with it, what comes out of it. It\u2019s very interesting.\u201d</p><p>  Few technology companies are better at tracking users than Google, whose share of internet searches exceeds 90 per cent in most EU countries, and whose business practices have sparked several investigations by the commission. The most prominent of these related to Google\u2019s \u201cshopping\u201d service, which competitors in the US and Europe said unfairly discriminated against them. When you search Google for a product, the company\u2019s own price comparison results appear at the top of the page, before the search results. Rival price comparison services, meanwhile, were demoted well down the list of results, according to the complainants.</p><p>  The commission agreed that Google had abused its dominant position and sought unsuccessfully to reach a settlement with the company. When Vestager took over the case, in 2014, she poured additional resources into the investigation before slapping the company with the \u20ac2.4bn fine. Google is appealing the decision. \u201cOf course it would have been better if this case had been solved fast, because then everyone could move on,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, that was not doable, so we had to find another direction.\u201d</p><p>  Writing in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Harvard Business Review</emphasis> this summer, Bala Iyer, Mohan Subramaniam and U Srinivasa Rangan argued that competition law needs to be updated for the digital age. Tomorrow\u2019s monopolies would not be judged only in terms of how much they sell, they wrote, but also how much they know about us and how much better they can predict our behaviour than their competitors.</p><p>  Vestager agrees. \u201cThis is a way of saying that data becomes an asset. There\u2019s no such thing as a free search or anything like that, so obviously you pay, and your payment then becomes an asset\u2026 We look very closely at these issues. We haven\u2019t had a big data case yet\u2026 but we try to look very carefully.\u201d</p><p>  ***</p><p>  Fairness is a word that Vestager often uses, especially where it pertains to tax. Under EU law, a government can set its tax rate as low as it likes so long as it\u2019s the same for all companies. But approving tax schemes that only benefit certain corporations \u2013 usually a multinational corporation that the country is trying to woo \u2013 is illegal under EU \u201cstate aid\u201d regulations.</p><p>  The largest, most egregious state aid cases have involved technology companies \u2013 Apple and Amazon. Yet other global firms have also been caught out. In 2015, Vestager ruled that the Netherlands and Luxembourg had granted selective advantages to Starbucks and Fiat respectively, and ordered the companies each to pay between \u20ac20m and \u20ac30m in back taxes. A few months later, she instructed Belgium to recover \u20ac700m from 35 multinationals. McDonalds, Ikea and the French energy company Engie are also under investigation over their tax affairs.</p><p>  The UK has not escaped scrutiny. Last autumn, Vestager announced that she was looking into a government-approved scheme called \u201cgroup financing exemption\u201d that might allow multinationals to avoid tax.</p><p>  \u201cEveryone is talking about the small and medium-size businesses being the backbone of the European economy. Well, they\u2019re also the backbone of public budgets, because it\u2019s the smaller companies who pay their taxes, it is small earners who pay their taxes,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cI think it is unfair that many contribute, but not all are contributing, because everyone is benefiting from what makes a decent society: roads, digital infrastructure, health system, education. And none of these come for free.\u201d</p><p>  ***</p><p>  Towards the end of my interview with Vestager, I asked where the \u201cFuck Finger\u201d was. \u201cBehind you,\u201d she said, pointing to the coffee table. \u201cIt\u2019s there so people don\u2019t have to see it, because most people don\u2019t like it \u2013 they don\u2019t know where to look. But it\u2019s not for them, it\u2019s for me. I need to be reminded that there will always be someone who disagrees with me, and that is their right, and sometimes they will be correct.\u201d The big tech companies she has penalised believe that they will eventually be proved correct in court, and some legal experts in Brussels agree. \u201cWith state aid, she\u2019s stretched the law and it\u2019s quite possible she will lose,\u201d one lawyer told me.</p><p>  Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform in London, said that he supported the EU\u2019s tax crackdown and the way that Vestager is standing up to the technology companies. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s also true that Germany sees the commission as a vehicle to protect its own digital industries. So how much of this is principle, and how much is to protect local industries?\u201d</p><p>  Andrea Renda, the head of regulatory policy at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, also had a nuanced view of Vestager\u2019s achievements. \u201cConsumers will say, \u2018I trust her, she\u2019s strong,\u2019 and the general view of her is positive. Mine is a bit more mixed, because she lacks transparency. She needs to explain more in terms of competition law why she is doing things.\u201d</p><p>  Irrespective of the strict merits of the cases, Vestager has won praise and respect for advancing the debate about how to regulate technology companies in the 21st century. \u201cDigital penetration of markets and our lives gets greater every day,\u201d said Georgios Petropoulos, a fellow at the Bruegel economics think tank in Brussels. \u201cWe have to establish some red lines about behaviour.\u201d</p><p>  Vestager\u2019s term has nearly two years left to run. One of her biggest ongoing investigations relates to Gazprom, the Russian energy giant that supplies about a third of the EU\u2019s gas \u2013 Germany is the biggest buyer \u2013 and that stands accused of overcharging and restricting its customers\u2019 ability to sell gas across borders.</p><p>  Other large cases currently under way involve Google, again. Competition officials are investigating whether its Android mobile operating system has built-in monopolies, and whether the AdSense program unfairly blocks competitors from advertising on third-party websites.</p><p>  Speculation over Vestager\u2019s next move is mounting, and although she can serve a second term, it\u2019s clear that her interests and, seemingly, her ambition, extend beyond competition. She was animated talking about Brexit. \u201cNone of us took it for granted that it would be Remain, yet when [the Leave victory] happened, it was awful, because\u2026 we really have been doing our best to accommodate the interests of the Brits in European democracy. So it was an avalanche of cold water, not just a bucket.</p><p>  \u201cBut then, it\u2019s always good advice from your mother: sleep on it, the next day things look different\u2026 We\u2019re 27 [member states], and we have something going for us, and we have citizens who expect us to make it work: handling illegal immigration, protecting refugees, handling climate change, enabling jobs to be created. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d</p><p>  There has been talk that she could succeed Christine Lagarde as head of the International Monetary Fund. In Brussels, however, it is the suggestion that she may follow Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission when he stands down next year that has got people excited.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Politico</emphasis> reported in November that Emmanuel Macron had told officials that Vestager was his choice for the commission\u2019s top job. They are mutual admirers. When I asked Vestager about the French president, she said: \u201cI think everyone who has met him would say he is amazing. Not only for his education, but the way he engages with people.\u201d</p><p>  The EC presidency may be a long shot. Denmark is not in the eurozone, and Vestager is part of the Liberal political group in Brussels, only the fourth-biggest alliance. Her decision to investigate the tax breaks granted by governments to multinationals may also have  created some ill will towards her.</p><p>  \u201cFrankly, I think she would be great,\u201d said Alec Burnside, a competition partner at the law firm Dechert. \u201cTo take on these people and cases, to withstand the fury of the US tech industry and government: that\u2019s a ballsy thing \u2013 if that\u2019s the right term \u2013  to have done.\u201d</p><p>  Margrethe Vestager has not confirmed an interest in the presidency \u2013 but neither has she denied it. On the stage at the Palais des Beaux-Arts on 30 November, her interviewer remarked that a local newspaper had a story that day suggesting that she may be the next president of the EC. Vestager smiled. \u201cI have learned that European politics is very much like Danish politics,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have all the rumours.\u201d l</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STATEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STATEM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RF7-T6Y1-DYX2-C51T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245927</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 New Statesman Ltd.

The difference between her and the audience at the Wired Live festival becomes apparent when she takes it off. This event, remember, is taking place in England in November, but the Danish commissioner of a European Union so recently rejected by British voters is one of only a small handful of people there wearing a poppy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unlike the open, connected and sometimes sterile world of technology, Vestager always has an eye on what she calls \"the culture that people care about\". This is not some bloodless Brussels technocrat but an intense and formidable politician who, in her previous job as Denmark's deputy prime minister, was the inspiration for Birgitte Nyborg, the fictional prime minister in the television series Borgen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, according to some of the technology companies that have grown unchecked into gigantic global corporations, that is precisely the problem. They complain Vestager is leading a political campaign against them.</p><p>Last year, she ruled that Ireland must collect (EURO)13bn (\u00a311.5bn) from Apple because the tech giant had benefited from illegal tax breaks that gave it an unfair competitive advantage. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, branded the verdict \"total political crap\".</p><p>Yet the 49-year-old commissioner, who grew up on Denmark's bleak west coast, the daughter of two Lutheran pastors, is not easily deterred. In May, she fined Facebook (EURO)110m for providing misleading information to the European Commission about its WhatsApp takeover. In June, she slapped Google with a (EURO)2.42bn penalty for abusing its position as the dominant search engine to promote its own shopping service. Last month, she fined Amazon (EURO)250m for benefiting from another illegal tax break. And, for good measure, she announced Ireland is to be hauled before the European Court of Justice because it is still dragging its feet over collecting the (EURO)13bn - \"plus interest\" - owed by Apple.</p><p>Google has said only that it \"respectfully disagrees\" with Vestager. It claims, with some justification, that many of the original complaints about its behaviour appear to have been organised by its rival, Microsoft. Barack Obama has also suggested the European response stems from the tech-envy of firms \"who can't compete\" with their Silicon Valley counterparts.</p><p>Vestager, however, dismisses such talk. \"Politics has no room in the work we do,\" she says, \"and you don't have to take my word for it - take the courts', because everything we do has to stand up there. They want to hear about the evidence and jurisprudence - they don't want to hear about the politics, or how I feel.\"</p><p>For the same reason, she refuses to meet any of the tech lobbyists swarming around competition policy.</p><p>She says her 800-strong team is not motivated by her beliefs, nor by the identity or nationality of the company being investigated. Instead, Vestager insists this is merely about the application of the fundamental free market principles established 60 years ago by the founders of what became the EU.</p><p>However, her personal digital habits suggest a deeper scepticism. She uses DuckDuckGo, a search engine that does not store users' personal data. She deletes her cookies \"more than once a week\" and is tempted to put tape over her laptop's webcam to stop surveillance by eyes unknown. \"My husband keeps reminding me I should get it done.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, before deciding whether to open her own Facebook account, she tried to read its terms of service agreement. \"I realised you hand over to them all kinds of rights to use your data and your pictures. Even if you close your account, anything you have shared is still Facebook's to do with whatever it wants.\"</p><p>Although Vestager maintains \"Facebook is wonderful\", she adds that such tech titans \"face a backlash\" on basic issues such as privacy. \"Already four in five people in Europe feel they are not in control of their data. Trust is the most important thing not only to make a society work but also to make a market work.\"</p><p>Some of her concerns fit within her competition brief: she worries that the control the likes of Facebook have over such vast amounts of information creates barriers to entry for new rivals and prevents society getting the full benefits of big data.</p><p>Vestager's criticism of Big Tech has crossed into areas beyond her reach, however. I ask whether the evidence presented to the US Congress last week - when Facebook, Google and Twitter were called to explain how social media was used to affect the outcome of the US election - made her fearful that Russia was exploiting digital platforms to undermine democracy. \"Yes, but that is only one dimension of it.\" Her bigger concern is that the targeting techniques of companies such as Facebook, which enable advertisements to be tailored to individuals, can, when applied to politics, lead to a \"kind of privatisation of public debate\". She warns that so-called dark posts, where political messages are seen by no one but the recipient, mean \"there is no one to fact-check it; no one from another party to say it's wrong; no one to say afterwards they are not keeping their promises\".</p><p>For corporate critics seeking to prove Vestager has a political agenda, such comments are grist to the mill. She acknowledges: \"This is not a competition issue, but something of concern to any citizen who lives in a democracy.\" And, she emphasises: \"I'm still a citizen.\"</p><p>This sense of pride in Europe's citizenry runs through everything she says. Asked if she is ever worried about taking on these digital behemoths, Vestager stares back for a moment. \"No,\" she says. \"I represent more than 500m citizens in Europe\" - they give her \"sufficient muscle\".</p><p>Is there a different danger for Europe, of a buccaneering Brexit Britain undercutting the EU and offering a low-tax, low-regulation sanctuary to these rich digital companies?</p><p>British voters, she says, will have to decide what sort of \"country they want to live in\". It does not sound like one she would choose, I suggest. \"Oh, I read far too many English crime stories to live here. There are so many murders in Midsomer!\"</p><p>She is not above resorting to a politician's answer. As the world's biggest technology firms are discovering, though, this is a rather effective politician.Tom Baldwin's book, Ctrl Alt Delete: How Technology Left Democracy Unhinged will by published next year by Hurst</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-38650037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PWD-N8P1-JCJY-G1MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1130\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 5, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

This was seen as groundbreaking, part of a first term largely defined by battles with tech companies.</p><p>Her second term, which began in December and was accompanied by a promotion to commission executive vice-president with wider responsibilities for regulating the digital economy, is proving much rockier. Ms Vestager has suffered significant courtroom defeats not only over tax policy but also in the area of merger control, where her decision to block the takeover of UK mobile company O2 by rival Three was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c5e79ec-d7e1-4031-a923-d8327a503761\"> annulled </url>in May.\u00a0</p><p>At the same time, she has had to navigate a rapidly changing political terrain. Her first term involved not just bashing US tech companies, but also resisting Franco-German moves towards a more corporatist industrial policy. She argued that open competition in the EU\u2019s single market was more fruitful than seeking to assemble rivals to US and Chinese companies. Matters came to a head in 2019 when she vetoed a proposed merger between train manufacturers Siemens and Alstom, saying the combined group would be overly dominant.</p><p>But such arguments now appear increasingly out of step with a political drive towards strategic independence and reshoring that has been turbocharged by the breakdown in supply chains caused by the coronavirus emergency. <br/><br/>French economy minister Bruno Le Maire \u2014 who branded Ms Vestager\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91a9f200-247c-11e9-8ce6-5db4543da632\"> decision </url>on Siemens and Alstom an \u201ceconomic error\u201d and \u201cpolitical mistake\u201d \u2014 now speaks confidently of uniting EU economic, trade and competition policy behind the common goal of \u201ceconomic sovereignty\u201d.</p><p>Supporters of Ms Vestager argue that occasional reversals are inevitable given the core mission that she has taken on: ensuring fair markets in an era of rapid technological revolution.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe is trying to push competitive markets\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009with a very courageous, clear vision,\u201d said Monique Goyens, director-general of BEUC, the European Consumer Organisation. </p><p>Ms Goyens noted that Ms Vestager\u2019s expanded job was about nothing less than levelling the playing field for the EU tech sector by clamping down on tax dodges, privacy violations and other attempts by foreign competitors to steal an advantage at consumers\u2019 expense, while creating the market conditions for companies that follow the rules to thrive.\u00a0</p><p>Ms Vestager won political points with consumer rights groups after the opening of cases against Google. </p><p>This week drugmaker Aspen offered to cut the cost of cancer drugs by roughly 75 per cent following an in-depth probe by the commission.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe big picture is we need order in the digital economy,\u201d Ms Goyens said. \u201cShe has been a consumer champion, and we need her to remain one.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The commission is widely expected to appeal the Apple decision. Some lawyers argue that, while the court found in the company\u2019s favour, its decision leaves the door open for Brussels to attack other aggressive tax favours handed out by member states.</p><p>Brussels is embarking on a separate push to use an obscure EU treaty article to circumvent national vetoes on tax policy, although the move is expected to encounter significant resistance from some governments, including the Netherlands and Ireland.\u00a0</p><p>At the same time, Ms Vestager is taking on the politically perilous process of seeking new powers in the area of competition law.

In July, she issued Googlea record $5bn fine for breaching monopoly laws by forcing phone manufacturers to install Googleapps on the device.Speaking at Web Summit, Europe\u2019s largest technology conference, she outlined her vision for a digital future that ensures digital innovation works for everyone.\u201cThis future is arriving so fast that it becomes increasingly difficult to say what shape it will take,\u201d she told the audience from the main stage.While Vestager is tough on misbehaving tech companies, she is keen to champion the benefits of technology to society: from making our lives easier in small ways, to changing the lives of those with inhibiting diseases or disabilities.But society needs to tackle the darker consequences of technology, she says, such as the spreading of harmful information that undermines democracy.Likening the digital revolution to riding a rollercoaster, she said:\u201cThe thing about riding a rollercoaster is it can be great fun. but you only ride it when you are sure you\u2019re going to be safe. And I think that is the fundamental challenge that we are facing right now \u2013 that we are going to be safe.\u201dRules can promote innovationOne of the central arguments against regulation is that red tape impairs innovation. </p><p>Vestager, however, disagrees and insists that competition laws, in fact, promote innovation.\u201cThe innovation we want is not the innovation that is made by getting around the rules,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason why innovation matters is because it makes our lives better.\u201dNor should democracy be sacrificed for innovation, she added. Instead, it should protect those values.She added that good rules can make \u201cinnovation thrive. It can be the necessary challenge you need to get creative.\u201dMaking direct reference to the company she fined $5bn, Vestager described Googleas one of our \u201cgreat innovators\u201d, but caveated with the question: \u201cwhy would we put all of our hopes of the future in just one company?\u201dThe way forward is to keep markets open and promotes open source software that benefits everyone, she says.<person><nameText>Margrethe Vestager</nameText></person>: \u201cWhat happens online, doesn\u2019t remain online.\u201dData has long been touted as the \u2018new oil\u2019, but society is still unsure how to handle its most abundant resource. And when companies form a data cartel, the impact on businesses and democracy could be disastrous.\u201cData gives us a new understanding of the world,\u201d said Vestager. \u201cBut when just a few companies hold lots and lots of data, it can make it very very hard for anyone else to compete against them. And without competition, consumers are not well served.\u201dVestager believes that this abuse of personal data has corroded trust in companies among consumers.But there is good news, she explained. With the \u201cright rules,\u201d it is possible to fix the problem.\u201cThe time is over when the digital world could escape the rules that apply for us in our offline life,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happens online, doesn\u2019t remain online.\u201dDrawing a comparison to the standards that protect consumers from being killed due to dodgy wiring in their home applications, Vestager shows that it\u2019s not a culture that should be difficult to adopt.We expect authorities to tackle piracy, terrorism, or price fixing in the offline world \u2013 and that should be no different in a digital world, she explained.One of the ways that could happen is through the European Commission\u2019s proposal that platforms are \u201cobliged to take down terrorist propaganda within the hour.\u201dData misuse is undermining democracyRecent political campaigns have shown how our own data can be used against us to influence our vote. This becomes clear with examples such as yesterday\u2019s report into the misuse of personal data during the Brexit referendum.\u201cOne of the things that is clear is the data belongs to us,\u201d said Vestager. \u201cIt is mine. It is my property. And we want to be able to control what happens to it.\u201d<person><nameText>Margrethe Vestager </nameText></person>also stressed the importance of tackling the threat of cyberattackers during elections.\u201cBecause it is obvious, that technology is changing our democracy, our society, our markets, the business opportunity and it does it at the same time. So we have to do a number of things at the same time.\u201dShe also said that citizens have an obligation to teach children how to grow up in the digital world, while businesses have a duty to take responsibility.\u201cWhen we help each other to make technology safe, then create the trust that will enable a digital society in human scale, so that technology will serve us and not serve itself.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-BC8A5BF6FC51432A9020C68E691223EF</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TP0-MGS1-DYG0-73XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><timeReceived>2:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 7, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Investors are still hesitant to jump in with both feet, since federal laws still prohibit weed\u00a0in any form. However, a recent partnership announced with tech giant Microsoftcould help change the tide. </p><p>In mid-June 2016, Microsoft announced[2] it would partner with Kind Financial, a software company focused on the legal cannabis industry. By most accounts, this is the first time a company of such significant status has announced a partnership with the marijuana industry \u2014 even if that connection isn't with growing the marijuana directly. 'Nobody has really come out of the closet, if you will,' Matthew A. Karnes, the founder of Green Wave Advisors, which provides data and analysis of the marijuana business, told The New York Times[3]. 'It's very telling that a company of this caliber is taking the risk of coming out and engaging with a company that is focused on the cannabis business.' Kind[4] is\u00a0in the seed-to-sale business, making it easier for marijuana distributors to track sales and stay in compliance with changing regulations. The company will use Microsoft's Azure Government cloud system to help with establishing more structure for the cannabis industry.\u00a0'No one can predict the future of cannabis legalization, however, it is clear that legalized cannabis will always be subject to strict oversight and regulations similar to alcohol and tobacco; and, KIND is proud to offer governments and regulatory agencies the tools and technology to monitor cannabis compliance,' said Kind Financial Founder and CEO David Dinenberg in a press release[5]. Microsoftand marijuanaMicrosoft | VESA MOILANEN/AFP/Getty Images You won't see a Microsoft-branded strain of marijuana anytime soon \u2014 the tech giant isn't interested in getting close to the growth or distribution action. Instead, the company will be helping Kind in its 'government solutions' arm, which offers software to state and local governments that are\u00a0interested in building compliance systems. Even so, the announcement made waves. For one, industry players are still in a waiting game of sorts, trying to figure out how to walk the tightrope of local laws while the drug is still outlawed on the federal level. On top of that, getting involved with marijuana\u00a0can still have negative social consequences. The last time Gallup asked Americans about marijuana use, 58% of respondents favored legalization. But even though a majority don't mind if epilepsy patients receive medicinal doses of marijuana, there can be a backlash for supporting the industry at large. '[My company] has stayed away from investing in the cannabis industry because it's like investing in the porn industry,' Zack Bogue, a venture capital investor, told The Washington Post[6]. 'I'm sure there's a lot of money to be made, but it's just not something we want to invest in.' The future of marijuana investmentsMoney | Source: iStock With that in mind, it's not surprising that companies have been hesitant\u00a0to enter business deals with marijuana-related businesses in the past. However, Microsoft's foray into the industry could be a turning point, offering much-need legitimacy to Kind and other firms\u00a0like it.\u00a0'Every business that works in the cannabis space, we all clamor for legitimacy,' Dinenberg of Kind told the Times. 'I would like to think that this is the first of many dominoes to fall.' It's not a guarantee by any means, but Microsoft's association with marijuana could also help legalization efforts on the national level. At the very least, it might shift bank attitudes about cooperating with the industry,\u00a0Allen St. Pierre, executive director of National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, told The Washington Post[7].\u00a0'Microsofthas a leviathan [lobbying] effort up here in Washington [D.C.],' St. Pierre explained. 'One of the things that has been really interesting to see is how the focus is becoming not so much about\u00a0legalization per say\u00a0\u2026\u00a0but just focusing in on these commerce reforms, for example to allow banks to handle this trade.' If\u00a0Microsoft were to add its name to the lobbying pool for those changes, it 'can only buoy those efforts,' he added. If cannabis\u00a0legalization becomes the norm in the coming years, not the exception, Microsoftwill have gotten into the industry at the ground level, accumulating experience in working with marijuana-focused companies before fighting for business with other major competitors. The industry is already\u00a0expected to be worth $6.5 billion by the end of 2016, one analyst told the Times[8], up from $4.8 billion in 2015. If California approves the drug for recreational use, as is expected, that could balloon to $25 billion by 2020.

Below is an edited transcript of the conversation:</p><p>\"Shark Tank\" is going into its 12th season. What's the timeline on production for that?We finished our first pod about a week ago, and then we're going to have another one, I'm not sure of the exact date, where we'll finish out the season and finish filming... I don't know the premiere date, but I know we're supposed to hear what the premiere date is going to be shortly.</p><p>Did the show work as well given all the coronavirus precautions you had to take? What was different?Yeah, it's very different. [Laughs] It truly was a bubble. You know, being very familiar with the NBA bubble, I can tell you the \"Shark Tank\" bubble was even more strict. I mean, we were literally kept in our rooms and had to follow a specific path to a specific elevator, following tape on the floor and signs on the wall to go to a specific makeup station.</p><p>Then the set was redone, so it had social distancing. Instead of just a straight line with our seats like in the past, it's kind of curved so that we're facing the entrepreneurs and have six feet - six and half feet, actually - between each of the Sharks. It's significantly different in what we had to do to film.</p><p>Was it shot in the same studio?Oh, no, not at all. We were in an undisclosed location, a hotel where we literally were quarantined in the hotel and were not allowed to leave... I think it's already public, it was at a hotel in Vegas.</p><p>But you think it still has the same \"Shark Tank\" appeal?Oh yeah... same intensity, I mean, literally, we had to quarantine, the entrepreneurs had to quarantine. And so when the cameras started rolling, everybody was fired up and ready to go - there was a lot of pent-up energy from just sitting in our rooms basically doing nothing in between shoots. So the intensity was off the charts. The deals were good, because the entrepreneurs really were committed to being there having to go through the quarantine. We had a lot of timely type deals, entrepreneurs who created businesses geared toward the pandemic, entrepreneurs whose businesses had to pivot because of the pandemic or whose backs were against the wall because of the pandemic. You get the same \"Shark Tank\" that you've seen but I think the level of intensity was 2X at least.</p><p>You've been doing this show for more than 11 years. Are you tired of doing it?No, not at all. Helping entrepreneurs, that's my thing. That's what I love to do. I've built and sold a bunch of companies, but now this is my chance to help others... The shooting of the show doesn't take all that much time in the big picture of things, but the message it sends is, the American dream is alive and well, and anybody can start a business and amazing things that can happen to that business.</p><p>The show is produced by Mark Burnett, who basically launched Donald Trump onto the national stage [with \"The Apprentice\"]. Have you had any second thoughts about working with Burnett because of that?No, not at all. Look, I don't try to look at the resume. Mark makes his own decisions, and so does everybody else that I work with in any company or business that I do. I'm not going to pass judgment on anybody like that.</p><p>Also on the topic of Trump, you're a fan of TikTok. What are your thoughts on Trump forcing a sale of TikTok?That's a big question. That's a long answer because there's a lot of things there. There's the technology, there's the AI [artificial intelligence] they use, there's the influence they can create, there's the universe of people who use it - and that's changing - there's the type of content that appears. I can make you an argument in both directions. I don't have a final opinion on it yet, there's just a lot more digging I have to do. But it's not as simple a question as it may seem.</p><p>What about Trump's idea that the U.S. government deserves a piece of the action of the TikTok sale?You know, it's crazy in one respect, but it's not the dumbest idea I've heard from him. It's not the traditional approach to act as an investment banker and take a cut. But whether you call it a cut or call it a tax to enable a transaction, I can live with it... I don't think it's a big deal one way or the other.</p><p>At Variety's CES Entertainment Summit this year you said <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/mark-cuban-ai-tikok-variety-entertainment-summit-1203461358/\">government regulation of Big Tech is inevitable</url>. How do you see this playing forward past the 2020 election?\u00a0So there's a couple things there. One, I think in terms of potential influence on the election by various parties - whether they're foreign or domestic - one of the things that Facebook in particular does, but all the platforms do, is algorithmic amplification. And it also applies to TikTok, for that matter. What they do is say, \"What's most popular and who's it most popular with?\" And then they amplify that message to an audience knowing that they're going to make more money that way because they get more committed viewing or interaction.</p><p>That approach in viewing is protected by <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/joe-biden-slams-facebook-calls-for-revoking-u-s-law-shielding-internet-companies-from-liability-for-speech-1203471171/\">Section 230</url> [of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which shields internet companies from legal liability for content posted on their services]. And so I think that's what needs to change. Anything that a platform uses algorithms to amplify a message for should not be protected by Section 230.</p><p>What do you think will happen in terms of regulation against social media platforms?I don't know. I don't know that people in politics truly understand it. I don't think they understand how much AI is involved. What makes TikTok work? Is it because people just love 15-second videos where people like to dance? It's AI, it's TikTok's algorithms. They do a better job than any other platform of using computer vision and AI to analyze what's in a video and recognizing what's in that video that's amplifying video, and then taking that and amplifying it further to make it an even bigger hit.</p><p>Part of the reason why it starts becoming an antitrust issue is because artificial intelligence is hard. It's really hard and expensive to implement and do right. And because it's so expensive... it ends up being limited to just fewer and fewer companies who are able to do it right. And right now, those are the biggest tech companies.</p><p>And so you can try to break these companies up - but you don't really solve the problem, because the next company that is able to implement AI well will have the same level of success. Two, we don't have a great AI strategy as a country. Those companies are really the most advanced researchers of AI... China and Russia and other countries have a more organized and sovereign approach to AI [than the United States]. And so when you break up these companies, you are really potentially disadvantaging the United States internationally when it comes to AI competition and the future of our economy.</p><p>If Biden wins the presidency, do you think there's a danger of an overcorrection - that U.S. companies would be at a global disadvantage?No, no, I think it's the exact opposite. The strategy Obama-Biden wrote, it was very much a direct approach to increasing government research in AI... A Biden presidency is going to be more science and research driven than what we've seen with Trump.</p><p>You recently told the New York Times that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/10/magazine/mark-cuban-interview.html\">the murder of George Floyd changed you</url>. What changes have you made in your personal and professional life as a result?That's a two-hour question. That's a very personal question... One thing I will mention that's related to \"Shark Tank,\" I've significantly increased the amount of investments I've made into minority founders and minority communities. I'm easily now, with the things I've done this week, past $50 million [invested in minority businesses]. We're investing, we're hiring, we're supporting, we're providing funding for other funds that are focused on minority communities. Because that's really where the change needs to bubble up from... They just have not been given the support that they've needed in the past.</p><p>How do you think the NBA has handled the return to play amid COVID?I think it's been great. Just like we saw with the \"Shark Tank\" bubble, everybody knew what was at stake when we went to the [NBA] bubble in Orlando. I give everybody so much credit, from NBA staff, to Walt Disney staff, to the players, to the teams' staff, for realizing how much is at stake and how important it is. I don't think people have recognized that in a bubble, there are no stars. Nobody gets special treatment.</p><p>How does the absence of a crowd affect the game itself?It's different, that's for sure. Talking to our players, it's different... You don't get the amp from your home-team crowd rooting for you, and you don't get the amp from the opposing team's crowd screaming and yelling and heckling you, but it becomes really personal when they play. You see the professionalism and the strength of character and determination that the players have.</p><p>You were one of the pioneers in streaming media 25 years ago with Broadcast.com [which Yahoo acquired for $5.7 billion]. Did streaming take off slower than you thought?Yeah, a lot slower. It took off far, far slower. If you were to ask me in 1995, I would have told you that by the year 2000 or 2002 we would be exactly where we are today. So I was a little bit ahead of schedule, but here we are... Now all delivery of all content is digital, and that's obviously changed everything.</p><p>Now it's really the Innovator's Dilemma trying to deal with traditional media, and how they try to hold on and how you transition to all streaming, which is exactly what we always thought it would end up being... I think now that the train has left the station in terms of day-and-date [for movie releases], you're probably going to see a lot of consolidation in the theater industry. And it wouldn't shock me to see studios buy out theaters so they have a completely vertical digital chain.</p><p>Back to \"Shark Tank.\" Emmy campaigns obviously are very different this year.We're doing all the Zoom interviews, we're talking to people, trying to get as much leverage as we can to reach Emmy voters. Winning an Emmy, I think, is so important, not as much for the Sharks as it is for all the people who just bust their ass to make that show happen. And particularly now in the pandemic. So few shows are being produced, so few people are working in the industry right now... What we did with Season 11 in inspiring people, hopefully it helps people get through the pandemic. No disrespect to those other shows [nominated in the Emmy's reality/reality competition host category] - they're great, incredible shows - but we're just a little bit different. We inspire people in different ways, and I think that's so needed right now.</p><p>More from Variety</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2020/legit/awards/digital-tony-awards-questions-1234748234/\">What Happens When the Tony Awards Go Virtual?</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/podcasts/james-corden-emmys-broadway-tonys-coronavirus-1234747311/\">James Corden Thinks Streaming Services Should Help Broadway Recover From the Pandemic (Watch)</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/fall-tv-premieres-coronavirus-network-marketers-1234746951/\">As Fall TV Premieres Are Scrambled by COVID, Network Marketers Adjust Their Strategies</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VARETY-1234749498</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VARTY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P3-SB61-JB0P-B199-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1961\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Variety</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 26, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[5] MARK CUBAN ON THE 2020 ELECTION:  Right now, if the election[6] was held today, I think he would win again. I think the real challenge is, the Democrats, whatever the number is, for the most part with two exceptions are just putting out politicians. And they're just-- they're just playing to-- to the evening news, to-- to cable-- to cable news. And that's a problem. You know, when I think of politics and tried-- and what I would look for, I try to ask what are the three things people care about when they wake up in the morning? Not what are the three things that are programmed on cable news each evening. And that's a disconnect that I don't think the Democrats have figured out. I think Donald Trump has recognized that he can drive the conversation right now and take control of it and the Democrats are just falling right behind and right in place and letting him drive the conversation. So, as of today, I think he has the advantage. But there's a long, long way to go and a lot can happen between now and then. MARK CUBAN ON CANDIDATES WHO SOLVE PROBLEMS:  DEIRDRE BOSA: Do you think that there's more room for billionaires in this political landscape running for President? MARK CUBAN: I think there's room for people who will solve problems. I think that's a big-- that's-- a big part of what people are looking for. I think one of the challenges of the Democrats[7] right now is that they put out these big numbers and they say, 'Okay, for-- we'll spend a trillion dollars on buying back student debt. We'll spend 300 billion dollars on this, 200 billion dollars on that.' But they don't say how they're going to use that money to solve problems. MARK CUBAN ON THE SAME OLD, SAME OLD: Look, when I think about why people voted for President Trump[8]\u2014 I think they were smart actually in a lot of respects. They realized that when you vote for a traditional politician you get the traditional political things. And a lot-- the people who voted for Donald Trump didn't want the same old, same old. Yet, here are the Democrats, they're competing with each other to win a primary rather than trying to find solutions for the country. You know, at least there's two non-politicians there. Maybe they'll come up with something unique that'll drive people. But right now again, if the election was held today, I don't think people-- people want someone to fight the battles for them and I don't think they see that coming from the Democrats right now in traditional politicians. I'm not happy about it, but that's what I see. MARK CUBAN ON BIG TECH BREAKUP: People are afraid what the future impacts are going to be. And so, they just take it out on, 'Well, let's just break up these big FANG companies.' That's not what's going to solve it. And again, when you break these companies up you actually give them more power because there's nobody else out there that's small that's going to step in to their place. You'll just have a few more companies doing more of the same thing, but only having the protections of the anti-trust regulations[9]. MARK CUBAN ON REGULATION: Who does it is is a big question. But in terms of regulation, I think we have to really, really be careful. The law of unintended consequences will smack us upside the head in ways we don't expect. You try to stop Facebook from selling data, when you try to put valuations on data, which-- I don't even know what that accomplishes. MARK CUBAN ON INNOVATION: I'm still-- more laissez-faire, where beyond privacy, privacy's a separate issue, but beyond privacy, we need to just encourage development and we need to encourage innovation like Node.io[10] because that's how we're-- we're going to compete. The concept, to me, that Facebook is the end-all, be-all product for news sources or saving pictures or sharing with Grandma is crazy. Same with Instagram. They'll be preempted at some point. It's inevitable. MARK CUBAN ON ANTITRUST ISSUES: I don't see it as an anti-trust problem at all. No one has to use Facebook. You know, there's alternatives for search. You know, just because they've been able to develop a lot -- a big customer base doesn't mean it's anti-trust. And so no, I don't think it's an issue. I do think Facebook has got a lot of issues. MARK CUBAN ON FACEBOOK: I do think Facebook has got a lot of issues in terms of privacy and use of data. But we always have to remember the law of unintended consequences. I mean, people talk about Facebook not wanting to make data available to others. To me, it's scarier Facebook-- it's scarier if Facebook or Google[11] or-- or others keep all the data to themselves because that gives them a significant advantage. So we have to be very careful in how we approach these issues. The post Mark Cuban On Trump, Breaking Up Facebook, And Antitrust[12] appeared first on ValueWalk[13].

In the wide-ranging Q&amp;A with Variety co-editor-in-chief Andrew Wallenstein, Cuban stated flatly that most American businesses have no choice but to integrate AI technology into their strategic plans. He said he's been taking classes to better understand the growing world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p><p>\"If you don't know AI, you're the equivalent of somebody in 1999 saying 'I'm sure this Internet thing will be OK but I don't give a shit,' \" Cuban said during the session at the Aira Las Vegas Resort, held as part of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/quibi-turnstyle-launch-katzenberg-whitman-1203460384/\">CES</url> conference that runs through Thursday. \"If you want to be relevant in business, you have to or you will be a dinosaur very quickly. .. There's going to be AI haves and have-nots. If you're a have not, you might as well rip out all the computers in your office and throw away your phones. That's how impactful it's going to be.\"</p><p>Cuban noted that he has learned how to program his digital assistant Alexa to tease his children. \"I'll ask 'Who is Jacob Cuban?' And she'll say 'Jacob Cuban is also known as the fart master.' \"</p><p>The TikTok platform that has come on strong in the U.S. in the last year has also been a source of family bonding for the Cubans. As a father of three, he appreciates the mostly family-friendly focus of the platform known for its 15-second videos. He was shocked to see that a video of him dancing with his children got 1.6 million views in 20 hours.</p><p>\"Families doing stupid dances that we like to do - it brings us together and it's a completely different platform\" than other big social media sites. </p><p>Pressed by Wallenstein about the prospect for heavier regulation coming to the tech world, Cuban said that some tighter governmental controls are probably inevitable. \"Facebook has stepped in it so many times that somebody's going to do something,\" he said. \"It's inevitable that Facebook needs to be regulated and we'll see what happens to Twitter.\"</p><p>The devil of regulation, of course, is in the details. Cuban said he hopes there will be an intelligent and reasoned approach to regulation, \"or the law of unintended consequences could bite us.\"</p><p>But on the question of whether Facebook, Google and others are so dominant in their markets that they need to be broken up - as has become a rallying cry on the campaign trail - Cuban said the answer is an unequivocal no.</p><p>\"That would be stupid,\" he said. One important reason why he believes that is because the behemoths are \"doing the research that's keeping our country competitive with other countries in terms of AI.\"</p><p>If Facebook, Google and Amazon were broken up, they would not have the same resources to invest in cutting-edge research.</p><p>\"This is the new space mission,\" Cuban said of AI. \"We really, really, really, really, really need to invest in it.

These, asking forgiveness from Shakespeare, are the watchwords of the coming year. And don't forget Amazon HQ2. First, though, let's survey 2017.In my outlook column a year ago, I called it the big question mark: Would new President Donald Trump govern as a conventional Republican with tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, killing Obamacare and attacking the safety net? Would he be a populist, as sold to his base during the campaign?</p><p> And would this affect Seattle's boom with an anti-city agenda? As it turned out, both the national and regional economy continued their growth, despite Trump's scandals and breaking of norms. An effort to kill Obamacare and take health insurance from tens of millions failed. But Republicans finally rammed through a huge tax cut. And embedded in that legislation may be provisions that undo his predecessor's health-care achievement anyway. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]As usual, I laid down no predictions. Instead, my markers were how much Boeing's slowdown would affect the regional economy (not much); would Trump's trade threats hurt our export-driven sectors (hard to tell because trade has continued a multiyear slowdown), and would the Trump administration punish blue metros with funding cutbacks (so far, stalled by federal courts). Seattle's economy continued to be hot this year \u2014 too hot for some \u2014 although the pace of growth slowed. We continued to be the crane capital of the nation and lead in house-price appreciation. Amazon kept leasing, including in the new landmark skyscraper going up at Rainier Square. On to the markers for 2018:Bubbles Stocks, bonds and housing appear at or near record highs \u2014 and not just in the United States \u2014 causing some economists to warn of an asset 'omnibubble.' Don't forget bitcoin. And the debt that will be added to the federal government by the Republican tax measure. Trump's determination to swing regulation to favor big banks and Wall Street is yet another cause for concern. We went to this rodeo in the 2000s and the results were ugly. On the other hand, inflation is low and growth is far from overheating. Much will depend on how the Federal Reserve unwinds the massive balance sheet it accumulated in fending off the worst of the Great Recession.If I knew the answer here, I wouldn't need this newspaper job. But it definitely needs watching. This is an aging expansion, and even a mild recession \u2014 combined with other forces such as new tax cuts for the very rich \u2014 will widen inequality further. Most Americans have yet to recoup their household wealth from before the last recession.Big Tech's overreach A stock-market correction or sharp retreat would badly maul tech shares \u2014 and job growth. But beyond that is a growing anti-Silicon Valley mood that touches Seattle, too.It was captured in a recent article in Wired[2], hardly a Luddite outlet. The headline read: 'The Other Tech Bubble.' As in, the bubble the industry lives in, seeing itself as heroic, successful, driving progress. Outside, many are less enamored as the 'disrupters' break the law, tech hubs see astronomical housing costs, and more.'In 2008, it was Wall Street bankers,' wrote Wired's Erin Griffith. 'In 2017, tech workers are the world's villain.' And maybe 2018. The article contains this gut punch: 'As headlines have exposed the troubling inner workings of company after company, startup culture no longer feels like fodder for gentle parodies about Ping-Pong and hoodies. It feels ugly and rotten.'Facebook, the greatest startup success story of this era, isn't a merry band of hackers building cutesy tools that allow you to digitally Poke your friends. It's a powerful and potentially sinister collector of personal data, a propaganda partner to government censors, and an enabler of discriminatory advertising.' Of course, the bankers got away with it. But the surly mood in much of the nation is not to be ignored.Amazon HQ2The company is expected to announce the location of its 'full equal' second headquarters. It will be interesting to see if the company was honest about the assets it was seeking beyond incentives \u2014 or if it goes out into a car-dependent office 'park.' It will be ominous to watch the state of play in months and years to come, because ultimately there will be one headquarters \u2014 barring a breakup. A new effort by City Hall to constructively engage with Seattle's largest employer is apparently happening \u2014 and perhaps just in time. My HQ2 picks are Denver, Dallas, New York City, Boston and the D.C. suburbs on rail transit. Toronto if Amazon wants to hedge against Trumpism. Dark horses: Atlanta, the Twin Cities and Pittsburgh. I am assuming Amazon doesn't want it to be on the same time zone as Seattle, so I leave out West Coast locations. If Amazon is being honest about what it wants, almost every other locale is out of contention.Trade Washington is heavily dependent on commerce with the world, however one measures. It's No. 3 among the states in merchandise exports, and at or near the top in per capita exports. This contributes to the state's prosperity, good jobs and economic diversification \u2014 but it will continue to be tested by Trump's 'America First' stance. This year, renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been contentious. The agreement could fall apart in 2018. While life would go on, the economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico are so intertwined that the shock would be severe. It could cause a recession. Trump also has been tough on China,Washington state's largest export customer, while trying to flatter Chinese President Xi Jinping. China has sometimes been a bad actor in trade, no doubt. But the administration lacks a coherent strategy for addressing this without harming American jobs \u2014 or backing down. In the life-might-not-go-on category, we have North Korea, armed with thermonuclear weapons and missiles that can apparently reach the continental United States. Earlier this month, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said the chance of war was 'increasing each day.' About Pyongyang's nukes, he said, 'We can't tolerate that risk.' Even a 'limited' nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula has the potential to kill millions.It amazes me so few Americans are paying attention. So there it is. I wish you a Happy New Year hoping the dark markers here are proved wrong.

As such, it is one of the most important global themes for marketers in 2020.</p><p><br/><br/>Lawmakers in many markets across the globe are implementing stronger data protection rights which will have significant implications for marketers. Specifically, in the US, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) comes into force this month.<br/><br/>&lt;!--EMBED:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/82/199803.html\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/82/199803.html</url> :EMBED--&gt;<br/>Like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the CCPA limits how companies can collect, store, use and share customer data and gives consumers more control over their personal information. While the new regulations change the data landscape, there are opportunities for brands to present themselves as 'privacy first' to consumers wary of how their data is being used.<br/><br/>More than half of respondents to the Marketer's Toolkit 2020 survey (52%) believe they need to strengthen their data policies. Almost a quarter (23%) of respondents in Asia have no form of data protection in place compared with 14% globally.<br/><br/>Dave Grimaldi, executive vice president, Public Policy, Interactive Advertising Bureau, cautions: \"The misuse of consumer data under this new CCPA regime could be the death knell for a company. We hope it won't be, but this is why marketers must act now.\"<br/><br/>In China, meanwhile, the Personal Information Security Specification proposes an \"unbundling\" of data protection consents, which will affect the ability to use consumers' personal data for marketing purposes. Marketers can expect greater scrutiny, particularly on data that are deployed for personalised marketing, such as transaction data, location and device data, and behavioural data.<br/><br/>Consent management and 'small data' are top priorities for 2020<br/>Consent, permissions and transparency will be the new normal for marketers in 2020. The Warc survey finds 57% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they are \"readdressing consent management practices in light of privacy regulation\".<br/><br/>&lt;!--EMBED:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/19/198842.html\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/19/198842.html</url> :EMBED--&gt;<br/>Some are investing in consent management platforms (CMPs) which collect and store customers' consent data, enabling marketers to keep track of peoples' privacy preferences and permissions.<br/><br/>Marketers are also prioritising first-party data, with 58% of respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing that they have a strategy for actively collecting first-party data from customers. Not only is first-party data compliant with regulations, but it also gives brands the opportunity to identify and engage with opt-in customers who actually want to hear from them.<br/><br/>Like Europe's GDPR before it, CCPA encourages companies to have a data minimisation strategy i.e. companies should not keep data they do not need. In this environment, marketers may pivot from big data, to smaller, smarter, more secure data, enabling marketers to nurture relationships with lots of smaller, niche communities of opt-in consumers.<br/><br/>Jill Baskin, chief marketing officer, The Hershey Company, says: \"For us, a big part of it is whether we agree with how our partners are using data. We just want to get a lot more transparency from our partners... How are they keeping [data]? We want to have not just what's the legal thing, but what we ethically think is right.\"<br/><br/>Ivan Pollard, chief marketing officer, General Mills, comments: \"We're going to keep making sure we're doing the right thing with data. I don't think it's enough to do a 'click here and accept our terms and conditions,' knowing that 90% of people never read them. We've got to be clear about what we're asking for and what we're going to do with it. That's number one.\"<br/><br/>&lt;!--EMBED:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/16/199532.html\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/16/199532.html</url> :EMBED--&gt;<br/>Regulation of big tech is welcomed by marketers as well as consumers<br/>Big tech firms are under increased scrutiny by consumers and lawmakers.

Even if consumer privacy is not being unjustifiably violated, the monetisation of data by major platforms has become a social, political and regulatory lightning rod.\"<br/><br/>A study by YouGov found that just over half of global consumers want to see more regulation of tech and social media companies. This attitude is shared by marketers: 86% of Warc's survey respondents think big tech companies should be subject to greater regulation.<br/><br/>Consumers will take more control over their data and their digital identities<br/>Several surveys have found that consumers are being much choosier about where and how they share information.<br/><br/>Research by Dentsu Aegis revealed that 44% of global consumers have taken steps to reduce the amount of data they share online. The Advertising Research Foundation found that US consumers have become less willing to share various aspects of personal data. <br/><br/>Recent research by Fudan University and Publicis Media China showed Chinese consumers are most likely to share basic demographic or behavioural information, but they are most concerned about sharing highly-sensitive biometric/healthcare or legal/financial data. And a recent study by consulting firm Accenture found consumers are suspicious of emerging technologies that promise to make their lives easier while collecting more data about them.<br/><br/>Brands recognise this shift. 66% of respondents to the Warc Marketer's Toolkit survey agreed or strongly agreed that consumers will take greater control of their data in 2020.<br/><br/>&lt;!--EMBED:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/19/198804.html\">https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/19/198804.html</url> :EMBED--&gt;<br/>New tech has driven fresh concerns. Connected devices such as Google's Nest thermostat, Amazon's Alexa and Facebook's Portal TV are capable of gathering rich consumer data and are increasingly common in private spaces such as peoples' homes or cars. Marketers engaging in emerging tech should review how they are using consumer data, and ensure they are compliant with data privacy laws.<br/><br/>Warc's Marketer's Toolkit 2020 is based on a survey of almost 800 client and agency-side practitioners around the world, combined with insights from a series of interviews with chief marketing officers, backed by evidence from Warc Data, case studies and expert opinion.<br/><br/>The report, available to download here, covers five key drivers of change: society, tech, economy, industry and policy.

Via DataTrekResearch.com,[3]  Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell seemed quite comfortable today during his testimony in front of the US Congress' Joint Economic Committee.His prior public appearances this year have not always gone as smoothly, of course. But his prepared remarks were clear and he managed the Q...ession reasonably well.    Markets endorsed his comments, signaling that they believe Fed policy is well calibrated to their expectations of the near-term US economic environment:  Just after Powell's session wrapped up, Fed Funds Futures for December tightened up even further around the belief that the Fed will not move rates at the next meeting. The odds now (96.3%) versus yesterday (95.6%) show almost complete conviction on this point. </p><p> Looking out through Q1 2020, Fed Funds Futures put 74.3% odds that the Fed will not move rates through this period, up from 71.9% yesterday.  The same message of 'no further Fed action' even holds through Q2 2020, with futures now pricing 65.7% odds of rates remaining unchanged from today. Yesterday, they were 61.9%.  You have to go all the way to November/December 2020 to find essentially coin-flip odds that the Fed will cut rates (49% in each month).  Even 2-year Treasuries mirror this sentiment that rates are 'just right', with a yield of 1.63% that sits right on top of today's effective Fed Funds rate of 1.55%.  Three issues during Chair Powell's testimony did, however, perk up our ears:  #1: A question about the relationship between rising US industrial concentration and slower than expected wage growth at this late point in an economic cycle.We have been highlighting the work of NYU professor Thomas Philippon on rising industry concentration. This is an important and growing political narrative, and not just tied to 'Big Tech' companies.  Chair Powell said rising industry concentration may be one explanation, but other factors also play important roles. Specifically, he cited:  Lower US worker productivity  Remaining slack in the labor market, as evidenced by still-rising participation  The effects of rising levels of automation and globalization  Lower unionization levels  Neutral interest rates that may be lower than where the Fed thinks they are  Takeaway: the issue of industry concentration is clearly top of mind in DC, with lawmakers/regulators concerned that the US economy's 'commanding heights' have too few occupants.  #2: There were 2 questions about a recent Columbia University paper about 'Inflation Inequality'.Chair Powell said he was familiar with the work. Here is a brief summary (paper link at the end of this section):  Poverty rates use the Consumer Price Index to adjust for inflation over time. This has been the approach to determine household need for programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, aka 'food stamps') for decades.  The CPI, however, may not accurately reflect the change in prices for the basket of goods and services consumed by lower-income households. One academic paper (Jaravel 2019) calculated that CPI under-reported inflation for this cohort by 0.44 points annually from 2004 - 2015.  By extension (but not in the paper), the Fed's symmetrical 2% inflation target may serve to exacerbate income inequality, since those at the bottom of the income scale are seeing larger price increases than more affluent demographic cohorts.  Takeaway: while this issue is unlikely to change the Fed's dual mandate, Chair Powell seems keenly aware that future political independence will require the central bank to be responsive to social issues like income inequality.At the margin that means Fed policy could drift more dovish than neutral, for reasons we explain in the next point.  #3: Chair Powell mentioned several times that the US has lower levels of labor force participation (LFP) among prime-aged (25 -54 year old) workers than most wealthy economies.This is quite true, as data from the OECD shows (link below for more):  The US prime aged LFP was 82.1% in 2018.  Among the G-7 countries, only Italy is lower at 77.9%.  Other major economies all show higher levels that are 4 - 6 points higher: UK (86.3%), Japan (87.4%), Germany (87.7%) and France (88.1%).  Takeaway: like the prior point, this is another spot where social issues intersect with how the Fed considers its policy mandates.Chair Powell constantly reiterates what seems to be his key observation from recent 'Fed Listens' events: that a 'hot' economy pulls workers into the labor force, and that's a desirable outcome. By comparing the US LFP rates to other wealthy economies, his implicit message is that as long as inflation remains contained the Fed will focus on improving US labor force participation.  Summing up: for the first time in what seems like years the market and the Federal Reserve agree that current interest rate policy is correct.Yes, there is some bias in Fed Funds Futures to believing the next move will be a cut. But that's more likely to come in the second half of 2020 rather than at the next few meetings. Given Chair Powell's more expansive view of what constitutes 'full employment' and the lack of general price inflation, assuming the Fed remains in 'stealth dove' mode is reasonable.

His flagship mutual fund, Third Avenue Value which Whitman co manages with Ian Lapey is 20 years old this week. Although it had a tough 2008, losing about 45% of its value, it has rebounded. Its 15 year annual return of 9.82% beats 89% of its Morningstar peers.</p><p> Marty Whitman said lessons learned from the financial meltdown included the great importance of the balance sheet. The other lesson is the importance of management. </p><p> Although a value investor, he avoids \"permanent impairment\" situations, unlike a lot of value investors, so that he did not invest in Fannie Mae or Countrywide or Lehman or Bear Stearns.  He added that 20 years ago his investments were strictly in North America, now they are over 60% in Asia. In well regulated markets, he said there is not a lot of difference between East Asia and North America.</p><p> He dismissed modern portfolio ideas as possibly \"of some use to day traders and high frequency traders. But as far as value investing, control investing, distress investing and credit analysis is concerned, that stuff is absolute garbage\".</p><p> He said, \"Every accounting number is important and is derived from other accounting numbers. So you have to understand the whole accounting cycle. If I want to estimate earnings, and I only have one tool, I would pick the current balance sheet. As a value investor, what you are interested in is whether the company is creating wealth. There are four ways to create wealth - it is not just cash flow\".</p><p> He said \"They are one, having cash flow from operations available to security holders. Two, and probably much more important is having earnings, which we define as creating wealth while consuming cash. The third - and very, very important - value creation method is resource conversion (such as) mergers and acquisitions, changes in control, massive recapitalisations, spinoffs etc. The fourth wealth-creation method .. is having extremely attractive access to capital markets\".</p><p> He added that he does not invest in companies that need relatively continuous access to the capital markets where shorts are capable of bringing them down.</p><p> Marty Whitman added that there are now an awful lot of American companies whose common stocks are attractively priced and meet our criteria, \"very much like what Hong Kong was for us five years ago\".</p><p> In other news</p><p> Halliburton in a six page statement late Thursday denied its cement used for the Macondo well was unstable and incapable of holding back the oil and gas in the well but said no stability test was conducted on the actual recipe for the cement used on the well. The company said BP had ordered a change in Halliburton's customary formula for cement by adding a higher proportion of a  chemical that slows the hardening of the mixture. The well blew out on  April 20, killing 11 workers and eventually releasing nearly 5 million barrels of oil into the gulf. Further tests are continuing under the seven member presidential spill commission. </p><p> Halliburton also took issue with a round of testing of similar cement performed by Chevron, saying the Chevron tests were not performed on exactly similar cement as that used on the Macondo well.</p><p> *The Financial Times reported Spanish bank Santander plans to list on the London Stock Exchange, after its UK banking business is already a household name in the British banking market. It has been writing about 1/5th of new mortgages in the UK and has increased its lending to small business, the Financial Times reported, but is</p><p> trying to drive its business more up market.

While a Democratic party sweep of the presidency and Congress could pose risks to industry as varied as higher corporate taxes, Medicare for All[1], or a ban on fracking[2], there is one threat that is likely to loom over the U.S. stock market regardless of the outcome: antitrust.  A growing bipartisan skepticism of the power of big technology firms has helped spark a renewed interest in long-dormant federal and state powers for regulating the market power of corporations. Google parent Alphabet Inc.</p><p> GOOG, 0.39%[3], Facebook Inc.  FB, 0.28%[4], Amazon Inc. AMZN, -0.72%[5] and Apple Inc.  AAPL, 1.41%[6] are all being investigated[7] by a Republican party led Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Justice Department over antitrust concerns, while a bipartisan coalition of 47 state attorneys general have launched a separate investigation into Facebook. [8] These actions could be the beginning of a sea change in U.S. antitrust policy after a half-century of relatively lax enforcement and they threaten to harm stock valuations in the tech and health care sectors as well as the S...00 index  SPX, 0.11%[9] more broadly, analysts say. In the long term though any resulting increase in competition could be good news for the overall U.S. economy.  'Technology has grown much more oligopolistic over the last 10 to 20 years, so the number of companies at the top is few, but their size is massive,' Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy told MarketWatch.  She compared large tech companies today to the financial services sector from 2005 through 2007, when large banks took advantage of light regulation to grow bigger while corporate governance started to 'deteriorate.'  'Thinking about how to stop that continued steamroller effect from tech companies is an area that has essentially bipartisan support in Washington at this point,' she added. 'That is one reason we downgraded technologywe could see some of these regulatory concerns weigh on the multiples of these stocks.'The costs of monopoly powerThomas Philippon, professor of finance at the New York Stern School of Business and author of recently published book 'The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets' said in an interview that during the past 20 years, 'concentration has increased in most U.S. industries' since the 1990s, and not just in the technology sphere.  The result of this trend has been higher prices for consumers and lower pay for workers.  In his book, he pointed to a 2017 study by market research firm BDRC Continental that shows that 'in most advanced economies, consumers pay around $35 a month for broad band internet connections. In the U.S., they pay almost double.'  As for airfares, in 2010 both European and U.S. airliners reaped about the same profit-per-passenger, but after a wave of mergers during the past decade, the U.S. companies reap $22.40 per passenger, while their European rivals garner just $7.84.  These trends have also impacted worker wages, as growing industry concentration reduces competition for labor, Philippon said. Growing market power has also coincided with a rising use of non-compete clauses in worker contracts that prevent them from going to work for rivals. A return to the New Deal consensusThese trends that have harmed the consumer and the American worker have resulted in more activists and politicians calling for a return to the sort of pro-competition public policy that began to form in the 1910s and reigned supreme through the 1970s.  Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Market Institute, tells the story in his recently published book 'Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy' of the history of U.S. antitrust policy which began in 1890 when Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act.  In the mid-twentieth century there was a bipartisan consensus around pro-competition policy as conservative small-business owners and liberal labor interests came together to support a federal government that would block mergers and force powerful companies to license intellectual property in an effort to promote competition. The New Deal consensus of the 1930s on antitrust policy began to fall apart in the 1970s, as the courts began interpreting antitrust laws as proscribing mergers only on the basis of consumer protection. But even by these standards, the federal government has been negligent, according to a research[10] by John Kwoka, an economist at Northwestern University, who found that during the past 20 years, 80% of mergers have led to one form of price increase or another. Monopoly: good for shareholders?Politicians like Elizabeth Warren are proposing laws[11] that would strengthen antitrust oversight and force courts to broaden their views, but business leaders are also joining the fight, with figures like Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes[12] and Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppleman calling for stricter antitrust oversight of big tech.  All of which raises the question: what could a reinvigorated pro-competition regime in Washington do to stock valuations?  In the short term at least, it wouldn't be good for the S...00 index  SPX, 0.11%[13]. Philippon estimated that if the U.S. were readopt a strict antitrust approach, it would raise aggregate GDP by $1 trillion, while raising worker pay and benefits by $1.25 trillion. Such a result would be positive for the vast majority of Americans who earn most of their income from labor, but it would lead to a $250 billion reduction in corporate profits. There may be bright spots for shareholders too though. Bank of America's Subramanian, for instance, said that companies that face few competitors risk becoming complacent and sloppy in their execution. 'Something we have been paying attention to in tech is that these companiesare starting to show some signs of fraying in terms of their shareholder or stakeholder focus,' she said. While pro-competition policy may reduce shareholder value in the short run, there is also reason to believe that it leads to greater innovation and therefore faster economic growth and more valuable public companies in the long run. Stoller points to the Microsoft antitrust suit, adjudicated in the 1990s, as an example.  'In the early 2000s, Microsoft, due in part to fear of antitrust action, refrained from using its power over browsers to keep a scrappy upstart called Google from reaching users,' he wrote in a recent op-ed in The Wall Street Journal[14]. 'Antitrust oxygenated the market; a lack of antitrust has now allowed Google to turn into the monopolist of today.' Philippon concurred, telling MarketWatch that while it is difficult to quantify, 'Competition drives innovation to a great extent. More competition would likely spur innovation and increase the long-term growth of the economy.'The post Market Extra: Do growing calls for antitrust action threaten the S...00 index as the 2020 election nears?[15] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[16].

While a Democratic party sweep of the presidency and Congress could pose risks to industry as varied as higher corporate taxes, Medicare for All[1], or a ban on fracking[2], there is one threat that is likely to loom over the U.S. stock market regardless of the outcome: antitrust.  A growing bipartisan skepticism of the power of big technology firms has helped spark a renewed interest in long-dormant federal and state powers for regulating the market power of corporations. Google parent Alphabet Inc.</p><p> GOOG, 0.57%[3], Facebook Inc.  FB, 0.33%[4], Amazon Inc. AMZN, -1.15%[5] and Apple Inc.  AAPL, 1.47%[6] are all being investigated[7] by a Republican party led Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Justice Department over antitrust concerns, while a bipartisan coalition of 47 state attorneys general have launched a separate investigation into Facebook. [8] These actions could be the beginning of a sea change in U.S. antitrust policy after a half-century of relatively lax enforcement and they threaten to harm stock valuations in the tech and health care sectors as well as the S...00 index  SPX, 0.15%[9] more broadly, analysts say. In the long term though any resulting increase in competition could be good news for the overall U.S. economy.  'Technology has grown much more oligopolistic over the last 10 to 20 years, so the number of companies at the top is few, but their size is massive,' Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy told MarketWatch.  She compared large tech companies today to the financial services sector from 2005 through 2007, when large banks took advantage of light regulation to grow bigger while corporate governance started to 'deteriorate.'  'Thinking about how to stop that continued steamroller effect from tech companies is an area that has essentially bipartisan support in Washington at this point,' she added. 'That is one reason we downgraded technologywe could see some of these regulatory concerns weigh on the multiples of these stocks.'The costs of monopoly powerThomas Philippon, professor of finance at the New York Stern School of Business and author of recently published book 'The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets' said in an interview that during the past 20 years, 'concentration has increased in most U.S. industries' since the 1990s, and not just in the technology sphere. The result of this trend has been higher prices for consumers and lower pay for workers.  In his book, he pointed to a 2017 study by market research firm BDRC Continental that shows that 'in most advanced economies, consumers pay around $35 a month for broad band internet connections. In the U.S., they pay almost double.'  As for airfares, in 2010 both European and U.S. airliners reaped about the same profit-per-passenger, but after a wave of mergers during the past decade, the U.S. companies reap $22.40 per passenger, while their European rivals garner just $7.84.  These trends have also impacted worker wages, as growing industry concentration reduces competition for labor, Philippon said. Growing market power has also coincided with a rising use of non-compete clauses in worker contracts that prevent them from going to work for rivals.A return to the New Deal consensusThese trends that have harmed the consumer and the American worker have resulted in more activists and politicians calling for a return to the sort of pro-competition public policy that began to form in the 1910s and reigned supreme through the 1970s.  Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Market Institute, tells the story in his recently published book 'Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy' of the history of U.S. antitrust policy which began in 1890 when Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act.  In the mid-twentieth century there was a bipartisan consensus around pro-competition policy as conservative small-business owners and liberal labor interests came together to support a federal government that would block mergers and force powerful companies to license intellectual property in an effort to promote competition. The New Deal consensus of the 1930s on antitrust policy began to fall apart in the 1970s, as the courts began interpreting antitrust laws as proscribing mergers only on the basis of consumer protection. But even by these standards, the federal government has been negligent, according to a research[10] by John Kwoka, an economist at Northwestern University, who found that during the past 20 years, 80% of mergers have led to one form of price increase or another. Monopoly: good for shareholders?Politicians like Elizabeth Warren are proposing laws[11] that would strengthen antitrust oversight and force courts to broaden their views, but business leaders are also joining the fight, with figures like Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes[12] and Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppleman calling for stricter antitrust oversight of big tech.  All of which raises the question: what could a reinvigorated pro-competition regime in Washington do to stock valuations?  In the short term at least, it wouldn't be good for the S...00 index  SPX, 0.15%[13]. Philippon estimated that if the U.S. were readopt a strict antitrust approach, it would raise aggregate GDP by $1 trillion, while raising worker pay and benefits by $1.25 trillion. Such a result would be positive for the vast majority of Americans who earn most of their income from labor, but it would lead to a $250 billion reduction in corporate profits. There may be bright spots for shareholders too though. Bank of America's Subramanian, for instance, said that companies that face few competitors risk becoming complacent and sloppy in their execution. 'Something we have been paying attention to in tech is that these companiesare starting to show some signs of fraying in terms of their shareholder or stakeholder focus,' she said. While pro-competition policy may reduce shareholder value in the short run, there is also reason to believe that it leads to greater innovation and therefore faster economic growth and more valuable public companies in the long run. Stoller points to the Microsoft antitrust suit, adjudicated in the 1990s, as an example.  'In the early 2000s, Microsoft, due in part to fear of antitrust action, refrained from using its power over browsers to keep a scrappy upstart called Google from reaching users,' he wrote in a recent op-ed in The Wall Street Journal[14]. 'Antitrust oxygenated the market; a lack of antitrust has now allowed Google to turn into the monopolist of today.' Philippon concurred, telling MarketWatch that while it is difficult to quantify, 'Competition drives innovation to a great extent. More competition would likely spur innovation and increase the long-term growth of the economy.'The post Market Extra: Do growing calls for antitrust action threaten the S...00 index as the 2020 election nears?[15] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[16].

Elizabeth Warren who has threatened to break up his social-media empire.  Read: Billionaire investor on Elizabeth Warren as president: Market might not even open[1] On Tuesday, The Verge published[2] text and leaked audio it says was from a recent internal meetings at the Menlo Park, Calif-based tech behemoth, where Zuckerberg fielded questions amid a barrage of antitrust probes and calls for the company to split itself up. Here's an excerpt from Zuckerberg's remarks:  I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. </p><p>And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that's not the position that you want to be in when you're, you know, I meanit's like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight. The Massachusetts Democrat and presidential hopeful for 2020 has been at the epicenter of calls to break up technology giants like Facebook Inc.  FB, -0.69%[3], as well as Google-parent Alphabet Inc.  GOOG, -2.36%[4] GOOGL, -2.33%[5] and Amazon.com Inc.  AMZN, -1.29%[6]. Warren has pledged that if she's elected president, she would split up the big technology companies:  'Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,' she wrote in a March 8 blog post on Medium[7].  On Tuesday, she fired back at the reports about Zuckerberg via Twitter, saying:  'What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anti-competitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.' What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/rI0v55KKAi\">https://t.co/rI0v55KKAi</url>[8] \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019[9] She said that she's not 'afraid to hold Big Tech companies' accountable: I'm not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.

Late last month, Zuckerberg made a surprise visit to Washington, D.C.[14] to meet with lawmakers, after failing to make an appearance at congressional hearings about the company's role in influencing the surprise outcome of the 2016 presidential election won by President Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton.  In Verge's audio[15], Zuckerberg makes the case that breaking up big technology companies won't achieve lawmakers desired antitrust ends and may actually exacerbate problems: 'It's just that breaking up these companies, whether it's Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues. And, you know, it doesn't make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together.'  Shares of Facebook were down 1% on Tuesday but have gained 34% so far in 2019 and 8.4% over the past 12 months. That's better than the broad-market S...00 index  SPX, -1.79%[16] which has gained 17.8% so far this year and logged a roughly 1% gain over the past year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA, -1.86%[17] has gained 14.3% thus far in 2019 but has been flat over the past year, according to FactSet data.  In Zuckerberg's Facebook profile, he said his comments were meant to be for his internal staffers, but wrote 'now that it's out there, you can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics like social responsibility, breaking up tech companies.'The post Market Extra: Facebook's Zuckerberg says he would 'go to the mat' over 'existential' threat to his business from Elizabeth Warren[18] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[19].

Yesterday the price drifted 6p to 415p as an extraordinary (but believable) story did the rounds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We hear that the company has agreed an important acquisition in the US, probably a portfolio of drugs rather than the takeover of another company,\" one market shrewdy said. \"It is likely to be worth something around pounds 500m, but there is also some sort of debt financing with the deal.</p><p>\"Our understanding is that the Financial Times will be running the story on Friday and a formal statement will be released after that.\"</p><p> The wider drug sector was not in the best of health, with Shire Pharmaceutical off 48p at pounds 12.64, after investors were unnerved by speculation that the company's top-selling treatment for hyperactive children, Adderall, might face generic competition much earlier than expected.</p><p> Thanks though to a strong bank sector and some progress by the big oil companies, the FTSE 100 ended the day 32.8 points ahead at 5,437.4. Earlier, continued fretting in the telecom sector helped send the index as low as 5,322 before nerves settled.</p><p> Among the banks, news that the Bank of Scotland / Halifax merger had been nodded through by competition regulators clearly helped sentiment, even though the decision had been expected. BoS added 15.5p to 792.5p and Halifax gained 27p to 805p, while the speculators were again busy in the market for Alliance &amp; Leicester , up 10p at 821p.</p><p> Abbey National , which some sector watchers expected to launch a deal-wrecking bid for either Halifax or BoS, gained 51p to pounds 12.52 as the chances of a cavalier hostile move receded.</p><p> Most of the big tech stocks were hit by the dreadful statement from Misys accompanying its year-end figures. The warning of tough times in its core banking systems division saw the price crash 117p to 308p, dragging Sage Group down 15p to 215p, while Reuters lost 17p to 769p.</p><p> Marconi fell to 93p after the Misys warning and Wednes day's heated annual meeting, but later recovered to 98p, down 1.5p.</p><p> Elsewhere there were sudden and exceptionally strong rumours of a bid at Brixton , the property group, whose shares jumped from 215.5p to 235.5p. The past two years have, of course, seen a rash of property companies being taken private, with both managements and investors exasperated at the huge dis counts to net asset value seen in the sector.</p><p> Meanwhile, indicative terms appeared for Dewhirst, the clothing manufacturer and Marks &amp; Spencer supplier, with directors and members of the founding family offering 85p a share. The bid to take the business private values Dewhirst at pounds 113m. The market price rose 10p to 81.5p.</p><p> Incepta , the advertising and public relations group which has seen its shares fall from 124p to a low of 45p over the past 12 months, perked up 5.5p to 52.5p. Sentiment in the stock was helped by news of the Havas deal to buy Tempus , whose shares soared 201.5p to 562p.</p><p> Whittard of Chelsea , the tea retailer which announced fourth months ago that it had received a bid approach, yesterday said that while it was continuing those discussions with an unnamed party it had also begun talks with various other potential bidders. The shares were marked 3p higher to 34p in response.</p><p> Action Computer Supplies , which issued a statement late on Wednesday saying it had received a bid approach, leapt 8.25p to 44p when trading restarted yesterday morning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-3ECB3ECB40C6EE0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:43J7-HXF0-00VR-R10Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"614\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Guardian (London)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Guardian Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>July 20, 2001</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0SHIRE PLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0SANTANDER UK PLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>\u00a0SAGE GROUP PLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SHPG (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0SHP (LSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>\u00a0SGE (LSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>\u00a0SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Introduction</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><anchor id=\"ref5b0180\"/>Marketing as an academic and managerial discipline is fundamentally concerned with understanding consumers and enabling firms to leverage consumer insights to deliver value and sustainably achieve efficient marketplace outcomes (<link><marker>Day &amp; Moorman, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0180\"/></link>; <link><marker>Vargo &amp; Lusch, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0700\"/></link>). However, the preferences and behaviors of consumers are not solely defined by their focal transactions and commercial relationships often observed through the narrow lens of a single stylized construct (<link><marker>Houston, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0345\"/></link>; <link><marker>McAlister, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0445\"/></link>). Consumption and consumers are interwoven with contemporary society, and consumers are complex living entities that are constantly evolving under the influence of macro factors beyond that of their immediate commercial environments.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0350\"/>As technological, business-model, and socioeconomic changes continue to accelerate and influence market structures, consumer experiences, and competitive forces, the ability for firms to understand, anticipate, and adapt to these changes is paramount for sustainable success. In the past decade, marketing has proposed new organizational perspectives for thriving in the presence of these forces. A significant theoretical development is the concept of the \"outside-in\" perspective of the firm, which has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years <link><marker>(Day &amp; Moorman, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0180\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hunt &amp; Madhavaram, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0350\"/></link>; <link><marker>Moorman &amp; Day, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0465\"/></link>; <link><marker>Mu, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0480\"/></link>; <link><marker>Mu, Bao, Sekhon, Qi, &amp; Love, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0485\"/></link>; <link><marker>Musarra &amp; Morgan, 2020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0495\"/></link>; <link><marker>Quach, Thaichon, Lee, Weaven, &amp; Palmatier, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0565\"/></link>; <link><marker>Rust, 2019)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0595\"/></link>. The outside-in perspective shifts managerial focus outside the traditional boundaries of the firm to facilitate understanding of external forces that may significantly influence firm performance and expand knowledge of how different participants inside and outside the firm interact to create value. The benefits of the outside-in perspective are improved market-sensing, customer engaging, and partner-linking.</p><p>The extant outside-in perspective is often focused on marketplace factors such as technological trends and competitive activities. However, as consumers are more informed and influenced by megatrends in the external environment, we believe that modern firm strategies should consider a broader set of macro factors beyond these marketplace forces. We build upon the outside-in perspective by examining the substantial developments in the macro contexts as well as their trajectories into the future, and consider how these megatrends affect consumer behaviors and firms' abilities to market-sense in both short and long-term.</p><p>Our proposed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">marketing ecosystem</emphasis> perspective expands on the marketplace lens of the existing outside-in view, and broadens it to consciously incorporate five interrelated macro factors that differ in scale and in the speed in which they shape consumer behaviors and firm strategies. The marketing ecosystem perspective recognizes that marketing is a bigger \"open system\" than previously conceptualized, and calls for firms to harbor an open-minded mindset and to collaborate with a broader set of stakeholders and partners.</p><p>We examine five significant emerging megatrends that will have a lasting influence on marketing theory and practice over the next decade and beyond: 1) marketplace developments influencing the rise of new business models and market dynamism; 2) technological developments fueling consumer privacy and surveillance concerns; 3) socioeconomic developments relating to increasing income inequality; 4) geopolitical developments and heightened levels of international protectionism; and 5) environmental developments on natural resources sustainability. Fortunately, the same technological advances that have contributed to the rise of these challenges also provide the means to address them, principally through the availability and use of increasingly rich data and emerging analytical technologies. Considering that these shifting market dynamics shape consumer behaviors which in turn shape markets, firms that pay significant attention to outside developments, technologies, consumer concerns, and diverse data will be the most adaptable.</p><p>Along with these megatrends, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside firms' direct control and decision-making. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' strategies is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of consumer data from various sources with modern-day analytics technologies. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict the changing preferences of consumers and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. Accordingly, this paper discusses recent advances in data and its analysis within the context of the five external developments to arm researchers and practitioners with contexts to thrive in the markets of the future.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0415\"/>The marketing ecosystem is an open and interconnected system. This perspective emphasizes that business functions are interrelated and not siloed by academic disciplines. Marketing can be enriched by synthesizing insights from other academic disciplines and by involving diverse stakeholders (<link><marker>MacInnis et al., 2020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0415\"/></link>). To deliver compelling offerings to customers and to maintain sustainable competitive advantages, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset of cooperating with actors traditionally viewed as outside of the realm of marketing. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble culture can endow firms with more robust outside-in capabilities, which then allow them to better sense market, seize opportunities, and quickly develop specific capabilities that fit into future market needs.</p><p>Consistent with this boundary-breaking perspective, we conduct our investigation by examining a diverse set of literature and assessing how other domains can enrich marketing theory and practice. After an introduction to the marketing ecosystem, we offer a discussion of the recent technology-driven data developments that continue to have a profound impact on consumers and businesses of all types. We delineate bourgeoning substantive domains with implications for consumers and firms and provide an overview of the rise of massive unstructured data that is increasingly prevalent. Complimenting this discourse, we highlight developing methodological disciplines adjacent to the marketing field whose spillover is shaping marketing through three broad roles: the need to gather and source, store and protect, and learn and use data effectively.</p><p>With this technology and data context established, we identify emergent trends in each of the five macro factors in the marketing ecosystem, informed by the priorities of the Marketing Science Institute (MSI), the Boston Consulting Groups and McKinsey &amp; Co., the Pew Research Foundation, the Brookings Institution, and the United Nations. We track the trajectories of each macro factor through developments across both Financial Times 50 (FT50) business journals and impactful marketing journals over the past few decades, identify the gaps between research focus and real-world challenges in each emergent area, and offer directions for future research.</p><p>The marketing ecosystem perspective contributes to marketing theory and practice through a structured, outside-in view focused on a better understanding of the evolving consumers. First, the ecosystem framework expands the existing outside-in perspective to a macro level and guides firms to monitor and internalize the megatrends that influence consumers, thereby improving firms' abilities to understand and predict their preferences and needs. Second, we discuss how firms can market-sense through emergent, data-rich, yet unstructured environments where consumer and marketplace data often do not reside within the firm. Third, by identifying the megatrends that shape consumers into the future, future marketing strategy research can incorporate these factors to provide a fuller and more nuanced view of consumers and to help firms make market-adaptable decisions.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. The marketing ecosystem perspective</emphasis></h><p>We define the marketing ecosystem as an interconnected system of coevolving actors and forces that affect firms' abilities to sense-make the market and seize opportunities. In addition to competitors' and collaborators' actions that directly affect the firm's business, the marketing ecosystem contains five macro factors: 1) marketplace factors, 2) technological factors, 3) socioeconomic factors, 4) geopolitical factors, and 5) natural environmental factors. The marketing ecosystem perspective expands the existing lens of outside-in view in marketing to include a set of structured macro factors and associated megatrends that influence consumers and have profound implications for firm strategies. The marketing ecosystem perspective explicitly recognizes that marketing is an \"open system,\" and that the firm can be thought of as an organism that is embedded in the broad ecosystem with which it needs to develop a symbiotic relationship to survive and prosper. Therefore, this perspective calls for a proactive and broad mindset of adaptability, exploration, and collaboration to improve firms' abilities for market-sensing and market-seizing.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref80005\"/>The marketing ecosystem has many elements. In this paper, we primarily focus on the megatrends occurring within the five macro factors, which are often ignored in previous outside-in perspectives. <link><marker>Fig. 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80005\"/></link> highlights the five macro factors as well as the megatrends occurring in each that we identify later in Section 4. The five factors are portrayed as concentric circles reflecting their specificity and the immediacy of their influences on consumer behaviors and, consequently, firms' decision-making. This broadened outside-in perspective provides a stable structure in that the five macro factors encompass the vast majority of the influence that consumers face, but also allows for flexibility and dynamics through the identification and updating of trends within each factor.<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80005\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80005\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000180200198501v88sCS0019850120302054mainassetsgr1SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000180200198501v88sCS0019850120302054mainassetsgr1LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 1 - Marketing Ecosystem: An Outside-in View for Sustainable Advantage.</p></caption></nitf:media></p><p>The ecosystem framework builds on the strength of the outside-in view, which stresses using outside factors to improve market-sensing, customer-engaging, and partner-linking (<link><marker>Day &amp; Moorman, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0180\"/></link>; <link><marker>Mu et al., 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0485\"/></link>). While the outside-in view is theoretically rich and thought-provoking, given its infancy in the literature, it is not yet fully developed and thus offers a fertile ground for frameworks. We build on the theoretical foundation of the outside-in perspective by crystalizing the various macro factors and discussing how they influence consumers and, consequently, firms' profitability, business models, and sustainable competitive advantage.</p><p>In the past, many of these macro factors might have received cursory looks, and some were excluded from the scope and mission of profit-oriented firms. However, as the business environment becomes increasingly dynamic and consumers become increasingly empowered, we argue that these outside-in factors are more important than ever. We recommend that firms should consciously incorporate these ecosystem factors into their decision-making and firm culture, as these factors will enable firms to be more adaptive and will likely determine the competitive advantages of the future.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0230\"/>The ecosystem perspective offers the following benefits for broadening firms' strategic thinking while grounded in the profit-orientation logic. First, the broad and anticipatory perspective enables firms to focus not only on current customer needs and current value for exploitation (<link><marker>Fader, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>) but also on future customer needs and future value for exploration (Mu <link><marker>2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0255\"/></link>). Markets change, and hence customers change. Current unprofitable customers and segments might evolve to become profitable in the future, and strategies that have worked in the past might not work in the future. The ecosystem perspective hence encourages firms to have a constant awareness of emergent segments and new needs. This perspective is consistent with the philosophy that organizations of all sizes need to promote entrepreneurial thinking and structure, and to promote experimentation for exploration and adaption, to overcome \"the innovator's dilemma\" (<link><marker>Christensen, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>; <link><marker>Christensen, Bartman, &amp; Van Bever, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link>; <link><marker>Christensen &amp; Raynor, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0160\"/></link>). Firms need to be aligned with the marketplace (<link><marker>Day, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>), and the marketing ecosystem framework explicitly describes the macro factors in the interconnected environmental factors that firms should consciously incorporate, beyond the previously considered factors such as technologies and competitive actions.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0260\"/>Second, by examining each macro factor, the ecosystem perspective helps to identify external stakeholders such as policymakers and tastemakers that influence consumers. Whereas the traditional stakeholder theory (<link><marker>Freeman, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0260\"/></link>) focuses on business ethics and corporate social responsibility, the ecosystem perspective offers a marketing lens from an outside-in perspective. It focuses on customer value creation by extracting market insights from data in various sources in the broad environment to meet the needs of both current and potential customers, so that firms can build sustainable competitive advantage. As the needs for ethical behaviors and social responsibility are internalized by consumers, the corresponding actions by the firm would also provide superior value to its customers in terms of goodwill, brand warm glow, customer loyalty stemming from increased customer-brand identification, and potential \"attitudinal insurance\" against the firm's future mistakes (<link><marker>Flammer, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0250\"/></link>; <link><marker>Godfrey, Merrill, &amp; Hansen, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>; <link><marker>Kang, Germann, &amp; Grewal, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0370\"/></link>) .</p><p>When thinking about the five macro factors, it is imperative for firms always to adopt a global view. With today's rapid rate of information and capital flow, compelling developments in the technological, marketplace, and cultural arenas in one corner of the world can quickly spill over to the other regions.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0780\"/>Environments always change, and thus consumers always change (<link><marker>Zhang &amp; Chang, 2020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0780\"/></link>). The concentric-circle \"radar\" design of the marketing ecosystem framework can guide firms on a concentric-level of \"outside-in\" thinking, focusing on factors that have more immediate effects while keeping an eye on the radar to simulate what-if scenarios on how changes in other factors could impact consumers and markets. This broadened view of the marketing environment can enhance the firms' outside-in capabilities, their abilities to experiment, and their abilities to deliver compelling offerings to customers in the long run.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0380\"/>At a firm culture level, the marketing ecosystem perspective can synthesize the two dominant perspectives on market orientation - one focused on processing marketplace information (<link><marker>Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0380\"/></link>) and the other focused on a market-oriented culture (<link><marker>Narver &amp; Slater, 1990</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0510\"/></link>). The ecosystem thinking promotes a firm culture that is open-minded, agile, mindful of diverse stakeholders, and boundary-breaking - factors that make the firm more dynamic (<link><marker>Teece, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0645\"/></link>). This culture embracing dynamism can, in turn, facilitate the rapid development of specific capabilities to gather, process, and benefit from marketplace information.</p><p>Data are paramount to understanding consumers. Therefore, before we dive into the megatrends in each of the five macro factors, we first discuss how marketplace and technology trends over the past two decades have contributed to increasingly richer data and more in-depth understanding of consumers. Data are becoming increasingly complex, and more and more relevant data now resides in the ecosystem outside of the firm's immediate control. Understanding how diverse data and analytical technologies can be leveraged will enable firms to understand the marketing ecosystem factors empirically and quantitatively.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.

Discrete era: Pre-1995s</emphasis></h><p>Before the proliferation of the internet and PCs, the availability of consumer and industry data and firms' analytic capabilities were relatively limited. Much of the data and corresponding analysis focused on making the most of discrete and crude data such as scanner panel data (e.g., <link><marker>Allenby, 1989</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link>; <link><marker>Guadagni &amp; Little, 1983</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0295\"/></link>; <link><marker>Winer, 1986</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0740\"/></link>) and primary data such as periodic surveys (e.g., <link><marker>Blair &amp; Burton, 1987</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>; <link><marker>Oliver &amp; Swan, 1989</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0535\"/></link>). Considering the sparsity of data types, marketers adapted statistical techniques or corrections to make use of this relatively \"limited\" information, such as non-response bias (<link><marker>Armstrong &amp; Overton, 1977</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>), or estimation of customer churn through limited information such as data on recency, frequency, and average monetary spending (e.g., <link><marker>Schmittlein, Morrison, &amp; Colombo, 1987</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0610\"/></link>).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.1.2. Continuous era: 1995-2005</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0800\"/>With extensive adoption of internet communications beginning in the early 1990s through the launch of the first smartphones, the substantial amounts of detailed consumer data available laid the foundation for the modern era of data-driven marketing. Large amounts of detailed transaction panel data provided new opportunities for firms to examine and understand not only customer segments but also customer dynamics and behavioral changes (<link><marker>Zhang &amp; Chang, 2020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0780\"/></link>). This data development resulted in a more customer-centric research focus such as satisfaction (e.g., <link><marker>Bolton, 1998</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0100\"/></link>; <link><marker>Mittal, Kumar, &amp; Tsiros, 1999</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0460\"/></link>), customer equity (e.g., <link><marker>Blattberg &amp; Deighton, 1996</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0095\"/></link>), and customer lifetime value (e.g., <link><marker>Berger &amp; Nasr, 1998</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0080\"/></link>). The better attitudinal and behavioral individual-level data coupled with more sophisticated statistical models led to a rich set of customer-centric research such as understanding and predicting customer profitability, repurchase, and relationship trajectories (<link><marker>Anderson, Fornell, &amp; Lehmann, 1994</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>; <link><marker>Ganesan, 1994</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0275\"/></link>; <link><marker>Reinartz &amp; Kumar, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0575\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zhang, Watson, &amp; Palmatier, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0800\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zhang, Watson, Palmatier, &amp; Dant, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0805\"/></link>).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.1.3. \"Big\" era: 2005-present</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0035\"/>The introduction of smartphones in the late 2000s brought a new level of data granularity that led to an unexpected challenge: data overload. Mobile location data, real-time app usage, page views, and the ability to link omni-channel touchpoints not only for a single consumer but also across consumers and competitors, created opportunities to provide better consumer experiences. Granular data capture (e.g., clickstream tracking in e-commerce) combined with cloud storage capabilities have enabled firms to synchronize analysis across data resources beyond their immediate internal availability (e.g., augmenting firm's internal data with social media posts and user online reviews). With sufficiently detailed data, firms in both B2C and B2B domains could implement previously difficult personalization tasks such as targeted pricing (<link><marker>Zhang, Netzer, &amp; Ansari, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0795\"/></link>), personalized product recommendations (<link><marker>Ansari, Li, &amp; Zhang, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0035\"/></link>), advertising timing (<link><marker>Trusov, Ma, &amp; Jamal, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0670\"/></link>), managing marketing-mix exposure (<link><marker>Du et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0190\"/></link>), and optimizing the multichannel retail experience (<link><marker>Chang &amp; Zhang, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0125\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zhang, 2020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0775\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0455\"/>During this time, we also began to see relevant data moving from firms' internal CRM databases to external environments - a development that requires firms to consider diverse sources for market-sensing such as social media, review sites, and forums. For example, the emergence of large-scale textual data generated by current and potential customers in online forums and review sites can reflect consumer sentiments and scale-up qualitative market research insights (<link><marker>Melumad, Inman, &amp; Pham, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0455\"/></link>; <link><marker>Netzer, Feldman, Goldenberg, &amp; Fresko, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0515\"/></link>). The textual data can also be generated by institutions and society at large. For example, data from the Google Book corpus, news media, government reports, song lyric websites, and movie script databases can provide a wealth of information. Although these text generators are not the firm's customers, they could nevertheless shed light on broad consumer cultural trends such as tastes in movies (<link><marker>Toubia et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0665\"/></link>) and music (<link><marker>Berger &amp; Packard, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link>).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.1.4. Massive unstructured era: Present and beyond</emphasis></h><p>As technological developments accelerate, consumers' interaction with mobile and smart devices generate massive amounts of data through social media posts, location-based photo and video uploads, as well as in-use data and living habits through sensors from IoT devices. <link><marker>Balducci &amp; Marinova (2018, p.558)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0060\"/></link> define unstructured data as \"a data unit in which the information offers a relatively concurrent representation of its multifaceted nature without predefined organization or numeric values.\" Data resides on a continuum from highly structured data (e.g., numeric data such as sales transactions) to highly unstructured such as non-verbal data (e.g., facial cues), images, and videos. Increasingly, text, audio, auditory, and video data co-occur in marketing communications across advertising, social media, product offerings, and numerous other touchpoints. Large amounts of unstructured data (e.g., from brand communities, product reviews, smart devices) and continued development in data-summarizing techniques can enable structures on these novel data types that could allow for the ability to scale up qualitative research and identify consumer conversations and emotions to facilitate market-sensing.</p><p>The ever-increasing sources of data offer the enormous potential to firms to learn deeply about consumers and markets and formulate strategies from an outside-in perspective. However, they challenge firms' analytic capabilities. These challenges have necessitated new disciplines to take advantage of these technological and data developments to adapt to a business environment that is unforgiving of data ignorance. The marketing field continues to evolve from its roots in the analysis of in-house numerical transactional data to incorporate vast troves of unstructured data from often disparate origins. On the one hand, this development allows for a more in-depth understanding of consumers. On the other hand, it necessitates capabilities for firms not only to model the complex data but also to look for relevant data that reside outside of the firm - emphasizing marketing analytic capabilities as well as outside-in ecosystem thinking.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0050\"/>Creative ways to source these unstructured data in the ecosystem can be enormously insightful. For example, to understand how disruptive companies such as Uber or Airbnb navigate resistance to market changes, one might study transcript of town hall meetings and other public documents in which citizen input is heard. As exogenous shocks in the forms of social movements such as #MeToo, #MAGA, and #FarmToTable can affect brand images and firms' marketing communication strategies, one can study how different groups of people define and advocate for certain meanings in the marketplace. At a broader level, firms can analyze texts, images, and photos in the ecosystem to assess how their brands fit into the cultural fabrics of current societal meanings and norms (<link><marker>Arvidsson &amp; Caliandro, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0050\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0145\"/>To make the most of this data opportunity, marketers are looking to other emerging disciplines in data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to process non-structured data (<link><marker>Chintagunta, Hanssens, &amp; Hauser, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0145\"/></link>). In the following section, we examine marketers' responses to these accelerating developments through emergent disciplines' use of massive unstructured data.

The first is the need to gather and source data from often disparate origins to generate the structure for analysis. The second is that firms must store and protect the data they have collected to ensure their proper use and accessibility for decision-making. This role is most likely to be overlooked but is of vital importance to prevent malicious attacks and ensure consumer privacy. The final part is the use of data for learning and decision-making, for which there are developing methodological disciplines in the domains of artificial intelligence. Firms can extract market insights from the iterative process of data analytics to create unique value for customers.<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref9t0010\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"5\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"304\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"40\"/><thead><row><entry><anchor id=\"reference9t0010\"/>Role</entry><entry>Disciplines</entry><entry>Implications</entry><entry>Software &amp; Algorithms</entry><entry>Representative Papers</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry>Gather and source</entry><entry>Text Voice Image and video Data stream from smart and connected devices  Behavioral meta-data</entry><entry>Massive unstructured data makes human coding unfeasible, but researchers can implement machine learning algorithms to inductively classify input and observe patters without the requirement of manually coded rules.</entry><entry>LIWC, VADER Natural Language Took Kit (NLTK) Pandas/NumPy (Python) Scrapy for Web scraping (Python) Google Cloud Vision API, Microsoft's Computer Vision API, OpenCV</entry><entry><anchor id=\"ref5b0310\"/><link><marker>Hartmann et al.

This unstructured data can often be accessed directly through an application programming interface (API) from social media platforms, scraped manually from webpages, or internally from firm-owned marketing communications, such as image and video advertisements and corresponding meta-data.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0365\"/>Although the multi-terabyte scale data makes human coding unfeasible, interest among marketing researchers in classifying large amounts of unstructured data and linking it to marketing outcomes continues to grow (<link><marker>Hartmann, Huppertz, Schamp, &amp; Heitmann, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0310\"/></link>). Fortunately, automated procedures for gathering unstructured data are becoming more accessible. For example, supervised machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks (<link><marker>Juan, Hsu, &amp; Xie, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0365\"/></link>; <link><marker>Timoshenko &amp; Hauser, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0655\"/></link>), k-Nearest Neighbors (<link><marker>Dzyabura, Jagabathula, &amp; Muller, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0205\"/></link>), naive Bayes (<link><marker>Hartmann et al., 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0310\"/></link>), and random forests (<link><marker>Hoornaert, Ballings, Malthouse, &amp; Van den Poel, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>) inductively classify textual input based on observed patterns without the requirement of manually coded rules from the researcher (<link><marker>Dumais, Platt, Heckerman, &amp; Sahami, 1998</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0195\"/></link>). Image classification approaches that have recently made their way into marketer's toolboxes include the use of openly available computer vision packages such as Google's Cloud Vision API, Microsoft's Computer Vision API, OpenCV, Amazon's Rekognition, and IBM's Watson Visual Recognition (<link><marker>Mazloom, Rietveld, Rudinac, Worring, &amp; Van Dolen, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0440\"/></link>). These programs have the advantage of not needing to specify parameters, and their openly available nature allows replication of results and utilization in firms with moderate technical ability.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0170\"/>Data now flows from connected consumer devices such as Nest's thermostats, smart running shoes and athletic wearables, virtual personal assistants (e.g., Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana), smart electrical plugs and LED lighting, door locks, and security cameras, and health monitoring devices (<link><marker>Cross, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>). In addition to understanding consumer preferences and behaviors, in the B2B space, IoT-connected equipment can improve maintenance prediction, inventory, supply chain efficiencies, and the ability to share in-use information from customers with suppliers for tighter partner-linking and service guidance (<link><marker>Russo &amp; Albert, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0590\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zhang &amp; Hon, 2020a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0785\"/></link>). In these environments, each IoT object generates static information (e.g., operational, warnings, repair, build information) and customer in-use information (e.g., input changes, user interaction monitoring, biosensors), which provides real-time data flow for later analysis (<link><marker>Ng &amp; Wakenshaw, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0525\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0765\"/>There is also a wealth of offline consumer activities such as customer participation and engagements in firm-sponsored or user-community events that have been traditionally overlooked. Many firms begin to realize the power of brand communities and the deep consumer engagements stemming from offline social interactions. Capturing activities such as event attendance and behaviors during the events in the CRM system through advancements in video capture, computer vision, and hand-held POS devices and examining how these activities affect search and purchases can offer a complete picture of the drivers of consumer behavior in offline and group settings (<link><marker>Zhang, 2019a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0765\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zhang, 2019b</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0770\"/></link>).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.2.2. Store and protect</emphasis></h><p>The same detailed and wide-ranging data that provide firms with insights can underwrite an increasing public concern about the accessibility, privacy, confidentiality, and the potential for misuse (<link><marker>Martin, Borah, &amp; Palmatier, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0430\"/></link>). Outside-in perspective places the interests of customers in the center (<link><marker>Mu, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0480\"/></link>), and protecting customers from harm should be a central focus of the firm. Firms must handle the obligation to effectively store and protect the data to reduce vulnerabilities to consumers and themselves, while still maintaining the usefulness of the data. This places emphasis on privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP), which represents data stewardship that balances privacy preservation with utility loss (<link><marker>Fung, Wang, Chen, &amp; Yu, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0265\"/></link>). In addition to collection and storage safeguards, firms should also be mindful of security and privacy when mining data for business insights (<link><marker>Xu, Jiang, Wang, Yuan, &amp; Ren, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0745\"/></link>). It is the firms' responsibility to modify or remove potentially sensitive information from the raw data upon collection, and to ensure potentially sensitive information does not appear in the results of the analysis. As data types become more complex, applying suitable ways to implement and quantify privacy can be challenging. However, promising technical developments in the use of blockchain and cryptography are beginning to make their way into data practice (<link><marker>Christidis &amp; Devetsikiotis, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zyskind &amp; Nathan, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0815\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0435\"/>Consumer concern is not always about actual harm from a privacy breach, but also about the vulnerability of potential harm, which makes many people reluctant to participate or share their data with the firm (<link><marker>Martin &amp; Murphy, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0435\"/></link>). Because of the increasing role and value of data in all facets of modern society as well as its potential downsides for consumers, governments have increasingly intervened in industry data practices through regulation. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May of 2018 and made substantial changes to how an organization can collect, use and transfer personal data within its jurisdiction. Its regulatory goal is to ensure that individuals have greater control over their data and how it is shared. Businesses that handle data of EU data subjects (e.g., an individual residing in the EU) all share the same regulative obligations and face the same consequences and enforcement (<link><marker>European Commission, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0215\"/></link>). These regulations require 1) clear and common language about data usage for customers, 2) affirmative customer consent for opt-in, 3) greater transparency as to transfer, purpose-in-use, and automated use, 4) stronger rights on granting access, data breach informing obligations, and data erasure, and 5) imposition of fines for organization found in violation of GDPR rules. Similar regulations are currently enacted or are in process in Brazil (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7ao de Dados), in Australia as the Australian Privacy Act 2018 Amendment, the USState of California's Consumer Privacy Act, Japan's Protection of Personal Information 2017 Amendment, South Korea's 2011 Personal Information Protection Act, and Thailand's 2020 Personal Data Protection Act. These six regulatory acts alone cover close to one billion people and $32 trillion in GDP (<link><marker>International Monetary Fund, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0355\"/></link>; <link><marker>US Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0685\"/></link>). As the trend of global consumer and regulatory data mindfulness continues, firms (especially those that operate in multiple jurisdictions) will need to ensure compliance with data protection laws and adapt their marketing and business practices such as direct marketing and communication to fit these requirements.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.2.3. Learn and use</emphasis></h><p>Recent developments in machine learning are well adapted to many of the characteristics of the massive unstructured data. In data environments where researchers face substantial uncertainty, machine learning techniques provide an advantage over more structured statistical or econometric analysis because they do not require strong assumptions to model relationships within the data. This modeling approach mitigates risks associated with improperly specified models or assumption-violating data. Research has demonstrated that applying machine learning techniques to user-generated content can reveal unseen information about the firm's offerings such as consumer quality perceptions (<link><marker>Ansari et al., 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0035\"/></link>; <link><marker>Netzer et al., 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0515\"/></link>; <link><marker>Tirunillai &amp; Tellis, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0660\"/></link>) or its competitive landscape (<link><marker>Lee &amp; Bradlow, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0395\"/></link>) - issues would be otherwise difficult to address using internal resources and traditional market research approaches. Other goals for data use are the abilities to introduce new products with higher chances of success, personalize offerings, improve transactional experiences, and increase customer acquisition conversion - areas that align with the primary functions of marketing and business operations. Although the vast majority of the approaches used for textual analysis rely on bag-of-words methods and currently have limited ability to capture the true linguistic relationships among words beyond their co-occurrences, we expect to see developments in areas such as natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning that can better capture semantic relationships.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0315\"/>Image and video classifications remain the focus of cutting-edge research where deep learning convolutional neural networks can accomplish tasks in hours more accurately than would take humans days and weeks (<link><marker>He, Zhang, Ren, &amp; Sun, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link>; <link><marker>Kwak &amp; An, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0390\"/></link>; <link><marker>Sermanet et al., 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0625\"/></link>). As researchers have increasing access to off-the-shelf or open-source libraries such as ImageNet, PASCAL VOC, and TensorFlow to facilitate image analysis in quick timeframes for additional analysis (<link><marker>Abadi, Isard, &amp; Murray, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0005\"/></link>; <link><marker>Klostermann et al., 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0375\"/></link>; <link><marker>Krizhevsky, Sutskever, &amp; Hinton, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>), these methods can be applied more widely by more substantively focused researchers. While current work has become proficient at object recognition in visual data (<link><marker>You, Luo, Jin, &amp; Yang, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0750\"/></link>), many conventional approaches still have difficulties recognizing and extracting more abstract information such as emotions and sentiments, which is admittedly tricky even for humans coders due to subjectivity (<link><marker>Wang &amp; Li, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0725\"/></link>). Machine learning techniques can work around this subjective task by pairing with textual data like reviews or social media posts (<link><marker>Chen, Yang, Feng, &amp; Gu, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link>; <link><marker>You, Luo, Jin, &amp; Yang, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0755\"/></link>), and advancements in bio-informatics technology such as facial recognition and eye-tracking have yielded insightful results in this domain (<link><marker>Teixeira, Wedel, &amp; Pieters, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0650\"/></link>; <link><marker>Venkatraman et al., 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0710\"/></link>). While machine learning can accommodate highly complex relationships, it can be difficult to interpret its output as well as generalize it to other contexts (<link><marker>Li, Shi, &amp; Wang, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0400\"/></link>). Furthermore, counterfactual analysis and policy change examination may not be as feasible as with more structured and theory-rich approaches. Therefore, we envision that future analytical excellence relies on two approaches - while firms should embrace the predictive abilities of intelligent machines, they should not indiscriminately abandon formal models grounded in theories of economics, psychology, and sociology, in order to understand the underlying phenomena and to articulate and extrapolate the strategies.</p><p>The abundance of unstructured data is not without pitfalls and limitations. One caveat is the potential for self-selection bias. Observed data, whether it is in the forms of product reviews, forum discussions, or twitter posts, could reflect strong motivations such as extreme satisfaction or dissatisfaction, political correctness, herding mentality, or trolling behaviors. Those consumers without strong sentiments and motivations for posting could be the \"silent majority\" that constitute the mainstream of the economy. Firms, when extracting insights from data in the ecosystem, need to be cognizant of the various sources and magnitude of bias. Even in the era of big data and AI, blind reliance on data and algorithms could lead to unintended and undesirable consequences. Therefore, data and the associated algorithms should be used in tandem with traditional market research approaches to ensure representative samples. The findings should then be triangulated with intuitions, institutional knowledge, and first principles.</p><p>The success of marketers and firms relies not only on the ability to leverage new data effectively but also on the identification and business-model adaptability of emerging developments in the ecosystem, which we will discuss next.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Emergent trends and future research directions in the marketing ecosystem</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0425\"/>Recognizing emerging and accelerating trends is not a straightforward task. We argue that these aspects can be addressed by understanding the macro forces as gleaned from the deployment of an ecosystem mindset. To triangulate forces and trends with substantial influence on marketing practice going forward, we leverage the work from several worldwide leading organizations that study business and societal shifts. Based on concentric levels of outside-in thinking related to 1) marketplace, 2) technological, 3) socioeconomic, 4) geopolitical, and 5) environmental domains, we examine seismic shifts from a marketing-specific lens with guidance from the thought leadership of the Marketing Science Institute (MSI) which bridges marketing academics with practitioners, a broader business strategy perspective via leading global consulting firms McKinsey &amp; Co. and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a US domestic view via the Pew Research Foundation, and an international view via the Brookings Institution and the United Nations. The role of data in facilitating an ecosystem perspective is our key focus for this paper and is consistent with MSI's recent 2018-2020 Research Priorities titled \"Capturing Information to Fuel Growth.\" MSI's No. 4 priority puts forth that academic research should focus on \"approaches to ingesting and analyzing data to drive marketing insights\" (<link><marker>Marketing Science Institute, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0425\"/></link>).

Research publication analysis of the five emergent trends from 1990 to 2018</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0450\"/>To underscore growth and opportunities for research pertaining to the five megatrends mentioned earlier, we provide a keyword analysis of the extant research in business literature, as the proportions of articles dedicated to a topic reflect the share-of-thought in a given academic discipline. Obtained from Reuter's Web of Science database and coded using the keywords, titles, and abstracts provided by the authors of published works, we determine the annual proportion of articles published for a given topic by dividing the number of articles about that topic published in a given year across a journal set by the total number of all articles published. Our approach is similar to the procedure examining keywords employed in prior studies of trends and meta-analysis (e.g., <link><marker>Mela, Roos, &amp; Deng, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0450\"/></link>; <link><marker>Watson IV, Worm, Palmatier, &amp; Ganesan, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0730\"/></link>). We organically determined a set of twenty-one keywords for each topic beginning with \"business model,\" \"sustainability,\" \"globalization,\" \"data privacy,\" and \"economic inequality,\" respectively, for each of the trends, and grew the keyword list by noting co-occurring keywords from author-provided keywords, titles, and abstracts (please refer to the complete list of keywords for a topic under its corresponding figure). Based on this analysis for each identified development, we provide a visual representation of their trajectory changes since 1990 in <link><marker>Figs. 4-8</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80020\"/></link><link><marker>Figs. 4-8</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80025\"/></link><link><marker>Figs. 4-8</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80030\"/></link><link><marker>Figs. 4-8</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80035\"/></link><link><marker>Figs. 4-8</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80040\"/></link> across two sets of publications. The first includes 87,613 articles published in the Financial Times Top 50 journals (FT50) that are representative of influential academic business literature in general. The second represents marketing-specific literature comprised of 16,663 articles across 14 scholarly journals with a 5-year Journal Citation Report Impact Factor greater than 3.0, which we label MKTG3.0. The set of MKTG3.0 journals includes <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of Marketing, Marketing Science</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of Marketing Research, Journal of Consumer Research, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Industrial Marketing Management, Journal of Consumer Psychology, Journal of Interactive Marketing</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of Service Research</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of Retailing</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of Product Innovation Management</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of International Marketing</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of Advertising</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">International Journal of Research in Marketing</emphasis>. By comparing the research focus across general business journals vs. marketing journals over time, we hope to identify 1) gaps between practical relevance and academic focus, and 2) gaps between focus in marketing and general business academies. We subsequently identify influential developments, track their \"share-of-thought\" trajectory, and discuss implications and future research directions.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.2. Marketplace trends</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0320\"/>The internet and digitization over the past two decades have facilitated significant changes and possibilities in business models - developments that have made the market more dynamic as well as entrenched. As McKinsey notes in their executive summary titled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Age of Analytics: Competing in a Data-Driven World</emphasis>, \"Data and analytics are changing the basis of competition. Leading companies are using their capabilities not only to improve their core operations but to launch entirely new business models\" (<link><marker>Henke et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>, p.3). Likewise, BCG highlights that marketplace opportunity often arises from innovative business models that rely \"less on the physical movement of goods and fixed investments in markets, and more on leveraging digital connectivity and ecosystems to expand across borders\" (<link><marker>Bhattacharya, Reeves, Lang, &amp; Augustinraj, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0085\"/></link>, p.1). In this vein, the authors identify seven recent business models that alter the global competitive landscape: 1) cross-border servitization, 2) asset-light market entry, 3) value-add through software, 4) global digital ecosystems, 5) global personalization, 6) multilocal manufacturing, and 7) developing multiple national identities.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0115\"/>The network effects of digital platforms are \"creating a winner-take-most dynamic in some markets\" (<link><marker>Henke et al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>, p.4), which lead to the rise of tech giants that enjoy increasingly large influence on the economy. Newly established companies have access to market intelligence, global market research (e.g., advertising on Facebook and Google), affordable and scalable HR and IT services (e.g., many SaaS programs, cloud computing via Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure), diversified startup funding via crowdsourcing (e.g., Kickstarter), and the global explosion of venture capital funding (<link><marker>Brown, Mawson, &amp; Rowe, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zvilichovsky, Danziger, &amp; Steinhart, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0810\"/></link>). However, the same incumbent providers of these entrepreneurial ecosystems have increasingly concentrated power and thus create an uneven playing field for start-ups. This power asymmetry, in turn, kills overall market dynamism and likely reduces innovative investment in the aggregate (<link><marker>Ofek &amp; Turut, 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0530\"/></link>). In response to these developments, rising anti-monopoly sentiments popularly labeled as a \"Techlash\" are already reflected in the proposed regulations and popular discourse (<link><marker>Scott, 2020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0615\"/></link>, p.1). We label this changing marketplace trend \"Market Dynamism.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.2.1.

This topic has experienced steady growth since 1990, with MKTG3.0 journals exhibiting ten-percentage points higher share of published papers than FT50 journals.

Directions and future research: market dynamism</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0690\"/>Despite easier access to data, technology, and funding for entrepreneurs, which all contribute to lowering startup costs, the US self-employment rate (a measure of entrepreneurial activity) has decreased by over 30% over the past two decades (<link><marker>US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0690\"/></link>). While total business applications gleaned from IRS filings recovered from its lows during the Great Recession, quarterly high-quality applications, which have a relatively high rate of turning into job-creating businesses, have fallen roughly 20% from 400,000 per quarter in 2006 to 300,000 per quarter in 2017 (<link><marker>US Census, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0695\"/></link>). Relatedly, the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the United States has declined sharply since its peak in 1996 (<link><marker>Doidge, Kahle, Karolyi, &amp; Stulz, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0185\"/></link>), the cause of which has received considerable attention both in academic and policy circles (<link><marker>Ewens &amp; Farre-Mensa, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0225\"/></link>; <link><marker>Farrell, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link>). At the end of 2017, the roughly 3600 publicly traded companies were half the number listed in 1997 (<link><marker>Ritter, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0580\"/></link>). However, the average size of listed companies had grown considerably. Compounding this is the trend of venture-backed companies exiting via mergers and acquisitions, where just 15% of venture-capital exits involved IPOs, down from 88% in 1991 (<link><marker>Ritter, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0580\"/></link>). The power concentration is further reflected geographically - much of venture funding remains in tech-hubs such as San Francisco, New York, and Seattle. Consequently, the US has experienced higher degrees of industry concentration and fewer numbers of competitors, which reduces market dynamism.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0360\"/>Increasingly, powerful incumbents can undermine or acquire promising start-ups and are beginning to draw the ire of government regulators in industries such as media (<link><marker>Ip, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0360\"/></link>) and tech (<link><marker>Goldstein, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0290\"/></link>). This trend in part has attracted the attention of investors aimed at promising entrepreneurs located outside of Silicon Valley establishments, such as the \"Rise of the Rest\" $150m venture fund from Revolution Investors (<link><marker>Loizos, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0410\"/></link>). These funds are starting to directly address data disparities among new companies through products and services for small business owners. For instance, ZenBusiness, an Austin, Texas-based SaaS provider, consolidates essential operational services like banking, lending, and tax preparation to those starting small businesses. Coalescing efforts to recognize the atrophying market dynamism and address competitive disparities raise the following questions:<list><listItem><label>1.  </label><bodyText><p>How do start-ups compete with larger incumbents?

Technological trends</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0420\"/>The second development reflects the need for firms in competitive environments to gather and use as much detailed consumer data as possible to understand and react to marketplace trends. The advent of wearable, IoT, facial, and voice recognition technologies can generate real-time lifestyle, emotional, and biometric data. However, this big data revolution and the corresponding marketing advancements have also brought about a dark side of data use. Numerous data breaches along with outright corporate misuse of customer data have generated push-back from consumers and regulators. As more and more customer-firm interactions move away from face-to-face into digital interfaces, consumers have become wary of real and perceived data privacy concerns, corporate surveillance, and general human-computer relationships (<link><marker>Martin et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0430\"/></link>). According to the Pew Research Center, most Americans (93%) said that \"being in control of who can get information about them\" is important (<link><marker>Madden &amp; Rainie, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0420\"/></link>, p.5). 86% of internet users have \"taken steps online to remove or mask their digital footprints, but many say they would like to do more or are unaware of tools they could use\" (<link><marker>Rainie, Kiesler, Kang, &amp; Madden, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0570\"/></link>, p.1). This trend has grown in reaction to the swift growth in data-centric business models and holds significant implications for marketing practices in the future. We label this technological trend \"Privacy and Surveillance.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.3.1.

From a policy perspective, the frequency and the magnitude of data breaches warrant significant attention from government regulators, as evidenced by the enactment of the EU's GDPR. Nevertheless, in other parts of the world, governments such as China have used digital technologies to increase the monitoring and tracking of their citizens not only through web and mobile histories but with real-time geolocation and facial recognition to reinforce desired worldviews (<link><marker>Mozur, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0475\"/></link>). Furthermore, we expect that the expanded use of artificial intelligence to marketing contexts will reshape the relationships consumers have with businesses in both the digital and physical domains by reshaping consumer experiences. For example, AI-assisted interactions may facilitate smoother access of customer details with front line salespeople, hyper-individualized recommendations in public retail environments, and autonomous retail (e.g., Amazon Go stores). These innovations could shatter long-held consumer beliefs and habits, result in unintended consequences, and bring to salience the role of humans in an AI-assisted world.</p><p>Future questions that address technological development and privacy concerns include:<list><listItem><label>1.  </label><bodyText><p>How do companies adapt their business models and analytical capabilities in the face of data regulation?

Likewise, increasing wage growth has been confined mainly to the fewer, more highly educated workers as the technical skills required to work in finance and tech sectors increased beyond many current levels of worker training (<link><marker>Adler, Florida, King, &amp; Mellander, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0010\"/></link>). Consequently, the US and other developed economies exhibit an increasing bi-furcation of powerful, data-rich and tech-savvy firms and their highly compensated workers, and many more data-poor legacy firms and the shared waning fortunes of their workforce. Part of this can be seen in the ongoing \"retail apocalypse\" and the continued struggles of traditional manufacturing and heavy industry (<link><marker>Al-Muslim, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0025\"/></link>; <link><marker>Caliendo, Dvorkin, &amp; Parro, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0340\"/>The Pew Center notes that the wealth gap between America's richest 5% of families increased their wealth level in 1989 from 114 times as much as families in the second quintile to 248 times in 2016 (<link><marker>Horowitz, Ingielnik, &amp; Kochhar, 2020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0340\"/></link>). To attempt to keep up with more affluent peers, both business and consumers have taken on record levels of debt over the past decade - $15.5 trillion in US Non-financial corporate debt, up 52% from its last peak the third quarter of 2008 and worth roughly 48% of US GDP (<link><marker>Rodriguez-Valladares, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0585\"/></link>), and more than $13.8 trillion in US household debt, exceeding its 2008 peak (<link><marker>Federal Reserve Bank Of New York, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0240\"/></link>).

There is a myriad of under-researched consumer and firm implications, including shrinking and shifting consumer segments, product and brand substitution patterns given new budget constraints, changes in consumer self-identity, political polarization and the consequent lack of trust in social interactions and towards certain brands and industries. Given the growing importance of these trends in all areas of business and society, there are enormous research opportunities for both marketing and business academics.<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80030\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80030\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000180200198501v88sCS0019850120302054mainassetsgr6SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000180200198501v88sCS0019850120302054mainassetsgr6LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 6 - Proportion of Published Papers by Year: Economic Inequality.Topic Keywords: \"Income inequality\" or \"Wealth inequality\" or \"Wealth concentration\" or \"Corporate monopoly\" or \"Monopoly power\" or \"Inclusive growth\" or \"Gini coefficient\" or \"Income redistribution\" or \"Income distribution\" or \"Social stratification\" or \"Household savings\" or \"Wealth\" or \"Wealth distribution\" or \"Distribution of wealth\" or \"Inheritance\" or \"Bequest*\" or \"Wealth accumulation\" or \"Economic inequality\" or \"Economic justice\" or \"Economic fairness\" or \"Poverty\".</p></caption></nitf:media></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.4.2.

In the US, economic inequality recently reached its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it 50\u00a0years ago (<link><marker>Semega, Kollar, Creamer, &amp; Mohanty, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0620\"/></link>). In response, there has been growing movement for firms to shift perspectives to a more macro-level stakeholder lens, which accounts for the outside forces that influence their businesses rather than focus only on traditional firm-level concerns. For instance, the, 2019 US Business Roundtable, chaired by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, released its \"Statement on the Purpose of the Corporation\" in which maximizing shareholder value was no longer the number one priority, but instead that they shared a \"fundamental commitment to all...stakeholders\" (<link><marker>Murray, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0490\"/></link>, p.1). Behavioral data can be used to address economic inequality directly (e.g., financing) or indirectly (e.g., EdTech open-source training and personalized education). Marketers can accordingly focus on broadening the data spectrum for their decision-making that takes in macro-level consequences beyond shareholder value, augmenting and rethinking measurements of customer lifetime value (CLV) and profit-maximization with ecosystem-level consequences in mind (e.g., early education in the community, investing in the continued education of their employees to promote upward mobility).</p><p>Future research for marketing in the domain of economic inequality can address:<list><listItem><label>1.  </label><bodyText><p>What new performance measures should firms use to augment the current profit-maximization objective to satisfy diverse stakeholders?

Geopolitical trends</emphasis></h><p>As global market access increased, developing economies experienced significant boosts in living standards and market power. This development leads to the rise of global companies from emerging economies (e.g., Alibaba, Tata, Huawei). There is also greater attention to consumers in youthful and dynamic markets such as China, India, Southeast Asia, and Africa, which has challenged incumbent firms in developed economies.</p><p>However, rising levels of inequality in the US and other developed economies has led, at least in part, to rising anti-globalization sentiments across numerous populaces, particularly among those who did not experience the promised benefits of globalization. Increasingly, the world is \"de-globalizing\" as a reaction to the past economic integration of the 1990s and early 2000s and can be seen from the UK's Brexit vote, the US's global trade tensions, France's Yellow-Vest protests, the failure of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the rise of China's One-Belt-One-Road initiatives, and most recently, the shutting-down of national borders and the high-profile \"finger-pointing\" during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. All of these developments certainly do not bode well for the future of globalization and international cooperation.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0055\"/>Furthermore, these trends reinforce consumer values-based sentiments such as \"Made in America\" claims or current Korean-Japanese \"national security\" trade disputes (<link><marker>Balabanis &amp; Diamantopoulos, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0055\"/></link>; <link><marker>Pak, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0555\"/></link>; <link><marker>Varman &amp; Belk, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0705\"/></link>). This global populist trend has risen to a level such that it warranted inclusion in the opening address of UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres at the 2018 UN General Assembly in which he noted that \"the world is suffering from a bad case of 'Trust Deficit Disorder.' People are feeling troubled and insecure. Trust is at a breaking point...

In particular, marketing research in this subject has lagged that of general business in the last decade between two to five percentage points. These gaps present an opportunity for marketers to understand both firm-level implications of these developments (e.g., trade disputes, supply chain disruptions and reversals, quality inconsistencies, and incentive structures to engage in long-term planning and international market-entry decisions) as well as consumer-level disruptions (e.g., multiple and incompatible technology formats, nationalistic brand preferences).<nitf:media flow=\"block\" nitf:media-type=\"graphic\"><nitf:media-reference><anchor id=\"reference80035\"/><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref80035\"/></link><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker><inlineObject altText=\"Enlarge Image\"><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000180200198501v88sCS0019850120302054mainassetsgr7SMALL\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"LNACX00000000180200198501v88sCS0019850120302054mainassetsgr7LARGE\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"20693\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></nitf:media-reference><caption><p>Fig. 7 - Proportion of Published Papers by Year: International Protectionism.Topic Keywords: \"Globalization\" or \"Emerging markets\" or \"Emerging economies\" or \"Developing countries\" or \"Developing economy\" or \"Developing markets\" or \"Cultural identity\" or \"Country-of-origin effect\" or \"International\" or \"Ethnocentrism\" or \"Political ideologies\" or \"Ideologies\" or \"Nationalism\" or \"Nationhood\" or \"Protest movements\" or \"Political discourse\" or \"Social movements\" or \"Resistance movements\" or \"Local-global identity\" or \"Multinational\" or \"Glocalization\".</p></caption></nitf:media></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.5.2.

The Brookings Institution notes that from 2017 to 2018, worldwide governments introduced over 1000 new policies that \"harmed foreign commercial interests,\" an increase of about 67% from 2016. Compounding this development, the number of new trade reforms during the same period declined by more than 20% percent, reflecting a movement away from the paradigm of global free trade (<link><marker>Evenett &amp; Fritz, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0220\"/></link>). The de-globalization trend is strengthening regional spheres of influence in ways that significantly hinder global commerce, cooperation, and understanding.</p><p>Simultaneously, these protectionist movements also coincide with the emergence of the \"bottom of the pyramid\" consumers newly connected on digital platforms that may add billions of participants to the global economy. Enabled by recently affordable mobile technology, millions of newly empowered consumers emerge to join international trade and market offerings, and their behaviors have rarely been observed and studied before in marketing on such a large scale. However, the deepening balkanization of goods and information can cut off potentially life-changing exchanges for many in the bottom rung to improve their economic, political, and health standings.</p><p>Balancing domestic pressures in the face of increasing international protectionism will yield impactful research for marketing strategy and policy implementations for firms operating in the inevitably connected world.

Environmental trends</emphasis></h><p>As living standards increase globally, and as the population continues to grow at regionally uneven rates, counteracting forces exert influences in different parts of the world. On the one hand, increased middle-class consumption and robust population growth in emerging economies (e.g., India, Africa), and on the other, slowing growth and aging population in many developed economies (e.g., Japan, Germany), have taxed thought leaders on corporate sustainability to recognize how business must respond to global natural resource sustainability challenges.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0680\"/>These developments are emphasized by business and international communities. In, 2015, McKinsey partnered with the United Nations to develop the UN Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (<link><marker>United Nations, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0675\"/></link>), which in part led to the development of UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals after the recent addition of \"Environmental Sustainability\" as one of McKinsey's 13 core business consulting functions. These types of partnerships have resulted in greater awareness of environmental concerns as expressed at the UN's, 2019 Climate Action Summit, which aimed to \"deliver new pathways and practical actions to shift global response into higher gear\" (<link><marker>United Nations, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0680\"/></link>).

However, growth seems to have plateaued since 2008, despite the increased public discourse on climate change related topics.

These consumer preferences reflect the growing sentiment in the US, where approximately two-thirds of US adults say that the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change, to protect air, and to protect water quality (<link><marker>Funk &amp; Hefferon, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0270\"/></link>). Values-based consumers, especially those from Gen-Z, are demanding greater environmental stewardship from both regulators and corporations.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0245\"/>However, firms face difficulties overcoming collective action for sustainability due to self-interest, economic reasoning, weak actor bonds, and differing perceptions of the issues (<link><marker>Finke, Gilchrist, &amp; Mouzas, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>).

Concluding remarks: a call for agile, growth-minded, and epistemologically-modest organizational culture</emphasis></h><p>As the world evolves quickly along many interrelated dimensions, firms' strategies are challenged to expand beyond the immediate technological and competitive factors in the marketplace. Accordingly, firms need to develop capabilities to meet the current need of the market as well as to anticipate how megatrends shape future consumer preferences, market structures, and their competitive standings.</p><p>In this paper, we build upon the view of outside-in marketing to propose a holistic and structured perspective for formulating marketing strategy - the \"marketing ecosystem\" perspective. It explicitly recognizes that marketing as an open and interconnected system of coevolving actors and forces that affect firms' abilities to sense-make the market and seize opportunities. We have emphasized on the megatrends in the ecosystem that is less studied in marketing. By doing this, we extend the view of outside-in marketing from being micro-focuses to encompass both micro and macro focus.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0605\"/>As we have shown throughout the paper, although the macro factors are conceptually distinct, their developments can be interrelated, and the resulting influence on consumers is often a confluence of multiple factors. Like any ecosystem in nature, the marketing ecosystem should be viewed as a \"living\" thing, with complex and interdependent parts, and in perpetual motion (<link><marker>Scheffer, Carpenter, Foley, Folke, &amp; Walker, 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0605\"/></link>; <link><marker>Walther et al., 2002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0720\"/></link>). It would be difficult, if not impossible, to truly isolate the effects of a single factor (<link><marker>Hooper et al., 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0330\"/></link>). For instance, the interrelationships of the various factors ranging from firms' organizational, marketplace, technological, environmental, cultural, to geopolitical, are at full display during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and are affecting firms and consumers in all industries world-wide. Whereas in the past many of these ecosystem factors might have been relegated to the domains of corporate social responsibility and goodwill and have been viewed as truly \"outside\" of the core scope and mission of profit-oriented firms, we argue that consciously incorporating these outside-in ecosystem factors into firms' decision-making will be essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability in an increasingly interlinked and dynamic business environment.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0210\"/>Marketing has long stressed the importance of long-term firm strategy. However, grand multi-year strategy formulations are becoming less and less relevant in the inherently and increasingly volatile and complex environments and can limit adaptability. The management theorist Peter Drucker once said, \"culture eats strategy for breakfast.\" Culture represents the values, customs, beliefs, and symbolic practices that men and women within an organization live and breathe day in and day out (<link><marker>Eagleton, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0210\"/></link>). A resolutely embraced firm culture is as close as it gets to a set of \"organizational DNA\" that can be reproduced and passed down in the development and sourcing of the next generation of leaders.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0200\"/>Accordingly, the fast-moving and unpredictable characteristics of the marketing ecosystem calls for an organizational culture of agility, humility, and nonlinear thinking. Firms should keep a constant pulse on the ecosystem but also acknowledge and embrace uncertainty in the market, avoid ideological rigidity, and be ready to admit mistakes and adjust or reverse course. Managers should embody the growth mindset as described by the social psychologist Carol Dweck (<link><marker>Dweck, 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0200\"/></link>) and a humble attitude of what the writer David Brooks calls \"epistemological modesty\" (<link><marker>Brooks, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0110\"/></link>) - that society is a complex organism and we cannot fully understand and predict all of its forces. An epistemologically modest attitude also acknowledges that past successes are a combination of sound strategy as well as favorable market conditions and serendipity, and that strategies that worked in the past might not work in the future. As the Nobel-winning psychologist Amos Tversky once said - \"he who sees the past as surprise-free is bound to have a future full of surprises.\"</p><p>As digital transformation becomes increasingly democratized, and technological barriers for business excellence continues to drop (<link><marker>Zhang &amp; Hon, 2020a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0785\"/></link>), culture and mindset will play a more significant role than specific technical capabilities which have generated competitive advantages of the past. An agile, broad-thinking, and humble culture can enable firms to develop a more robust outside-in capability which allows them to better market-sense and seize opportunities, and quickly develop specific capabilities that fit into future market needs.</p><p>Understanding megatrends often requires decision-makers with different backgrounds, training, and viewpoints. Thus, the ecosystem perspective calls for a management culture of interdisciplinary formulation of marketing strategies. Likewise, future marketing and business leaders should be exposed to liberal arts in addition to possessing technical and business skills, in order to harbor a humanistic and holistic view of the consumer and of the marketplace, informed by history.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0470\"/>One open question is why so many modern organizations with strong analytical abilities and outside-in perspective are still surprised and sidestepped by missed market opportunities and unexpected events. This puzzle presents a limitation of the current research and suggests that the market success of an organization cannot be solely determined from a marketing lens. Within an organization, marketing is just one function with its limited resources and boundaries. Factors such as reward structure, organizational structure, the power of the various executives, and the integration and collaboration of different functional units all contribute to whether a marketing ecosystem mindset can be adopted successfully and executed coherently. These are important areas of future research. It calls for \"boundary-breaking\" research programs and the involvement of scholars from diverse disciplines as well as multiple research stakeholders such as managers and policymakers - a sentiment echoed by the marketing academic community (<link><marker>Moorman, van Heerde, Moreau, &amp; Palmatier, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0470\"/></link>; <link><marker>Simonson, Carmon, Dhar, Drolet, &amp; Nowlis, 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0635\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zeithaml et al., 2020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0760\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0105\"/>Finally, we once again emphasize that as the world becomes wealthier (<link><marker>Brookings, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0105\"/></link>; <link><marker>Forbes, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0255\"/></link>; <link><marker>O'Toole, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0550\"/></link>), as inequality widens, and as natural resources become depleted, a daunting challenge for firms of all types is how to balance the profit-maximization mantra of capitalism with responsible growth and meaningful impacts on society (<link><marker>Zhang &amp; Hon, 2020b</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0790\"/></link>). Consumers demand it, the world needs it, and businesses' continued relevance and survival depend on it. Marketing and business communities need to deeply reflect on their worldviews - how they comprehensively see and envision the world across economic, social, and political borders, and think about the purpose of their existence beyond profit, growth, and shareholder value. Solutions to this challenge require cultural and policy paradigm shifts (<link><marker>Aragon-Correa, Marcus, &amp; Vogel, 2020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0040\"/></link>) informed by the outside-in, an awakening to \"enlightened capitalism\" (<link><marker>O'Toole, 2019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0545\"/></link>) beyond idealistic and theoretical discussions, and sustained and concerted efforts from society's multiple stakeholders. This process will not be easy, but there needs to be no tension between the various objectives. Reconciling social benefits with consumers' interests in mind and with growing profits for the firm is only a matter of the right mission and values.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: \u204e Corresponding author.</p></bodyText></contact><graphic/><bibliography><bodyText><p><anchor id=\"reference5b0005\"/><link><marker>Abadi et al., 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref5b0005\"/></link> M.

I would love to check in with Clint and see if he's updated his ballot.)Of course, marketing can be used for good as well as evil.To wit:Right now, we have - for all intents and purposes - absolutely no federal 'privacy' law at all.US Congress Proposes Comprehensive Federal Data Privacy Legislation - Finally[3]I have an intelligence-guided-by-experience[4] distinct impression - that most Americans are ignorant of what that means.Ignorant of what 'privacy' legislation is. And ignorant of what not having any means.Please note: I said these many Americans are ignorant - not stupid.It Is Big Media's job to report to us the news of the day. But as we have just above yet again demonstrated - Big Media is utterly corrupt.So the average American with a regular gig - one that is not following the news for a living - is uninformednot unintelligent.Butwe now all have access to the Internet. Which places all humanity's information at our fingertips.So if the average American doesn't expand their search for information beyond Big Media - they are helping make the case for stupid rather than ignorant.Federal 'Privacy' legislation is meant to address - basically everything we do on online.For what we search, where we go, what we do, what we purchase, - EVERYTHING we do online - is data for Internet companies to collect and sell.Privacy Is a Bigger Issue Than You Think[5]Federal 'Privacy' legislation should equally rein in - and establish identical parameters and limits for and protections from - everyone who collects our digital data.Big Tech - Google, Facebook, Amazon,. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) - Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;#38;T,. Everyone collecting online data.What they collect, how they collect - and how they secure our digital data.I think part of the problem with 'Privacy' legislation - is it shouldn't be called 'Privacy' legislation. It doesn't market well.'Privacy' - is too broad and vague.'Americans' Digital Data Protection' - is targeted and specific to what the legislation will do. And better grabs average Americans' attention.We absolutely need 'Americans' Digital Data Protection' legislation.We have had a private sector Internet for a quarter century. And again - we still have ZERO law delineating what can and can not be done with our digital data.Please keep in mind:Big Tech behemoths like Google and Facebook became near-$1-TRILLION companies - nigh entirely by collecting and selling our digital data.Big Tech behemoths - love the lack of federal Digital Data Protection legislation.Government Absence Leaves Big Tech to Steer Privacy[6]And in the event of a prospective shift in the wind - Big Tech behemoths are looking to crony-rig in their favor any Digital Data Protection law Congress puts forward.Big Tech's Disingenuous Push for a Federal Privacy Law[7]But again - we need Equal Protection[8] before Digital Data Protection law.Big Tech, ISPs, everyone collecting digital data - treated equally.One additional thought about Digital Data Protection law:It should be one federal thing. Not thousands of state, county and city things.Leftists Do Federalism Terribly - To Then Do Policy Terribly[9]:'Behold the Left's anti-Federalism assault on the Internet - ridiculously executed in the name of 'Federalism!''States Will Be the Battlegrounds for 2020 Tech Policy Fights'Will 2020 See a State-by-State Return to Net Neutrality in the US?'Will More States Adopt Privacy Laws in 2020?'How Progressive Federalism Can Help Preserve Net Neutrality:'#8216;(I)nternet policy should be a welcome opportunity to use one of our country's most valuable traditions, federalism, to identify policies and approaches that work, as well as those that fail to achieve their goals.''Ummm.no.'The World Wide Web - is a WORLD Wide Web. An entire planet of countries - interconnected.'So quite obviously, Internet law and regulation is the purview of our federal government.'Our Feds pass and impose Internet policy for US - and then negotiate terms of interchange with the nations of the world.'Having fifty different slates of state-by-state Internet policies - is omni-directional insane.'Good marketing isn't all about style.Having a substantively good product helps too.Good Digital Data Protection legislation - is easier to pass than bad Privacy legislation.[Originally posted at RedState][10] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-obama-proudest-moment-no-scandal\">https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-obama-proudest-moment-no-scandal</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://archive.is/FfJEl#selection-111.0-111.79\">http://archive.is/FfJEl#selection-111.0-111.79</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/privacy-security-world/2019/03/what-congress-means-when-it-talks-about-data-privacy-legislation/\">https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/privacy-security-world/2019/03/what-congress-means-when-it-talks-about-data-privacy-legislation/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ncc-1776.org/tle2000/libe68-20000331-11.html\">https://ncc-1776.org/tle2000/libe68-20000331-11.html</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/big-data-privacy-is-a-bigger-issue-than-you-think/\">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/big-data-privacy-is-a-bigger-issue-than-you-think/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2020/05/government-absence-leaves-big-tech-steer-privacy-contact-tracing-apps/165189/?oref=nextgov_cio_briefing_nl\">https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2020/05/government-absence-leaves-big-tech-steer-privacy-contact-tracing-apps/165189/?oref=nextgov_cio_briefing_nl</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/big-techs-disingenuous-push-federal-privacy-law\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/big-techs-disingenuous-push-federal-privacy-law</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redstate.com/setonmotley/2020/01/14/leftists-do-federalism-terribly-to-then-do-policy-terribly/\">https://www.redstate.com/setonmotley/2020/01/14/leftists-do-federalism-terribly-to-then-do-policy-terribly/</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redstate.com/diary/setonmotley/2020/05/11/marketing-is-important-for-bad-politicians-bad-virus-policy-and-good-legislation/\">https://www.redstate.com/diary/setonmotley/2020/05/11/marketing-is-important-for-bad-politicians-bad-virus-policy-and-good-legislation/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-HRTL136364158938834313225876100103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HRTL-136364</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YWP-J5X1-JCMN-Y093-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1244\"/><timeReceived>4:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Heartlander</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 13, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

very important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama is an untalented, utterly corrupt Communist hack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a full-on (and ongoing) Big Media marketing blitz \u2013 Obama is now an absolutely awful ex-two-term president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama concluded his eight years of massive, ongoing, rolling criminal activity \u2013 by attempting a government-wide coup to overthrow his elected successor Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama left the White House \u2013 with Big Media having completely covered up eight full years of his Administration\u2019s malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now Big Media is amplifying administration Vice President \u2013 and now-presumptive Democrat presidential nominee \u2013 Joe Biden\u2019s fatuously ridiculous claim there was \u201cnot one whisper of scandal.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as to aid in the marketing for November\u2019s election \u2013 of the dementia-addled, corrupt candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it weren\u2019t for Big Media\u2019s massive marketing \u2013 Obama, Biden and a whole host of other Obama Administration officials would already be in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, if it weren\u2019t for Big Media\u2019s massive marketing \u2013 the meritless Obama would never have been elected president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marketing\u2026is very important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama is one of the most successful marketing jobs in the history of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or as Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood put it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cPresident Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Eastwood said this in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, we have been subjected to (amongst many others) the Trump-Russia collusion hoax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fraud under which the Obama Administration and the residual Deep State Swamp colluded to conduct their attempted Trump coup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there\u2019s the \u201cEveryone Must Shut Down and Stay Home\u201d mandate in response to the China Virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which has murdered our $22 trillion economy.\u00a0 By forcing us to do things \u2013 that are antithetical to everything virology and reality tell us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For the record: The China Virus shutdown hoax gets my vote for greatest hoax ever perpetrated.\u00a0 I would love to check in with Clint and see if he\u2019s updated his ballot.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, marketing can be used for good as well as evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, we have \u2013 for all intents and purposes \u2013 absolutely no federal \u201cprivacy\u201d law at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US Congress Proposes Comprehensive Federal Data Privacy Legislation \u2013 Finally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an intelligence-guided-by-experience distinct impression \u2013 that most Americans are ignorant of what that means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignorant of what \u201cprivacy\u201d legislation is.\u00a0 And ignorant of what not having any means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note: I said these many Americans are ignorant \u2013 not stupid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It Is Big Media\u2019s job to report to us the news of the day.\u00a0 But as we have just above yet again demonstrated \u2013 Big Media is utterly corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the average American with a regular gig \u2013 one that is not following the news for a living \u2013 is uninformed\u2026not unintelligent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But\u2026we now all have access to the Internet.\u00a0 Which places all humanity\u2019s information at our fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if the average American doesn\u2019t expand their search for information beyond Big Media \u2013 they are helping make the case for stupid rather than ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal \u201cPrivacy\u201d legislation is meant to address \u2013 basically everything we do on online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For what we search, where we go, what we do, what we purchase,\u2026 \u2013 EVERYTHING we do online \u2013 is data for Internet companies to collect and sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy Is a Bigger Issue Than You Think&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal \u201cPrivacy\u201d legislation should equally rein in \u2013 and establish identical parameters and limits for and protections from \u2013 everyone who collects our digital data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Tech \u2013 Google, Facebook, Amazon,\u2026.\u00a0 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) \u2013 Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T;,\u2026.\u00a0 Everyone collecting online data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they collect, how they collect \u2013 and how they secure our digital data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem with \u201cPrivacy\u201d legislation \u2013 is it shouldn\u2019t be called \u201cPrivacy\u201d legislation.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t market well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cPrivacy\u201d \u2013 is too broad and vague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAmericans\u2019 Digital Data Protection\u201d \u2013 is targeted and specific to what the legislation will do.\u00a0 And better grabs average Americans\u2019 attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We absolutely need \u201cAmericans\u2019 Digital Data Protection\u201d legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have had a private sector Internet for a quarter century.\u00a0 And again \u2013 we still have ZERO law delineating what can and can not be done with our digital data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Tech behemoths like Google and Facebook became near-$1-TRILLION companies \u2013 nigh entirely by collecting and selling our digital data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Tech behemoths \u2013 love the lack of federal Digital Data Protection legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government Absence Leaves Big Tech to Steer Privacy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the event of a prospective shift in the wind \u2013 Big Tech behemoths are looking to crony-rig in their favor any Digital Data Protection law Congress puts forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Tech\u2019s Disingenuous Push for a Federal Privacy Law&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But again \u2013 we need Equal Protection before Digital Data Protection law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Tech, ISPs, everyone collecting digital data \u2013 treated equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One additional thought about Digital Data Protection law:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be one federal thing.\u00a0 Not thousands of state, county and city things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leftists Do Federalism Terribly \u2013 To Then Do Policy Terribly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cBehold the Left\u2019s anti-Federalism assault on the Internet \u2013 ridiculously executed in the name of \u2018Federalism!</p><p>\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cStates Will Be the Battlegrounds for 2020 Tech Policy Fights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWill 2020 See a State-by-State Return to Net Neutrality in the US?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWill More States Adopt Privacy Laws in 2020?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow Progressive Federalism Can Help Preserve Net Neutrality:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u2018(I)nternet policy should be a welcome opportunity to use one of our country\u2019s most valuable traditions, federalism, to identify policies and approaches that work, as well as those that fail to achieve their goals.\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cUmmm\u2026.no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe World Wide Web \u2013 is a WORLD Wide Web.\u00a0 An entire planet of countries \u2013 interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo quite obviously, Internet law and regulation is the purview of our federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur Feds pass and impose Internet policy for US \u2013 and then negotiate terms of interchange with the nations of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHaving fifty different slates of state-by-state Internet policies \u2013 is omni-directional insane.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good marketing isn\u2019t all about style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a substantively good product helps too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good Digital Data Protection legislation \u2013 is easier to pass than bad Privacy legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Originally posted at RedState]&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you so  much and good morning everybody.  Happy Thursday to you.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Thursday, October 19th.  Your top stories right now,  6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Thirty years ago a market milestone and yesterday, a major market milestone  as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BARTIROMO:  The DOW Jones Industrial Average closing above 23,000 for the  first time ever yesterday.  It was the f1st record close since President  Trump took office.  An amazing momentum market.</p><p> Earnings driving the gains yesterday, the optimism over tax cuts has  underpinned market gains for months as well and we could be one step closer  to it today.  The Senate gears up for the budget vote later today.   President Trump is calling this a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will be the largest tax  cut in the history of our country.  I focus on tax cuts because it's such  an important weapon to get our country really moving.  </p><p> So we'll go from being one of the highest tax nations in the world to one  of the lowest tax.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in my opinion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got all of the updates coming up.  Geopolitical tensions  this morning however weighing on markets.  Pulling things back from  yesterday's all time high.  </p><p>DOW Industrial expected to be down about 80 points at the opening of  trading, down about a third of a percent, Nasdaq down two-thirds of a  percent right now.</p><p> In Europe this morning, take a look at the action, all the major averages  down as you see there with the FTSE100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC  Krones down almost half of a percent and the DAX Index down better than one  half of one percent.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Japan  which was up again taking a cue from the U.S., up half of a percent.</p><p> A brand new terrorism threat to report, the Department of Homeland Security  is warning that ISIS is plotting another 9/11 style attack, details on this  terrifying plan aiming to inflict mass casualties.  We've got all the  details.</p><p> And a scary scene at the German airport, an Air Berlin Jet does a dangerous  fly-by with 200 passengers on board, the fallout from the active defiance  coming up.</p><p> NFL Commission Roger Goodell refusing to take a tougher stance on anthem  protests and nobody is happy with Goodell's comments even Colin Kaepernick,  he fired back without opening his mouth.  We'll tell you what he said.</p><p>General Electric eyes major cost cuts, \"The Wall Street Journal\" this  morning reporting some of the excessive spending at the company including  Former CEO Jeff Immelt flying an empty jet next to his jet as a back up  during his 16-year tenure.  Wow.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle is here.  Kelly and Company  Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly is here.  And Rosecliff Capital CEO, Mike  Murphy is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Great to  be here.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Happy Thursday everybody.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  We have 5,000 foot jump since President Trump took office in  the DOW but this tax plan, man, I'll tell you, we're going to have to see  what happens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely, 23,000 and counting.  I mean, come on.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  And you know what's fascinating is actually  Janet Yellen is due to have a meeting today at the White House with  President Trump.</p><p> And so whatever happens at the Fed and whoever they pick next is going to  have significant impacts on the markets and one of the reasons why you can  see that is because the Fed has been so accommodative to this market.</p><p> You've seen asset inflation, I mean valuations are at all time highs.  So  it's a fascinating aspect because Secretary MNuchin has reported that he  doesn't like Kevin Warsh because he think he could royal markets, right?</p><p> He wasn't for quantitative using, he actually was very adamant against it.   And so Jerome Powell is more accommodative. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We may know this week or next who the president decides on,  we're going to get to all of that coming up.</p><p> But first, our top story this hour and that is the market milestone,  23,000.  The DOW Industrial closed above the 23,000 mark for the first time  ever yesterday.  Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin though made an important  comment throughout the day warning that all of those games could be in  jeopardy should Congress fail to pass tax reform.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY TEXT: </p><p> There is no question that the rally in the stock market has based into it  reasonably high expectations of us getting tax cuts and tax reform done.   It also has based into it optimism on regulatory relief which they begun to  see and there's expectations.  So I think to the extent we get the tax deal  done, the stock market will go up higher but there's no question in my mind  if we don't get it done, you're going to see a reversal of the significant  amount of these gains.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  sounds about right, the Senate is expected to vote today on a  budget that would allow the Chamber to pass a tax bill with just 51 votes  instead of the 60 needed for major legislation.  </p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is Former Chief Strategist for  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, his senate and president campaign, Jason Johnson is  with us along with Former Deputy Secretary of Labor in the Obama  Administration, now a Senior Fellow at the University of Virginia Miller  Center, Chris Liu.  Good to see you both gentlemen, Thank you so much for  joining us this morning.</p><p> CHRIS LIU, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LABOR, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION:  Thank  you. </p><p> JASON JOHNSON, FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Jason, in that same interview, the Treasury Secretary made  those comments about the market, he offered this, an absolutely guarantee  that a tax overhaul would be sign into law by the end of this year.  Is  that a reasonable time table?  Do you think they will get this done?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well certainly if you look at the performance this year with  other major pieces of legislation it doesn't seem reasonable.  But I  understand why the Secretary is saying what he's saying.</p><p> There is an absolute expectation that this has to be done in the political  market if you will.  And so I'm not incredibly optimistic that it happens  by the end of the year.  There certainly seems to be a mixed message coming  from some leaders on the Hill as to whether or not the deadline is the end  of the year.  But whether it's the end of the year or after the first of  the year, it must happen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Chris, do you agree with that that it must happen and that it  will happen?</p><p> LIU:  I agree with Senator McConnell who said it's more important that we  get it right instead of just running this through.  And I think it's  important to look at the details here and we don't really know yet  percentage is going to go to the super wealthy, how it's going to add to  the deficit whether it's really going to fix the idiosyncrasies in the tax  code right now.</p><p> And so putting it on an artificial deadline does not bode well for coming  up with good policy and that's really what the market wants to see right  now.  They really want to see the once in a generation tax reform proposal,  not another giveaway that just goes to the super wealthy.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, Chris considering -- it's Kevin Kelly here.  Considering you  spent time in the White House especially with President Obama, do you think  it's appropriate for a cabinet secretaries or anybody in this  administration to be talking about the impact on stock markets given that  they should be focusing on policy and talking about the implements, what it  could do to the real economy as opposed to really focusing on markets that  should do whatever they should be doing?</p><p> LIU:  That's exactly right.  It's one of the reasons why we in the Obama  Administration didn't talk about the stock market even though we had  significant gains as well because the market goes up and unfortunately it  goes down as well.</p><p> And it goes up or down for reasons that have nothing to do with Washington.   And if I were Secretary MNuchin, I would probably take my cues from the  leaders on the Hill as to what the timing should be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, I know.  I think that's a good point but at the same  time, $5.3 trillion in market value doesn't come out of air.  It's clear  that the market value that we've seen in these gains is partly due to  optimism over what President Trump is doing.  </p><p> He's rolled back an incredible amount of regulation and they're expecting  tax reform.  Are you saying $5.3 trillion in market value is just a  coincidence?</p><p> LIU:  Well I would say that it's based on the expectation something's  happening.  This is a recovery, economic recovery that began in early 2010  and we've had essentially seven straight years of economic growth.</p><p> There have been rollbacks of regulations but there hasn't been this  significant economic change that Donald Trump has promised yet.  So a lot  of this is --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we did see a 3.1 percent GDP the other day and GDP was  averaging about one and a half percent under President Obama.  So -- I mean  there's something to it that the economy is definitely better.  </p><p> You're (INAUDIBLE) in small business, do you see that Mike Murphy?  Do you  see things getting better?  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.  We see small business optimism out there, we see  startups, we see companies that are looking to disrupt existing industries  coming out hiring people, raising money, going out and creating -- using  technology to make our lives better.  So I think right now the optimism  that we see nationwide is something we haven't seen in a long time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jason, let me ask you this, in terms of this bill, if it gets  done in the first quarter, do you think that still has a positive impact?   If we don't see a bill on the president's desk by Thanksgiving, this is  going to be a problem for certainly into the 2018 election for the  republicans.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Sure.  Going back to the comment earlier that we shouldn't have  artificial deadlines.  I don't believe getting this done by the end of the  year or seeing that we need to get it done by the end of the year is an  artificial deadline because we know historically that very few things  happen in election year.</p><p> And as we all know, next year is an election year.  So Maria, into the  first quarter, maybe so but we know that you get much passed the first  quarter these guys don't like to do much in an election year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you're right, if they don't get it done maybe that's  -- they should move out because this is something that the American people  want, Lea Gabrielle.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.  Chris, Senator Schumer said our republican friends are  trying to hide what's in the tax bill that they don't want people to know.  </p><p> Is this just resistance sort of popping up already from the democrats on  this obstructionist because really tax reform is good for all Americans  right now, is it?</p><p> LIU:  A hundred percent agree tax reform is good.  What we have seen so far  is simply tax cuts and some of the initial estimates are that becoming 50  to 80 percent of the benefits would go to the top one percent.  Look --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's not true.  That's just not true.  I don't want to spew  out nonsense because 80 percent of the tax reform package going to the top  one percent is nonsense.</p><p> LIU:  An important issue to get right.  For instance, it's the state and  local tax deduction which is going to affect a lot republican members and  understanding the details of that is not just resistance, it's actually  trying to make sure that this is legitimate tax reform and there are so  many issues.  This is why this is hard and it's hard to get it right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're talking about a corporate rate of 20 percent.  If you  see the corporate rate go down from 35 percent to 20 percent, that will be  a positive for corporations and the idea is is that they are going to  reinvest in higher (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> KELLY:  It's small businesses.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Small business with 25 percent pass through rate, same thing  down from 39.6.  So this is a significant move.  He's also talking about  three brackets, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent --</p><p> MURPHY:  I mean, small businesses is like --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Doubling the standard deduction.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I'd like to point out, those aren't republican small  businesses, those are democrat, republican, American small businesses.  So  that impacts everybody not just one side.  This isn't a one side versus the  other.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the reason that I have to push back on that Chris  is because we were expecting the talking points after this plan and it's  just not true that 80 percent of the tax plan impacts the top one percent,  it's just not true and we have to make it clear.</p><p> LIU:  You know, the problem is, we don't have the details yet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p> LIU:  We don't have the -- we don't have the details yet and I think that's  the problem --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well we have the details that we just mentioned, we got three  brackets on the individual rates, we got a doubling of the standard  deduction, corporate rate of 20 percent, pass through rate of 25 percent,  and the elimination of most deductions.</p><p> LIU:  Well look, we don't really know what the impact is on average  Americans, we don't know what the size of the (INAUDIBLE) tax credit is  going to be, we don't understand all the other archaic idiosyncrasy that's  --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So then how can you say it benefits the one percent if you  don't even have the details?</p><p> LIU:  Well -- look, we're -- the folks that have looked at this are basing  this on the initial proposal.  Let's have a whole debate on this and let's  make sure we get this right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because this is -- we're watching President  Obama return to the campaign trail Chris to stump for democratic candidates  and governance races, of course, in New Jersey and in Virginia, out of next  month elections.</p><p> This development comes amid a shakeup at the DNC where several key long  time officials have lost their post.  The party's new chairman, Tom Perez  obviously preparing to host his first meeting since taking over the job  earlier this year.</p><p> You were among the 75 people nominated by Tom Perez to become the new at  large DNC member, what's behind the shakeup?  Tell us how you're feeling?   Congratulations by that nomination by the way Chris.</p><p> LIU:  Well look, there are about 400 members of the Democratic National  Committee.  The new chairman get to pick 75.  This is a time of change  within the Democratic Party and I think we need to admit that things  haven't gone as well as they should have over the last couple of years.</p><p> And so unfortunately when you bring new people in, some people that have  served for a while have to be moved and that's just part of change.  And  this is a big 10 party and change happens and change is good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, one thing that seems to be happening is that the  Democratic Party is being hijacked by the extreme left Chris.  </p><p> Are you going to be able to come up with a message that will resonate with  the broad American people, the population given the fact that you've got  Barrack Obama, you've got Bernie Sanders, you've got Elizabeth Warren going  to the extreme left and really hijacking what was a moderate party at one  point?</p><p> LIU:  Tom Perez has made a commitment that the democrats need to compete in  every seat from the school board to the Senate to the White House.</p><p> And we need to understand that we as a party can't have one monolithic  message.  That doesn't work in all state and certainly doesn't even work in  all rural areas versus urban areas as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  All right.  Gentlemen, thanks very  much for the conversation we appreciate you joining us this morning.  Chris  Liu.  Jason, good to see you as well.  We will talk with you soon  gentlemen.</p><p> Coming up, the head of Homeland Security is warning Americans of a new  threat, the concern over ISIS plotting another 9/11 next.  We are going to  tell you the details of what we know.  </p><p> Then Colin Kaepernick firing back at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the  new way he's lashing out against him straight ahead.  </p><p> A fired up morning thins morning, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A top U.S. security chief warning terror groups  are planning a major attack on the scale of 9/11.  Cheryl Casone with the  details now, Cheryl --</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Maria, good morning.  Acting Homeland Security  Secretary Elaine Duke saying it is clear that ISIS and other terror groups  are planning to take down planes as an aim to carry out another massive  attack.  Duke also saying terror groups have been using knife and van  attacks to keep their members engaged.</p><p> Well the head of American Express, one of the country's most prominent  African-American corporate leaders is leaving the company, Kenneth Chenault  depature caps a 16-year run at the credit card company.  He's going to be  succeeding a CEO by Stephen Squeri a three decade AmEx veteran.  Shares of  AmEx up 23 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, American cities are pulling all the stops in their bid to become home  to Amazon's second headquarters.  Stonecrest, Georgia has offered to change  its name to Amazon.  Tucson, Arizona tried to send a company a 21-foot  cactus.</p><p>Amazon has promised to invest $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs.  The  deadline to submit bids is today.  And, of course, check this out, New York  City lit up famous buildings including the Empire State Building and one  World Trade in Amazon's orange color last night trying to help seal the  deal.  Probably going to be a little more than light that's going to get  Amazon somewhere.</p><p> And then finally there's this, first lady Melania Trump is donating her  inaugural ball gown to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.   She is handing over the vanilla silk off the shoulder gown, it's got a slit  skirt.  The tradition first began Maria with Helen Taft back in 1912.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Cool.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Interesting.  Would you  go see the first lady's gown at the Smithsonian Lea?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think if I was already going to the Smithsonian then I would  happen to pass by and see the first lady's gown.</p><p> But I do think that this is really nice about making (INAUDIBLE) because it  gives you a sense of being able to even that you can't touch them, just  being able to sort of look at them and sort of have the essence of what it  must have been like to be there that day.  So I think it's wonderful that  they do this.</p><p> KELLY:  I think it also highlights the importance of the first lady, right?   I mean you go throughout history and you look at the contributions they've  made.  So it's nice that --</p><p> MURPHY:  The guy who's getting married in New York.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  I was going to say behind every great man is a better woman.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, says the guy who's getting married.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your upcoming nuptial.</p><p> KELLY:  Well she did get her dress last Friday so maybe I'm just kind of  high upbeat excited.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, she got the dress.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, I know.  So obviously I didn't see it but it was a fun and  exciting experience.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I was going to say, let's see a live TV picture of this and get  you in really big trouble.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep following all of that.  Coming up next  though, a real scare in the sky to tell you about, more video of the risky  fly-by stunt that got pilot suspended, that's coming up.</p><p> And then GE's new chief taking away company cars and cancelling fancy  retreats.  The new cost cutting direction for General Electric ahead of its  earnings tomorrow, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric's new CEO John Flannery making  some changes starting with some old favorites.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details, Tracee --</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.  You know,  John Flannery, he's only been on the job since August 1st but he's already  making some big changes.</p><p> One of his first belt tightening moves was to ground GE's fleet of six  business jets which was a favorite of former GE CEO Jeff Immelt who used to  have an empty private jet fly next to his just as a spare and that's just  the beginning.</p><p> Bob Nardelli, former Chrysler CEO and Home CEO was on the show yesterday  and here's what he had to say.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO HOME DEPOT &amp; CHRYSLER:  They have to get their  fundamental businesses that are left to get some growth.  They got to get  growth, they've got to get top line growth, they got to get productivity,  they got to get innovation.</p><p> The key to GE over the last 16 years Maria as we've seen that goes out have  been a lot more than the goes in.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARRASCO:  And Nardelli worked at GE for several years.  And according to  \"The Wall Street Journal,\" next month Flannery is expected to unveil the  results of a strategic review that includes thousands of corporate level  job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure.</p><p> He is shutting down research centers in Shanghai, Munich, and Rio democrats  Janiero.  A GE spokesperson said:</p><p> TEXT: The company will continue to have an intense focus on our global  operations and customer base.</p><p> The company is expected to report quarterly reports tomorrow.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at that stock ahead of those --</p><p> CARRASCO:  Hasn't been good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ahead of those numbers.  The stock has been cut in half from  the highs.  No, wait a minute.  Let's just underline what you just said  Tracee, he had a separate jet flying behind his jet on business trips and  the jet flying behind him was empty.</p><p> CARRASCO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he did that for what reason?</p><p> CARRASCO:  Just in case there were any issues with the private jet he was  already on.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I mean --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I flew in the navy and I have a commanding officer who made me  take a jet to an air show because it was his hometown and he wanted to make  sure that if his jet, if there's anything wrong with it he couldn't fly in  the air show but there was a spare there.  So I've seen this before, pretty  wasteful.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  But the biggest problem is they have shareholders, right,  that they're held accountable too and I'm sorry --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a public company.</p><p> KELLY:  Listen, you don't need to fly a private jet next to you.  Listen,  if your plane has mechanical issues, guess what, then we'll figure out and  we'll rent a private jet that's there to take you back to wherever you need  to go.  You don't -- yes, exactly.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  Well here's the problem, the board.  If I was a member on the  board, how can you -- you've got to be held accountable.  I mean, they --  like coming out of GE tomorrow and whether they cut the dividend, that's  one of the biggest concerns that shareholders are having right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, sure is.</p><p> KELLY:  But also what is this board doing if they're allowing this, right?   Shareholder capital --</p><p> MURPHY:  And (INAUDIBLE) I think for an old company like GE that's trying  to figure out how to stay relevant in this new economy, I think something  like this coming out makes it really hard for shareholders to believe in  this.</p><p> And you could see people wanting to sell this and look at company if they  are really on the cutting edge of technology.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that are growing.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  But they are looking for places to trim the fat just like  Tracee mentioned, shutting down some of those research centers and sort of  trying to consolidate their resources.  So at least we're moving forward in  that way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've got to.  We'll see what the company says tomorrow.  GE  reports at around 8:30a.m. in the morning, tomorrow morning on its third  quarter. And, of course, a speculation is around that dividend.  Tracee  Carrasco, thank you.  </p><p> We will take a break.  When we come back, months after going public, Blue  Apron is laying off hundreds of employees.

We've got more, coming up on that.  But first, a new approach to measuring  success, Fortune Magazine is shining a light on the top names driving the  business world tomorrow, where is the growth?  We want to know.  Fortune is  debuting its future 50 list today, covering the most innovative companies  prime for explosive growth.  Fox Business has the exclusive first look at  the list.  </p><p> Coming in at number five on Fortunes' Future 50 Leaders, medical robotics  leader, Intuitive Surgical, fourth is the king of the stream, Netflix.   Number three on this list, Mark Zuckerberg's dorm project turns social  media titan, Facebook.  Elon Musk, electric automaker Tesla, cruising into  the second spot.  And topping the list is cloud computing giant,  Salesforce, joining us right now in a Fox Business Exclusive, Working  Deputy Editor, Brian O'Keefe.  Brian, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR OF FORTUNE:  My pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, a lot of those names, obviously, very familiar and growth  stories that we all know, how did you come up with this list, what are the  growth metrics that you used?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  So we worked with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), they were our  partners in doing this.  They did an incredible amount of number crunching,  and they looked at 15 years of financial data and they scream for all 2,300  U.S. public companies.  And they really looked at a couple of things.  One  is the market potential of all these companies, what the market is betting,  how much growth the market is betting and assigning their value.  </p><p> And then they also dove into the company's themselves and looked at people,  structure, their technology and investments, they used artificial  intelligence, natural language processing to look at 70,000 10Ks and look  at the way those companies talked about themselves, if they talked about  future and investment and long-term thinking.  And they did a lot of  backtesting and looked at what correlated with real growth over time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's interesting that Salesforce is the number one -- in  the number one spot.  Were you surprised with that, Mike?</p><p> MURPHY:  I was, for sure, because, you know, when you think about growth,  you hear the fangs.  You know, you hear about Facebook, which is there but  Amazon, Netflix, which is there, Google.  So, the way this is -- I think  this is going to create a lot of controversy from people who are saying,  you know, like, oh, here's the big apple, we don't see therearound.</p><p> KELLY:  Apple didn't make the list, actually.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Apple didn't make the list.</p><p> KELLY:  Apple did not make the list, in part to its recent increase  emphasis on paying dividends on over reinvestment.</p><p> O'KEEFE: Yes, I mean, you're seeing -- I mean, Apple is the big exception,  right?  That's, you know, we noted that.  And, you know, Apple is obviously  still an incredible performer but they are piling up cash, they are paying  out dividends under some pressure to shareholders and that's not really a  formula for future growth.  </p><p> You know, you want to see a company, not that Apple is not doing well, but  you want to see them putting it in to new technology, Salesforce, to your  point, you know, they are -- Marc Benioff keeps that company really focused  on the future, they're investing in artificial intelligence and they're  making acquisitions on --</p><p> KELLY:  And I think the important thing about Salesforce, if you look it as  -- it didn't surprise me one bit about this, because he's actually struck  deals and partnerships with other companies like IBM to have a stronger,  better, platform for his customers, right?  So for insurance companies, if  there's a hail storm, they're going to use IBMs (INAUDIBLE) to notify all  the policyholders, so he's done a very good job especially on the  acquisition side.  So if they had a hole on their business model, he went  out and bought them.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  To look at the list overall, though, you know, a lot of people  say the past performance is the best indication of future success and  that's really not the way that you created this list, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that's really, kind of, the whole reason we did  create this list, is that past performance isn't the indicator of future  success and today's environment, things are changing so much faster,  technologies speeding up the pace of change, that we felt like in BCG, felt  like, we need a better metric to do that.  So that, you know, most of the  time, you're measuring a company on.  </p><p> You're trying to project the future on what they've been doing recently.   And this is like really -- that's why it's diving into, sort of, the DNA of  these companies and how they operate and how they talk and how they think  and trying to do that in a scientific way.  And, you know, looking at the  structure of the company, I mean, the hard reality is that younger  companies tend to grow faster, I mean, not just smaller companies, but  tightly-managed younger companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And founder companies, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  And founder companies, a lot of the time, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You also put his list of Future 50 Challengers.  We just showed  it on the screen.  These are companies that are on the fast-track for  growth but aren't quite there yet.  So how did you come up with this list?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Well, the secret about the Future 50 is (INAUDIBLE) list of 25.   So we have the 25 big companies and the 25 challengers, is what we called  it, BCG, didn't want to -- if you're screening for growth, you're going to  naturally get smaller companies, so that's why we did two separate screens  to get the big companies that are still growing.  The challengers are  really the companies that are on the rise, not necessarily small companies,  but, you know, it can be like, $5 to 10-billion market cap companies.  And  you see a lot of software companies on the list overall but especially on  the challenger's list, I mean, it's really like software is eating the  world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what Marc Andreessen said years ago, you know, software  eats the world.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, it's still true.  It's true, maybe more than ever.  I mean,  it's, you know, like Veeva Systems, the number one company in the  challenger's list.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Workday has been taking market share from, like, the  oracles of the world for years.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Workday is huge.  I mean, obviously, it's a huge stock, market  cap has shut up.  And yes, so these are companies that they're displacing  traditional systems and they're doing it with software technology.</p><p> KELLY:  So on Workday, it's a perineal emanate target, right?  And I just  wanted to highlight the point you said, though, earlier, 64 percent of the  companies in this list are software or online service providers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  That highlights that this is the wave and this is the future of  where we are going.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You want to find growth, that's where it is.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, and a bit in every industry.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And one of the things that you have said is that, a lot of  companies that are using artificial intelligence are, sort of, higher on  the list, but you also used artificial intelligence in developing this  list, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that was one of the really cool things that BCG did,  is use this natural language processing to troll through 70,000 10Ks = like  200,000 different earnings calls, transcripts, and really look at the  language that the management uses to talk about how they managed their own  business.   And so, and, you know, I don't -- I don't personally know the details of  how the artificial intelligence did it, but it correlates certain words and  the way they come together with performance.</p><p> MURPHY:  So, how far down did you guys dig?  Like, how low did you go?   Because a company like Salesforces which is number one, they have a  venture, we ran a venture capital funds.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Right.</p><p> MURPHY:  So Salesforce is actively out there looking to acquire early-stage  start-ups.  Is there another 50 list of, kind of, the 50 (INAUDIBLE) that's  going start-ups or early stage companies?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Maybe we will expand that out.  But one thing the BCG did do, was  look at the investments that company's making, compared to high performing  DC funds to, sort of, get a sense of like how good their investments are.   So, that's an interesting way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're hitting on something so important right now.  I'm so  glad you brought it up, Mike, because you're right, Salesforce has an arm  that invests and acquires smaller companies.  That's why a lot of these  companies as Amazon, you know, other big technology --</p><p> KELLY:  Intel.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Intel, you're seeing large tech right now, have venture capital  arm and they are acquiring some of the smaller, no-names out there.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  You know, we have a story on Salesforce that goes deeper into  what they're doing.  They bought 55 companies since 2006.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  And Marc Benioff, you know, a lot of times, like, maybe he  doesn't even exactly know what they're going to do with the company but he  knows there's an interesting technology and they make it an acquisition,  they figure out how it's going to impact their business.</p><p> KELLY:  Is there a super surprised company, for you, because I'm looking at  this list and I'm not surprised by it, but I think people could be as the  intercontinental exchange that, you know, they run the New York stock  exchange, but really, those companies, the exchange have been focusing on  data, licensing, it's not really  --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of (INAUDIBLE) mergers.</p><p> KELLY:  Exactly.  So, is there a company on this list that surprised you  the most?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Surprised me the most, I mean, I'm a little surprised -- Monster  Beverage is a really interesting company.</p><p> KELLY:  Number 20 on that list.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Because they have been growing fast for 20 years, and, you know,  I don't drink Monster Beverage drinks, but a lot of people do.  They're  really smart about how they market their brand, they don't really do a lot  of advertising but they do a lot of really cool, sort of, sponsorship  stuff.  And they just, you know, they keep growing that company year after  year.</p><p> KELLY:  And the next leg of growth for Monster Beverage is over in China  and Asia, so that's where they're looking to go so if you follow the stock  close, you can see they've dominated North America and they've slowly been  making inroads and smart positioning in Asia.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look at that chart.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  You know we have MasterCard and Visa on the list.  And I think  that's really interesting because they seemed like, you know, it's the card  in your wallet.  But they're really doing a lot of innovative things.  They  are trying to be, you know, the future of payments in all different forms.</p><p> MURPHY:  And when we talk about big tech companies or fin-tech companies  doing acquisitions, early-stage investing.  But there's also companies like  Campbell Soup has (INAUDIBLE) so it's not just big tech that's looking to  acquire small innovative companies.  I think it's across all diferent -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Campbell Soup, wow.  And these guys are computer guys like you.   We had Ann Winblad on from Winblad, who is a great venture capitalist.  And  she said, I'm competing with the arms of the soft, you know, of the  SoftBanks, not SoftBanks, of the --</p><p> MURPHY:  The large corporations.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The large corporation.  The largest technology -- </p><p> KELLY:  Imagine if the repatriation happens, of the taxes of all those  trillions of dollars overseas to these companies that they can then re- invest since small businesses start up, things that are happening.  I mean,  not to tie this into the whole tax reform overhaul policy but that could be  a good next leg of growth for this company.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  First, they have to find the right things to invest in.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, of course.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  These lists are helpful.  Brian, thank you so much, Brian  O'Keefe joining us.  We wanted to also -- should we take a look at IBM real  quick.  I mean, IBM was obviously stalled in terms of its revenue growth  for 22 quarters.  You saw a decline in revenue but yesterday, check out  that stock yesterday.  Nine percent, one of the reasons the Dow Industrials  hit 23,000.  I just wanted to mention that, is this a turning point for  IBM?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't think so.  I think when you see that type of move, so much  of the volume in the markets right now is computer driven or algorithmic  trading.  That, to me, smells like a short covering -- short squeeze.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep watching IBM.  Obviously, IBM, GE, two- story stocks that we want to look at today.  Brian, good to see you, thank  you.  Coming up next, the fight is growing over Catalonia's push for  independence.  How the Spanish government is trying to stop the region's  succession, that's next.  And then a terrifying close call, more video of  that scary fly by that put 200 passengers at risk.  We'll tell you all  about it, back in a moment, straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Markets are down this morning after a huge day  yesterday.  Dow Industrials' expected to be down better than 100 points.   No surprise.  The market crossed 23,000 yesterday for the first time ever  in a big rally, and, of course, we're up to better than $5 trillion in  market value since the election.  </p><p> A couple names on the move, Gilead Sciences; the stock right now is up  almost three percent in the premarket after winning FDA approval for a new  cancer gene therapy -- used to treat lymphoma.  The pharmaceutical giant  will sell the treatment at $373,000.  It's only the second gene therapy to  earn approval from the FDA on that.  Novartis brought the first drug of  this class to market back in August.</p><p>EBay shares this morning on the move after delivering third-quarter  earnings after the bell last night.  The results were roughly in line but  fourth-quarter guidance's disappointed.  EBay is revamping its online  marketplace amid tough competition from Amazon.  Stock, right now, taken a  real hit down 6-1/2 percent in the premarket.  </p><p> And then, there's Spain, the government there is set to activate an  emergency measure to take control of Catalonia, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So, Spain's government calling a special cabinet for  the weekend to activate this measure -- it allows for the central  government to take over the semiautonomous power of any of the country's17  regions.  Now, this comes after Catalonia's leader said, Separatist  lawmakers, can vote in favor of declaration of independence.  The measure  has never been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in  Spain.  </p><p> Well, an Air Berlin pilot is in big trouble.  He performed a risky flying  stunt with 200 passengers aboard.  You're watching the video of it right  now.  Reports say he buzzed Dusseldorf Airport terminal in a maneuver that  was met to mark the bankrupt last Trans-Atlantic flight.  Well, a pilot of  another told Reuters that a go-around should only be performed for its  operations, or safety aviation officials are looking at this video and  looking into this incident.  </p><p> Well, Blue Apron, they are tightening their belt.  The company has laid out  six percent of the workforce, that's about 300 workers, as part of a  company or organization.  Blue Apron has struggled since it went public  back in June with its stock price cut in half since then.  Competition from  a rival, a big one that would-be Amazon.  There is the year to date chart,  you can see it on your screen.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Sea World is laying off 350 workers due to low attendance at its  parks -- mainly in Orlando and San Diego.  They've been trying to rebuild  the brand solving protests over its treatment of their killer whales.   Shares of Sea World, down more than 34 percent year to date.  </p><p> And then, finally this, Snickers are getting a facelift, actually three  facelifts.  The candy company announcing they're going to release a line of  three new flavors to combat a number of different, well, emotional issues.   Feeling irritable, wimpy, indecisive?  Well, they've got the cure.  These  three bars: espresso, fiery, and salty and sweet, Maria.  Right now, I  think I want the espresso.  I'm a little tired.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Yes, the expresso sounds good.  </p><p> KELLY:  Thanks to wimpy for fiery, right?  Like, I like spicy stuff, but it  doesn't mean that I'm a wimp.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's taking it personally.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  So -- but personally, I'm really concerned about the espresso  one, because if you're irritable, I think the last thing you actually need  is to have some more caffeine.  More caffeine.  I always like those names,  though.  I actually find that really attractive.  When you're in a store  and you're looking at candy and you're like, yes, you know, I kind of feel  irritable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do you buy right there?  Or will you buy it because of  that?  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  No.  Only if I really want it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking out over  the national anthem protest.  What he said to players and how they're  reacting, next.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a big night at Wrigley Field last night.  The Cubs  fought for their playoff lives and they survived.  Jared Max with the  highlights, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey!  Good morning, Maria.  I know  the Dodgers are only one win from the World Series, but just imagine the  Cubs came all the way back to win the NLC.  Yes, they did what they had to  do last night in a do or die game 4. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> (BASEBALL GAMEPLAY)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Javier Baez at two home runs; Wilson Contreras also (INAUDIBLE) for  the Cubs.  Dodgers would blast from Cody Dellinger and Justin Turner, but  the Cubs win.  Cubs win!  Cubs win, 3-2.  So, there will be a game 5.   Tonight, at Wrigley Field, the Cubs pick Jose Montana.  The Dodgers'  Clayton Kershaw L.A. leads three games to one.  </p><p>New York Yankees rookie, Aaron Judge, a hero again last night.  A third- inning double off Astros Ace, Dallas Keuchel, gave the Yanks a 2-0 lead.   Then, at the seventh inning, fellow baby bomber, Gary Sanchez, smashes a  solo home run against Brad Peacock -- third home run this postseason for  Sanchez.  Yankees' finally got reminisce its Dallas Keuchel and Masahiro  Tanaka.  7-shutout innings, 5-0, Yanks win.  </p><p> Series goes back to Houston where the Astros won the first two games.   Here's to start, Justin Verlander tomorrow night, and Yankees turn to Luis  Severino.  Yanks, one win from their 41st American League pennant.  </p><p> Hey, you know when somebody says, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.   Well, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the opposite yesterday,  regarding players choices to stand or kneel for the national anthem.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER FOR THE NFL:  Everyone should stand for the  national anthem, that's an important part of our policy.  It's also an  important part of our game that we all take great pride in, it's also  important for us to honor our flag and to our country, and we think our  fans expect us to do that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAX:  Everyone should stand, not must stand.  While Goodell said he just  wants to keep the politics out of football.  President Trump, responded on  Twitter, \"NFL, too much talk, not enough action.  Stand for the national  anthem.\"  And while Colin Kaepernick, the first anthem kneeler, remained  silent except for retweets about not enough attention being given to what  he says police brutality against people of color. The Seahawks' Michael  Bennett isn't interested in discussing how to fix these social issues.   While the NFL team owners are trying to.  </p><p> Why?  He says, \"I don't think we can work alongside them until we address  that issue.  I think the issue with Kaepernick is the start to a  conversation.  If they want us to be open to what they want, the dialogue,  then that's something that needs to be on the table right there.\"  So,  Kaepernick first and then the issues.  </p><p> Some kneel, some protests, some put their money where their mouth is, like  the Philadelphia Eagles' Chris Long who has supported teammates protesting  the national anthem but is also doing something else.  Chris Long of the  Eagles, who had donated his first six-game paychecks this season to fund  two scholarships at a prep school in Charlottesville where he grew up is  now donating the rest of his 2017 NFL salary.  Ten more paychecks to help  fund education to make it for folks who are -- don't get the opportunities  in certain cities -- ten weeks of paychecks going to this in cities of St.  Louis, Boston and also Philadelphia.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is great.  </p><p> KELLY:  Leading by example.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Football has a 10 for Tomorrow campaign.  Good on him for that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, go Yanks!  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sorry, Max.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MURPHY:  Yes, this should be the go Yanks.</p><p> MAX:  Some Mets fans started this as soon when the Yankees beat the Mets,  and he got Wednesday missing.  Somehow, the Yankees do this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Mets are still amazing.  Sorry.  All right.  Jared Max.   Catch Jared's sports reports on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7,\" SiriusXM 115.  I  want to bring you this breaking news: the president is tweeting this  morning.  Here is what he said, \"Republicans are going for big budget  approval today.  The first step toward massive tax cuts.  I think we have  the votes, but who knows?\"  Uh-oh!</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> KELLY:  Who knows?  Caveat.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I guess they need the caveat in this day and age.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, cities are mailing in their bid to  Amazon.  We're taking a look at the other crazy stumps from towns competing  for technology giants' second headquarters, wait until you see this.   That's next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Happy  Thursday to you.  Thanks for being with us.

And it is Thursday, October 19th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> A market milestone yesterday -- yes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  closing above 23000 for the first time ever.  This was the 51st record  close since President Trump took office.</p><p> Earnings and IBM driving the gains yesterday but optimism over tax cuts has  underpinned market gains for months now.  We could be one step closer to  that today, in fact.  The Senate is gearing up for the budget vote today  and President Trump is calling this a once in a lifetime opportunity to  drive growth.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We will cut the business tax  rate from the highest in the developed world at 35 percent to no more than  20 percent.  We are cutting taxes on small businesses to the lowest rate in  more than 80 years.  We are going to restore America's competitive edge,  rebuild America's middle class -- very much aimed at the middle class --  and renew the promise of the American dream.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this morning the President just tweeted this about the  vote.  He says, \"Republicans are going for the big budget approval today,  first step toward massive tax cuts.  I think we have the votes but who  knows?\"</p><p> Well, we'll be following that all day, that's for sure.</p><p> Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions are weighing on the market this morning.

The Nikkei average up almost half a percent following  the U.S.' lead.</p><p> President Trump closer to making a decision on the chairman of the Federal  Reserve.  Current chair Janet Yellen headed to White House today, her term  ends next year in February.  We will find out soon who the President is  going to appoint.  We are taking a look at where the candidates stand this  morning.</p><p> Plus, it's deadline day, cities across the country have until midnight  tonight to submit their bids for Amazon's second headquarters.

And joining me to talk all about  it -- Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle is here; Kelly and Company  managing partner Kevin Kelly is here; and Rosecliff Capital CEO Mike  Murphy.  </p><p> Great to see you.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Good morning.  Great to be here.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  Good morning.  And what  I like is coming up at 7:30 we've got Dick Bove coming on talking about the  bank earnings and today we have BB&amp;T reporting earnings -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  -- which will be interesting because we want to see what happens  with the regional banks and the guidance they give and what they think  about tax reform because they are more levered to the U.S. economy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  </p><p> You know, the earnings estimates have come way down, Mike, from earlier in  the year.  I mean we had profit growth to 14 percent in the first quarter.   We want to talk about 4 percent expectations this quarter, but I bet you  they beat them wildly.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  Well, so far we have seen great numbers and banks have put  up some very solid numbers.  I think a lot of people have been betting  against the banks and it's been a losing trade so far.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're talking about all that this morning and a lot more  but we kick it off this hour with our top story: more than 100 cities in  North America in a bidding war this morning for next Amazon headquarters.   The fight is almost over.  Today is the last day for cities to submit their  applications to Amazon.  And the company has a wish list which all the  mayors know about.</p><p> The online giant is looking for a metro area of one million people or more,  access to a mass transit system, close proximity to international airport.</p><p> Let's talk about that.  Joining me right now is the mayor of Tulsa,  Oklahoma -- Mayor G.T. Bynum, and Danbury, Connecticut Mayor Mark Boughton.   Good to see you both.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> MARK BOUGHTON, MAYOR, DANBURY CONNECTICUT:  Thanks for having me.  Great to  be here.</p><p> G.T. BYNUM, MAYOR, TULSA, OKLAHOMA:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mayor Bynum, let me kick it off with you.  Why did you throw  your city into this bidding war?  Tell us how you fit this bill?  </p><p> BYNUM:  We think we are really well placed from a logistical standpoint.   There's no city in America that combines our quality of life here in Tulsa  with the overall population base.</p><p> We are bringing in the greatest public park gift in America, next year to a  $400 million gathering place.  We just obtained Bob Dylan's archive which  the \"Washington Post\" has said is going to lead to Tulsa becoming the  research center in the world for 20th century music.</p><p> We have the arena of the year, beating out the Staples Center and Madison  Square Garden.  So we have all of that and yet we have the ease of a Middle  American city and we are close proximity to 750,000 people in this region  that work in today businesses and profession that Amazon will need for this  headquarters.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> BYNUM:  So we think we are uniquely positioned because of our placement in  the country right by one of Amazon's main competitors just an hour and a  half to our east.  And we think we can hang with cities that are a whole  lot bigger than us from a population standpoint because of the placement we  happen to have and the culture of our city matches Amazon's very closely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mayor Boughton -- what do you think?  How do you compare?  </p><p> BOUGHTON:  Well, listen.  We are leveraging a regional approach to this.   So we're actually working with eastern New York.  We're working with lower  Fairfield County, upper Fairfield County and of course, our city which  compromises of about 85,000 people.</p><p> We have plenty of space and room to this.  We have access to all of the  mass transit things -- all the things that they're looking for to be  successful.</p><p> But we really believe in our application and, look, at the end of the day  you miss 100 percent of the shot you don't take.  So we're going to take  our shot, we want those 50,000 jobs.  The economic spinoff and derivative  is incredible and we will transform Connecticut and I think this will lead  to a Connecticut comeback. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So some cities are really getting creative in an effort to  stand out.  And check out what some of the people are doing in Tucson,  Arizona for example.  Officials uprooted a 21-foot tall cactus and tried to  deliver it to Amazon's Seattle headquarter.</p><p> Over in Birmingham, Alabama they constructed a giant Amazon box and placed  them around the city.</p><p> And then in Missouri, Kansas City's mayor reportedly bought a thousand  items from Amazon and wrote reviews for each one.</p><p> So you posted a video on Facebook, didn't you?  </p><p> BOUGHTON:  I did.  And Alexa says that, you know, we should be there that  day.  HQ2 should be Danbury, Connecticut.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You invited -- you invited Amazon to Danbury.  Listen, we have  the clip.  Let's watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOUGHTON:  We not only talk the talk but we walk the walk.  I'm a proud  Amazon customer.  So Alexa where is the best place for Amazon to locate its  second world headquarters?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Danbury, Connecticut.  </p><p> BOUGHTON:  I told you so.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MURPHY:  She's on point all the time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Alexa knew.</p><p> MURPHY:   I think one thing about Amazon, you know, they do everything but  they're really a logistics also.  So going from Seattle for their regional  headquarters and to have a place over on the East Coast I think would be  very important for them.  So I think you've got -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you have five corporations that already have global  headquarters.  </p><p> BOUGHTON:  Absolutely, yes.  We were once a city and now we're multi- corporation community.  And we are 70 miles from New York City.  So we have  all the assets that are here as well.</p><p> So look, we think -- we are a dark horse candidate.  There's no question  about that.  But we think we're a player in this and we're going to take a  shot at this thing.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  You're so right that you miss 100 percent of the shots but you  don't take -- that's something that they say a lot in the navy.  </p><p> But I want to ask Mayor Bynum, you know, you were talking about your city  and how it can benefit.  But when you're competing with cities like  Chicago, I know Mayor Emanuel who's already spoken with Jeff Bezos about a  potential move there, companies like Kraft have already planned to move to  there.  How do you compete with cities like that?  </p><p> BYNUM:  Well, I think you compete by being focused as a community on  building the best city that you can.  There are plenty of cities that have  a larger population than we do that we don't think that can compete with us  from a quality of life standpoint and from an access to human capital  standpoint.</p><p> Again, we have the population base in this region working in the industries  that Amazon needs to staff this headquarters.  And beyond that, we have the  quality of life here that really a city many times our size would typically  expect but we have it with the convenience of a city of our size here in  Tulsa.</p><p> So population-base certainly will play a factor and like my colleague from  Danbury, we recognize we are an underdog but we believe that we will be  competitive.  And our goal is that the team at Amazon is both surprised and  impressed when they open our proposal.  </p><p> KELLY:  I think the most important aspects that Amazon is going to look at  is what is the incentive for them especially on the tax side.  So I guess  this goes to both of you guys.  Let's start with G.T. -- what are you guys  willing to give Amazon in a tax incentive way to entice them to come  because we know it's always about the money -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  -- and they're going to go where the best incentive is for them.  </p><p> BYNUM:  Yes.  We're a big college football state and our head coaches don't  give their play book away to the opposing coach right when a game starts.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> BYNUM:  So we're not going to talk about what our incentives are.  We do  have, thanks to the partnership that we have with the state Oklahoma in  making this proposal, a very good incentive proposal we think that the team  at Amazon is going to be impressed by -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, yes.  I mean it is -- </p><p> BYNUM:  But I don't want to give that away today.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's all about taxes.</p><p> I mean Mr. Mayor in Danbury -- I mean look how many companies have moved  out of Connecticut because of Malloy and his taxes.</p><p> BOUGHTON:  Sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean what are you going to do about that?  </p><p> BOUGHTON:  Well, we'll partner with the state of Connecticut, obviously.   Same thing with us, we're not going to spill our popcorn or eat our popcorn  before we see the movie.  But at the end of the day, we think we can  (INAUDIBLE) the right economic incentive in front of these folks to be able  to get them there.</p><p> But it's not all about the money.  I mean look, we are not going to  completely throw ourselves at Amazon.  We want to play a little coy here  too in terms of doing this dance and we love to get them here.  And I think  that's better than just, you know, putting everything on the table at once.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you going to run for governor against Malloy next time?  </p><p> BOUGHTON:  We're looking very closely at that race and we'll see what  happens there.  We think there's an opportunity and we think it's time that  we make Connecticut great again.  How about that?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So if you were to run against Governor Malloy for the  governorship of Connecticut, will you cut taxes?  </p><p> BOUGHTON:  I will eliminate the income tax.  We have a plan to eliminate  the income tax over the next ten years and we're going to bring people back  to Connecticut.  We're going to keep our retirees to stay in Connecticut.   It's going to be the place to be.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, I will move to Connecticut if you do that.  I'm looking for a  way out.  I mean come on.  The problem is -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY:  A lot of people from New York I think will move -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know a couple of people that just bought condos in  Connecticut.  </p><p> KELLY:  Guess what, they can't go to Jersey.  Jersey is getting worst in  taxes -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  -- so if you do that -- </p><p> GABRIELLE:  And if the state and local deduction is eliminated, yes.   People will be wanting to move to Connecticut.</p><p> BOUGHTON:  And we've been (INAUDIBLE) for eight months.  It's a solid plan.   It's something I think everybody is going to be impressed with.  It's  different and we are the land of steady habits, but we will work it out.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, that's the popcorn you need to spill.  So if you're going to  run, you need those details.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BOUGHTON:  We are launching a few details here and there just to show  people a little bit about what's going on.  But again we want to play a  little coy here as well too in that particular arena.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But if you're going to run against Governor Malloy, you've got  to make it known soon, right.  I mean the race is next year.</p><p> BOUGHTON:  Look, Governor Malloy is not running again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p> BOUGHTON:  So it's going to be an open seat.  And we will have some kind of  announcement probably in January, February and see what our intentions are.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  We'll be watching that.  Mayor G.T. Bynum, Mayor Mark  Boughton -- good to see you both.  Thanks very much for coming in.</p><p> BYNUM:  Thank you.</p><p> BOUGHTON:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up: Hollywood fired back at Harvey Weinstein -- how  Channing Tatum is taking action against the Hollywood producer next.</p><p> Plus Ford recalls over a million trucks.  We will tell you about the  company's $267 million coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> President Trump set to meet with Puerto Rico's governor at the White House  today.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  What a meeting that's going to be  -- Maria.  Good morning.</p><p> Administration officials say that Trump and Ricardo Rossello will discuss  efforts to rebuild the U.S. territory which was torn apart by Hurricane  Maria.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We will continue  working hand in hand with local areas in all areas of our country that have  been impacted by several natural disasters in recent months.  And as  President Trump has repeatedly said we stand with our fellow citizens, we  are here to help and get them back on their feet.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Three million people are still without power and one million don't  have running water since Hurricane Maria struck the island nearly a month  ago.  Concerns about contamination and disease are still growing with  nearly half of Puerto Rico's sewage treatment plants out of service.</p><p> Well, actor Channing Tatum announcing he will no longer develop a film with  the Weinstein Company.  The movie was to be based on a book \"Forgive Me  Leonard Peacock\", about a boy dealing with the aftermath of sexual abuse.   In a statement Tatum calls for an elimination of abuse from creative  culture.  Harvey Weinstein who founded the Weinstein Company is accused of  rape, sexual assault and harassment by dozens of women.</p><p> And even the world's most famous sled-dog race, they did arrive, is prone  to cheating.  The race committee has revealed that someone tried to give  their dogs a boost with the opioid pain reliever, tramadol.  Officials have  refused to name, the musher involved in this.  Whoever it is won't face any  discipline.  Race rules have been revised, so musher's liable for any  future violations.  Nice.  All right.</p><p> And then country music stars paying tributes to the victims of the mass  shooting in Las Vegas last night at the CMT artists of the year show.   Among the stars on hand: Jason Aldean, Keith Urban and Chris Stapleton.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  From Las Vegas to Puerto Rico to Florida and Texas to  Charlottesville and California.  The entire nation is trying to process  these devastating events.  But on this night, one that we usually celebrate  a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human  spirit.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  So no awards were handed out, instead the show was a celebration  of life and the ability to rise above the tragedy -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> CASONE:  Some great performances there.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p> What did you think of that tribute -- Mike?  </p><p> MURPHY:  I mean it's such a tragedy to see the whole community come and  gather around and pay tribute to them.  I mean what you come to expect  though from the United States of America, we can fight and go back and  forth on different sides of things but when a tragedy comes, it shows how  we can all come together.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p> Coming up -- a historic week for Wall Street.  We're breaking down investor  reaction after the Dow closes above 23000 for the first time.  </p><p> And today, of course is the 30th anniversary of Black Monday, 23 percent  selloff in a day for the S&amp;P back then.  And look at this resilience today  in unchartered territory. </p><p> Plus a start-up is promising to help you post better photos online.  We  will talk with the CEO who has raised $11 million in funding.  How it helps  you grow your social media brand.</p><p> Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> What a week on Wall Street -- a record week for stock prices.  The Dow  Jones Industrial Average above 23000 yesterday for the first time ever.   Earnings, of course, driving the gains. </p><p> Joining us right now is Scott Wren.  He's the senior global equity  strategist with Wells Fargo Investment.  Scott -- it is good to see you.   Thank you so much -- </p><p> SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT:  Good  to see you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- for joining us.  We are happy you're here today on the 30th  anniversary of Black Monday.</p><p> But look at where we are with this market -- 23000.  What does that mean to  you?  </p><p> WREN:  You know, it's hard to believe it's been 30 years and obviously the  market is very resilient.  We've had lots of pullback.  There's not too  many like that.</p><p> But really for me and for our equity strategy group, you know, 23000 -- it  may be a psychological number, but one thing it tells me is that hey,  stocks are maybe a little bit stretched here.</p><p> I mean let's face it, they are not cheap.  So those kinds of milestones  right now -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you want to sell into this.  </p><p> WREN:  Well, you know, we've been in the pullback camp.  I mean it wouldn't  surprise me over next few months we see 6 percent, 7 percent pullback.  You  know, nothing -- nothing big but I think it's about time for that.  I would  argue valuations are stretched as I said.</p><p> You know, we've got the fed hiking rates.  I don't think we are going to  get much out of Washington that's really meaningful over the course of the  next six or nine months, maybe.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You don't think we get a tax deal done this year?  </p><p> WREN:  Well, you know, with mid-terms next year, I think they're going to  pass something but, you know, in an $18 trillion economy you need something  with magnitude to push this thing forward and I don't have a lot of faith  that that's actually going to happen.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And I think the tax -- whatever they do, that'll impact the  Russell 2000 more, right -- the small-cap market because as we look at Dow  23000, these are large multinational corporations that have benefited from  the weaker dollar.</p><p> So IBM yesterday, one of the reasons why they were up so significantly and  their CFO said it themselves, the dollar has been a great tail wind for  them.</p><p> Do you recommend that people should start looking globally elsewhere --  Asia, emerging markets -- to put some capital work given it's lofty over  here in the United States?  </p><p> WREN:  Well, I think that -- when we look at our clients they are  underweight everything international.  So what we've been recommending is  they take a little money off the table on large cap U.S. which is obviously  done very well and put that into some EM or developed international, of  course, those that had big runs this year.</p><p> But I looked a couple of days ago and over the last five years, the S&amp;P is  up 75 percent.  EM -- the NSCI EM index is up 11 percent; 11 or 12 percent.</p><p> So you know, we would argue, I live in a baseball town so, you know, we  were in the last third of the game, you know, eighth inning, maybe one out,  the rest of the world really isn't about the third inning.  So there's some  more baseball to be played here but abroad, the game is a lot earlier.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I want to get your thoughts on the Fed and what President Trump  may make it for his decision.  But also you say that the biggest risk to  the economy right now is the fed decision to do these rate hikes.  So  there's sort of the expectation that one will come in December but the  expectation of three next year not so much.  </p><p> WREN:  I think that the stock market has priced in a December rate hike for  at least six months.  I mean I think that's fine.  The fed, I think, will  take one if the market is going to give it to them which they definitely  will in December.</p><p> I don't think the market believes that three will happen next year.  Our  fixed income team who makes that call is looking for two but there are  certainly competitors of ours on the street that are looking for four.   Three or four in a 2.3 percent growth economy, I think that's a head way.</p><p> KELLY:  And the 10-year treasury is gone at 2.6 percent.  I mean that is  pretty -- that's tightening.  </p><p> WREN:  And to me, you know, and I'm certainly not the bond guy but, you  know, when you raise rate that many times, I mean that 10-year yield is  going to come down.  It's not going to go up.  </p><p> MURPHY:  So Scott -- I mean we've seen a lot of people calling for  pullbacks.  And now this market just slowly grinds higher.  But most of  them come out and say, buy that pullback.  And I believe that's why the  market hasn't seen a pullback because any sort of selloff at all like we  are about to see this morning at the open, people are stepping in to buy  that.  And I think that's -- I don't know how we get the pullback with this  environment.  </p><p> WREN:  You know, that's such a great point because I think, you know,  retail investors are sitting on their hands.  But you have a lot of  institution and asset managers out there.  You know, they have a benchmark  to keep up with or beat if this thing keeps grinding higher.  You know,  they need to be in it.</p><p> And so they're in their buys -- so I would say there's a little bit of  institutional chasing going on and that that mentality and that activity --  that's one of the reasons why we haven't had to pullback.  </p><p> KELLY:  Well, here is the reason why I don't think we've had the pullback.   We've seen sector dispersion especially in returns.  So before the  correlation is between every sector north of 70 percent.  Now you're seeing  some sectors even around 35 percent.  So when tech fell, financials stepped  up.  Then health care.</p><p> So do you think that's another reason -- are there sectors investors should  look at in the market?  </p><p> WREN:  You know, there really are because you know, we are way passed the  rising tide lifts all boats.  And so there is dispersion.</p><p> You look at technology versus energy, for instance on a year to date basis  -- there's massive difference.  So we -- we do not think the cycle is over.   We think that -- we want our clients continuing to lean cyclically so we  like industrials, we like financials, we like the consumer discretionary  sector.  we also like health care -- still think that's undervalued.</p><p> So what's what we want them leaning toward.  What we don't want them doing  is getting defensive.  So we are underweight staples.  We are underweight  utilities.  We're also underweight energy which I think is this may  continue to work out.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The earnings period has actually been better than expected all  year, right.  </p><p> WREN:  Certainly the first half was.  I think, you know -- we are going to  see 5 or 6 percent maybe this third quarter -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, this quarter.</p><p> WREN:  -- and so, you know, that's obviously toned down from the first  part.  You know, we tell our clients, third quarter earnings, that's what's  happened in the past, you know.  We want them to look forward and this  modest growth, modest inflation environment, I don't think you're going to  see much of a change there.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you do with a stock like GE?  You're an industrial guy?  </p><p> WREN:  Well, you know -- right, right.  You know, they are industrials.  I  think they are going to continue.  You know, I think those companies will  benefit from a continuation of this global growth.  And that's been our  theme -- a little bit better growth here, a little bit better growth  internationally.  And I would say if there's a surprise growth-wise it's  probably not in the U.S. it's internationally.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  GE reports earnings tomorrow -- that's why I  mention it.</p><p> But Scott -- really good to see you.</p><p> WREN:  Great to see you guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p> WREN:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Scott Wren -- Wells Fargo.</p><p> Coming up, speculation over that next move in the Federal Reserve chair --  that's heating up.  Candidates that President Trump is considering as he  prepares for a meeting with Janet Yellen; that meeting taking place today.   We'll see if we know who the next chairman will be later today.</p><p> And then has political correctness gone too far, the outrage after a school  canceled its Halloween parade.  We will tell you about it straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us this morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday,  October 19th.  Your tapestries right now 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Another market milestone yesterday.  The Dow Jones industrial average  closing above 23,000 for the first time ever.  Hitting the 51st record high  since President Trump took office.</p><p> Earnings from IBM drove some of the games yesterday and the optimism over  the tax reform plan.  Today, the senate could bring tax cuts one step  closer to reality, as they are voting on the budget.  President Trump  tweeted about it this morning saying quote, \"Republicans are going for the  big budget approval today.  First step to a massive tax cuts.  I think we  have the votes.  But who knows?</p><p> Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions in Spain weighing on markets this morning.   Futures indicating a pullback from yesterday's all-time highs.  Dow  Industrials off of the lows, but nonetheless showing a decline of about 90  points.  Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 also in negative territory.</p><p> In Europe this morning, the markets are looking like this.  Similar story  and the FT 100 is down a half of a percent.  As is the CAC quarante in  Paris.  The Dax Index in Germany down three quarters of one percent.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Japan,  as you see there.</p><p> The future of the Fed is in focus.  President Trump will meet with Janet  Yellen later today as questions swirl about the next Fed chair.  We're  taking a look at the possibility of a second term for Janet Yellen this  morning.</p><p> Not built Ford tough enough.  The automaker recalling over a million pickup  trucks Ford issued that could cause the door to swing open while driving.   The models that need to go into the shop, coming up.</p><p> And a disturbing new trend encouraging kids to go missing?  What parents  need to know about the shocking new Facebook game which dares kids to  disappear for days.  Really?</p><p> And then Be Your Own Brand ambassador.  We'll talk to a new company helping  people take their social media game to a whole new level and get paid doing  it.  All that coming up this morning.</p><p> But first this top story this half an hour.  The search for the next  Federal Reserve chair.  President Trump is meeting with Janet Yellen later  today as he nears a final decision on filling the top spot at the central  bank.</p><p> The two will discuss the possibility of nominating her for a second term.   But he may actually decide to move on from Janet Yellen.</p><p> Let's bring in research and bank analyst at Vertical Group, Dick Bove.   Dick, good to see you.  Thanks so much for weighing in here.</p><p> DICK BOVE, RESEARCH AND BANK ANALYST, VERTICAL GROUP:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are you looking for from the president on this Fed move?</p><p> BOVE:  Well, I'm hoping very much that he does not reappoint Janet Yellen,  because I see two major problems in the Federal Reserve.</p><p> Over the last few years, which she failed to correct.  The first one is  that she did not blend monetary and regulatory policy.  Now, what does that  mean?  It means as the Fed on the monetary side was producing new money,  the Fed on the regulatory side was forcing that money out of the private  sector and into the Federal Reserve.  In other words, over $2.5 trillion  was taken out of the banking system and put into the Federal Reserve,  because of regulations.</p><p> Now, I went to Washington twice on this issue.  And I said to the  regulatory guys, don't you realize what you're doing to monetary policy  when you do this?  And they said, \"That's not our job to worry about.  All  we're going to care about is safety and soundness.\"</p><p> The second issue though is even more important.  If you took a look at the  Federal Reserve balance sheet, uh, 10 years ago, what you would see is that  currency, what they print, you have in your hands.</p><p> Funds 90 percent or more of the Fed balance sheet.  That's no longer true.   Now, the Fed balance sheet is being funded by bank deposits.  Second, if  you look at the asset side of the Fed balance sheet, you would have seen 10  years ago that about 90 percent of the money was used to buy treasuries.   That's not true anymore either.</p><p> In addition -- in addition, the duration of the assets on the Fed have got  over 56 percent of the assets are 10 years longer.  So, what does long  discussion mean?  It means that 10 years ago, you were using long-term  money, currency, to fund short-term investments.  Today, you're using very  short-term money to fund very long-term investments.  Feds balance sheet is  out.</p><p> KELLY:  So, Dick, it's Kevin Kelly.  So that leaves -- that begs the  question, if you don't believe in Janet Yellen is the next Fed chairperson,  who is the top candidate to take care of the Fed balance sheet, as you're  talking about?  I don't think Kevin Warsh is going to get it, because he's  too much of a hawk.  You have Jerome Powell.  They're talking about him  because he's more dovish.</p><p> Who do you think would be the best for this economy and this market?  </p><p> BOVE:  Well, I mean, unfortunately the guy I like the best and he's already  on the Fed now and he's going to be the fellow who was going to handle bank  supervision.  Because at least he's going to be looking at the structure of  the Fed and he's going to be - if you will hopefully alleviating this  massive short-term long-term situation in terms of the balance sheet.  I  have no idea why the people like John Taylor who had a wonderful  theoreticians have looked at the Fed balance sheet.</p><p> I have no idea whether the guys Warsh have looked at, what the regulatory  side of the Fed has done to monetary policy.  I mean, basically, no one  speaks about these issues.  But they're important.  The Fed balance sheet  is a mess.</p><p> If you are a bank analyst analyzing a bank, go to the Federal Reserve, you  would say this thing is in real trouble.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Speaking of the balance sheet, you're talking about this long  term securities and you suggested that those were mostly mortgages.</p><p> You say that if the banks are willing to replace the Fed and the treasury  and mortgage markets but there'd be little to no impact.  But you indicated  that as unlikely.  And my question is really, why should they step in to  mortgage liquidity?  I mean, it seems like a very risky business when you  look at the past decade.</p><p> BOVE:  Which - I'm sorry.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  You're talking about long-term securities and the Fed balance  sheet and unloading.  One of the things that you had suggested is that if  the banks would replace the Fed and treasury mortgage markets, then there  wouldn't be such an impact.  But I guess my question is, would that even be  a good decision from the banks?</p><p> BOVE:  I didn't make that statement.  What I said was that the Fed should  not be funding long-term assets with short-term money.  And any answer in  the financial industry that does that, generally runs into a significant  amount of difficulty when interest rates go up.  And interest rates are  going up.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dick, there's an op-ed in the Journal today.  The Fed chief  America needs.  And it's co-authored by former treasury secretary George  Shultz.  He's suggesting for the president to pick somebody who understands  the economy can grow more than two percent a year.  But he's warning that  the next Fed chair must not make the mistake of more rapid economic growth  for an overheated inflation from economy that needs cooling off.</p><p> He says the Fed that make such a mistake would perpetrate the slow growth,  low productivity stagnant wage economy of the past decade.  So this op-ed  today is basically saying, look, some of these guys don't believe that the  economy can grow more than two percent.</p><p> Do you think it can?</p><p> BOVE:  Oh, absolutely.  I don't think there's any doubt about it,  whatsoever.  I think that if you -- and I'm going to go back to the Fed for  a second.  If you take a look at taking $2.5 trillion, $2.5 trillion out of  the private sector and putting into the Fed, you can see that the type of  stimulus that we were told, we were receiving was not being received.</p><p> On the other hand, however, this whole argument that is made about secular  stagnation in the U.S. economy is, in my view, garbage.  I think that  basically if you get enough buying power in the hands of the American, so  to speak, worker, household, et cetera, you will find that the U.S. economy  can grow much more rapidly than two percent per year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, Mike Murphy is here.  And, Mike, remember, in 1984, the  GDP was 7.3 percent.  I'm just saying, after the tax package.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  And now we're down here and  trying to get above three percent.</p><p> But, Dick, we've liked the banks all year.  And now you see they're all  sitting right up in the air recent highs.  I'm wondering, which banks do  you think people can look at and buy?  And also part two of that question,  do the banks need trading revenue to pick up in order to get another like  higher?</p><p> BOVE:  Well, if you're one of the biggest banks in the United States, you  definitely would benefit by seeing trading pickup.  But it's not going to,  because of the change in the structure of the markets.  In other words,  there's too much money going into passive funds versus actively managed  funds which has big impact on trading.</p><p> But I think in the beginning question.  I love Bank of America.  I think  that the company is well behind the curve as a result to the huge problems  that it's had over the past, well, say decade.  And I think that Brian  Moynihan is doing a phenomenally good job in turning it around.</p><p> But I think if you take a look at some of the regional banks, companies  like PNC Financial has shown just the staggeringly a positive result in the  quarter.  It outperformed all of the bigger banks by a mile, so to speak.   And it did so by taking business from the bigger banks.</p><p> So I think that some of the regional banks could be very interesting here.   But as I say two, recommendations would clearly be Bank of America and PNC  Financial.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  And all the banks reported better than expected  earnings in the third quarter, despite of the week trading.  The asset  management business has sort of offset the weakness, I guess, Dick.</p><p> BOVE:  Well, again, we could have a long discussion on that one.  I think  the asset management business is in a lot of trouble right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p> BOVE:  Basically, you've got hundreds of billions of dollars moving out of,  if you will, actively managed funds and you've got literally trillions of  dollars moving into passively managed funds and into ETF's.</p><p> On another financial network, you have a very strong spokesperson who get  up and said, stop putting your money into actively managed funds.  It's  costing you too much money.  Put them in passive managed by individual  stocks.  And people are doing that.  And that's having a very bad impact.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dick, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  We'll be watching the  development.  Dick Bove from Vertical there.</p><p> Coming up, safety issues caused Ford Motor to recall more than one million  trucks at a cost of $267 million.  How do you know if your vehicle is  actually on that list?  Next.</p><p> And then a concerning new game on Facebook encouraging kids to disappear.   What parents need to know about this disturbing trend, back in a moment.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New questions in the Russia uranium deal.   Earlier this week, The Hill reported that the Obama administration approved  the controversial deal in 2010, giving Moscow a substantial amount of  uranium, 20 percent.</p><p> The FBI found evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged  in bribery, kickbacks and extortion.  The Hill also says that according to  one eyewitness, Russian officials routed millions of dollars to the U.S.  designed to benefit former president Bill Clinton's foundation, the Clinton  Foundation, during the time that Hillary Clinton served as secretary state.   That report has now been questioned.  President Trump apparently referring  to The Hill report tweeted this this morning.  \"Uranium deal to Russia with  Clinton help and Obama administration knowledge is the biggest story that  the fake media does not want to follow.\"  The president just tweeting that  out a few minutes ago.</p><p> Meanwhile, there's this.  Not built Ford tough enough, huh?  Cheryl Casone  with details and the major recall coming out of Ford Motor this morning.   Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  It's a big one, Maria.  Ford  announcing a recall of its best-selling truck.  The automakers has a  problem with the latch on the side doors on more than one million of its F  series trucks could prevent the doors from opening or closing.  And recall  will cost Ford an estimated $267 million.</p><p> Shares of Ford are lower in the premarket.  Down more than half a percent.</p><p> Meanwhile, Toyota is recalling more than 300,000 Sienna Minivans, because  they can shift out of park and roll away.  Shares of Toyota are up more  than five percent, so far this year.  Two automakers to watch today.</p><p> Well, kids, as young as 14 are going missing for days at the time as part  of a new Facebook game called the 48-hour challenge.  The Sun over written  reports.  The shocking challenge invites kids to hide from their parents  for as long as possible.</p><p> Kids are given points that their frantic parents take the Facebook or  Twitter to sound the alarm for them.</p><p> One mother in the Northern Ireland says their child disappeared and was  found some 55 hours later in a totally different country.</p><p> Well, an elementary school in Massachusetts has decided to cancel the  Halloween costume parade this year.  The school's principal's says in a  letter in part, \"The costume parade is out of our ordinary routine and can  be difficult for many students.  Also, the parade is not inclusive of all  of the students.\"</p><p> Some parents call this move just overly done political correctness.  The  school says Halloween is going to be a black and orange spirit day.</p><p> OK.  And then finally this.  Snap is now in the costumer business.  Just in  time for Halloween.  A little better Halloween story here.  They're  releasing a dancing hotdog costume that will allow you to dress up as  Snapchat's biggest virtual star.  Chief executive Evan Spiegel cost the  hotdog, \"Likely the world's first augmented reality superstar.\"  Saying he  is -- this has been viewed 1.5 billion times.  It's for sale for Amazon for  $79, iF anyone is interested.</p><p> Snap's shares are under pressure in the premarket, by the way.  Not exactly  the big performer since the IPO is down almost one percent, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl, thank you.</p><p> No Halloween parade.</p><p> KELLY:  No Halloween parade.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You were saying merry Christmas?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I reject black and orange day.  I'm sorry.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I reject it too.</p><p> KELLY:  You can't please -- all of the time.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  What is black and orange spirit, anyway?  What does that mean?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I have no idea.</p><p> MURPHY:  Once the kids dress up.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your kids love Halloween.</p><p> MURPHY:  They love Halloween.  But they better not think about hiding for  two days.  That go overwhelming.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  The parents should probably would want that, but most not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up next, the big business of social media.   We are checking out the startup.  Helping people become the creative  directors of their own brand online.  That's next.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So stuck on choosing a filter for your latest  Instagram post?  Not to worry.  New startup SelfMade is here to help.  With  social average of 50 million people.</p><p> A team of professional editors, dedicated, creative agent and only a month  to month commitment.  SelfMade will make you #influence, sir, before you  have time to click post.</p><p> Joining us right now is Self-Made founder and CEO, Brian Schechter.  Brian,  it's good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much.</p><p> BRIAN SCHECHTER:  It's great to be here, Maria.  Thank you,</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And of course mike murphy, you are a big supporter and -- </p><p> MURPHY: Big supporter of Brian's SelfMade, fan supporter, investor on Brian  and the team.  I think what they're doing is kind of change the whole  outlook for people who want to build the presence on social media.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And one of the things that your company indicates is that  people need to have their own personal brand.  And they want to make it  better.  Tell us how SelfMade works.</p><p> SCHECHTER:  That's exactly right and it's really a part of the new economy  where more and more people need to define themselves whether they are  freelance or an entrepreneur.  They have to set themselves apart in order  to keep up.</p><p> So the way the app works is people take a survey where we learn about their  personal preferences in terms of the images that they want to be sharing  and their goals on social media.</p><p> From there, they get access to a member's only app where they can upload  images.  Those images get routed to professional image specialist.  They do  an edit of the picture.  They come back through the app and then we help  them prepare to share it by sending them through a planner.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So we're looking at one picture right now.  This is the picture  of the woman on the beach yet all the people behind her.  And then it was  edited.</p><p> SCHECHTER:  Right.  So that is in line with her personal brand style.  So  she uploaded the original image, gave some instructions and then a team of  editors were able to reformat the image to make it look like it will be  cohesive on her grid on Instagram.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very cool.  Mike, what attracted you about this company?</p><p> MURPHY:  So it's really Brian and his co-founder Zach are -- they are  successful entrepreneurs from the past, so they built businesses.  Brian  built and sold the business.  Zach worked at on Google Docs.  Ran Goggle  Docs for a long time.</p><p> So they have a great background, great pedigree.  And I think they're  really tapping into something that's needed right now, because people --  it's no longer whether or not you want to build a presence.  If you're an  entrepreneur, you need a presence on something like Instagram, 800 million  users out there on Instagram.</p><p> So to find the way to do it correctly.  A lot of people know, they spend  all this time and money on their business and then they throw a picture up,  a selfie up on Instagram, which isn't really doing it justice and that's  where these guys connect.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you mentioned the users on Instagram.  Marketing and  advertising on Instagram is the highly profitable now and can an average  person actually make money on Instagram?</p><p> SCHECHTER:  Yes.  So it's making money on Instagram but it's also boosting  their career.  So we have fitness professionals who want to maintain the  client base or connect with new clients.</p><p> We have florists.  People who run small businesses that want to send  traffic to their personal website.  And just people who recognize that more  and more in today's economy when someone looks them up, they're looking  them up on social and if it's on point and professional, they're more  likely to get a new opportunity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you've been able to raise $11 million in funding so far.  Is  that just for operation?  Tell us where the money goes and whether or not  you're looking for another round.</p><p> SCHECHTER:  Yes.  So we close our series this spring.  First mark the New  York Venture Capital from led around.  And basically what's going on is  we're seeing this profound demand that people have to be able to get  support like Michael is describing, to build their personal brand.</p><p> So we're really onto something where our member base now while we've been  in private data has over 50 million followers on Instagram combined.   They're paying between 50 and $150 a month and this is all been while we've  still been in private data.  We're gearing up to launch publicly later this  year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think the customer then, the customer base is an  entrepreneur or as an individual?  Who's the customer?</p><p> SCHECHTER:  It's entrepreneurs.  It's people who have a side gig that where  they want to build to make the incremental income.  Again, people in the  fitness profession and beauty profession.  It's consultants, florists, real  estate agents, you name it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know this market incredibly well, Mike.</p><p> MURPHY:  Well, I'd like to think I do.  Yes.  And I think it's a great  opportunity, as our funds looks for investment.  We talk all the time here  on the show about how small businesses are going to change the landscape  and disrupt the economy as we know it, of the bigger, older companies.</p><p> And I think the company like SelfMade.  Brian and his team can really help  fuel that and that's where I see the opportunity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff.  Good luck.  We'll be watching.  Thanks for  joining us, Brian.</p><p> SCHECHTER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Brian Schechter, Mike Murphy.</p><p> We will take a break.  When we come back, Apple moves from iPhone to self- driving cars.  A sneak peek look at the technology giant's secret project.   That's right here next hour, \"Mornings with Maria.\"  Stay with us.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.

Earnings from IBM and  others drove the gains yesterday and optimism over the tax cuts says  underpinned this market for certainly since the beginning of the year.

We're confident that we're going to get tax cuts done and  so that's what we're focused on and we're going to continue pushing forward  until we get there.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Geopolitical tensions meanwhile weighing on markets this  morning.

Spain is moving to suspend Catalonia  independence.  Futures right now pulling back from the all-time highs  yesterday.  Dow Industrials set to open down about 100 points today.   NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 also weaker and remember, today is 30 years from Black  Monday, October 19th when market dropped 23 percent on the S&amp;P 500 in a  day.  In Europe this morning, the major indices look like this and again  weakness here, the FT-100 down a half percent, the CAC quarante is down  two-thirds of a percent.  In Asia overnight, markets close mostly low with  the exception of Japan which was up almost half a percent.  Meanwhile, a  brand-new terrorism threat to report.  The Department of Homeland Security  is warning that ISIS is plotting another 9/11-style attack.  Details on the  terrifying plan aiming to inflict mass casualties. </p><p> It is deadline day.  Cities across the country have until midnight tonight  to submit their bids for Amazon second headquarters.  We'll show what  Chicago is doing to try to get Amazon there coming up.  Apple has not even  announced its self-driving car but now there are pictures.  We've got the  details of what Apple is doing in that area.  And NFL Commissioner Roger  Goodell still in the news, refusing to take a tougher stance on anthem  protests, nobody is happy with Goodell's comment, even Colin Kaepernick, he  fired back and he didn't even say anything.  He fired back without opening  his mouth.  All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk  all about it, Fox News Correspondent Lea Gabrielle is here, Kelly and  Company managing partner Kevin Kelly, and Rosecliff Capital CEO, Mike  Murphy.  Great to see you. </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Good morning.  </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  And what recently just happened  actually Verizon posted their earnings before the market, it's interesting  they actually are up off of it, they added some net subscribers.  Last week  we saw AT&amp;T reported, they were down five percent the most since 2009.  So  this is actually showing that's a tale of two different companies that's  happening  I mean, you have so much promotion in the market, free HBO, or  free Netflix, you know, between the different carriers.  So it's going to  be interesting to see what they say on their earnings call and what  guidance they can get going forward because acquired -- remember, Yahoo!</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  They acquired Yahoo! but Verizon shares were down  earlier.</p><p> KELLY:  We'll see what the earnings do to the stock today but certainly  earnings is the story driving this market, and yesterday throw it to a new  market milestone.  The Dow Jones Industrials average closed above the  23,000 mark for the first time ever yesterday.  Though Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin is warning that all of those gains could be in jeopardy.   Should Congress fail to pass tax reform?  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF TREASURY:  There is no question  that the rally in the stock market has base into it, reasonably high  expectations of us getting tax cuts and tax reform done.  And also, has  base into it, optimism on regulator relief which they have begun to see and  there's expectations.  So I think to the extent we get the tax deal done  the stock market will go up higher but there's no question in my mind if we  don't get it done you're going to see a reversal of significant amount of  these gains. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The Senate is expected to vote today on that budget that would  allow the chamber to pass a tax bill with just 51 votes.  That's called  reconciliation, instead of the 60 needed for major legislation.  The  president just tweeted about it this morning and here is what he said,  Republicans are going for the big budget approval today.  First step toward  massive tax cuts, I think we have the votes, but who knows?  Uh-oh.   Joining us right now is former Reagan budget director David Stockman.  And  David, you've been here before during the Reagan years.  You were able to  pass an incredible tax reform in that same interview that Treasury  Secretary Mnuchin said that the gains will be in jeopardy.  He said there's  an absolute guarantee that a tax overhaul will be signed into law by end of  this year, reasonable timetable?  </p><p> DAVID STOCKMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET:  No.  He  said that about eight times now, first it was May then it was August, then  it was October.  Really, I think the guy is clueless.  I think the notion  that we're going to have a big, big tax cut is a pipe dream.  They can't  pay for it and we're in a different environment today than they were 1981.   1981, the debt was only 940 billion, it was 30 percent of GDP, there was  plenty of room to have a giant tax cut that was paid for by borrowing.  Today, they have to find pay-fors, loopholes, base-broadeners, they can't  find any, even the state and local tax savings which allegedly was 1.3  trillion over 10 years is falling by the wayside day by day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You don't believe --</p><p> STOCKMAN:  So I think they're going to end up with no tax bill or one that  is so modest or so minor that it will have very little impact on the  economy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you don't -- you don't believe Treasury Secretary Mnuchin  when he says that growth will happen as a result of lower taxes and that  will partly pay for this?  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No, I don't believe that for a minute, because they're not  cutting taxes on marginal rates that are high already.  We have a 70  percent marginal rate in 1981.  The top rate today is 39.6 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  And just said we're going to keep the fourth bracket, we're not  cutting it at all.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mike?  Mike Murphy.</p><p> MURPHY:  To clarify, do you believe we need a tax cut and they just can't  find the place to get -- come from?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good -- that's good question.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  I absolutely believe we need a payroll tax cut that will take  the burden off 160 million payroll tax taxpayers particularly in the middle  and lower end that are getting hit for 15-1/2 percent employer, employee.   That's the job killer.  That's the --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about corporate rate?  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  The corporate rate is --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the pass-through?  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  It will be a great -- the corporate rate and pass-through would  be a great boon, a windfall for Wall Street.  It is not going to lead to  any more jobs or any more growth in the United States because jobs have  gone overseas for lower labor costs.  Let me give one example.  IBM had  zero employees in India in 1993, it's got 130,000 in India today, more than  the U.S. not because of a, you know, 35 percent statutory rate but because  they can hire people to work on, you know -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the bulk of this reform package just supposed to go  towards small business.  I mean, you're not saying that small business, the  guy who owns the hardware store on Main Street has employees overseas.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No.  I'm saying the corporate rate cut is $2 trillion going from  35 to 20.  The big companies that put the jobs overseas aren't going to  bring them back.  Everybody who gets more after tax cut will --</p><p> KELLY:  But David --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about smaller companies,  </p><p> KELLY:  But they're already not paying that tax -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're not paying that, absolutely right.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY:  So when you're saying it's a windfall the net effect of tax rate is  27 percent for the S&amp;P 500, they're already, you know, shifting operations  to -- </p><p> STOCKMAN:  I agree.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't think G.E. paid any taxes.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No, no, no, no, no. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> STOCKMAN:  I agree with that.  IBM's effective tax rate is 11 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  that's exactly right.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  But when we lower taxes on Wal-Mart, they're not going to make  any more stores or hire any more people.  </p><p> KELLY:  No.  They're going to reinvest in their online business and bulk  that up because they got to compete against -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> STOCKMAN:  They're going to pay a higher -- they're going to pay a higher  dividend, they're going to buy back more stock.  This is just a bonanza for  Wall Street because the paid corporate tax is paid for by investors, it  does not get laid onto labor or anything else.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I want to ask about this thought the Reagan administration was  very good in public messaging and everything that it did.  You know,  Secretary Mnuchin said this warning to Congress that you could essentially  blow up the stock market if you fail to pass taxes.  Is that political  posturing, is that a public messaging campaign?  What's your perspective on  --</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Well, he's right.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  -- bigger impact.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  He is right but this is -- this whole stock market run-up has  been a pipe dream about stimulus and a big tax cut that could never happen  --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But it's not just a pipe dream.  Come on, David.  We're talking  $5.3 trillion in market value, you're calling that a pipe dream?  You think  that's just a coincidence?  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Yes.  Because I was talking to an audience 30 years ago today  and while he was talking the stock market went down the equivalent of 5,000  Dow points.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a totally different moment in time.  One of the reasons  the stock market is up is because of earnings performance.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No, it isn't.  No, it isn't.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Earnings were up 14 percent in the first quarter and 11 percent  in the second quarter. </p><p> STOCKMAN:  That is -- I would have to say, I really challenge that because  that is only basically the pig coming through the python.  Earnings today  are no higher than they were in the middle of 2014.  Three years earnings  went down because of the deflation of oil and material deflation, things  come back up, they're back where they were three years ago, the stock  market is up 45 percent over the same period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Wow.</p><p> MURPHY:  But -- hold on, when you say that you use those statistics, you're  talking broadly, there are specific companies that actually have real  growth that have shown huge growth since 2014.  So to say it's a pipe dream  and pigs and python like the market is priced, where it is priced.  Whether  it goes upward --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No.  The market is -- the market is totally irrational.  The  market is --</p><p> MURPHY:  But it's not more irrational today than it was 30 years ago or 20  years ago or 10 years ago, right?</p><p> KELLY:  We had the 50-50, remember?  They trade high multiples back then.   You had coke trading at 50 times earnings.  I mean, this is -- this is only  the same story.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you think this is all a house of cards. </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Well, I do, because in the nine months before the crash, 30  years ago, interest rates went up from seven percent to 10 percent in nine  months.  It caused a tremendous shock in the market that took a little  while to develop.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But interest rates are not going up 10 percent anytime soon. </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No, no, no, no, no.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Anytime soon.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  It doesn't -- relatively speaking, that's a 30 percent gain.   OK?  Interest rates are going up today and they will be for the next year  or two years, four years because the Fed has told you, we are shrinking our  balance sheet, we're draining cash, they're doing it right now, starting  this month, by the year from now they're going to be draining 600 billion  at an annual rate and that is going to cause yields around the world to  rise.  The whole market is priced on low yields, it's priced on stock  buybacks, it's priced on junk bonds out of control and all of that is going  to show -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That can mess this up.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KELLY:  They could shock it but they telegraphed it well, so we've seen --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  Even Janet Yellen said, we're not going to normalized rates.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Also said they'll be data independent.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> KELLY:  But the market has -- </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No.  They have to raise rates, they have to drain the liquidity,  they have to shrink their balance sheet because they're trying to get ready  for next crisis and get their --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what do you -- what do you attribute the 3.1 percent GDP? </p><p> STOCKMAN:  What do I -- I don't think there is any 3.1 percent --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We got a 3.1 percent GDP two weeks ago.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No.  I mean, for one quarter --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we got at the quarter -- we got it the -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> STOCKMAN:  No.  No.  The average GDP growth for the last couple years has  been plus or minus two percent.</p><p>  BARTIROMO:  But we -- OK.  But we got a 3.1 percent GDP, I'm just saying.   I mean, do you not think things are getting better?  Do you not think there  is fundamental strength in the backdrop --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> STOCKMAN:  I think we're a hundred months into this expansion.  The third  longest in history, there are headwinds all around the world mainly the  central banks are going to go in Q.T., quantitative tightening in a  sequence over the next year three or four years fundamentally different  than the last three years. </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  But they're doing that in expanding economies, you're looking  at the global GDP going up.  So yes, they can tighten it.  If they don't  they tightened, they're not doing their job because the economies are  getting more health, they have to tighten into that so there's not  irrational exuberance (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Well --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your biggest problem with the tax plan?  What's your  biggest --</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Where I disagree with you is I don't believe the law of supply  and demand has been repealed.  And when the central banks are draining  cash, that means the demand today for the whole -- all of the -- there's 20  trillion of bonds and other securities in the portfolio of central banks.   If they drop that by a few trillion dollars, it will fundamentally on the  margin affect the yield.  And then the frontrunners, the smart guys on Wall  Street will say the central banks are selling, they're not buying.  I'm  going to start selling what they're selling.  We're going to get the same  phenomena on the down that we had  on the --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what's your biggest problem with this tax plan?</p><p> STOCKMAN:  My biggest problem is it targets the wrong tax.  Today the  income taxes are rich man's levy of the 1.5 trillion income tax collected  in the most recent year, four percent, six million out of 150 million  taxpayers paid 60 percent.  So if you're going to cut income taxes, you're  cutting taxes for the rich.  I don't necessarily object to that but it  isn't possible politically, and so, therefore, they got their own tax. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But 50 percent of the people don't pay any tax. </p><p> STOCKMAN:  That's right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right?  And then you got the standard deduction that gone to 12  percent.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> STOCKMAN:  If you take someone at the median income 59,000 a year, with  standard deduction, they are raising taxes in that outline by 38 percent on  that household.  So the point is, nobody on the income tax side is going to  benefit big except the top and we don't need it.  What we do need is a  payroll tax cut for the minimum wage person who's out there having a --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you say we don't need it, we've had a 1-1/2 percent growth  story for the last eight years.  I mean, under two percent, what do you  mean we don't need it?</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Because --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The rich pay -- the 10 percent of the top earners pay 80  percent of the tax.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  Yes.  And they don't need it because they've had the biggest  specter of the bonanza in the history of mankind and the history of  mankind.  We have had a boom, we have a bubble in the stock market like  never before, the rich people have gotten all that.  If they need incentive  to invest they got incentive coming out that, you know -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But he's saying this is a middle-class tax.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  It isn't.  It's a lie.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Twelve percent, 25 percent, 35 percent.  </p><p> STOCKMAN:  Yes.  That's a lie.  It depends on where they put the brackets.   They didn't even say.  These people are total fakes.  I've never seen  anything that was as content-free as substance-less as this nine pager that  came out.  Remember what happened in the Reagan time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> STOCKMAN:  We put out our plan in February, our tax bill in March, the  budget passed in April and May, they were writing the tax bill in June,  Reagan signed it August 13, on September 13th -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, David.  September 13th.  David Stockton joining us.   We will be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A top U.S. security chief is warning terror  groups are planning a major tactic on the scale of 9/11.  Cheryl Casone  with the details now.  Cheryl?  Wow.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Really, this is something  else, Maria.  Acting homeland security secretary Elaine Duke said it is  clear that ISIS and other terror groups are planning to take down planes as  they in to carry out another massive attack. Then she also said that terror  groups have been using knife and van attacks to keep their members engaged.</p><p> Well, a video shows what appears to be on of Apple's self-driving cars as  they reportedly are testing out the technology, they never confirmed it but  this Lexus SUV has a roof full of sensors, radar units, and cameras.  Apple  has been pretty secretive about the self-driving car project but the  company did get a permit from the California DMV to test self-driving cars.   That was earlier this year.  Shares of Apple up about 38 percent so far  this year.</p><p> Well, OK.  Let's see some baseball.  The Dodgers are only one win away from  the World Series but the Chicago Cubs are not ready to surrender.  They did  what they had to do last night in a do-or-die game four.  Javier Baez hit  two homeruns leading the Cubs to a 3-2 victory.  So there will be a game  five tonight at Wrigley Field, L.A. leads the series three games to one.   And then, of course, let's get to the American League.  New York Yankees'  rookie Aaron Judge a hero again last night, his third inning double giving  the Yanks a 2-0 lead, then at the seventh inning, fellow baby bummer Gary  Sanchez smashed a solo homer.  Yankees beat the Astros five to nothing,  nada.  Series going back to Houston.  The Astros won the first two games,  Yanks are one win away from their 41st American League (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> Well, tensions were high during Attorney General Jeff Sessions at Senate  testimony yesterday but a much needed lighter moment has gone viral.  Here  is Senator Ben Sasse and what he sad to say after Sessions traded words  with Senator Al Franken over his allegations about Russia.  Just watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. BEN SASSE (R), NEBRASKA:  There was some drama there, a sort of added  to the drama and distracted you for a minute.  I was paying enough  attention there that I dumped to Dr. Pepper on Senator Cruz.  So that's  what was distracting us on this side of the dice</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> CASONE:  He did.  OK.  So Senator Cruz sent out a tweet to his office,  please place a picture of @BenSasse above the @drpepper fridge in our  lobby.  He is now cut off.  Remember, Dr. Pepper, a Texas brand.  Sasse  later replied to one Twitter user, what appears to be a reference to -- of  old conspiracy theory about Cruz's father that at the time Donald Trump  revived during the Republican primary.  I was wearing my Lee Harvey Oswald  -- was framed t-shirt.  Sasse was asked on Twitter if this spill was an  accident, he reapplied, no comment.  But it really did happen.  He -- they  keep saying, dump the Dr. Pepper (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> KELLY:  Well -- and Ted Cruz --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I light moment.</p><p> KELLY:  Ted Cruz actually then posted a photo of the zodiac killer-like  logo.  So we played into this whole thing, it was crazy. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.  Not standing up for  the national anthem.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell under fire this  morning again from both sides for not taking a stronger stance on the  league's ongoing protest.  We'll talk to former NFL stars right here next.   Get their take on the controversy.  Plus, markets looking at the sell-off  at the opening of trading after hitting fresh new highs yesterday.  NASDAQ  president Nelson Griggs will weigh in on whether technology stocks and the  optimism could drive more record territory.  Back in a minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  City leaders across North America are going to  great lengths to attract Amazon's new headquarters, submitting their  pitches ahead of tonight's deadline.  Jeff Flock is in Chicago with the  very latest on all of the extraordinary bids, Jeff.  Over the years.</p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  It's amazing.  I come to you,  Maria, this morning from the renovated lobby, I thought it was once the  world's largest post office building in Chicago, curiously enough built for  the Amazon to this day because of the mail order business of Montgomery  Ward and Sears.  You know, we got a drone flying overhead and it kind of  shows you the enormity of this potential site of the Amazon HQ2, massive  building, 2.7 million square feet and it's just what Amazon need is a real  big building.  Of course, this is not alone in its pitch.  If we put up the  map with little dots of all of the cities and towns that have made pitches  and that are making pitches today, we wouldn't be able to see the map  actually.  That's just a small number of all the people out there.  </p><p> Of course, the prize is huge, we're talking 50,000 potential jobs with  average compensation of $100,000, amazing.  $5 billion in potential  investment from Amazon.  So it is a big prize, places like Chicago, Atlanta  is mentioned as a key one as well, Boston, of course, speculation is  rampant but who knows.  Here in Chicago as we said, this building, Maria,  was built as we said back in the '30s for Amazon, for the Amazons.  The  Sears and Montgomery Ward, so it would be fitting if Amazon was to choose  this.  It has all the things that Amazon wants a metropolitan area, public  transportation, the rest, close to a big population center but, of course,  a lot of places have all of that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's true.  And they all want that 50,000 jobs, that  this headquarters will bring.  Jeff, thank you.  We'll be watching.  Jeff  Flock in Chicago.  Markets this morning are pulling back, we're expecting a  lower opening for the broader averages.  Take a look, we're back at the  lows of the morning down 115 points on the Dow, 45 points lower in the  NASDAQ, of course, this morning, we got a weak showing but this after  yesterday is huge performance, the Dow Jones Industrials average closed  above 23,000 for the first time ever yesterday.  As investors put their  confidence behind technology stocks among others.  IBM was one of the big  drivers.  Joining us right now is the president of the NASDAQ Stock  Exchange, Nelson Griggs.  Nelson, it's good to have you on the program.   Thanks so much for being here.</p><p> NELSON GRIGGS, PRESIDENT, NASDAQ STOCK EXCHANGE:  Great to be here, Maria.   Thanks for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So there must be a lot of momentum there in NASDAQ with the  technology rally, the NASDAQ composite is up 23 percent so far this year.   What do you think is going on? </p><p> GRIGGS:  Well, I think what you have here is the investors clearly want to  purchase growth stocks right now, the companies, the -- sort of larger  NASDAQ technology companies are delivering in terms of revenue, in terms of  user growth and we've also seen a tremendous performance in the NASDAQ  technology, IPOs this year.  So all in all you've got a great backdrop  where investors love the growth rate. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your -- what's your take on this Silicon Valley story  that is propping up, Silicon Valley guys want to have their own exchange,  in Silicon Valley they say that it's going to be a long-term investing and,  you know, the current exchanges are encouraging short-term trading. </p><p> GRIGGS:  Well, I would say there is a lot in the long-term exchange  proposal that we would agree with.  And I think -- my primary job is to  speak with our 2700 companies on NASDAQ, and there certainly is a desire, a  need for communication with investors to be more long-term focus.  It's a  hard thing to accomplish, so you have to look at it from the company side  but also the investor side and there is definitely a middle ground to reach  here. </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Nelson, I think it's pretty interesting you bring that up  because I know NASDAQ has their private market that actually helps, shares  of private companies go back-and-forth but what I'm more interested in is  your leadership when it comes to the blockchain technology and what's  happening.  I mean, if we go overdue the Nordic region, NASDAQ has the only  listed ETN's when it comes to Bitcoin, Etherum, and then we saw you just  recently got a patent when it came to the blockchain technology.  Can you  talk to us about how you think about cryptocurrencies and blockchain? </p><p> GRIGGS:  Sure.  So we have a very large effort internally, a four-block  chain because if you think there's a transformative technology and where we  look at is -- a couple arias, one, when you think about tracking a share as  of who is from investor to investor, that is a -- today a very antiquated  process and there is great opportunity to bring that to not only how stocks  are traded and tracked which we are doing today in a private market but  also how that could focus on how stocks appear in trade.  So I think there  is a lot of opportunity, we're not -- when we get cryptocurrencies, we do  think there's opportunity there as well but we are looking at a very --  little more costly. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Mike Murphy.  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  Hey, Nelson.  Just quickly.  I -- you're standing in front of a  Mongo sign for the IPO.</p><p> GRIGGS:  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  So what's the -- how do you get more of the large unicorn  companies to list to come to the public market.  I'm sure it's a point that  you're focusing on.  How do you do it? </p><p> GRIGGS:  Yes.  Well, first off, we do feel very firmly that a company  should only go public when they're ready to go public.  So the fact that  there's a lot of attention played on, the unicorns taking longer to come to  come to the market, it's necessarily a bad thing because it has to be  prepared when they come.  And that's why we do have the NASDAQ private  market but at the same time we do think that the regulatory aspect of the  overall framework needs to be looked at more closely or last eight years  there's been more and more regulations piled upon companies listed  companies that we do believe could be a moment in time here to have some  progression in terms of how we look at our company. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nelson, great to see you.  Thanks so much, sir. </p><p> GRIGGS:  Thanks for having me. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Nelson Griggs joining us there.  President at the NASDAQ.   Still ahead, taking the sideline, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell facing  heat this morning for not taking a strong enough stance on kneeling during  the national anthem.  Former NFL stars will weigh on the ongoing  controversy right here.  And then earnings in focus on Wall Street.   Verizon shares right now up two percent.  That's a Dow component.  That's  going to be a help on the upside for the Dow after beating expectations on  revenue in the third quarter.  Earnings per share were in line, investors  reacting to revenue growth.  We're breaking down the numbers, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, October 19th.   30 years from Black Monday.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the  East Coast.  The rally rolls on, the Dow Jones Industrials average above  23,000 yesterday for the first time ever. Hitting the 51st record-high  since President Trump took office.  Amazing momentum.  Earnings from IBM  drove the gains yesterday amid optimism over tax reform.  Today the Senate  could bring us one step closer to tax cuts, President Trump tweeted about  it this morning saying this, Republicans are going for the big budget  approval today, first step towards massive tax cuts.  I think we have the  votes, but who knows.  </p><p> Meanwhile, markets are pulling back this morning.  Geopolitical tensions in  Spain are weighing on markets but the Dow Jones Industrial average expected  to pull back from that all-time high yesterday.  Down about 100 points  rights now.  NASDAQ down 41.  In Europe, similar story, markets down across  the board, the European indices are down between two-thirds of a percent  and one percent as we speak.  And in Asia overnight, markets mostly lower  as well with the exception of Japan which was up a  fraction.  </p><p> Earnings certainly the story on Wall Street once again.  Verizon shares in  the spotlight and the stock is up this morning two percent after Verizon  beat revenue expectations with its third-quarter numbers.  We're breaking  down those numbers coming up.  Amazon moving in, the technology titan is  taking up retail space at Kohl stores.  We'll have a first look at that new  partnership.  </p><p> And Navy jet training under growing scrutiny this morning after deadly  accident.  How the Navy is working to fix the problems.  We are on it this  morning.  But first, outrage on the field.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell  refusing to take a tougher stance against national anthem protesters  yesterday saying that the players should stand but they won't be forced to  do so. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER, NFL:  Everyone should stand for the national  anthem.  That's an important part of our policy.  It's also an important  part of our game that we all take great pride in.  And it's also important  for us to honor our flag and to our country and we think our fans expect us  to do that.  The fact is that we have about a half a dozen players that are  protesting.  We hope and we're going to continue to work to try to put that  at zero.  That's what we'd like to do.  But we want to make sure that we're  understanding what the players are talking about and that's complex.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Patriotic fans and the president were not happy with Goodell's  decision after the news conference.  President Trump tweeted at the NFL, he  said this, too much talk not enough action, stand for national anthem.   Let's bring in former NFL safety Burgess Owens along with former NFL  linebacker, Colin Allred and former NFL safety and the Brewer Group  executive chairman, portfolio manager, Jack Brewer.  Good to see you,  everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  This is an  important conversation.</p><p> BURGESS OWENS, FORMER NFL SAFETY:  Than you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me kick it off with you, Colin.  Your reaction to  yesterday's events.</p><p> COLIN ALLRED, FORMER NFL LINEBACKER:  You know, I actually want to give  Roger Goodell some credit because I think that he has resisted pressure  from President Trump and he has brought the players and the owners together  and created a dialogue about how the league can be a positive actor in the  space moving forward.  I think that's the right thing to do, so I actually  want to give him some credit and this is coming from someone who is part of  the 2011 lockout when the owners and Goodell locked us out.  So I actually  want to give him a little bit of credit here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jack, what do you think?  </p><p> JACK BREWER, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, BREWER GROUP:  I totally agree.  I think  this is the situation where you got six players, 99.9 percent of players in  the National Football League stand each and every time that national anthem  comes on.  So we can't make this into something that it's not I think the  conversation really needs to start moving towards the solutions.  The  National Football League and its players have always backed this country,  we represent this country in my opinion very well.  We're heroes in our own  rights.  No, we're not military men and women in service, men and women but  we represent communities all across this country that are struggling.  </p><p> You know, we represent kids, we're the voices for some of the youth that,  you know, have so many elements and problems in America.  So we need to  start talk about this, I said it time and time again let's go sit down with  the president, you know, let's get, you know, let's fill the White House  with, you know, African-American players and let's have these conversations  because this country needs to heal right now and that's the most important  thing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, should this be done on the football field?  I  mean, Burgess, how do you see it?  </p><p> OWENS:  I wrote a book recently called, Liberalism or How to Turn Good Men  into Whiners, Weenies, and Wimps.  And that's what we see with the NFL  right now.  Let me tell you one thing we have -- our responsibility as men,  is make sure young boys understand that they have every single opportunity  in the world and this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.   We have millionaires, we have people across with CEOs, black president and  he would talk about having a conversation, the conversation would be, what  has Democratically Party done for black community?  Why is that we have 83  percent of black teen males unemployed, 75 percent of black boys in  California not reading standards?  </p><p> This conversation is not about our president, it's not about the white NFL,  it's about black men standing up, going to these communities and fighting  back on these ideologies that's killing us literally for decades.  Who has  the guts to do that?  That's what it comes down, who has the courage to  stand against the black elitists, not the white people, the black elitists.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I understand that but -- I mean, the issue, I mean, do you have  to -- do you have to do that to the American flag?  Do you have to do that  on the football field?  I mean, let's face it, Jack, the reason that, you  know, the players, all of you have the right to protester is because of the  American flag and the constitution and the freedom that this country  enjoys. </p><p> BREWER:  And Maria, most people agree with you.  I agree with you.  I will  stand for the flag too.  I think, you know, it goes back to the reality  that 99.9 percent of players are standing up for the flag, only six players  actively stand up against the flag.  Now when the president made those  statements you saw a league lashed out against that, but that had nothing  to do with the flag.  It really took us off topic.  So I totally agree with  Burgess.  Our black leaders are the first to be blamed because we need more  -- first off, we need more youth leaders, we need more younger people  coming to the forefront and actually talking about solutions to these  problems, and you're right, actually, the president ran on most of these  things.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p> BREWER:  We need -- we need jobs, you know, we have double the unemployment  rate as other races in our country, you know, we need health care, we have  issues with our home (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, somewhere along the line, the argument, you know, the  debate changed as far as what we're standing for and what we're sitting  for.  I mean, we're talking about the American flag and the freedoms that  we all enjoy because of our hardworking and courageous men and women who go  and fight for war, Colin.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ALLRED:  One of our freedoms is the right to express ourselves.  And I  think that the players have that right and I think whether or not we all  agree about each individual player's decision.  I do think we as Americans  should agree about their right to freedom of expression.  And their right  to express themselves.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's -- you're right about that.  Yes.</p><p> OWENS:  Let me say this.  They have a right but there's not -- they don't  have a right doing the work time to do so.  If that's the case, the message  basically comes -- that's coming out of this is that -- listen, guys, you  can choose to come to work or not, you decide not to come to work, that's  OK.  We have parameters, at businesses the way business work, they put --  they put stranded parameters around the employees because it's about the  brand and there's no company in this -- in this -- in this country that  allows the employees to dictate basically how their companies are going to  be run.  It's done by leadership and at this point, we need -- black men  need to know when you come to work, you have discipline, you have authority  and you need to either tie the line or know these consequences (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> BREWER:  I agree with that, Burgess, but to a point I think, you know, the  national anthem shouldn't be considered a part of football game, these guys  should be there to play their sport, they should respect the national  anthem and if they don't want to -- if they want to participate, we take  the cameras off of them.  We need to stop showing the world these guys  kneeling when you take the cameras off of that and focus it on the football  field.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point.  </p><p> BREWER:  But I -- but I don't -- but I --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But there's a ton of cameras there, you're not going to be able  to not show it. </p><p> BREWER:  Yes.  I just think we're showing -- we're making into a bigger  issue than it actually is.  We got -- remember, 99.9 percent of players  stand up and we can't -- we can't deny that fact.  We need to go back  again.  Let's sit down with this president and talk about it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Shouldn't they have handled this differently from the get-go?   I mean, when Colin Kaepernick first got on his knee rather than just  letting it go, maybe that's the time to rather than turning it into  something about President Trump.  </p><p> OWENS:  Yes.  What I don't understand is that, during that time there was  an election going on, and we have to be honest, guys, at that time, there  was a need to have a black base energized and so what Colin did pretty much  is focus on the bad things that police were doing and that is -- that's a  whole conversation we need to have.  At the end of the day, it was about  energizing black vote.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ALLRED:  I disagree entirely with that.  I just got to say, Maria, I  disagree with that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.  Tell us why.  Go ahead, Colin. </p><p> ALLRED:  I think that the players who decided -- well, I think the players  who have decided to take a knee take this very seriously and I think they  are -- I know some of the guys who have done this and they are thoughtful  guys who are taking a stand for what they believe in.  And I don't think  that it's about the black vote, I don't think -- some kind of lack of black  leadership, I think that they believe strongly in this and they believe  that they are standing up for what they believe in and they want to  represent their communities and where they come from.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what about the way viewers have reacted \"Monday Night  Football\" ratings have dropped to a new low, the Colts-Titans game drew an  average of roughly eight million viewers, that was down 18 percent -- 18- 1/2 percent from the previous week's game.  I mean, Burgess, do you think  that tonight's game between the Chiefs and the Raiders will reverse the  downward trend or are we are going to see viewers react negatively to the  players doing their politics on the field?  </p><p> OWENS:  Well, I think the last time -- that was a very good point, these  players truly do believe in what they're doing, here is -- here is a  reason, why do they believe this?  It's because we have a black  entertainment -- a network that's pushing this anti-American, anti-flag,  anti-white scenario, and this -- and this been on purpose guys.  15 years  we've been hearing this.  So these kids coming out, they truly do not  believe in our country think everything is going wrong.  There are people  right now, listen to BET, they still do not know that hands up don't shoot,  it was a lie.  Still, don't know that because they have not been told the  truth.  </p><p> So, there is a focused energy by this -- by the left, to get our -- to get  our race upset, doing the things we're doing right now and not believing in  our country and that's why the flag has to be one place we come together  and say, listen, guys, we can disagree, we can figure out how to make this  happen but the flags won't play as we stand together to recognize our  country, the greatest place in history of mankind.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I agree with that.  I agree with that.</p><p> BREWER:  Yes. Amen to that. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BREWER:  I mean, we all know we have issues.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You have to agree with that, Colin.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BREWER:  We have to get over them.  We have to get over them.</p><p> ALLRED:  I agree with the sentiment that we are the greatest country.  I  would disagree that it has anything to do with BET or the business,  anything to do with some kind of feeling on the left.  I think that the  black players feel like they need -- they have been ignored by both  Democrats and Republicans and they're trying to get a message out there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do you think -- do you think this is working?  Do you think  standing -- getting to the knee is working in terms of impacting the issues  that you are upset with?  </p><p> ALLRED:  I think that we are having a conversation about this right now  because players started to take a knee.  I think all of its country people  are having conversations that they might not be having.  And sometimes  having uncomfortable conversations is a part of making progress.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good point.</p><p> BREWER:  What we need.</p><p> ALLRED:  And I think that's something that's been initiated by this. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  Great --</p><p> BREWER:  Amen, Colin.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great conversation, Colin, Burgess, Jack.  Thank you so much.</p><p> ALLRED:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks for talking about the issues of the day.</p><p> OWENS:  Thank you, guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  We'll see you soon, gentlemen.  Thank you.   Coming up.  General Electric eyes major cost-cutting.

Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An unlikely tie-up between two major retailers  finally begins.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of The New York Stock  Exchange with the details.  What a day yesterday was, a little different  open today, huh, Nic?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right.  And so,  we're looking to the downside.  But what records we keep setting, I mean,  they'll just keep (INAUDIBLE) I guess.  Taking a look at some of our movers  this morning.  Of course, part of this run-up has been because of great  earnings, but I'm going to start with the story and that is the AmazonKohl's versus the Wal-Mart story.  Amazon and Kohl's have now completed a  tie-up intended to Kohl's and it will go to a lot of the Kohl's, 82 of the  Kohl's.  You're going to be able to go in there, into Kohl's, return your  Amazon products.  You'll even be able to try products out, gadgets, make  purchases.  </p><p> This is the way Amazon is going to take on Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart continues to  grow and has Wal-Mart Express where you just basically on your phone say  you're going to return it, you go into the store, you show your phone, you  give the package, done 30 seconds.  So, it is a battle.  Now, let's get to  those earnings we spoke of, Maria, watching Verizon and Travelers.  Verizon  looking to the upside today.  This bright spot was the paying of the  monthly bill subscribers.  They added 274,000 phone subscribers, that beats  the streets, that pushes Verizon up two percent and that will at least help  the Dow, at least in part.  They did see Verizon Fios subscribers dropping  off.  </p><p> Last but not least, the insurer, Travellers, the bright spot there was the  strong underwriting.  And in fact, that rose 4.2 percent to a record.  The  weak part was the catastrophe payouts, recording 700 million because of  Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but big picture, 59 percent drop in quarterly  profit.  It is fractionally higher this morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much, Nicole Petallides.   Meanwhile, General Electric's new CEO making some big changes, John  Flannery is reportedly expected to cut thousands of corporate-level jobs  and scale back G.E.'s global structure.  That's an addition to taking away  company cars, canceling fancy executive retreats.  We'll see what he does  and what the announcement is tomorrow, apparently, there's going to be  charges along with earnings tomorrow, when they report their third-quarter.  </p><p> Joining us now, host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney with some  thoughts on that.  Kind of a crazy story was that, Stuart, that Jeff Immelt  had an empty jet flying next to his jet on business trips just in case he  had mechanical failure.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's a head-shaker.  That is  one of the worst pieces of P.R. for a leading business guy that I've seen  in a long, long time.  I'll repeat the story, Maria, if I may, I don't know  why you've covered it already, I'm going to cover it, Jeff Immelt, CEO of  G.E., often, not always, but often had a second empty corporate jet flying  around after him -- he's in the first jet -- empty jet is the second jet,  just in case there's mechanical failure or security problems with the first  jet?  That really is extraordinary.  As you know, Maria -- look, I am  fascinated by G.E.  It was the stock of the last generation, and now it's  not.  They've got their profit margin declines, their financial business is  largely gone, they made a bad bet on energy, the dividend is threatened,  there's bad P.R. from the jets.  And I'm questioning, Maria, maybe you can  answer this one, is it a buy at $22.00 a share?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what, we had -- we had Scott Wren on early from  Wells Fargo, and he's a real industrial guy.  And he said he's looking at  it.  I mean, he didn't out-and-out say buy it at this level because we may  see more weakness, but, yes, I think you make a good point, the stock has  lost half of its value from the highs, Stu.</p><p> VARNEY:  At $23.00 a share, it pays a four percent dividend.  If that  dividend is threatened and I'm told that it is and the stock goes down to  $21.00 a share, say, just supposing it does, is it a buy at that point?  I  would say yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're probably right, Stu.  You're great at that.  Stu, we'll  see you in 10 minutes.  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top  of the hour at 9:00 a.m. with Stuart Varney.  We'll be right back, right  here, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Two Navy pilots have been killed during a Navy  Jet training exercise in Tennessee, this happened earlier this month.  But  what went wrong, is still in question.  Lea is with us today.  You're a  former Navy fighter pilot, what have you learned?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, Maria, that specific crash, I spoke with the Navy about  this, and they're still investigating, they don't know what caused it yet,  but I did learn from the Navy that they were planning to do a low-level  flight for that crash.  Now, separate issue is the one I first reported  here on this program back in April, when T-45 pilots were refusing to fly  because of issues that they were having with their life support systems in  the T-45, we've been continuing this investigation, and I visited Naval Air  Station Patuxent River in Maryland.  That's where research, development,  test, and evaluations are done for naval aircraft.  And it's the heart of  where the Navy is trying to solve those problems with life support systems.   Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DENNIS GORDGE, EXPERT, ALTITUDE SYSTEMS LABORATORY:  This is a breathing  regulator, which would control the flow of oxygen up through the hose to  the mask, so every time you take a breath, this regulator would allow the  oxygen to flow to the mask.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  At this altitude systems laboratory, experts like Dennis Gordge  are working with the Navy to address what are known as physiological  episodes (INAUDIBLE) when pilots become impaired while flying, sometimes  because they're breathing bad air.  The issue has been jeopardizing flights  in the T-45 trainer and the F-18 Hornet at an increasing rate.  </p><p> When a jet has an oxygen problem, the Navy pulls the equipment out of the  jet, and brings it here to Patuxent River.  For example, this component is  an oxygen concentrator from a T-45.</p><p> GORDGE:  Each component of the system is evaluated for its own performance,  this lab will put all those components together to look -- to see how it  did as a system.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  In fact, they can replicate the exact flight profile where a  problem was reported to determine what went wrong with the systems.</p><p> GORDGE:  So, this chamber is the simulated cockpit, and so this chamber  would be the pressurized portion of the aircraft.  This chamber, as you can  see, has got two breathing simulators, mechanical breathing simulators.</p><p> REAR ADM. SELECT SARA JOYNER, PHYSIOLOGICAL EPISODES TEAM LEAD:  We've  collected a tremendous amount of data, now we're getting into the analysis  and that's starting to inform some of the things that we think we need to  address.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Navy Admiral Select Sara Joyner was handpicked by the top brass  to address physiological episodes.  She's been on the job since late August  and says that they have been making modifications, like adding a new carbon  monoxide removal tool and T-45s have a new warning system for pilots.</p><p> What was your feeling when you were asked to take over this, you know,  being somebody who's been out there, flying jets and being in the midst of  combat operations?</p><p> JOYNER:  I think when I look at it is the trust and confidence given to me  to do this mission.  This is probably the most important thing that's going  on in naval aviation.  I couldn't feel anything other than a heavy  responsibility combined with, you know, just really wanting to lean into  the problem and get to work.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  T-45s that have been modified are flying again, although we've  learned that pilots have reported six more incidents, Maria.  F-18s are  going to take longer.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.  Stay with  us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  My thanks to a great panel.  Thanks, everybody.   Have a great day.  Seize that day.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stuart,  over to you.</p><p> VARNEY:  I will seize it, Maria, thank you very much.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

It was the f1st record close since President  Trump took office.  An amazing momentum market.</p><p>Earnings driving the gains yesterday, the optimism over tax cuts has  underpinned market gains for months as well and we could be one step closer  to it today.  The Senate gears up for the budget vote later today.   President Trump is calling this a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will be the largest tax  cut in the history of our country.  I focus on tax cuts because it's such  an important weapon to get our country really moving.  </p><p>So we'll go from being one of the highest tax nations in the world to one  of the lowest tax.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in my opinion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got all of the updates coming up.  Geopolitical tensions  this morning however weighing on markets.  Pulling things back from  yesterday's all time high.  </p><p>DOW Industrial expected to be down about 80 points at the opening of  trading, down about a third of a percent, Nasdaq down two-thirds of a  percent right now.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the action, all the major averages  down as you see there with the FTSE100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC  Krones down almost half of a percent and the DAX Index down better than one  half of one percent.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Japan  which was up again taking a cue from the U.S., up half of a percent.</p><p>A brand new terrorism threat to report, the Department of Homeland Security  is warning that ISIS is plotting another 9/11 style attack, details on this  terrifying plan aiming to inflict mass casualties.  We've got all the  details.</p><p>And a scary scene at the German airport, an Air Berlin Jet does a dangerous  fly-by with 200 passengers on board, the fallout from the active defiance  coming up.</p><p>NFL Commission Roger Goodell refusing to take a tougher stance on anthem  protests and nobody is happy with Goodell's comments even Colin Kaepernick,  he fired back without opening his mouth.

Wow.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle is here.  Kelly and Company  Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly is here.  And Rosecliff Capital CEO, Mike  Murphy is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Great to  be here.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Thursday everybody.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We have 5,000 foot jump since President Trump took office in  the DOW but this tax plan, man, I'll tell you, we're going to have to see  what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely, 23,000 and counting.  I mean, come on.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  And you know what's fascinating is actually  Janet Yellen is due to have a meeting today at the White House with  President Trump.</p><p>And so whatever happens at the Fed and whoever they pick next is going to  have significant impacts on the markets and one of the reasons why you can  see that is because the Fed has been so accommodative to this market.</p><p>You've seen asset inflation, I mean valuations are at all time highs.  So  it's a fascinating aspect because Secretary MNuchin has reported that he  doesn't like Kevin Warsh because he think he could royal markets, right?</p><p>He wasn't for quantitative using, he actually was very adamant against it.   And so Jerome Powell is more accommodative. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We may know this week or next who the president decides on,  we're going to get to all of that coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story this hour and that is the market milestone,  23,000.  The DOW Industrial closed above the 23,000 mark for the first time  ever yesterday.  Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin though made an important  comment throughout the day warning that all of those games could be in  jeopardy should Congress fail to pass tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY TEXT: </p><p>There is no question that the rally in the stock market has based into it  reasonably high expectations of us getting tax cuts and tax reform done.   It also has based into it optimism on regulatory relief which they begun to  see and there's expectations.  So I think to the extent we get the tax deal  done, the stock market will go up higher but there's no question in my mind  if we don't get it done, you're going to see a reversal of the significant  amount of these gains.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  sounds about right, the Senate is expected to vote today on a  budget that would allow the Chamber to pass a tax bill with just 51 votes  instead of the 60 needed for major legislation.  </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Former Chief Strategist for  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, his senate and president campaign, Jason Johnson is  with us along with Former Deputy Secretary of Labor in the Obama  Administration, now a Senior Fellow at the University of Virginia Miller  Center, Chris Liu.  Good to see you both gentlemen, Thank you so much for  joining us this morning.</p><p>CHRIS LIU, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LABOR, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION:  Thank  you. </p><p>JASON JOHNSON, FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Jason, in that same interview, the Treasury Secretary made  those comments about the market, he offered this, an absolutely guarantee  that a tax overhaul would be sign into law by the end of this year.  Is  that a reasonable time table?  Do you think they will get this done?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Well certainly if you look at the performance this year with  other major pieces of legislation it doesn't seem reasonable.  But I  understand why the Secretary is saying what he's saying.</p><p>There is an absolute expectation that this has to be done in the political  market if you will.  And so I'm not incredibly optimistic that it happens  by the end of the year.  There certainly seems to be a mixed message coming  from some leaders on the Hill as to whether or not the deadline is the end  of the year.  But whether it's the end of the year or after the first of  the year, it must happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chris, do you agree with that that it must happen and that it  will happen?</p><p>LIU:  I agree with Senator McConnell who said it's more important that we  get it right instead of just running this through.  And I think it's  important to look at the details here and we don't really know yet  percentage is going to go to the super wealthy, how it's going to add to  the deficit whether it's really going to fix the idiosyncrasies in the tax  code right now.</p><p>And so putting it on an artificial deadline does not bode well for coming  up with good policy and that's really what the market wants to see right  now.  They really want to see the once in a generation tax reform proposal,  not another giveaway that just goes to the super wealthy.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, Chris considering -- it's Kevin Kelly here.  Considering you  spent time in the White House especially with President Obama, do you think  it's appropriate for a cabinet secretaries or anybody in this  administration to be talking about the impact on stock markets given that  they should be focusing on policy and talking about the implements, what it  could do to the real economy as opposed to really focusing on markets that  should do whatever they should be doing?</p><p>LIU:  That's exactly right.  It's one of the reasons why we in the Obama  Administration didn't talk about the stock market even though we had  significant gains as well because the market goes up and unfortunately it  goes down as well.</p><p>And it goes up or down for reasons that have nothing to do with Washington.   And if I were Secretary MNuchin, I would probably take my cues from the  leaders on the Hill as to what the timing should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, I know.  I think that's a good point but at the same  time, $5.3 trillion in market value doesn't come out of air.  It's clear  that the market value that we've seen in these gains is partly due to  optimism over what President Trump is doing.  </p><p>He's rolled back an incredible amount of regulation and they're expecting  tax reform.  Are you saying $5.3 trillion in market value is just a  coincidence?</p><p>LIU:  Well I would say that it's based on the expectation something's  happening.  This is a recovery, economic recovery that began in early 2010  and we've had essentially seven straight years of economic growth.</p><p>There have been rollbacks of regulations but there hasn't been this  significant economic change that Donald Trump has promised yet.  So a lot  of this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we did see a 3.1 percent GDP the other day and GDP was  averaging about one and a half percent under President Obama.  So -- I mean  there's something to it that the economy is definitely better.  </p><p>You're (INAUDIBLE) in small business, do you see that Mike Murphy?  Do you  see things getting better?  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  We see small business optimism out there, we see  startups, we see companies that are looking to disrupt existing industries  coming out hiring people, raising money, going out and creating -- using  technology to make our lives better.  So I think right now the optimism  that we see nationwide is something we haven't seen in a long time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason, let me ask you this, in terms of this bill, if it gets  done in the first quarter, do you think that still has a positive impact?   If we don't see a bill on the president's desk by Thanksgiving, this is  going to be a problem for certainly into the 2018 election for the  republicans.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Sure.  Going back to the comment earlier that we shouldn't have  artificial deadlines.  I don't believe getting this done by the end of the  year or seeing that we need to get it done by the end of the year is an  artificial deadline because we know historically that very few things  happen in election year.</p><p>And as we all know, next year is an election year.  So Maria, into the  first quarter, maybe so but we know that you get much passed the first  quarter these guys don't like to do much in an election year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you're right, if they don't get it done maybe that's  -- they should move out because this is something that the American people  want, Lea Gabrielle.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.  Chris, Senator Schumer said our republican friends are  trying to hide what's in the tax bill that they don't want people to know.  </p><p>Is this just resistance sort of popping up already from the democrats on  this obstructionist because really tax reform is good for all Americans  right now, is it?</p><p>LIU:  A hundred percent agree tax reform is good.  What we have seen so far  is simply tax cuts and some of the initial estimates are that becoming 50  to 80 percent of the benefits would go to the top one percent.  Look --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not true.  That's just not true.  I don't want to spew  out nonsense because 80 percent of the tax reform package going to the top  one percent is nonsense.</p><p>LIU:  An important issue to get right.  For instance, it's the state and  local tax deduction which is going to affect a lot republican members and  understanding the details of that is not just resistance, it's actually  trying to make sure that this is legitimate tax reform and there are so  many issues.  This is why this is hard and it's hard to get it right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about a corporate rate of 20 percent.  If you  see the corporate rate go down from 35 percent to 20 percent, that will be  a positive for corporations and the idea is is that they are going to  reinvest in higher (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KELLY:  It's small businesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Small business with 25 percent pass through rate, same thing  down from 39.6.  So this is a significant move.  He's also talking about  three brackets, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent --</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean, small businesses is like --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I'd like to point out, those aren't republican small  businesses, those are democrat, republican, American small businesses.  So  that impacts everybody not just one side.  This isn't a one side versus the  other.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the reason that I have to push back on that Chris  is because we were expecting the talking points after this plan and it's  just not true that 80 percent of the tax plan impacts the top one percent,  it's just not true and we have to make it clear.</p><p>LIU:  You know, the problem is, we don't have the details yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>LIU:  We don't have the -- we don't have the details yet and I think that's  the problem --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well we have the details that we just mentioned, we got three  brackets on the individual rates, we got a doubling of the standard  deduction, corporate rate of 20 percent, pass through rate of 25 percent,  and the elimination of most deductions.</p><p>LIU:  Well look, we don't really know what the impact is on average  Americans, we don't know what the size of the (INAUDIBLE) tax credit is  going to be, we don't understand all the other archaic idiosyncrasy that's  --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then how can you say it benefits the one percent if you  don't even have the details?</p><p>LIU:  Well -- look, we're -- the folks that have looked at this are basing  this on the initial proposal.  Let's have a whole debate on this and let's  make sure we get this right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because this is -- we're watching President  Obama return to the campaign trail Chris to stump for democratic candidates  and governance races, of course, in New Jersey and in Virginia, out of next  month elections.</p><p>This development comes amid a shakeup at the DNC where several key long  time officials have lost their post.  The party's new chairman, Tom Perez  obviously preparing to host his first meeting since taking over the job  earlier this year.</p><p>You were among the 75 people nominated by Tom Perez to become the new at  large DNC member, what's behind the shakeup?  Tell us how you're feeling?   Congratulations by that nomination by the way Chris.</p><p>LIU:  Well look, there are about 400 members of the Democratic National  Committee.  The new chairman get to pick 75.  This is a time of change  within the Democratic Party and I think we need to admit that things  haven't gone as well as they should have over the last couple of years.</p><p>And so unfortunately when you bring new people in, some people that have  served for a while have to be moved and that's just part of change.  And  this is a big 10 party and change happens and change is good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, one thing that seems to be happening is that the  Democratic Party is being hijacked by the extreme left Chris.  </p><p>Are you going to be able to come up with a message that will resonate with  the broad American people, the population given the fact that you've got  Barrack Obama, you've got Bernie Sanders, you've got Elizabeth Warren going  to the extreme left and really hijacking what was a moderate party at one  point?</p><p>LIU:  Tom Perez has made a commitment that the democrats need to compete in  every seat from the school board to the Senate to the White House.</p><p>And we need to understand that we as a party can't have one monolithic  message.  That doesn't work in all state and certainly doesn't even work in  all rural areas versus urban areas as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  All right.  Gentlemen, thanks very  much for the conversation we appreciate you joining us this morning.  Chris  Liu.  Jason, good to see you as well.  We will talk with you soon  gentlemen.</p><p>Coming up, the head of Homeland Security is warning Americans of a new  threat, the concern over ISIS plotting another 9/11 next.  We are going to  tell you the details of what we know.  </p><p>Then Colin Kaepernick firing back at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the  new way he's lashing out against him straight ahead.  </p><p>A fired up morning thins morning, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A top U.S. security chief warning terror groups  are planning a major attack on the scale of 9/11.  Cheryl Casone with the  details now, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria, good morning.  Acting Homeland Security  Secretary Elaine Duke saying it is clear that ISIS and other terror groups  are planning to take down planes as an aim to carry out another massive  attack.  Duke also saying terror groups have been using knife and van  attacks to keep their members engaged.</p><p>Well the head of American Express, one of the country's most prominent  African-American corporate leaders is leaving the company, Kenneth Chenault  depature caps a 16-year run at the credit card company.  He's going to be  succeeding a CEO by Stephen Squeri a three decade AmEx veteran.  Shares of  AmEx up 23 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, American cities are pulling all the stops in their bid to become home  to Amazon's second headquarters.  Stonecrest, Georgia has offered to change  its name to Amazon.  Tucson, Arizona tried to send a company a 21-foot  cactus.</p><p>Amazon has promised to invest $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs.  The  deadline to submit bids is today.  And, of course, check this out, New York  City lit up famous buildings including the Empire State Building and one  World Trade in Amazon's orange color last night trying to help seal the  deal.  Probably going to be a little more than light that's going to get  Amazon somewhere.</p><p>And then finally there's this, first lady Melania Trump is donating her  inaugural ball gown to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.   She is handing over the vanilla silk off the shoulder gown, it's got a slit  skirt.  The tradition first began Maria with Helen Taft back in 1912.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Cool.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Interesting.  Would you  go see the first lady's gown at the Smithsonian Lea?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think if I was already going to the Smithsonian then I would  happen to pass by and see the first lady's gown.</p><p>But I do think that this is really nice about making (INAUDIBLE) because it  gives you a sense of being able to even that you can't touch them, just  being able to sort of look at them and sort of have the essence of what it  must have been like to be there that day.  So I think it's wonderful that  they do this.</p><p>KELLY:  I think it also highlights the importance of the first lady, right?   I mean you go throughout history and you look at the contributions they've  made.  So it's nice that --</p><p>MURPHY:  The guy who's getting married in New York.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I was going to say behind every great man is a better woman.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, says the guy who's getting married.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your upcoming nuptial.</p><p>KELLY:  Well she did get her dress last Friday so maybe I'm just kind of  high upbeat excited.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, she got the dress.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I know.  So obviously I didn't see it but it was a fun and  exciting experience.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I was going to say, let's see a live TV picture of this and get  you in really big trouble.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep following all of that.  Coming up next  though, a real scare in the sky to tell you about, more video of the risky  fly-by stunt that got pilot suspended, that's coming up.</p><p>And then GE's new chief taking away company cars and cancelling fancy  retreats.  The new cost cutting direction for General Electric ahead of its  earnings tomorrow, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric's new CEO John Flannery making  some changes starting with some old favorites.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details, Tracee --</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.  You know,  John Flannery, he's only been on the job since August 1st but he's already  making some big changes.</p><p>One of his first belt tightening moves was to ground GE's fleet of six  business jets which was a favorite of former GE CEO Jeff Immelt who used to  have an empty private jet fly next to his just as a spare and that's just  the beginning.</p><p>Bob Nardelli, former Chrysler CEO and Home CEO was on the show yesterday  and here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO HOME DEPOT &amp; CHRYSLER:  They have to get their  fundamental businesses that are left to get some growth.  They got to get  growth, they've got to get top line growth, they got to get productivity,  they got to get innovation.</p><p>The key to GE over the last 16 years Maria as we've seen that goes out have  been a lot more than the goes in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARRASCO:  And Nardelli worked at GE for several years.  And according to  \"The Wall Street Journal,\" next month Flannery is expected to unveil the  results of a strategic review that includes thousands of corporate level  job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure.</p><p>He is shutting down research centers in Shanghai, Munich, and Rio democrats  Janiero.  A GE spokesperson said:</p><p>TEXT: The company will continue to have an intense focus on our global  operations and customer base.</p><p>The company is expected to report quarterly reports tomorrow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at that stock ahead of those --</p><p>CARRASCO:  Hasn't been good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ahead of those numbers.  The stock has been cut in half from  the highs.  No, wait a minute.  Let's just underline what you just said  Tracee, he had a separate jet flying behind his jet on business trips and  the jet flying behind him was empty.</p><p>CARRASCO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he did that for what reason?</p><p>CARRASCO:  Just in case there were any issues with the private jet he was  already on.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean --</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I flew in the navy and I have a commanding officer who made me  take a jet to an air show because it was his hometown and he wanted to make  sure that if his jet, if there's anything wrong with it he couldn't fly in  the air show but there was a spare there.  So I've seen this before, pretty  wasteful.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  But the biggest problem is they have shareholders, right,  that they're held accountable too and I'm sorry --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a public company.</p><p>KELLY:  Listen, you don't need to fly a private jet next to you.  Listen,  if your plane has mechanical issues, guess what, then we'll figure out and  we'll rent a private jet that's there to take you back to wherever you need  to go.  You don't -- yes, exactly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Well here's the problem, the board.  If I was a member on the  board, how can you -- you've got to be held accountable.  I mean, they --  like coming out of GE tomorrow and whether they cut the dividend, that's  one of the biggest concerns that shareholders are having right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sure is.</p><p>KELLY:  But also what is this board doing if they're allowing this, right?   Shareholder capital --</p><p>MURPHY:  And (INAUDIBLE) I think for an old company like GE that's trying  to figure out how to stay relevant in this new economy, I think something  like this coming out makes it really hard for shareholders to believe in  this.</p><p>And you could see people wanting to sell this and look at company if they  are really on the cutting edge of technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that are growing.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  But they are looking for places to trim the fat just like  Tracee mentioned, shutting down some of those research centers and sort of  trying to consolidate their resources.  So at least we're moving forward in  that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've got to.  We'll see what the company says tomorrow.  GE  reports at around 8:30a.m. in the morning, tomorrow morning on its third  quarter. And, of course, a speculation is around that dividend.  Tracee  Carrasco, thank you.  </p><p>We will take a break.  When we come back, months after going public, Blue  Apron is laying off hundreds of employees.

We've got more, coming up on that.  But first, a new approach to measuring  success, Fortune Magazine is shining a light on the top names driving the  business world tomorrow, where is the growth?  We want to know.  Fortune is  debuting its future 50 list today, covering the most innovative companies  prime for explosive growth.  Fox Business has the exclusive first look at  the list.  </p><p>Coming in at number five on Fortunes' Future 50 Leaders, medical robotics  leader, Intuitive Surgical, fourth is the king of the stream, Netflix.   Number three on this list, Mark Zuckerberg's dorm project turns social  media titan, Facebook.  Elon Musk, electric automaker Tesla, cruising into  the second spot.  And topping the list is cloud computing giant,  Salesforce, joining us right now in a Fox Business Exclusive, Working  Deputy Editor, Brian O'Keefe.  Brian, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR OF FORTUNE:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, a lot of those names, obviously, very familiar and growth  stories that we all know, how did you come up with this list, what are the  growth metrics that you used?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  So we worked with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), they were our  partners in doing this.  They did an incredible amount of number crunching,  and they looked at 15 years of financial data and they scream for all 2,300  U.S. public companies.  And they really looked at a couple of things.  One  is the market potential of all these companies, what the market is betting,  how much growth the market is betting and assigning their value.  </p><p>And then they also dove into the company's themselves and looked at people,  structure, their technology and investments, they used artificial  intelligence, natural language processing to look at 70,000 10Ks and look  at the way those companies talked about themselves, if they talked about  future and investment and long-term thinking.  And they did a lot of  backtesting and looked at what correlated with real growth over time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's interesting that Salesforce is the number one -- in  the number one spot.  Were you surprised with that, Mike?</p><p>MURPHY:  I was, for sure, because, you know, when you think about growth,  you hear the fangs.  You know, you hear about Facebook, which is there but  Amazon, Netflix, which is there, Google.  So, the way this is -- I think  this is going to create a lot of controversy from people who are saying,  you know, like, oh, here's the big apple, we don't see therearound.</p><p>KELLY:  Apple didn't make the list, actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Apple didn't make the list.</p><p>KELLY:  Apple did not make the list, in part to its recent increase  emphasis on paying dividends on over reinvestment.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Yes, I mean, you're seeing -- I mean, Apple is the big exception,  right?  That's, you know, we noted that.  And, you know, Apple is obviously  still an incredible performer but they are piling up cash, they are paying  out dividends under some pressure to shareholders and that's not really a  formula for future growth.  </p><p>You know, you want to see a company, not that Apple is not doing well, but  you want to see them putting it in to new technology, Salesforce, to your  point, you know, they are -- Marc Benioff keeps that company really focused  on the future, they're investing in artificial intelligence and they're  making acquisitions on --</p><p>KELLY:  And I think the important thing about Salesforce, if you look it as  -- it didn't surprise me one bit about this, because he's actually struck  deals and partnerships with other companies like IBM to have a stronger,  better, platform for his customers, right?  So for insurance companies, if  there's a hail storm, they're going to use IBMs (INAUDIBLE) to notify all  the policyholders, so he's done a very good job especially on the  acquisition side.  So if they had a hole on their business model, he went  out and bought them.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  To look at the list overall, though, you know, a lot of people  say the past performance is the best indication of future success and  that's really not the way that you created this list, right?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that's really, kind of, the whole reason we did  create this list, is that past performance isn't the indicator of future  success and today's environment, things are changing so much faster,  technologies speeding up the pace of change, that we felt like in BCG, felt  like, we need a better metric to do that.  So that, you know, most of the  time, you're measuring a company on.  </p><p>You're trying to project the future on what they've been doing recently.   And this is like really -- that's why it's diving into, sort of, the DNA of  these companies and how they operate and how they talk and how they think  and trying to do that in a scientific way.  And, you know, looking at the  structure of the company, I mean, the hard reality is that younger  companies tend to grow faster, I mean, not just smaller companies, but  tightly-managed younger companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And founder companies, right?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  And founder companies, a lot of the time, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You also put his list of Future 50 Challengers.  We just showed  it on the screen.  These are companies that are on the fast-track for  growth but aren't quite there yet.  So how did you come up with this list?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Well, the secret about the Future 50 is (INAUDIBLE) list of 25.   So we have the 25 big companies and the 25 challengers, is what we called  it, BCG, didn't want to -- if you're screening for growth, you're going to  naturally get smaller companies, so that's why we did two separate screens  to get the big companies that are still growing.  The challengers are  really the companies that are on the rise, not necessarily small companies,  but, you know, it can be like, $5 to 10-billion market cap companies.  And  you see a lot of software companies on the list overall but especially on  the challenger's list, I mean, it's really like software is eating the  world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Marc Andreessen said years ago, you know, software  eats the world.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Yes, it's still true.  It's true, maybe more than ever.  I mean,  it's, you know, like Veeva Systems, the number one company in the  challenger's list.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Workday has been taking market share from, like, the  oracles of the world for years.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Workday is huge.  I mean, obviously, it's a huge stock, market  cap has shut up.  And yes, so these are companies that they're displacing  traditional systems and they're doing it with software technology.</p><p>KELLY:  So on Workday, it's a perineal emanate target, right?  And I just  wanted to highlight the point you said, though, earlier, 64 percent of the  companies in this list are software or online service providers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  That highlights that this is the wave and this is the future of  where we are going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to find growth, that's where it is.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, and a bit in every industry.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And one of the things that you have said is that, a lot of  companies that are using artificial intelligence are, sort of, higher on  the list, but you also used artificial intelligence in developing this  list, right?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that was one of the really cool things that BCG did,  is use this natural language processing to troll through 70,000 10Ks = like  200,000 different earnings calls, transcripts, and really look at the  language that the management uses to talk about how they managed their own  business.   And so, and, you know, I don't -- I don't personally know the details of  how the artificial intelligence did it, but it correlates certain words and  the way they come together with performance.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, how far down did you guys dig?  Like, how low did you go?   Because a company like Salesforces which is number one, they have a  venture, we ran a venture capital funds.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  So Salesforce is actively out there looking to acquire early-stage  start-ups.  Is there another 50 list of, kind of, the 50 (INAUDIBLE) that's  going start-ups or early stage companies?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Maybe we will expand that out.  But one thing the BCG did do, was  look at the investments that company's making, compared to high performing  DC funds to, sort of, get a sense of like how good their investments are.   So, that's an interesting way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're hitting on something so important right now.  I'm so  glad you brought it up, Mike, because you're right, Salesforce has an arm  that invests and acquires smaller companies.  That's why a lot of these  companies as Amazon, you know, other big technology --</p><p>KELLY:  Intel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Intel, you're seeing large tech right now, have venture capital  arm and they are acquiring some of the smaller, no-names out there.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  You know, we have a story on Salesforce that goes deeper into  what they're doing.  They bought 55 companies since 2006.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  And Marc Benioff, you know, a lot of times, like, maybe he  doesn't even exactly know what they're going to do with the company but he  knows there's an interesting technology and they make it an acquisition,  they figure out how it's going to impact their business.</p><p>KELLY:  Is there a super surprised company, for you, because I'm looking at  this list and I'm not surprised by it, but I think people could be as the  intercontinental exchange that, you know, they run the New York stock  exchange, but really, those companies, the exchange have been focusing on  data, licensing, it's not really  --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of (INAUDIBLE) mergers.</p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.  So, is there a company on this list that surprised you  the most?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Surprised me the most, I mean, I'm a little surprised -- Monster  Beverage is a really interesting company.</p><p>KELLY:  Number 20 on that list.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Because they have been growing fast for 20 years, and, you know,  I don't drink Monster Beverage drinks, but a lot of people do.  They're  really smart about how they market their brand, they don't really do a lot  of advertising but they do a lot of really cool, sort of, sponsorship  stuff.  And they just, you know, they keep growing that company year after  year.</p><p>KELLY:  And the next leg of growth for Monster Beverage is over in China  and Asia, so that's where they're looking to go so if you follow the stock  close, you can see they've dominated North America and they've slowly been  making inroads and smart positioning in Asia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at that chart.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  You know we have MasterCard and Visa on the list.  And I think  that's really interesting because they seemed like, you know, it's the card  in your wallet.  But they're really doing a lot of innovative things.  They  are trying to be, you know, the future of payments in all different forms.</p><p>MURPHY:  And when we talk about big tech companies or fin-tech companies  doing acquisitions, early-stage investing.  But there's also companies like  Campbell Soup has (INAUDIBLE) so it's not just big tech that's looking to  acquire small innovative companies.  I think it's across all diferent -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Campbell Soup, wow.  And these guys are computer guys like you.   We had Ann Winblad on from Winblad, who is a great venture capitalist.  And  she said, I'm competing with the arms of the soft, you know, of the  SoftBanks, not SoftBanks, of the --</p><p>MURPHY:  The large corporations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The large corporation.  The largest technology -- </p><p>KELLY:  Imagine if the repatriation happens, of the taxes of all those  trillions of dollars overseas to these companies that they can then re- invest since small businesses start up, things that are happening.  I mean,  not to tie this into the whole tax reform overhaul policy but that could be  a good next leg of growth for this company.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  First, they have to find the right things to invest in.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These lists are helpful.  Brian, thank you so much, Brian  O'Keefe joining us.  We wanted to also -- should we take a look at IBM real  quick.  I mean, IBM was obviously stalled in terms of its revenue growth  for 22 quarters.  You saw a decline in revenue but yesterday, check out  that stock yesterday.  Nine percent, one of the reasons the Dow Industrials  hit 23,000.  I just wanted to mention that, is this a turning point for  IBM?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't think so.  I think when you see that type of move, so much  of the volume in the markets right now is computer driven or algorithmic  trading.  That, to me, smells like a short covering -- short squeeze.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep watching IBM.  Obviously, IBM, GE, two- story stocks that we want to look at today.  Brian, good to see you, thank  you.  Coming up next, the fight is growing over Catalonia's push for  independence.  How the Spanish government is trying to stop the region's  succession, that's next.  And then a terrifying close call, more video of  that scary fly by that put 200 passengers at risk.  We'll tell you all  about it, back in a moment, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Markets are down this morning after a huge day  yesterday.  Dow Industrials' expected to be down better than 100 points.   No surprise.  The market crossed 23,000 yesterday for the first time ever  in a big rally, and, of course, we're up to better than $5 trillion in  market value since the election.  </p><p>A couple names on the move, Gilead Sciences; the stock right now is up  almost three percent in the premarket after winning FDA approval for a new  cancer gene therapy -- used to treat lymphoma.  The pharmaceutical giant  will sell the treatment at $373,000.  It's only the second gene therapy to  earn approval from the FDA on that.  Novartis brought the first drug of  this class to market back in August.</p><p>EBay shares this morning on the move after delivering third-quarter  earnings after the bell last night.  The results were roughly in line but  fourth-quarter guidance's disappointed.  EBay is revamping its online  marketplace amid tough competition from Amazon.  Stock, right now, taken a  real hit down 6-1/2 percent in the premarket.  </p><p>And then, there's Spain, the government there is set to activate an  emergency measure to take control of Catalonia, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So, Spain's government calling a special cabinet for  the weekend to activate this measure -- it allows for the central  government to take over the semiautonomous power of any of the country's17  regions.  Now, this comes after Catalonia's leader said, Separatist  lawmakers, can vote in favor of declaration of independence.  The measure  has never been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in  Spain.  </p><p>Well, an Air Berlin pilot is in big trouble.  He performed a risky flying  stunt with 200 passengers aboard.  You're watching the video of it right  now.  Reports say he buzzed Dusseldorf Airport terminal in a maneuver that  was met to mark the bankrupt last Trans-Atlantic flight.  Well, a pilot of  another told Reuters that a go-around should only be performed for its  operations, or safety aviation officials are looking at this video and  looking into this incident.  </p><p>Well, Blue Apron, they are tightening their belt.  The company has laid out  six percent of the workforce, that's about 300 workers, as part of a  company or organization.  Blue Apron has struggled since it went public  back in June with its stock price cut in half since then.  Competition from  a rival, a big one that would-be Amazon.  There is the year to date chart,  you can see it on your screen.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Sea World is laying off 350 workers due to low attendance at its  parks -- mainly in Orlando and San Diego.  They've been trying to rebuild  the brand solving protests over its treatment of their killer whales.   Shares of Sea World, down more than 34 percent year to date.  </p><p>And then, finally this, Snickers are getting a facelift, actually three  facelifts.  The candy company announcing they're going to release a line of  three new flavors to combat a number of different, well, emotional issues.   Feeling irritable, wimpy, indecisive?  Well, they've got the cure.  These  three bars: espresso, fiery, and salty and sweet, Maria.  Right now, I  think I want the espresso.  I'm a little tired.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Yes, the expresso sounds good.  </p><p>KELLY:  Thanks to wimpy for fiery, right?  Like, I like spicy stuff, but it  doesn't mean that I'm a wimp.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's taking it personally.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  So -- but personally, I'm really concerned about the espresso  one, because if you're irritable, I think the last thing you actually need  is to have some more caffeine.  More caffeine.  I always like those names,  though.  I actually find that really attractive.  When you're in a store  and you're looking at candy and you're like, yes, you know, I kind of feel  irritable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do you buy right there?  Or will you buy it because of  that?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  No.  Only if I really want it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking out over  the national anthem protest.  What he said to players and how they're  reacting, next.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a big night at Wrigley Field last night.  The Cubs  fought for their playoff lives and they survived.  Jared Max with the  highlights, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey!  Good morning, Maria.  I know  the Dodgers are only one win from the World Series, but just imagine the  Cubs came all the way back to win the NLC.  Yes, they did what they had to  do last night in a do or die game 4. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>(BASEBALL GAMEPLAY)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Javier Baez at two home runs; Wilson Contreras also (INAUDIBLE) for  the Cubs.  Dodgers would blast from Cody Dellinger and Justin Turner, but  the Cubs win.  Cubs win!  Cubs win, 3-2.  So, there will be a game 5.   Tonight, at Wrigley Field, the Cubs pick Jose Montana.  The Dodgers'  Clayton Kershaw L.A. leads three games to one.  </p><p>New York Yankees rookie, Aaron Judge, a hero again last night.  A third- inning double off Astros Ace, Dallas Keuchel, gave the Yanks a 2-0 lead.   Then, at the seventh inning, fellow baby bomber, Gary Sanchez, smashes a  solo home run against Brad Peacock -- third home run this postseason for  Sanchez.  Yankees' finally got reminisce its Dallas Keuchel and Masahiro  Tanaka.  7-shutout innings, 5-0, Yanks win.  </p><p>Series goes back to Houston where the Astros won the first two games.   Here's to start, Justin Verlander tomorrow night, and Yankees turn to Luis  Severino.  Yanks, one win from their 41st American League pennant.  </p><p>Hey, you know when somebody says, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.   Well, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the opposite yesterday,  regarding players choices to stand or kneel for the national anthem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER FOR THE NFL:  Everyone should stand for the  national anthem, that's an important part of our policy.  It's also an  important part of our game that we all take great pride in, it's also  important for us to honor our flag and to our country, and we think our  fans expect us to do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  Everyone should stand, not must stand.  While Goodell said he just  wants to keep the politics out of football.  President Trump, responded on  Twitter, \"NFL, too much talk, not enough action.  Stand for the national  anthem.\"  And while Colin Kaepernick, the first anthem kneeler, remained  silent except for retweets about not enough attention being given to what  he says police brutality against people of color. The Seahawks' Michael  Bennett isn't interested in discussing how to fix these social issues.   While the NFL team owners are trying to.  </p><p>Why?  He says, \"I don't think we can work alongside them until we address  that issue.  I think the issue with Kaepernick is the start to a  conversation.  If they want us to be open to what they want, the dialogue,  then that's something that needs to be on the table right there.\"  So,  Kaepernick first and then the issues.  </p><p>Some kneel, some protests, some put their money where their mouth is, like  the Philadelphia Eagles' Chris Long who has supported teammates protesting  the national anthem but is also doing something else.  Chris Long of the  Eagles, who had donated his first six-game paychecks this season to fund  two scholarships at a prep school in Charlottesville where he grew up is  now donating the rest of his 2017 NFL salary.  Ten more paychecks to help  fund education to make it for folks who are -- don't get the opportunities  in certain cities -- ten weeks of paychecks going to this in cities of St.  Louis, Boston and also Philadelphia.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great.  </p><p>KELLY:  Leading by example.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Football has a 10 for Tomorrow campaign.  Good on him for that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, go Yanks!  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sorry, Max.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, this should be the go Yanks.</p><p>MAX:  Some Mets fans started this as soon when the Yankees beat the Mets,  and he got Wednesday missing.  Somehow, the Yankees do this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Mets are still amazing.  Sorry.  All right.  Jared Max.   Catch Jared's sports reports on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7,\" SiriusXM 115.  I  want to bring you this breaking news: the president is tweeting this  morning.  Here is what he said, \"Republicans are going for big budget  approval today.  The first step toward massive tax cuts.  I think we have  the votes, but who knows?\"  Uh-oh!</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KELLY:  Who knows?  Caveat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I guess they need the caveat in this day and age.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, cities are mailing in their bid to  Amazon.  We're taking a look at the other crazy stumps from towns competing  for technology giants' second headquarters, wait until you see this.

We are cutting taxes on small businesses to the lowest rate in  more than 80 years.  We are going to restore America's competitive edge,  rebuild America's middle class -- very much aimed at the middle class --  and renew the promise of the American dream.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this morning the President just tweeted this about the  vote.

Great to be here.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  Good morning.  And what  I like is coming up at 7:30 we've got Dick Bove coming on talking about the  bank earnings and today we have BB&amp;T reporting earnings -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- which will be interesting because we want to see what happens  with the regional banks and the guidance they give and what they think  about tax reform because they are more levered to the U.S. economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point.  </p><p>You know, the earnings estimates have come way down, Mike, from earlier in  the year.  I mean we had profit growth to 14 percent in the first quarter.   We want to talk about 4 percent expectations this quarter, but I bet you  they beat them wildly.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  Well, so far we have seen great numbers and banks have put  up some very solid numbers.  I think a lot of people have been betting  against the banks and it's been a losing trade so far.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're talking about all that this morning and a lot more  but we kick it off this hour with our top story: more than 100 cities in  North America in a bidding war this morning for next Amazon headquarters.   The fight is almost over.  Today is the last day for cities to submit their  applications to Amazon.  And the company has a wish list which all the  mayors know about.</p><p>The online giant is looking for a metro area of one million people or more,  access to a mass transit system, close proximity to international airport.</p><p>Let's talk about that.  Joining me right now is the mayor of Tulsa,  Oklahoma -- Mayor G.T. Bynum, and Danbury, Connecticut Mayor Mark Boughton.   Good to see you both.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MARK BOUGHTON, MAYOR, DANBURY CONNECTICUT:  Thanks for having me.  Great to  be here.</p><p>G.T. BYNUM, MAYOR, TULSA, OKLAHOMA:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mayor Bynum, let me kick it off with you.  Why did you throw  your city into this bidding war?  Tell us how you fit this bill?  </p><p>BYNUM:  We think we are really well placed from a logistical standpoint.   There's no city in America that combines our quality of life here in Tulsa  with the overall population base.</p><p>We are bringing in the greatest public park gift in America, next year to a  $400 million gathering place.  We just obtained Bob Dylan's archive which  the \"Washington Post\" has said is going to lead to Tulsa becoming the  research center in the world for 20th century music.</p><p>We have the arena of the year, beating out the Staples Center and Madison  Square Garden.  So we have all of that and yet we have the ease of a Middle  American city and we are close proximity to 750,000 people in this region  that work in today businesses and profession that Amazon will need for this  headquarters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>BYNUM:  So we think we are uniquely positioned because of our placement in  the country right by one of Amazon's main competitors just an hour and a  half to our east.  And we think we can hang with cities that are a whole  lot bigger than us from a population standpoint because of the placement we  happen to have and the culture of our city matches Amazon's very closely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mayor Boughton -- what do you think?  How do you compare?  </p><p>BOUGHTON:  Well, listen.  We are leveraging a regional approach to this.   So we're actually working with eastern New York.  We're working with lower  Fairfield County, upper Fairfield County and of course, our city which  compromises of about 85,000 people.</p><p>We have plenty of space and room to this.  We have access to all of the  mass transit things -- all the things that they're looking for to be  successful.</p><p>But we really believe in our application and, look, at the end of the day  you miss 100 percent of the shot you don't take.  So we're going to take  our shot, we want those 50,000 jobs.  The economic spinoff and derivative  is incredible and we will transform Connecticut and I think this will lead  to a Connecticut comeback. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So some cities are really getting creative in an effort to  stand out.  And check out what some of the people are doing in Tucson,  Arizona for example.  Officials uprooted a 21-foot tall cactus and tried to  deliver it to Amazon's Seattle headquarter.</p><p>Over in Birmingham, Alabama they constructed a giant Amazon box and placed  them around the city.</p><p>And then in Missouri, Kansas City's mayor reportedly bought a thousand  items from Amazon and wrote reviews for each one.</p><p>So you posted a video on Facebook, didn't you?  </p><p>BOUGHTON:  I did.  And Alexa says that, you know, we should be there that  day.  HQ2 should be Danbury, Connecticut.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You invited -- you invited Amazon to Danbury.  Listen, we have  the clip.  Let's watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOUGHTON:  We not only talk the talk but we walk the walk.  I'm a proud  Amazon customer.  So Alexa where is the best place for Amazon to locate its  second world headquarters?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Danbury, Connecticut.  </p><p>BOUGHTON:  I told you so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MURPHY:  She's on point all the time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Alexa knew.</p><p>MURPHY:   I think one thing about Amazon, you know, they do everything but  they're really a logistics also.  So going from Seattle for their regional  headquarters and to have a place over on the East Coast I think would be  very important for them.  So I think you've got -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have five corporations that already have global  headquarters.  </p><p>BOUGHTON:  Absolutely, yes.  We were once a city and now we're multi- corporation community.  And we are 70 miles from New York City.  So we have  all the assets that are here as well.</p><p>So look, we think -- we are a dark horse candidate.  There's no question  about that.  But we think we're a player in this and we're going to take a  shot at this thing.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You're so right that you miss 100 percent of the shots but you  don't take -- that's something that they say a lot in the navy.  </p><p>But I want to ask Mayor Bynum, you know, you were talking about your city  and how it can benefit.  But when you're competing with cities like  Chicago, I know Mayor Emanuel who's already spoken with Jeff Bezos about a  potential move there, companies like Kraft have already planned to move to  there.  How do you compete with cities like that?  </p><p>BYNUM:  Well, I think you compete by being focused as a community on  building the best city that you can.  There are plenty of cities that have  a larger population than we do that we don't think that can compete with us  from a quality of life standpoint and from an access to human capital  standpoint.</p><p>Again, we have the population base in this region working in the industries  that Amazon needs to staff this headquarters.  And beyond that, we have the  quality of life here that really a city many times our size would typically  expect but we have it with the convenience of a city of our size here in  Tulsa.</p><p>So population-base certainly will play a factor and like my colleague from  Danbury, we recognize we are an underdog but we believe that we will be  competitive.  And our goal is that the team at Amazon is both surprised and  impressed when they open our proposal.  </p><p>KELLY:  I think the most important aspects that Amazon is going to look at  is what is the incentive for them especially on the tax side.  So I guess  this goes to both of you guys.  Let's start with G.T. -- what are you guys  willing to give Amazon in a tax incentive way to entice them to come  because we know it's always about the money -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- and they're going to go where the best incentive is for them.  </p><p>BYNUM:  Yes.  We're a big college football state and our head coaches don't  give their play book away to the opposing coach right when a game starts.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>BYNUM:  So we're not going to talk about what our incentives are.  We do  have, thanks to the partnership that we have with the state Oklahoma in  making this proposal, a very good incentive proposal we think that the team  at Amazon is going to be impressed by -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, yes.  I mean it is -- </p><p>BYNUM:  But I don't want to give that away today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's all about taxes.</p><p>I mean Mr. Mayor in Danbury -- I mean look how many companies have moved  out of Connecticut because of Malloy and his taxes.</p><p>BOUGHTON:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean what are you going to do about that?  </p><p>BOUGHTON:  Well, we'll partner with the state of Connecticut, obviously.   Same thing with us, we're not going to spill our popcorn or eat our popcorn  before we see the movie.  But at the end of the day, we think we can  (INAUDIBLE) the right economic incentive in front of these folks to be able  to get them there.</p><p>But it's not all about the money.  I mean look, we are not going to  completely throw ourselves at Amazon.  We want to play a little coy here  too in terms of doing this dance and we love to get them here.  And I think  that's better than just, you know, putting everything on the table at once.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to run for governor against Malloy next time?  </p><p>BOUGHTON:  We're looking very closely at that race and we'll see what  happens there.  We think there's an opportunity and we think it's time that  we make Connecticut great again.  How about that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So if you were to run against Governor Malloy for the  governorship of Connecticut, will you cut taxes?  </p><p>BOUGHTON:  I will eliminate the income tax.  We have a plan to eliminate  the income tax over the next ten years and we're going to bring people back  to Connecticut.  We're going to keep our retirees to stay in Connecticut.   It's going to be the place to be.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I will move to Connecticut if you do that.  I'm looking for a  way out.  I mean come on.  The problem is -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  A lot of people from New York I think will move -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know a couple of people that just bought condos in  Connecticut.  </p><p>KELLY:  Guess what, they can't go to Jersey.  Jersey is getting worst in  taxes -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- so if you do that -- </p><p>GABRIELLE:  And if the state and local deduction is eliminated, yes.   People will be wanting to move to Connecticut.</p><p>BOUGHTON:  And we've been (INAUDIBLE) for eight months.  It's a solid plan.   It's something I think everybody is going to be impressed with.  It's  different and we are the land of steady habits, but we will work it out.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, that's the popcorn you need to spill.  So if you're going to  run, you need those details.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOUGHTON:  We are launching a few details here and there just to show  people a little bit about what's going on.  But again we want to play a  little coy here as well too in that particular arena.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But if you're going to run against Governor Malloy, you've got  to make it known soon, right.  I mean the race is next year.</p><p>BOUGHTON:  Look, Governor Malloy is not running again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p>BOUGHTON:  So it's going to be an open seat.  And we will have some kind of  announcement probably in January, February and see what our intentions are.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  We'll be watching that.  Mayor G.T. Bynum, Mayor Mark  Boughton -- good to see you both.  Thanks very much for coming in.</p><p>BYNUM:  Thank you.</p><p>BOUGHTON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up: Hollywood fired back at Harvey Weinstein -- how  Channing Tatum is taking action against the Hollywood producer next.</p><p>Plus Ford recalls over a million trucks.  We will tell you about the  company's $267 million coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump set to meet with Puerto Rico's governor at the White House  today.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details there -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  What a meeting that's going to be  -- Maria.  Good morning.</p><p>Administration officials say that Trump and Ricardo Rossello will discuss  efforts to rebuild the U.S. territory which was torn apart by Hurricane  Maria.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We will continue  working hand in hand with local areas in all areas of our country that have  been impacted by several natural disasters in recent months.  And as  President Trump has repeatedly said we stand with our fellow citizens, we  are here to help and get them back on their feet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Three million people are still without power and one million don't  have running water since Hurricane Maria struck the island nearly a month  ago.  Concerns about contamination and disease are still growing with  nearly half of Puerto Rico's sewage treatment plants out of service.</p><p>Well, actor Channing Tatum announcing he will no longer develop a film with  the Weinstein Company.  The movie was to be based on a book \"Forgive Me  Leonard Peacock\", about a boy dealing with the aftermath of sexual abuse.   In a statement Tatum calls for an elimination of abuse from creative  culture.  Harvey Weinstein who founded the Weinstein Company is accused of  rape, sexual assault and harassment by dozens of women.</p><p>And even the world's most famous sled-dog race, they did arrive, is prone  to cheating.  The race committee has revealed that someone tried to give  their dogs a boost with the opioid pain reliever, tramadol.  Officials have  refused to name, the musher involved in this.  Whoever it is won't face any  discipline.  Race rules have been revised, so musher's liable for any  future violations.  Nice.  All right.</p><p>And then country music stars paying tributes to the victims of the mass  shooting in Las Vegas last night at the CMT artists of the year show.   Among the stars on hand: Jason Aldean, Keith Urban and Chris Stapleton.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  From Las Vegas to Puerto Rico to Florida and Texas to  Charlottesville and California.  The entire nation is trying to process  these devastating events.  But on this night, one that we usually celebrate  a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human  spirit.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  So no awards were handed out, instead the show was a celebration  of life and the ability to rise above the tragedy -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>CASONE:  Some great performances there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>What did you think of that tribute -- Mike?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I mean it's such a tragedy to see the whole community come and  gather around and pay tribute to them.  I mean what you come to expect  though from the United States of America, we can fight and go back and  forth on different sides of things but when a tragedy comes, it shows how  we can all come together.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>Coming up -- a historic week for Wall Street.  We're breaking down investor  reaction after the Dow closes above 23000 for the first time.  </p><p>And today, of course is the 30th anniversary of Black Monday, 23 percent  selloff in a day for the S&amp;P back then.  And look at this resilience today  in unchartered territory. </p><p>Plus a start-up is promising to help you post better photos online.  We  will talk with the CEO who has raised $11 million in funding.  How it helps  you grow your social media brand.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>What a week on Wall Street -- a record week for stock prices.  The Dow  Jones Industrial Average above 23000 yesterday for the first time ever.   Earnings, of course, driving the gains. </p><p>Joining us right now is Scott Wren.  He's the senior global equity  strategist with Wells Fargo Investment.  Scott -- it is good to see you.   Thank you so much -- </p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT:  Good  to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for joining us.  We are happy you're here today on the 30th  anniversary of Black Monday.</p><p>But look at where we are with this market -- 23000.  What does that mean to  you?  </p><p>WREN:  You know, it's hard to believe it's been 30 years and obviously the  market is very resilient.  We've had lots of pullback.  There's not too  many like that.</p><p>But really for me and for our equity strategy group, you know, 23000 -- it  may be a psychological number, but one thing it tells me is that hey,  stocks are maybe a little bit stretched here.</p><p>I mean let's face it, they are not cheap.  So those kinds of milestones  right now -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want to sell into this.  </p><p>WREN:  Well, you know, we've been in the pullback camp.  I mean it wouldn't  surprise me over next few months we see 6 percent, 7 percent pullback.  You  know, nothing -- nothing big but I think it's about time for that.  I would  argue valuations are stretched as I said.</p><p>You know, we've got the fed hiking rates.  I don't think we are going to  get much out of Washington that's really meaningful over the course of the  next six or nine months, maybe.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think we get a tax deal done this year?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, you know, with mid-terms next year, I think they're going to  pass something but, you know, in an $18 trillion economy you need something  with magnitude to push this thing forward and I don't have a lot of faith  that that's actually going to happen.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And I think the tax -- whatever they do, that'll impact the  Russell 2000 more, right -- the small-cap market because as we look at Dow  23000, these are large multinational corporations that have benefited from  the weaker dollar.</p><p>So IBM yesterday, one of the reasons why they were up so significantly and  their CFO said it themselves, the dollar has been a great tail wind for  them.</p><p>Do you recommend that people should start looking globally elsewhere --  Asia, emerging markets -- to put some capital work given it's lofty over  here in the United States?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, I think that -- when we look at our clients they are  underweight everything international.  So what we've been recommending is  they take a little money off the table on large cap U.S. which is obviously  done very well and put that into some EM or developed international, of  course, those that had big runs this year.</p><p>But I looked a couple of days ago and over the last five years, the S&amp;P is  up 75 percent.  EM -- the NSCI EM index is up 11 percent; 11 or 12 percent.</p><p>So you know, we would argue, I live in a baseball town so, you know, we  were in the last third of the game, you know, eighth inning, maybe one out,  the rest of the world really isn't about the third inning.  So there's some  more baseball to be played here but abroad, the game is a lot earlier.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I want to get your thoughts on the Fed and what President Trump  may make it for his decision.  But also you say that the biggest risk to  the economy right now is the fed decision to do these rate hikes.  So  there's sort of the expectation that one will come in December but the  expectation of three next year not so much.  </p><p>WREN:  I think that the stock market has priced in a December rate hike for  at least six months.  I mean I think that's fine.  The fed, I think, will  take one if the market is going to give it to them which they definitely  will in December.</p><p>I don't think the market believes that three will happen next year.  Our  fixed income team who makes that call is looking for two but there are  certainly competitors of ours on the street that are looking for four.   Three or four in a 2.3 percent growth economy, I think that's a head way.</p><p>KELLY:  And the 10-year treasury is gone at 2.6 percent.  I mean that is  pretty -- that's tightening.  </p><p>WREN:  And to me, you know, and I'm certainly not the bond guy but, you  know, when you raise rate that many times, I mean that 10-year yield is  going to come down.  It's not going to go up.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So Scott -- I mean we've seen a lot of people calling for  pullbacks.  And now this market just slowly grinds higher.  But most of  them come out and say, buy that pullback.  And I believe that's why the  market hasn't seen a pullback because any sort of selloff at all like we  are about to see this morning at the open, people are stepping in to buy  that.  And I think that's -- I don't know how we get the pullback with this  environment.  </p><p>WREN:  You know, that's such a great point because I think, you know,  retail investors are sitting on their hands.  But you have a lot of  institution and asset managers out there.  You know, they have a benchmark  to keep up with or beat if this thing keeps grinding higher.  You know,  they need to be in it.</p><p>And so they're in their buys -- so I would say there's a little bit of  institutional chasing going on and that that mentality and that activity --  that's one of the reasons why we haven't had to pullback.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, here is the reason why I don't think we've had the pullback.   We've seen sector dispersion especially in returns.  So before the  correlation is between every sector north of 70 percent.  Now you're seeing  some sectors even around 35 percent.  So when tech fell, financials stepped  up.  Then health care.</p><p>So do you think that's another reason -- are there sectors investors should  look at in the market?  </p><p>WREN:  You know, there really are because you know, we are way passed the  rising tide lifts all boats.  And so there is dispersion.</p><p>You look at technology versus energy, for instance on a year to date basis  -- there's massive difference.  So we -- we do not think the cycle is over.   We think that -- we want our clients continuing to lean cyclically so we  like industrials, we like financials, we like the consumer discretionary  sector.  we also like health care -- still think that's undervalued.</p><p>So what's what we want them leaning toward.  What we don't want them doing  is getting defensive.  So we are underweight staples.  We are underweight  utilities.  We're also underweight energy which I think is this may  continue to work out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The earnings period has actually been better than expected all  year, right.  </p><p>WREN:  Certainly the first half was.  I think, you know -- we are going to  see 5 or 6 percent maybe this third quarter -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, this quarter.</p><p>WREN:  -- and so, you know, that's obviously toned down from the first  part.  You know, we tell our clients, third quarter earnings, that's what's  happened in the past, you know.  We want them to look forward and this  modest growth, modest inflation environment, I don't think you're going to  see much of a change there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you do with a stock like GE?  You're an industrial guy?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, you know -- right, right.  You know, they are industrials.  I  think they are going to continue.  You know, I think those companies will  benefit from a continuation of this global growth.  And that's been our  theme -- a little bit better growth here, a little bit better growth  internationally.  And I would say if there's a surprise growth-wise it's  probably not in the U.S. it's internationally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  GE reports earnings tomorrow -- that's why I  mention it.</p><p>But Scott -- really good to see you.</p><p>WREN:  Great to see you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>WREN:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scott Wren -- Wells Fargo.</p><p>Coming up, speculation over that next move in the Federal Reserve chair --  that's heating up.  Candidates that President Trump is considering as he  prepares for a meeting with Janet Yellen; that meeting taking place today.   We'll see if we know who the next chairman will be later today.</p><p>And then has political correctness gone too far, the outrage after a school  canceled its Halloween parade.  We will tell you about it straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us this morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday,  October 19th.  Your tapestries right now 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Another market milestone yesterday.  The Dow Jones industrial average  closing above 23,000 for the first time ever.  Hitting the 51st record high  since President Trump took office.</p><p>Earnings from IBM drove some of the games yesterday and the optimism over  the tax reform plan.  Today, the senate could bring tax cuts one step  closer to reality, as they are voting on the budget.  President Trump  tweeted about it this morning saying quote, \"Republicans are going for the  big budget approval today.  First step to a massive tax cuts.  I think we  have the votes.  But who knows?</p><p>Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions in Spain weighing on markets this morning.   Futures indicating a pullback from yesterday's all-time highs.  Dow  Industrials off of the lows, but nonetheless showing a decline of about 90  points.  Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 also in negative territory.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the markets are looking like this.  Similar story  and the FT 100 is down a half of a percent.  As is the CAC quarante in  Paris.  The Dax Index in Germany down three quarters of one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Japan,  as you see there.</p><p>The future of the Fed is in focus.  President Trump will meet with Janet  Yellen later today as questions swirl about the next Fed chair.  We're  taking a look at the possibility of a second term for Janet Yellen this  morning.</p><p>Not built Ford tough enough.  The automaker recalling over a million pickup  trucks Ford issued that could cause the door to swing open while driving.   The models that need to go into the shop, coming up.</p><p>And a disturbing new trend encouraging kids to go missing?  What parents  need to know about the shocking new Facebook game which dares kids to  disappear for days.  Really?</p><p>And then Be Your Own Brand ambassador.  We'll talk to a new company helping  people take their social media game to a whole new level and get paid doing  it.  All that coming up this morning.</p><p>But first this top story this half an hour.  The search for the next  Federal Reserve chair.  President Trump is meeting with Janet Yellen later  today as he nears a final decision on filling the top spot at the central  bank.</p><p>The two will discuss the possibility of nominating her for a second term.   But he may actually decide to move on from Janet Yellen.</p><p>Let's bring in research and bank analyst at Vertical Group, Dick Bove.   Dick, good to see you.  Thanks so much for weighing in here.</p><p>DICK BOVE, RESEARCH AND BANK ANALYST, VERTICAL GROUP:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you looking for from the president on this Fed move?</p><p>BOVE:  Well, I'm hoping very much that he does not reappoint Janet Yellen,  because I see two major problems in the Federal Reserve.</p><p>Over the last few years, which she failed to correct.  The first one is  that she did not blend monetary and regulatory policy.  Now, what does that  mean?  It means as the Fed on the monetary side was producing new money,  the Fed on the regulatory side was forcing that money out of the private  sector and into the Federal Reserve.  In other words, over $2.5 trillion  was taken out of the banking system and put into the Federal Reserve,  because of regulations.</p><p>Now, I went to Washington twice on this issue.  And I said to the  regulatory guys, don't you realize what you're doing to monetary policy  when you do this?  And they said, \"That's not our job to worry about.  All  we're going to care about is safety and soundness.\"</p><p>The second issue though is even more important.  If you took a look at the  Federal Reserve balance sheet, uh, 10 years ago, what you would see is that  currency, what they print, you have in your hands.</p><p>Funds 90 percent or more of the Fed balance sheet.  That's no longer true.   Now, the Fed balance sheet is being funded by bank deposits.  Second, if  you look at the asset side of the Fed balance sheet, you would have seen 10  years ago that about 90 percent of the money was used to buy treasuries.   That's not true anymore either.</p><p>In addition -- in addition, the duration of the assets on the Fed have got  over 56 percent of the assets are 10 years longer.  So, what does long  discussion mean?  It means that 10 years ago, you were using long-term  money, currency, to fund short-term investments.  Today, you're using very  short-term money to fund very long-term investments.  Feds balance sheet is  out.</p><p>KELLY:  So, Dick, it's Kevin Kelly.  So that leaves -- that begs the  question, if you don't believe in Janet Yellen is the next Fed chairperson,  who is the top candidate to take care of the Fed balance sheet, as you're  talking about?  I don't think Kevin Warsh is going to get it, because he's  too much of a hawk.  You have Jerome Powell.  They're talking about him  because he's more dovish.</p><p>Who do you think would be the best for this economy and this market?  </p><p>BOVE:  Well, I mean, unfortunately the guy I like the best and he's already  on the Fed now and he's going to be the fellow who was going to handle bank  supervision.  Because at least he's going to be looking at the structure of  the Fed and he's going to be - if you will hopefully alleviating this  massive short-term long-term situation in terms of the balance sheet.  I  have no idea why the people like John Taylor who had a wonderful  theoreticians have looked at the Fed balance sheet.</p><p>I have no idea whether the guys Warsh have looked at, what the regulatory  side of the Fed has done to monetary policy.  I mean, basically, no one  speaks about these issues.  But they're important.  The Fed balance sheet  is a mess.</p><p>If you are a bank analyst analyzing a bank, go to the Federal Reserve, you  would say this thing is in real trouble.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Speaking of the balance sheet, you're talking about this long  term securities and you suggested that those were mostly mortgages.</p><p>You say that if the banks are willing to replace the Fed and the treasury  and mortgage markets but there'd be little to no impact.  But you indicated  that as unlikely.  And my question is really, why should they step in to  mortgage liquidity?  I mean, it seems like a very risky business when you  look at the past decade.</p><p>BOVE:  Which - I'm sorry.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  You're talking about long-term securities and the Fed balance  sheet and unloading.  One of the things that you had suggested is that if  the banks would replace the Fed and treasury mortgage markets, then there  wouldn't be such an impact.  But I guess my question is, would that even be  a good decision from the banks?</p><p>BOVE:  I didn't make that statement.  What I said was that the Fed should  not be funding long-term assets with short-term money.  And any answer in  the financial industry that does that, generally runs into a significant  amount of difficulty when interest rates go up.  And interest rates are  going up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dick, there's an op-ed in the Journal today.  The Fed chief  America needs.  And it's co-authored by former treasury secretary George  Shultz.  He's suggesting for the president to pick somebody who understands  the economy can grow more than two percent a year.  But he's warning that  the next Fed chair must not make the mistake of more rapid economic growth  for an overheated inflation from economy that needs cooling off.</p><p>He says the Fed that make such a mistake would perpetrate the slow growth,  low productivity stagnant wage economy of the past decade.  So this op-ed  today is basically saying, look, some of these guys don't believe that the  economy can grow more than two percent.</p><p>Do you think it can?</p><p>BOVE:  Oh, absolutely.  I don't think there's any doubt about it,  whatsoever.  I think that if you -- and I'm going to go back to the Fed for  a second.  If you take a look at taking $2.5 trillion, $2.5 trillion out of  the private sector and putting into the Fed, you can see that the type of  stimulus that we were told, we were receiving was not being received.</p><p>On the other hand, however, this whole argument that is made about secular  stagnation in the U.S. economy is, in my view, garbage.  I think that  basically if you get enough buying power in the hands of the American, so  to speak, worker, household, et cetera, you will find that the U.S. economy  can grow much more rapidly than two percent per year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Mike Murphy is here.  And, Mike, remember, in 1984, the  GDP was 7.3 percent.  I'm just saying, after the tax package.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  And now we're down here and  trying to get above three percent.</p><p>But, Dick, we've liked the banks all year.  And now you see they're all  sitting right up in the air recent highs.  I'm wondering, which banks do  you think people can look at and buy?  And also part two of that question,  do the banks need trading revenue to pick up in order to get another like  higher?</p><p>BOVE:  Well, if you're one of the biggest banks in the United States, you  definitely would benefit by seeing trading pickup.  But it's not going to,  because of the change in the structure of the markets.  In other words,  there's too much money going into passive funds versus actively managed  funds which has big impact on trading.</p><p>But I think in the beginning question.  I love Bank of America.  I think  that the company is well behind the curve as a result to the huge problems  that it's had over the past, well, say decade.  And I think that Brian  Moynihan is doing a phenomenally good job in turning it around.</p><p>But I think if you take a look at some of the regional banks, companies  like PNC Financial has shown just the staggeringly a positive result in the  quarter.  It outperformed all of the bigger banks by a mile, so to speak.   And it did so by taking business from the bigger banks.</p><p>So I think that some of the regional banks could be very interesting here.   But as I say two, recommendations would clearly be Bank of America and PNC  Financial.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  And all the banks reported better than expected  earnings in the third quarter, despite of the week trading.  The asset  management business has sort of offset the weakness, I guess, Dick.</p><p>BOVE:  Well, again, we could have a long discussion on that one.  I think  the asset management business is in a lot of trouble right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>BOVE:  Basically, you've got hundreds of billions of dollars moving out of,  if you will, actively managed funds and you've got literally trillions of  dollars moving into passively managed funds and into ETF's.</p><p>On another financial network, you have a very strong spokesperson who get  up and said, stop putting your money into actively managed funds.  It's  costing you too much money.  Put them in passive managed by individual  stocks.  And people are doing that.  And that's having a very bad impact.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dick, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  We'll be watching the  development.  Dick Bove from Vertical there.</p><p>Coming up, safety issues caused Ford Motor to recall more than one million  trucks at a cost of $267 million.  How do you know if your vehicle is  actually on that list?  Next.</p><p>And then a concerning new game on Facebook encouraging kids to disappear.   What parents need to know about this disturbing trend, back in a moment.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New questions in the Russia uranium deal.   Earlier this week, The Hill reported that the Obama administration approved  the controversial deal in 2010, giving Moscow a substantial amount of  uranium, 20 percent.</p><p>The FBI found evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged  in bribery, kickbacks and extortion.  The Hill also says that according to  one eyewitness, Russian officials routed millions of dollars to the U.S.  designed to benefit former president Bill Clinton's foundation, the Clinton  Foundation, during the time that Hillary Clinton served as secretary state.   That report has now been questioned.  President Trump apparently referring  to The Hill report tweeted this this morning.  \"Uranium deal to Russia with  Clinton help and Obama administration knowledge is the biggest story that  the fake media does not want to follow.\"  The president just tweeting that  out a few minutes ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this.  Not built Ford tough enough, huh?  Cheryl Casone  with details and the major recall coming out of Ford Motor this morning.   Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  It's a big one, Maria.  Ford  announcing a recall of its best-selling truck.  The automakers has a  problem with the latch on the side doors on more than one million of its F  series trucks could prevent the doors from opening or closing.  And recall  will cost Ford an estimated $267 million.</p><p>Shares of Ford are lower in the premarket.  Down more than half a percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, Toyota is recalling more than 300,000 Sienna Minivans, because  they can shift out of park and roll away.  Shares of Toyota are up more  than five percent, so far this year.  Two automakers to watch today.</p><p>Well, kids, as young as 14 are going missing for days at the time as part  of a new Facebook game called the 48-hour challenge.  The Sun over written  reports.  The shocking challenge invites kids to hide from their parents  for as long as possible.</p><p>Kids are given points that their frantic parents take the Facebook or  Twitter to sound the alarm for them.</p><p>One mother in the Northern Ireland says their child disappeared and was  found some 55 hours later in a totally different country.</p><p>Well, an elementary school in Massachusetts has decided to cancel the  Halloween costume parade this year.  The school's principal's says in a  letter in part, \"The costume parade is out of our ordinary routine and can  be difficult for many students.  Also, the parade is not inclusive of all  of the students.\"</p><p>Some parents call this move just overly done political correctness.  The  school says Halloween is going to be a black and orange spirit day.</p><p>OK.  And then finally this.  Snap is now in the costumer business.  Just in  time for Halloween.  A little better Halloween story here.  They're  releasing a dancing hotdog costume that will allow you to dress up as  Snapchat's biggest virtual star.  Chief executive Evan Spiegel cost the  hotdog, \"Likely the world's first augmented reality superstar.\"  Saying he  is -- this has been viewed 1.5 billion times.  It's for sale for Amazon for  $79, iF anyone is interested.</p><p>Snap's shares are under pressure in the premarket, by the way.  Not exactly  the big performer since the IPO is down almost one percent, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>No Halloween parade.</p><p>KELLY:  No Halloween parade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You were saying merry Christmas?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I reject black and orange day.  I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I reject it too.</p><p>KELLY:  You can't please -- all of the time.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  What is black and orange spirit, anyway?  What does that mean?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have no idea.</p><p>MURPHY:  Once the kids dress up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your kids love Halloween.</p><p>MURPHY:  They love Halloween.  But they better not think about hiding for  two days.  That go overwhelming.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  The parents should probably would want that, but most not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up next, the big business of social media.   We are checking out the startup.  Helping people become the creative  directors of their own brand online.  That's next.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So stuck on choosing a filter for your latest  Instagram post?  Not to worry.  New startup SelfMade is here to help.  With  social average of 50 million people.</p><p>A team of professional editors, dedicated, creative agent and only a month  to month commitment.  SelfMade will make you #influence, sir, before you  have time to click post.</p><p>Joining us right now is Self-Made founder and CEO, Brian Schechter.  Brian,  it's good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BRIAN SCHECHTER:  It's great to be here, Maria.  Thank you,</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course mike murphy, you are a big supporter and -- </p><p>MURPHY: Big supporter of Brian's SelfMade, fan supporter, investor on Brian  and the team.  I think what they're doing is kind of change the whole  outlook for people who want to build the presence on social media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And one of the things that your company indicates is that  people need to have their own personal brand.  And they want to make it  better.  Tell us how SelfMade works.</p><p>SCHECHTER:  That's exactly right and it's really a part of the new economy  where more and more people need to define themselves whether they are  freelance or an entrepreneur.  They have to set themselves apart in order  to keep up.</p><p>So the way the app works is people take a survey where we learn about their  personal preferences in terms of the images that they want to be sharing  and their goals on social media.</p><p>From there, they get access to a member's only app where they can upload  images.  Those images get routed to professional image specialist.  They do  an edit of the picture.  They come back through the app and then we help  them prepare to share it by sending them through a planner.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we're looking at one picture right now.  This is the picture  of the woman on the beach yet all the people behind her.  And then it was  edited.</p><p>SCHECHTER:  Right.  So that is in line with her personal brand style.  So  she uploaded the original image, gave some instructions and then a team of  editors were able to reformat the image to make it look like it will be  cohesive on her grid on Instagram.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.  Mike, what attracted you about this company?</p><p>MURPHY:  So it's really Brian and his co-founder Zach are -- they are  successful entrepreneurs from the past, so they built businesses.  Brian  built and sold the business.  Zach worked at on Google Docs.  Ran Goggle  Docs for a long time.</p><p>So they have a great background, great pedigree.  And I think they're  really tapping into something that's needed right now, because people --  it's no longer whether or not you want to build a presence.  If you're an  entrepreneur, you need a presence on something like Instagram, 800 million  users out there on Instagram.</p><p>So to find the way to do it correctly.  A lot of people know, they spend  all this time and money on their business and then they throw a picture up,  a selfie up on Instagram, which isn't really doing it justice and that's  where these guys connect.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you mentioned the users on Instagram.  Marketing and  advertising on Instagram is the highly profitable now and can an average  person actually make money on Instagram?</p><p>SCHECHTER:  Yes.  So it's making money on Instagram but it's also boosting  their career.  So we have fitness professionals who want to maintain the  client base or connect with new clients.</p><p>We have florists.  People who run small businesses that want to send  traffic to their personal website.  And just people who recognize that more  and more in today's economy when someone looks them up, they're looking  them up on social and if it's on point and professional, they're more  likely to get a new opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you've been able to raise $11 million in funding so far.  Is  that just for operation?  Tell us where the money goes and whether or not  you're looking for another round.</p><p>SCHECHTER:  Yes.  So we close our series this spring.  First mark the New  York Venture Capital from led around.  And basically what's going on is  we're seeing this profound demand that people have to be able to get  support like Michael is describing, to build their personal brand.</p><p>So we're really onto something where our member base now while we've been  in private data has over 50 million followers on Instagram combined.   They're paying between 50 and $150 a month and this is all been while we've  still been in private data.  We're gearing up to launch publicly later this  year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think the customer then, the customer base is an  entrepreneur or as an individual?  Who's the customer?</p><p>SCHECHTER:  It's entrepreneurs.  It's people who have a side gig that where  they want to build to make the incremental income.  Again, people in the  fitness profession and beauty profession.  It's consultants, florists, real  estate agents, you name it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know this market incredibly well, Mike.</p><p>MURPHY:  Well, I'd like to think I do.  Yes.  And I think it's a great  opportunity, as our funds looks for investment.  We talk all the time here  on the show about how small businesses are going to change the landscape  and disrupt the economy as we know it, of the bigger, older companies.</p><p>And I think the company like SelfMade.  Brian and his team can really help  fuel that and that's where I see the opportunity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff.  Good luck.  We'll be watching.  Thanks for  joining us, Brian.</p><p>SCHECHTER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brian Schechter, Mike Murphy.</p><p>We will take a break.

That's right here next hour, \"Mornings with Maria.\"  Stay with us.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.

It was the  51st record close since President Trump took office. Earnings from IBM and  others drove the gains yesterday and optimism over the tax cuts says  underpinned this market for certainly since the beginning of the year.  We  could be one step closer to tax cuts today.  The senate is gearing up for  its budget vote later today.</p><p>President Trump calling this a once a lifetime opportunity.  White House  Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says, \"The focus is on the  middleclass, even though the wealthy will benefit as well.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The fact is the  priority again remains that middleclass Americans are the ones that are  most impacted.

Spain is moving to suspend Catalonia  independence.  Futures right now pulling back from the all-time highs  yesterday.  Dow Industrials set to open down about 100 points today.   NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 also weaker and remember, today is 30 years from Black  Monday, October 19th when market dropped 23 percent on the S&amp;P 500 in a  day.  In Europe this morning, the major indices look like this and again  weakness here, the FT-100 down a half percent, the CAC quarante is down  two-thirds of a percent.  In Asia overnight, markets close mostly low with  the exception of Japan which was up almost half a percent.  Meanwhile, a  brand-new terrorism threat to report.  The Department of Homeland Security  is warning that ISIS is plotting another 9/11-style attack.  Details on the  terrifying plan aiming to inflict mass casualties. </p><p>It is deadline day.  Cities across the country have until midnight tonight  to submit their bids for Amazon second headquarters.  We'll show what  Chicago is doing to try to get Amazon there coming up.  Apple has not even  announced its self-driving car but now there are pictures.  We've got the  details of what Apple is doing in that area.  And NFL Commissioner Roger  Goodell still in the news, refusing to take a tougher stance on anthem  protests, nobody is happy with Goodell's comment, even Colin Kaepernick, he  fired back and he didn't even say anything.  He fired back without opening  his mouth.  All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk  all about it, Fox News Correspondent Lea Gabrielle is here, Kelly and  Company managing partner Kevin Kelly, and Rosecliff Capital CEO, Mike  Murphy.  Great to see you. </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Good morning.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  And what recently just happened  actually Verizon posted their earnings before the market, it's interesting  they actually are up off of it, they added some net subscribers.  Last week  we saw AT&amp;T reported, they were down five percent the most since 2009.  So  this is actually showing that's a tale of two different companies that's  happening  I mean, you have so much promotion in the market, free HBO, or  free Netflix, you know, between the different carriers.  So it's going to  be interesting to see what they say on their earnings call and what  guidance they can get going forward because acquired -- remember, Yahoo!</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  They acquired Yahoo! but Verizon shares were down  earlier.</p><p>KELLY:  We'll see what the earnings do to the stock today but certainly  earnings is the story driving this market, and yesterday throw it to a new  market milestone.  The Dow Jones Industrials average closed above the  23,000 mark for the first time ever yesterday.  Though Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin is warning that all of those gains could be in jeopardy.   Should Congress fail to pass tax reform?  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF TREASURY:  There is no question  that the rally in the stock market has base into it, reasonably high  expectations of us getting tax cuts and tax reform done.  And also, has  base into it, optimism on regulator relief which they have begun to see and  there's expectations.  So I think to the extent we get the tax deal done  the stock market will go up higher but there's no question in my mind if we  don't get it done you're going to see a reversal of significant amount of  these gains. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Senate is expected to vote today on that budget that would  allow the chamber to pass a tax bill with just 51 votes.  That's called  reconciliation, instead of the 60 needed for major legislation.  The  president just tweeted about it this morning and here is what he said,  Republicans are going for the big budget approval today.  First step toward  massive tax cuts, I think we have the votes, but who knows?  Uh-oh.   Joining us right now is former Reagan budget director David Stockman.  And  David, you've been here before during the Reagan years.  You were able to  pass an incredible tax reform in that same interview that Treasury  Secretary Mnuchin said that the gains will be in jeopardy.  He said there's  an absolute guarantee that a tax overhaul will be signed into law by end of  this year, reasonable timetable?  </p><p>DAVID STOCKMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET:  No.  He  said that about eight times now, first it was May then it was August, then  it was October.  Really, I think the guy is clueless.  I think the notion  that we're going to have a big, big tax cut is a pipe dream.  They can't  pay for it and we're in a different environment today than they were 1981.   1981, the debt was only 940 billion, it was 30 percent of GDP, there was  plenty of room to have a giant tax cut that was paid for by borrowing.  Today, they have to find pay-fors, loopholes, base-broadeners, they can't  find any, even the state and local tax savings which allegedly was 1.3  trillion over 10 years is falling by the wayside day by day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't believe --</p><p>STOCKMAN:  So I think they're going to end up with no tax bill or one that  is so modest or so minor that it will have very little impact on the  economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't -- you don't believe Treasury Secretary Mnuchin  when he says that growth will happen as a result of lower taxes and that  will partly pay for this?  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No, I don't believe that for a minute, because they're not  cutting taxes on marginal rates that are high already.  We have a 70  percent marginal rate in 1981.  The top rate today is 39.6 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  And just said we're going to keep the fourth bracket, we're not  cutting it at all.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike?  Mike Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  To clarify, do you believe we need a tax cut and they just can't  find the place to get -- come from?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good -- that's good question.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  I absolutely believe we need a payroll tax cut that will take  the burden off 160 million payroll tax taxpayers particularly in the middle  and lower end that are getting hit for 15-1/2 percent employer, employee.   That's the job killer.  That's the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about corporate rate?  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  The corporate rate is --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the pass-through?  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  It will be a great -- the corporate rate and pass-through would  be a great boon, a windfall for Wall Street.  It is not going to lead to  any more jobs or any more growth in the United States because jobs have  gone overseas for lower labor costs.  Let me give one example.  IBM had  zero employees in India in 1993, it's got 130,000 in India today, more than  the U.S. not because of a, you know, 35 percent statutory rate but because  they can hire people to work on, you know -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the bulk of this reform package just supposed to go  towards small business.  I mean, you're not saying that small business, the  guy who owns the hardware store on Main Street has employees overseas.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  I'm saying the corporate rate cut is $2 trillion going from  35 to 20.  The big companies that put the jobs overseas aren't going to  bring them back.  Everybody who gets more after tax cut will --</p><p>KELLY:  But David --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about smaller companies,  </p><p>KELLY:  But they're already not paying that tax -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're not paying that, absolutely right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  So when you're saying it's a windfall the net effect of tax rate is  27 percent for the S&amp;P 500, they're already, you know, shifting operations  to -- </p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't think G.E. paid any taxes.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No, no, no, no, no. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  I agree with that.  IBM's effective tax rate is 11 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  that's exactly right.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  But when we lower taxes on Wal-Mart, they're not going to make  any more stores or hire any more people.  </p><p>KELLY:  No.  They're going to reinvest in their online business and bulk  that up because they got to compete against -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>STOCKMAN:  They're going to pay a higher -- they're going to pay a higher  dividend, they're going to buy back more stock.  This is just a bonanza for  Wall Street because the paid corporate tax is paid for by investors, it  does not get laid onto labor or anything else.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I want to ask about this thought the Reagan administration was  very good in public messaging and everything that it did.  You know,  Secretary Mnuchin said this warning to Congress that you could essentially  blow up the stock market if you fail to pass taxes.  Is that political  posturing, is that a public messaging campaign?  What's your perspective on  --</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, he's right.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  -- bigger impact.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  He is right but this is -- this whole stock market run-up has  been a pipe dream about stimulus and a big tax cut that could never happen  --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it's not just a pipe dream.  Come on, David.  We're talking  $5.3 trillion in market value, you're calling that a pipe dream?  You think  that's just a coincidence?  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.  Because I was talking to an audience 30 years ago today  and while he was talking the stock market went down the equivalent of 5,000  Dow points.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a totally different moment in time.  One of the reasons  the stock market is up is because of earnings performance.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No, it isn't.  No, it isn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Earnings were up 14 percent in the first quarter and 11 percent  in the second quarter. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  That is -- I would have to say, I really challenge that because  that is only basically the pig coming through the python.  Earnings today  are no higher than they were in the middle of 2014.  Three years earnings  went down because of the deflation of oil and material deflation, things  come back up, they're back where they were three years ago, the stock  market is up 45 percent over the same period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Wow.</p><p>MURPHY:  But -- hold on, when you say that you use those statistics, you're  talking broadly, there are specific companies that actually have real  growth that have shown huge growth since 2014.  So to say it's a pipe dream  and pigs and python like the market is priced, where it is priced.  Whether  it goes upward --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  The market is -- the market is totally irrational.  The  market is --</p><p>MURPHY:  But it's not more irrational today than it was 30 years ago or 20  years ago or 10 years ago, right?</p><p>KELLY:  We had the 50-50, remember?  They trade high multiples back then.   You had coke trading at 50 times earnings.  I mean, this is -- this is only  the same story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you think this is all a house of cards. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well, I do, because in the nine months before the crash, 30  years ago, interest rates went up from seven percent to 10 percent in nine  months.  It caused a tremendous shock in the market that took a little  while to develop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But interest rates are not going up 10 percent anytime soon. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No, no, no, no, no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anytime soon.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  It doesn't -- relatively speaking, that's a 30 percent gain.   OK?  Interest rates are going up today and they will be for the next year  or two years, four years because the Fed has told you, we are shrinking our  balance sheet, we're draining cash, they're doing it right now, starting  this month, by the year from now they're going to be draining 600 billion  at an annual rate and that is going to cause yields around the world to  rise.  The whole market is priced on low yields, it's priced on stock  buybacks, it's priced on junk bonds out of control and all of that is going  to show -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That can mess this up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  They could shock it but they telegraphed it well, so we've seen --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  Even Janet Yellen said, we're not going to normalized rates.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Also said they'll be data independent.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KELLY:  But the market has -- </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  They have to raise rates, they have to drain the liquidity,  they have to shrink their balance sheet because they're trying to get ready  for next crisis and get their --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you -- what do you attribute the 3.1 percent GDP? </p><p>STOCKMAN:  What do I -- I don't think there is any 3.1 percent --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We got a 3.1 percent GDP two weeks ago.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  I mean, for one quarter --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we got at the quarter -- we got it the -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>STOCKMAN:  No.  No.  The average GDP growth for the last couple years has  been plus or minus two percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we -- OK.  But we got a 3.1 percent GDP, I'm just saying.   I mean, do you not think things are getting better?  Do you not think there  is fundamental strength in the backdrop --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  I think we're a hundred months into this expansion.  The third  longest in history, there are headwinds all around the world mainly the  central banks are going to go in Q.T., quantitative tightening in a  sequence over the next year three or four years fundamentally different  than the last three years. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  But they're doing that in expanding economies, you're looking  at the global GDP going up.  So yes, they can tighten it.  If they don't  they tightened, they're not doing their job because the economies are  getting more health, they have to tighten into that so there's not  irrational exuberance (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your biggest problem with the tax plan?  What's your  biggest --</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Where I disagree with you is I don't believe the law of supply  and demand has been repealed.  And when the central banks are draining  cash, that means the demand today for the whole -- all of the -- there's 20  trillion of bonds and other securities in the portfolio of central banks.   If they drop that by a few trillion dollars, it will fundamentally on the  margin affect the yield.  And then the frontrunners, the smart guys on Wall  Street will say the central banks are selling, they're not buying.  I'm  going to start selling what they're selling.  We're going to get the same  phenomena on the down that we had  on the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's your biggest problem with this tax plan?</p><p>STOCKMAN:  My biggest problem is it targets the wrong tax.  Today the  income taxes are rich man's levy of the 1.5 trillion income tax collected  in the most recent year, four percent, six million out of 150 million  taxpayers paid 60 percent.  So if you're going to cut income taxes, you're  cutting taxes for the rich.  I don't necessarily object to that but it  isn't possible politically, and so, therefore, they got their own tax. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But 50 percent of the people don't pay any tax. </p><p>STOCKMAN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right?  And then you got the standard deduction that gone to 12  percent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN:  If you take someone at the median income 59,000 a year, with  standard deduction, they are raising taxes in that outline by 38 percent on  that household.  So the point is, nobody on the income tax side is going to  benefit big except the top and we don't need it.  What we do need is a  payroll tax cut for the minimum wage person who's out there having a --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you say we don't need it, we've had a 1-1/2 percent growth  story for the last eight years.  I mean, under two percent, what do you  mean we don't need it?</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The rich pay -- the 10 percent of the top earners pay 80  percent of the tax.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.  And they don't need it because they've had the biggest  specter of the bonanza in the history of mankind and the history of  mankind.  We have had a boom, we have a bubble in the stock market like  never before, the rich people have gotten all that.  If they need incentive  to invest they got incentive coming out that, you know -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But he's saying this is a middle-class tax.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  It isn't.  It's a lie.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Twelve percent, 25 percent, 35 percent.  </p><p>STOCKMAN:  Yes.  That's a lie.  It depends on where they put the brackets.   They didn't even say.  These people are total fakes.  I've never seen  anything that was as content-free as substance-less as this nine pager that  came out.  Remember what happened in the Reagan time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>STOCKMAN:  We put out our plan in February, our tax bill in March, the  budget passed in April and May, they were writing the tax bill in June,  Reagan signed it August 13, on September 13th -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, David.  September 13th.  David Stockton joining us.   We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A top U.S. security chief is warning terror  groups are planning a major tactic on the scale of 9/11.  Cheryl Casone  with the details now.  Cheryl?  Wow.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Really, this is something  else, Maria.  Acting homeland security secretary Elaine Duke said it is  clear that ISIS and other terror groups are planning to take down planes as  they in to carry out another massive attack. Then she also said that terror  groups have been using knife and van attacks to keep their members engaged.</p><p>Well, a video shows what appears to be on of Apple's self-driving cars as  they reportedly are testing out the technology, they never confirmed it but  this Lexus SUV has a roof full of sensors, radar units, and cameras.  Apple  has been pretty secretive about the self-driving car project but the  company did get a permit from the California DMV to test self-driving cars.   That was earlier this year.  Shares of Apple up about 38 percent so far  this year.</p><p>Well, OK.  Let's see some baseball.  The Dodgers are only one win away from  the World Series but the Chicago Cubs are not ready to surrender.  They did  what they had to do last night in a do-or-die game four.  Javier Baez hit  two homeruns leading the Cubs to a 3-2 victory.  So there will be a game  five tonight at Wrigley Field, L.A. leads the series three games to one.   And then, of course, let's get to the American League.  New York Yankees'  rookie Aaron Judge a hero again last night, his third inning double giving  the Yanks a 2-0 lead, then at the seventh inning, fellow baby bummer Gary  Sanchez smashed a solo homer.  Yankees beat the Astros five to nothing,  nada.  Series going back to Houston.  The Astros won the first two games,  Yanks are one win away from their 41st American League (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>Well, tensions were high during Attorney General Jeff Sessions at Senate  testimony yesterday but a much needed lighter moment has gone viral.  Here  is Senator Ben Sasse and what he sad to say after Sessions traded words  with Senator Al Franken over his allegations about Russia.  Just watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BEN SASSE (R), NEBRASKA:  There was some drama there, a sort of added  to the drama and distracted you for a minute.  I was paying enough  attention there that I dumped to Dr. Pepper on Senator Cruz.  So that's  what was distracting us on this side of the dice</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  He did.  OK.  So Senator Cruz sent out a tweet to his office,  please place a picture of @BenSasse above the @drpepper fridge in our  lobby.  He is now cut off.  Remember, Dr. Pepper, a Texas brand.  Sasse  later replied to one Twitter user, what appears to be a reference to -- of  old conspiracy theory about Cruz's father that at the time Donald Trump  revived during the Republican primary.  I was wearing my Lee Harvey Oswald  -- was framed t-shirt.  Sasse was asked on Twitter if this spill was an  accident, he reapplied, no comment.  But it really did happen.  He -- they  keep saying, dump the Dr. Pepper (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>KELLY:  Well -- and Ted Cruz --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I light moment.</p><p>KELLY:  Ted Cruz actually then posted a photo of the zodiac killer-like  logo.  So we played into this whole thing, it was crazy. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up.  Not standing up for  the national anthem.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell under fire this  morning again from both sides for not taking a stronger stance on the  league's ongoing protest.  We'll talk to former NFL stars right here next.   Get their take on the controversy.  Plus, markets looking at the sell-off  at the opening of trading after hitting fresh new highs yesterday.  NASDAQ  president Nelson Griggs will weigh in on whether technology stocks and the  optimism could drive more record territory.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  City leaders across North America are going to  great lengths to attract Amazon's new headquarters, submitting their  pitches ahead of tonight's deadline.  Jeff Flock is in Chicago with the  very latest on all of the extraordinary bids, Jeff.  Over the years.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  It's amazing.  I come to you,  Maria, this morning from the renovated lobby, I thought it was once the  world's largest post office building in Chicago, curiously enough built for  the Amazon to this day because of the mail order business of Montgomery  Ward and Sears.  You know, we got a drone flying overhead and it kind of  shows you the enormity of this potential site of the Amazon HQ2, massive  building, 2.7 million square feet and it's just what Amazon need is a real  big building.  Of course, this is not alone in its pitch.  If we put up the  map with little dots of all of the cities and towns that have made pitches  and that are making pitches today, we wouldn't be able to see the map  actually.  That's just a small number of all the people out there.  </p><p>Of course, the prize is huge, we're talking 50,000 potential jobs with  average compensation of $100,000, amazing.  $5 billion in potential  investment from Amazon.  So it is a big prize, places like Chicago, Atlanta  is mentioned as a key one as well, Boston, of course, speculation is  rampant but who knows.  Here in Chicago as we said, this building, Maria,  was built as we said back in the '30s for Amazon, for the Amazons.  The  Sears and Montgomery Ward, so it would be fitting if Amazon was to choose  this.  It has all the things that Amazon wants a metropolitan area, public  transportation, the rest, close to a big population center but, of course,  a lot of places have all of that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's true.  And they all want that 50,000 jobs, that  this headquarters will bring.  Jeff, thank you.  We'll be watching.  Jeff  Flock in Chicago.  Markets this morning are pulling back, we're expecting a  lower opening for the broader averages.  Take a look, we're back at the  lows of the morning down 115 points on the Dow, 45 points lower in the  NASDAQ, of course, this morning, we got a weak showing but this after  yesterday is huge performance, the Dow Jones Industrials average closed  above 23,000 for the first time ever yesterday.  As investors put their  confidence behind technology stocks among others.  IBM was one of the big  drivers.  Joining us right now is the president of the NASDAQ Stock  Exchange, Nelson Griggs.  Nelson, it's good to have you on the program.   Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>NELSON GRIGGS, PRESIDENT, NASDAQ STOCK EXCHANGE:  Great to be here, Maria.   Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there must be a lot of momentum there in NASDAQ with the  technology rally, the NASDAQ composite is up 23 percent so far this year.   What do you think is going on? </p><p>GRIGGS:  Well, I think what you have here is the investors clearly want to  purchase growth stocks right now, the companies, the -- sort of larger  NASDAQ technology companies are delivering in terms of revenue, in terms of  user growth and we've also seen a tremendous performance in the NASDAQ  technology, IPOs this year.  So all in all you've got a great backdrop  where investors love the growth rate. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your -- what's your take on this Silicon Valley story  that is propping up, Silicon Valley guys want to have their own exchange,  in Silicon Valley they say that it's going to be a long-term investing and,  you know, the current exchanges are encouraging short-term trading. </p><p>GRIGGS:  Well, I would say there is a lot in the long-term exchange  proposal that we would agree with.  And I think -- my primary job is to  speak with our 2700 companies on NASDAQ, and there certainly is a desire, a  need for communication with investors to be more long-term focus.  It's a  hard thing to accomplish, so you have to look at it from the company side  but also the investor side and there is definitely a middle ground to reach  here. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Nelson, I think it's pretty interesting you bring that up  because I know NASDAQ has their private market that actually helps, shares  of private companies go back-and-forth but what I'm more interested in is  your leadership when it comes to the blockchain technology and what's  happening.  I mean, if we go overdue the Nordic region, NASDAQ has the only  listed ETN's when it comes to Bitcoin, Etherum, and then we saw you just  recently got a patent when it came to the blockchain technology.  Can you  talk to us about how you think about cryptocurrencies and blockchain? </p><p>GRIGGS:  Sure.  So we have a very large effort internally, a four-block  chain because if you think there's a transformative technology and where we  look at is -- a couple arias, one, when you think about tracking a share as  of who is from investor to investor, that is a -- today a very antiquated  process and there is great opportunity to bring that to not only how stocks  are traded and tracked which we are doing today in a private market but  also how that could focus on how stocks appear in trade.  So I think there  is a lot of opportunity, we're not -- when we get cryptocurrencies, we do  think there's opportunity there as well but we are looking at a very --  little more costly. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, Mike Murphy.  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Hey, Nelson.  Just quickly.  I -- you're standing in front of a  Mongo sign for the IPO.</p><p>GRIGGS:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  So what's the -- how do you get more of the large unicorn  companies to list to come to the public market.  I'm sure it's a point that  you're focusing on.  How do you do it? </p><p>GRIGGS:  Yes.  Well, first off, we do feel very firmly that a company  should only go public when they're ready to go public.  So the fact that  there's a lot of attention played on, the unicorns taking longer to come to  come to the market, it's necessarily a bad thing because it has to be  prepared when they come.  And that's why we do have the NASDAQ private  market but at the same time we do think that the regulatory aspect of the  overall framework needs to be looked at more closely or last eight years  there's been more and more regulations piled upon companies listed  companies that we do believe could be a moment in time here to have some  progression in terms of how we look at our company. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nelson, great to see you.  Thanks so much, sir. </p><p>GRIGGS:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nelson Griggs joining us there.  President at the NASDAQ.   Still ahead, taking the sideline, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell facing  heat this morning for not taking a strong enough stance on kneeling during  the national anthem.  Former NFL stars will weigh on the ongoing  controversy right here.  And then earnings in focus on Wall Street.   Verizon shares right now up two percent.  That's a Dow component.  That's  going to be a help on the upside for the Dow after beating expectations on  revenue in the third quarter.  Earnings per share were in line, investors  reacting to revenue growth.  We're breaking down the numbers, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, October 19th.   30 years from Black Monday.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the  East Coast.  The rally rolls on, the Dow Jones Industrials average above  23,000 yesterday for the first time ever. Hitting the 51st record-high  since President Trump took office.  Amazing momentum.  Earnings from IBM  drove the gains yesterday amid optimism over tax reform.  Today the Senate  could bring us one step closer to tax cuts, President Trump tweeted about  it this morning saying this, Republicans are going for the big budget  approval today, first step towards massive tax cuts.  I think we have the  votes, but who knows.  </p><p>Meanwhile, markets are pulling back this morning.  Geopolitical tensions in  Spain are weighing on markets but the Dow Jones Industrial average expected  to pull back from that all-time high yesterday.  Down about 100 points  rights now.  NASDAQ down 41.  In Europe, similar story, markets down across  the board, the European indices are down between two-thirds of a percent  and one percent as we speak.  And in Asia overnight, markets mostly lower  as well with the exception of Japan which was up a  fraction.  </p><p>Earnings certainly the story on Wall Street once again.  Verizon shares in  the spotlight and the stock is up this morning two percent after Verizon  beat revenue expectations with its third-quarter numbers.  We're breaking  down those numbers coming up.  Amazon moving in, the technology titan is  taking up retail space at Kohl stores.  We'll have a first look at that new  partnership.  </p><p>And Navy jet training under growing scrutiny this morning after deadly  accident.  How the Navy is working to fix the problems.  We are on it this  morning.  But first, outrage on the field.  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell  refusing to take a tougher stance against national anthem protesters  yesterday saying that the players should stand but they won't be forced to  do so. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER, NFL:  Everyone should stand for the national  anthem.  That's an important part of our policy.  It's also an important  part of our game that we all take great pride in.  And it's also important  for us to honor our flag and to our country and we think our fans expect us  to do that.  The fact is that we have about a half a dozen players that are  protesting.  We hope and we're going to continue to work to try to put that  at zero.  That's what we'd like to do.  But we want to make sure that we're  understanding what the players are talking about and that's complex.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Patriotic fans and the president were not happy with Goodell's  decision after the news conference.  President Trump tweeted at the NFL, he  said this, too much talk not enough action, stand for national anthem.   Let's bring in former NFL safety Burgess Owens along with former NFL  linebacker, Colin Allred and former NFL safety and the Brewer Group  executive chairman, portfolio manager, Jack Brewer.  Good to see you,  everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  This is an  important conversation.</p><p>BURGESS OWENS, FORMER NFL SAFETY:  Than you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me kick it off with you, Colin.  Your reaction to  yesterday's events.</p><p>COLIN ALLRED, FORMER NFL LINEBACKER:  You know, I actually want to give  Roger Goodell some credit because I think that he has resisted pressure  from President Trump and he has brought the players and the owners together  and created a dialogue about how the league can be a positive actor in the  space moving forward.  I think that's the right thing to do, so I actually  want to give him some credit and this is coming from someone who is part of  the 2011 lockout when the owners and Goodell locked us out.  So I actually  want to give him a little bit of credit here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jack, what do you think?  </p><p>JACK BREWER, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, BREWER GROUP:  I totally agree.  I think  this is the situation where you got six players, 99.9 percent of players in  the National Football League stand each and every time that national anthem  comes on.  So we can't make this into something that it's not I think the  conversation really needs to start moving towards the solutions.  The  National Football League and its players have always backed this country,  we represent this country in my opinion very well.  We're heroes in our own  rights.  No, we're not military men and women in service, men and women but  we represent communities all across this country that are struggling.  </p><p>You know, we represent kids, we're the voices for some of the youth that,  you know, have so many elements and problems in America.  So we need to  start talk about this, I said it time and time again let's go sit down with  the president, you know, let's get, you know, let's fill the White House  with, you know, African-American players and let's have these conversations  because this country needs to heal right now and that's the most important  thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, should this be done on the football field?  I  mean, Burgess, how do you see it?  </p><p>OWENS:  I wrote a book recently called, Liberalism or How to Turn Good Men  into Whiners, Weenies, and Wimps.  And that's what we see with the NFL  right now.  Let me tell you one thing we have -- our responsibility as men,  is make sure young boys understand that they have every single opportunity  in the world and this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.   We have millionaires, we have people across with CEOs, black president and  he would talk about having a conversation, the conversation would be, what  has Democratically Party done for black community?  Why is that we have 83  percent of black teen males unemployed, 75 percent of black boys in  California not reading standards?  </p><p>This conversation is not about our president, it's not about the white NFL,  it's about black men standing up, going to these communities and fighting  back on these ideologies that's killing us literally for decades.  Who has  the guts to do that?  That's what it comes down, who has the courage to  stand against the black elitists, not the white people, the black elitists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I understand that but -- I mean, the issue, I mean, do you have  to -- do you have to do that to the American flag?  Do you have to do that  on the football field?  I mean, let's face it, Jack, the reason that, you  know, the players, all of you have the right to protester is because of the  American flag and the constitution and the freedom that this country  enjoys. </p><p>BREWER:  And Maria, most people agree with you.  I agree with you.  I will  stand for the flag too.  I think, you know, it goes back to the reality  that 99.9 percent of players are standing up for the flag, only six players  actively stand up against the flag.  Now when the president made those  statements you saw a league lashed out against that, but that had nothing  to do with the flag.  It really took us off topic.  So I totally agree with  Burgess.  Our black leaders are the first to be blamed because we need more  -- first off, we need more youth leaders, we need more younger people  coming to the forefront and actually talking about solutions to these  problems, and you're right, actually, the president ran on most of these  things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p>BREWER:  We need -- we need jobs, you know, we have double the unemployment  rate as other races in our country, you know, we need health care, we have  issues with our home (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, somewhere along the line, the argument, you know, the  debate changed as far as what we're standing for and what we're sitting  for.  I mean, we're talking about the American flag and the freedoms that  we all enjoy because of our hardworking and courageous men and women who go  and fight for war, Colin.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ALLRED:  One of our freedoms is the right to express ourselves.  And I  think that the players have that right and I think whether or not we all  agree about each individual player's decision.  I do think we as Americans  should agree about their right to freedom of expression.  And their right  to express themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- you're right about that.  Yes.</p><p>OWENS:  Let me say this.  They have a right but there's not -- they don't  have a right doing the work time to do so.  If that's the case, the message  basically comes -- that's coming out of this is that -- listen, guys, you  can choose to come to work or not, you decide not to come to work, that's  OK.  We have parameters, at businesses the way business work, they put --  they put stranded parameters around the employees because it's about the  brand and there's no company in this -- in this -- in this country that  allows the employees to dictate basically how their companies are going to  be run.  It's done by leadership and at this point, we need -- black men  need to know when you come to work, you have discipline, you have authority  and you need to either tie the line or know these consequences (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>BREWER:  I agree with that, Burgess, but to a point I think, you know, the  national anthem shouldn't be considered a part of football game, these guys  should be there to play their sport, they should respect the national  anthem and if they don't want to -- if they want to participate, we take  the cameras off of them.  We need to stop showing the world these guys  kneeling when you take the cameras off of that and focus it on the football  field.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point.  </p><p>BREWER:  But I -- but I don't -- but I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's a ton of cameras there, you're not going to be able  to not show it. </p><p>BREWER:  Yes.  I just think we're showing -- we're making into a bigger  issue than it actually is.  We got -- remember, 99.9 percent of players  stand up and we can't -- we can't deny that fact.  We need to go back  again.  Let's sit down with this president and talk about it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Shouldn't they have handled this differently from the get-go?   I mean, when Colin Kaepernick first got on his knee rather than just  letting it go, maybe that's the time to rather than turning it into  something about President Trump.  </p><p>OWENS:  Yes.  What I don't understand is that, during that time there was  an election going on, and we have to be honest, guys, at that time, there  was a need to have a black base energized and so what Colin did pretty much  is focus on the bad things that police were doing and that is -- that's a  whole conversation we need to have.  At the end of the day, it was about  energizing black vote.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ALLRED:  I disagree entirely with that.  I just got to say, Maria, I  disagree with that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.  Tell us why.  Go ahead, Colin. </p><p>ALLRED:  I think that the players who decided -- well, I think the players  who have decided to take a knee take this very seriously and I think they  are -- I know some of the guys who have done this and they are thoughtful  guys who are taking a stand for what they believe in.  And I don't think  that it's about the black vote, I don't think -- some kind of lack of black  leadership, I think that they believe strongly in this and they believe  that they are standing up for what they believe in and they want to  represent their communities and where they come from.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about the way viewers have reacted \"Monday Night  Football\" ratings have dropped to a new low, the Colts-Titans game drew an  average of roughly eight million viewers, that was down 18 percent -- 18- 1/2 percent from the previous week's game.  I mean, Burgess, do you think  that tonight's game between the Chiefs and the Raiders will reverse the  downward trend or are we are going to see viewers react negatively to the  players doing their politics on the field?  </p><p>OWENS:  Well, I think the last time -- that was a very good point, these  players truly do believe in what they're doing, here is -- here is a  reason, why do they believe this?  It's because we have a black  entertainment -- a network that's pushing this anti-American, anti-flag,  anti-white scenario, and this -- and this been on purpose guys.  15 years  we've been hearing this.  So these kids coming out, they truly do not  believe in our country think everything is going wrong.  There are people  right now, listen to BET, they still do not know that hands up don't shoot,  it was a lie.  Still, don't know that because they have not been told the  truth.  </p><p>So, there is a focused energy by this -- by the left, to get our -- to get  our race upset, doing the things we're doing right now and not believing in  our country and that's why the flag has to be one place we come together  and say, listen, guys, we can disagree, we can figure out how to make this  happen but the flags won't play as we stand together to recognize our  country, the greatest place in history of mankind.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree with that.  I agree with that.</p><p>BREWER:  Yes. Amen to that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BREWER:  I mean, we all know we have issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to agree with that, Colin.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREWER:  We have to get over them.  We have to get over them.</p><p>ALLRED:  I agree with the sentiment that we are the greatest country.  I  would disagree that it has anything to do with BET or the business,  anything to do with some kind of feeling on the left.  I think that the  black players feel like they need -- they have been ignored by both  Democrats and Republicans and they're trying to get a message out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think -- do you think this is working?  Do you think  standing -- getting to the knee is working in terms of impacting the issues  that you are upset with?  </p><p>ALLRED:  I think that we are having a conversation about this right now  because players started to take a knee.  I think all of its country people  are having conversations that they might not be having.  And sometimes  having uncomfortable conversations is a part of making progress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good point.</p><p>BREWER:  What we need.</p><p>ALLRED:  And I think that's something that's been initiated by this. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  Great --</p><p>BREWER:  Amen, Colin.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great conversation, Colin, Burgess, Jack.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ALLRED:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for talking about the issues of the day.</p><p>OWENS:  Thank you, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.  We'll see you soon, gentlemen.  Thank you.   Coming up.  General Electric eyes major cost-cutting.  The Wall Street  Journal highlighting some of the excessive spending at the company  including former CEO Jeff Immelt flying an empty jet next to his jet as a  backup during his 16-year tenure when he travels.  Just in case he's got  mechanical failures.  Stuart Varney will give us his take on the future of  G.E. next.  And then step aside Amazon, the technology-titan moves in  Kohl's stores across the country.  Our first look at the Amazon experience.   Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An unlikely tie-up between two major retailers  finally begins.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of The New York Stock  Exchange with the details.  What a day yesterday was, a little different  open today, huh, Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right.  And so,  we're looking to the downside.  But what records we keep setting, I mean,  they'll just keep (INAUDIBLE) I guess.  Taking a look at some of our movers  this morning.  Of course, part of this run-up has been because of great  earnings, but I'm going to start with the story and that is the AmazonKohl's versus the Wal-Mart story.  Amazon and Kohl's have now completed a  tie-up intended to Kohl's and it will go to a lot of the Kohl's, 82 of the  Kohl's.  You're going to be able to go in there, into Kohl's, return your  Amazon products.  You'll even be able to try products out, gadgets, make  purchases.  </p><p>This is the way Amazon is going to take on Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart continues to  grow and has Wal-Mart Express where you just basically on your phone say  you're going to return it, you go into the store, you show your phone, you  give the package, done 30 seconds.  So, it is a battle.  Now, let's get to  those earnings we spoke of, Maria, watching Verizon and Travelers.  Verizon  looking to the upside today.  This bright spot was the paying of the  monthly bill subscribers.  They added 274,000 phone subscribers, that beats  the streets, that pushes Verizon up two percent and that will at least help  the Dow, at least in part.  They did see Verizon Fios subscribers dropping  off.  </p><p>Last but not least, the insurer, Travellers, the bright spot there was the  strong underwriting.  And in fact, that rose 4.2 percent to a record.  The  weak part was the catastrophe payouts, recording 700 million because of  Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but big picture, 59 percent drop in quarterly  profit.  It is fractionally higher this morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much, Nicole Petallides.   Meanwhile, General Electric's new CEO making some big changes, John  Flannery is reportedly expected to cut thousands of corporate-level jobs  and scale back G.E.'s global structure.  That's an addition to taking away  company cars, canceling fancy executive retreats.  We'll see what he does  and what the announcement is tomorrow, apparently, there's going to be  charges along with earnings tomorrow, when they report their third-quarter.  </p><p>Joining us now, host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney with some  thoughts on that.  Kind of a crazy story was that, Stuart, that Jeff Immelt  had an empty jet flying next to his jet on business trips just in case he  had mechanical failure.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's a head-shaker.  That is  one of the worst pieces of P.R. for a leading business guy that I've seen  in a long, long time.  I'll repeat the story, Maria, if I may, I don't know  why you've covered it already, I'm going to cover it, Jeff Immelt, CEO of  G.E., often, not always, but often had a second empty corporate jet flying  around after him -- he's in the first jet -- empty jet is the second jet,  just in case there's mechanical failure or security problems with the first  jet?  That really is extraordinary.  As you know, Maria -- look, I am  fascinated by G.E.  It was the stock of the last generation, and now it's  not.  They've got their profit margin declines, their financial business is  largely gone, they made a bad bet on energy, the dividend is threatened,  there's bad P.R. from the jets.  And I'm questioning, Maria, maybe you can  answer this one, is it a buy at $22.00 a share?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know what, we had -- we had Scott Wren on early from  Wells Fargo, and he's a real industrial guy.  And he said he's looking at  it.  I mean, he didn't out-and-out say buy it at this level because we may  see more weakness, but, yes, I think you make a good point, the stock has  lost half of its value from the highs, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  At $23.00 a share, it pays a four percent dividend.  If that  dividend is threatened and I'm told that it is and the stock goes down to  $21.00 a share, say, just supposing it does, is it a buy at that point?  I  would say yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're probably right, Stu.  You're great at that.  Stu, we'll  see you in 10 minutes.  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top  of the hour at 9:00 a.m. with Stuart Varney.  We'll be right back, right  here, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Two Navy pilots have been killed during a Navy  Jet training exercise in Tennessee, this happened earlier this month.  But  what went wrong, is still in question.  Lea is with us today.  You're a  former Navy fighter pilot, what have you learned?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, Maria, that specific crash, I spoke with the Navy about  this, and they're still investigating, they don't know what caused it yet,  but I did learn from the Navy that they were planning to do a low-level  flight for that crash.  Now, separate issue is the one I first reported  here on this program back in April, when T-45 pilots were refusing to fly  because of issues that they were having with their life support systems in  the T-45, we've been continuing this investigation, and I visited Naval Air  Station Patuxent River in Maryland.  That's where research, development,  test, and evaluations are done for naval aircraft.  And it's the heart of  where the Navy is trying to solve those problems with life support systems.   Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DENNIS GORDGE, EXPERT, ALTITUDE SYSTEMS LABORATORY:  This is a breathing  regulator, which would control the flow of oxygen up through the hose to  the mask, so every time you take a breath, this regulator would allow the  oxygen to flow to the mask.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  At this altitude systems laboratory, experts like Dennis Gordge  are working with the Navy to address what are known as physiological  episodes (INAUDIBLE) when pilots become impaired while flying, sometimes  because they're breathing bad air.  The issue has been jeopardizing flights  in the T-45 trainer and the F-18 Hornet at an increasing rate.  </p><p>When a jet has an oxygen problem, the Navy pulls the equipment out of the  jet, and brings it here to Patuxent River.  For example, this component is  an oxygen concentrator from a T-45.</p><p>GORDGE:  Each component of the system is evaluated for its own performance,  this lab will put all those components together to look -- to see how it  did as a system.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  In fact, they can replicate the exact flight profile where a  problem was reported to determine what went wrong with the systems.</p><p>GORDGE:  So, this chamber is the simulated cockpit, and so this chamber  would be the pressurized portion of the aircraft.  This chamber, as you can  see, has got two breathing simulators, mechanical breathing simulators.</p><p>REAR ADM. SELECT SARA JOYNER, PHYSIOLOGICAL EPISODES TEAM LEAD:  We've  collected a tremendous amount of data, now we're getting into the analysis  and that's starting to inform some of the things that we think we need to  address.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Navy Admiral Select Sara Joyner was handpicked by the top brass  to address physiological episodes.  She's been on the job since late August  and says that they have been making modifications, like adding a new carbon  monoxide removal tool and T-45s have a new warning system for pilots.</p><p>What was your feeling when you were asked to take over this, you know,  being somebody who's been out there, flying jets and being in the midst of  combat operations?</p><p>JOYNER:  I think when I look at it is the trust and confidence given to me  to do this mission.  This is probably the most important thing that's going  on in naval aviation.  I couldn't feel anything other than a heavy  responsibility combined with, you know, just really wanting to lean into  the problem and get to work.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  T-45s that have been modified are flying again, although we've  learned that pilots have reported six more incidents, Maria.  F-18s are  going to take longer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.  Stay with  us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  My thanks to a great panel.  Thanks, everybody.   Have a great day.  Seize that day.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Stuart,  over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  I will seize it, Maria, thank you very much.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thank you so  much and good morning everybody.  Happy Thursday to you.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Thursday, October 19th.  Your top stories right now,  6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Thirty years ago a market milestone and yesterday, a major market milestone  as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BARTIROMO:  The DOW Jones Industrial Average closing above 23,000 for the  first time ever yesterday.  It was the f1st record close since President  Trump took office.  An amazing momentum market.</p><p> Earnings driving the gains yesterday, the optimism over tax cuts has  underpinned market gains for months as well and we could be one step closer  to it today.  The Senate gears up for the budget vote later today.   President Trump is calling this a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will be the largest tax  cut in the history of our country.  I focus on tax cuts because it's such  an important weapon to get our country really moving.  </p><p> So we'll go from being one of the highest tax nations in the world to one  of the lowest tax.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in my opinion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got all of the updates coming up.  Geopolitical tensions  this morning however weighing on markets.  Pulling things back from  yesterday's all time high.  </p><p>DOW Industrial expected to be down about 80 points at the opening of  trading, down about a third of a percent, Nasdaq down two-thirds of a  percent right now.</p><p> In Europe this morning, take a look at the action, all the major averages  down as you see there with the FTSE100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC  Krones down almost half of a percent and the DAX Index down better than one  half of one percent.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Japan  which was up again taking a cue from the U.S., up half of a percent.</p><p> A brand new terrorism threat to report, the Department of Homeland Security  is warning that ISIS is plotting another 9/11 style attack, details on this  terrifying plan aiming to inflict mass casualties.  We've got all the  details.</p><p> And a scary scene at the German airport, an Air Berlin Jet does a dangerous  fly-by with 200 passengers on board, the fallout from the active defiance  coming up.</p><p> NFL Commission Roger Goodell refusing to take a tougher stance on anthem  protests and nobody is happy with Goodell's comments even Colin Kaepernick,  he fired back without opening his mouth.  We'll tell you what he said.</p><p>General Electric eyes major cost cuts, \"The Wall Street Journal\" this  morning reporting some of the excessive spending at the company including  Former CEO Jeff Immelt flying an empty jet next to his jet as a back up  during his 16-year tenure.  Wow.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle is here.  Kelly and Company  Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly is here.  And Rosecliff Capital CEO, Mike  Murphy is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Great to  be here.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Happy Thursday everybody.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  We have 5,000 foot jump since President Trump took office in  the DOW but this tax plan, man, I'll tell you, we're going to have to see  what happens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely, 23,000 and counting.  I mean, come on.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  And you know what's fascinating is actually  Janet Yellen is due to have a meeting today at the White House with  President Trump.</p><p> And so whatever happens at the Fed and whoever they pick next is going to  have significant impacts on the markets and one of the reasons why you can  see that is because the Fed has been so accommodative to this market.</p><p> You've seen asset inflation, I mean valuations are at all time highs.  So  it's a fascinating aspect because Secretary MNuchin has reported that he  doesn't like Kevin Warsh because he think he could royal markets, right?</p><p> He wasn't for quantitative using, he actually was very adamant against it.   And so Jerome Powell is more accommodative. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We may know this week or next who the president decides on,  we're going to get to all of that coming up.</p><p> But first, our top story this hour and that is the market milestone,  23,000.  The DOW Industrial closed above the 23,000 mark for the first time  ever yesterday.  Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin though made an important  comment throughout the day warning that all of those games could be in  jeopardy should Congress fail to pass tax reform.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY TEXT: </p><p> There is no question that the rally in the stock market has based into it  reasonably high expectations of us getting tax cuts and tax reform done.   It also has based into it optimism on regulatory relief which they begun to  see and there's expectations.  So I think to the extent we get the tax deal  done, the stock market will go up higher but there's no question in my mind  if we don't get it done, you're going to see a reversal of the significant  amount of these gains.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  sounds about right, the Senate is expected to vote today on a  budget that would allow the Chamber to pass a tax bill with just 51 votes  instead of the 60 needed for major legislation.  </p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is Former Chief Strategist for  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, his senate and president campaign, Jason Johnson is  with us along with Former Deputy Secretary of Labor in the Obama  Administration, now a Senior Fellow at the University of Virginia Miller  Center, Chris Liu.  Good to see you both gentlemen, Thank you so much for  joining us this morning.</p><p> CHRIS LIU, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LABOR, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION:  Thank  you. </p><p> JASON JOHNSON, FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Jason, in that same interview, the Treasury Secretary made  those comments about the market, he offered this, an absolutely guarantee  that a tax overhaul would be sign into law by the end of this year.  Is  that a reasonable time table?  Do you think they will get this done?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well certainly if you look at the performance this year with  other major pieces of legislation it doesn't seem reasonable.  But I  understand why the Secretary is saying what he's saying.</p><p> There is an absolute expectation that this has to be done in the political  market if you will.  And so I'm not incredibly optimistic that it happens  by the end of the year.  There certainly seems to be a mixed message coming  from some leaders on the Hill as to whether or not the deadline is the end  of the year.  But whether it's the end of the year or after the first of  the year, it must happen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Chris, do you agree with that that it must happen and that it  will happen?</p><p> LIU:  I agree with Senator McConnell who said it's more important that we  get it right instead of just running this through.  And I think it's  important to look at the details here and we don't really know yet  percentage is going to go to the super wealthy, how it's going to add to  the deficit whether it's really going to fix the idiosyncrasies in the tax  code right now.</p><p> And so putting it on an artificial deadline does not bode well for coming  up with good policy and that's really what the market wants to see right  now.  They really want to see the once in a generation tax reform proposal,  not another giveaway that just goes to the super wealthy.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, Chris considering -- it's Kevin Kelly here.  Considering you  spent time in the White House especially with President Obama, do you think  it's appropriate for a cabinet secretaries or anybody in this  administration to be talking about the impact on stock markets given that  they should be focusing on policy and talking about the implements, what it  could do to the real economy as opposed to really focusing on markets that  should do whatever they should be doing?</p><p> LIU:  That's exactly right.  It's one of the reasons why we in the Obama  Administration didn't talk about the stock market even though we had  significant gains as well because the market goes up and unfortunately it  goes down as well.</p><p> And it goes up or down for reasons that have nothing to do with Washington.   And if I were Secretary MNuchin, I would probably take my cues from the  leaders on the Hill as to what the timing should be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, I know.  I think that's a good point but at the same  time, $5.3 trillion in market value doesn't come out of air.  It's clear  that the market value that we've seen in these gains is partly due to  optimism over what President Trump is doing.  </p><p> He's rolled back an incredible amount of regulation and they're expecting  tax reform.  Are you saying $5.3 trillion in market value is just a  coincidence?</p><p> LIU:  Well I would say that it's based on the expectation something's  happening.  This is a recovery, economic recovery that began in early 2010  and we've had essentially seven straight years of economic growth.</p><p> There have been rollbacks of regulations but there hasn't been this  significant economic change that Donald Trump has promised yet.  So a lot  of this is --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we did see a 3.1 percent GDP the other day and GDP was  averaging about one and a half percent under President Obama.  So -- I mean  there's something to it that the economy is definitely better.  </p><p> You're (INAUDIBLE) in small business, do you see that Mike Murphy?  Do you  see things getting better?  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.  We see small business optimism out there, we see  startups, we see companies that are looking to disrupt existing industries  coming out hiring people, raising money, going out and creating -- using  technology to make our lives better.  So I think right now the optimism  that we see nationwide is something we haven't seen in a long time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jason, let me ask you this, in terms of this bill, if it gets  done in the first quarter, do you think that still has a positive impact?   If we don't see a bill on the president's desk by Thanksgiving, this is  going to be a problem for certainly into the 2018 election for the  republicans.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Sure.  Going back to the comment earlier that we shouldn't have  artificial deadlines.  I don't believe getting this done by the end of the  year or seeing that we need to get it done by the end of the year is an  artificial deadline because we know historically that very few things  happen in election year.</p><p> And as we all know, next year is an election year.  So Maria, into the  first quarter, maybe so but we know that you get much passed the first  quarter these guys don't like to do much in an election year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you're right, if they don't get it done maybe that's  -- they should move out because this is something that the American people  want, Lea Gabrielle.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.  Chris, Senator Schumer said our republican friends are  trying to hide what's in the tax bill that they don't want people to know.  </p><p> Is this just resistance sort of popping up already from the democrats on  this obstructionist because really tax reform is good for all Americans  right now, is it?</p><p> LIU:  A hundred percent agree tax reform is good.  What we have seen so far  is simply tax cuts and some of the initial estimates are that becoming 50  to 80 percent of the benefits would go to the top one percent.  Look --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's not true.  That's just not true.  I don't want to spew  out nonsense because 80 percent of the tax reform package going to the top  one percent is nonsense.</p><p> LIU:  An important issue to get right.  For instance, it's the state and  local tax deduction which is going to affect a lot republican members and  understanding the details of that is not just resistance, it's actually  trying to make sure that this is legitimate tax reform and there are so  many issues.  This is why this is hard and it's hard to get it right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're talking about a corporate rate of 20 percent.  If you  see the corporate rate go down from 35 percent to 20 percent, that will be  a positive for corporations and the idea is is that they are going to  reinvest in higher (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> KELLY:  It's small businesses.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Small business with 25 percent pass through rate, same thing  down from 39.6.  So this is a significant move.  He's also talking about  three brackets, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent --</p><p> MURPHY:  I mean, small businesses is like --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Doubling the standard deduction.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I'd like to point out, those aren't republican small  businesses, those are democrat, republican, American small businesses.  So  that impacts everybody not just one side.  This isn't a one side versus the  other.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the reason that I have to push back on that Chris  is because we were expecting the talking points after this plan and it's  just not true that 80 percent of the tax plan impacts the top one percent,  it's just not true and we have to make it clear.</p><p> LIU:  You know, the problem is, we don't have the details yet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p> LIU:  We don't have the -- we don't have the details yet and I think that's  the problem --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well we have the details that we just mentioned, we got three  brackets on the individual rates, we got a doubling of the standard  deduction, corporate rate of 20 percent, pass through rate of 25 percent,  and the elimination of most deductions.</p><p> LIU:  Well look, we don't really know what the impact is on average  Americans, we don't know what the size of the (INAUDIBLE) tax credit is  going to be, we don't understand all the other archaic idiosyncrasy that's  --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So then how can you say it benefits the one percent if you  don't even have the details?</p><p> LIU:  Well -- look, we're -- the folks that have looked at this are basing  this on the initial proposal.  Let's have a whole debate on this and let's  make sure we get this right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because this is -- we're watching President  Obama return to the campaign trail Chris to stump for democratic candidates  and governance races, of course, in New Jersey and in Virginia, out of next  month elections.</p><p> This development comes amid a shakeup at the DNC where several key long  time officials have lost their post.  The party's new chairman, Tom Perez  obviously preparing to host his first meeting since taking over the job  earlier this year.</p><p> You were among the 75 people nominated by Tom Perez to become the new at  large DNC member, what's behind the shakeup?  Tell us how you're feeling?   Congratulations by that nomination by the way Chris.</p><p> LIU:  Well look, there are about 400 members of the Democratic National  Committee.  The new chairman get to pick 75.  This is a time of change  within the Democratic Party and I think we need to admit that things  haven't gone as well as they should have over the last couple of years.</p><p> And so unfortunately when you bring new people in, some people that have  served for a while have to be moved and that's just part of change.  And  this is a big 10 party and change happens and change is good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, one thing that seems to be happening is that the  Democratic Party is being hijacked by the extreme left Chris.  </p><p> Are you going to be able to come up with a message that will resonate with  the broad American people, the population given the fact that you've got  Barrack Obama, you've got Bernie Sanders, you've got Elizabeth Warren going  to the extreme left and really hijacking what was a moderate party at one  point?</p><p> LIU:  Tom Perez has made a commitment that the democrats need to compete in  every seat from the school board to the Senate to the White House.</p><p> And we need to understand that we as a party can't have one monolithic  message.  That doesn't work in all state and certainly doesn't even work in  all rural areas versus urban areas as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  All right.  Gentlemen, thanks very  much for the conversation we appreciate you joining us this morning.  Chris  Liu.  Jason, good to see you as well.  We will talk with you soon  gentlemen.</p><p> Coming up, the head of Homeland Security is warning Americans of a new  threat, the concern over ISIS plotting another 9/11 next.  We are going to  tell you the details of what we know.  </p><p> Then Colin Kaepernick firing back at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the  new way he's lashing out against him straight ahead.  </p><p> A fired up morning thins morning, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A top U.S. security chief warning terror groups  are planning a major attack on the scale of 9/11.  Cheryl Casone with the  details now, Cheryl --</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Maria, good morning.  Acting Homeland Security  Secretary Elaine Duke saying it is clear that ISIS and other terror groups  are planning to take down planes as an aim to carry out another massive  attack.  Duke also saying terror groups have been using knife and van  attacks to keep their members engaged.</p><p> Well the head of American Express, one of the country's most prominent  African-American corporate leaders is leaving the company, Kenneth Chenault  depature caps a 16-year run at the credit card company.  He's going to be  succeeding a CEO by Stephen Squeri a three decade AmEx veteran.  Shares of  AmEx up 23 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, American cities are pulling all the stops in their bid to become home  to Amazon's second headquarters.  Stonecrest, Georgia has offered to change  its name to Amazon.  Tucson, Arizona tried to send a company a 21-foot  cactus.</p><p>Amazon has promised to invest $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs.  The  deadline to submit bids is today.  And, of course, check this out, New York  City lit up famous buildings including the Empire State Building and one  World Trade in Amazon's orange color last night trying to help seal the  deal.  Probably going to be a little more than light that's going to get  Amazon somewhere.</p><p> And then finally there's this, first lady Melania Trump is donating her  inaugural ball gown to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.   She is handing over the vanilla silk off the shoulder gown, it's got a slit  skirt.  The tradition first began Maria with Helen Taft back in 1912.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Cool.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Interesting.  Would you  go see the first lady's gown at the Smithsonian Lea?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think if I was already going to the Smithsonian then I would  happen to pass by and see the first lady's gown.</p><p> But I do think that this is really nice about making (INAUDIBLE) because it  gives you a sense of being able to even that you can't touch them, just  being able to sort of look at them and sort of have the essence of what it  must have been like to be there that day.  So I think it's wonderful that  they do this.</p><p> KELLY:  I think it also highlights the importance of the first lady, right?   I mean you go throughout history and you look at the contributions they've  made.  So it's nice that --</p><p> MURPHY:  The guy who's getting married in New York.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  I was going to say behind every great man is a better woman.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, says the guy who's getting married.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your upcoming nuptial.</p><p> KELLY:  Well she did get her dress last Friday so maybe I'm just kind of  high upbeat excited.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, she got the dress.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, I know.  So obviously I didn't see it but it was a fun and  exciting experience.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I was going to say, let's see a live TV picture of this and get  you in really big trouble.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep following all of that.  Coming up next  though, a real scare in the sky to tell you about, more video of the risky  fly-by stunt that got pilot suspended, that's coming up.</p><p> And then GE's new chief taking away company cars and cancelling fancy  retreats.  The new cost cutting direction for General Electric ahead of its  earnings tomorrow, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric's new CEO John Flannery making  some changes starting with some old favorites.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details, Tracee --</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.  You know,  John Flannery, he's only been on the job since August 1st but he's already  making some big changes.</p><p> One of his first belt tightening moves was to ground GE's fleet of six  business jets which was a favorite of former GE CEO Jeff Immelt who used to  have an empty private jet fly next to his just as a spare and that's just  the beginning.</p><p> Bob Nardelli, former Chrysler CEO and Home CEO was on the show yesterday  and here's what he had to say.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO HOME DEPOT &amp; CHRYSLER:  They have to get their  fundamental businesses that are left to get some growth.  They got to get  growth, they've got to get top line growth, they got to get productivity,  they got to get innovation.</p><p> The key to GE over the last 16 years Maria as we've seen that goes out have  been a lot more than the goes in.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARRASCO:  And Nardelli worked at GE for several years.  And according to  \"The Wall Street Journal,\" next month Flannery is expected to unveil the  results of a strategic review that includes thousands of corporate level  job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure.</p><p> He is shutting down research centers in Shanghai, Munich, and Rio democrats  Janiero.  A GE spokesperson said:</p><p> TEXT: The company will continue to have an intense focus on our global  operations and customer base.</p><p> The company is expected to report quarterly reports tomorrow.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at that stock ahead of those --</p><p> CARRASCO:  Hasn't been good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ahead of those numbers.  The stock has been cut in half from  the highs.  No, wait a minute.  Let's just underline what you just said  Tracee, he had a separate jet flying behind his jet on business trips and  the jet flying behind him was empty.</p><p> CARRASCO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he did that for what reason?</p><p> CARRASCO:  Just in case there were any issues with the private jet he was  already on.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I mean --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I flew in the navy and I have a commanding officer who made me  take a jet to an air show because it was his hometown and he wanted to make  sure that if his jet, if there's anything wrong with it he couldn't fly in  the air show but there was a spare there.  So I've seen this before, pretty  wasteful.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  But the biggest problem is they have shareholders, right,  that they're held accountable too and I'm sorry --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a public company.</p><p> KELLY:  Listen, you don't need to fly a private jet next to you.  Listen,  if your plane has mechanical issues, guess what, then we'll figure out and  we'll rent a private jet that's there to take you back to wherever you need  to go.  You don't -- yes, exactly.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  Well here's the problem, the board.  If I was a member on the  board, how can you -- you've got to be held accountable.  I mean, they --  like coming out of GE tomorrow and whether they cut the dividend, that's  one of the biggest concerns that shareholders are having right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, sure is.</p><p> KELLY:  But also what is this board doing if they're allowing this, right?   Shareholder capital --</p><p> MURPHY:  And (INAUDIBLE) I think for an old company like GE that's trying  to figure out how to stay relevant in this new economy, I think something  like this coming out makes it really hard for shareholders to believe in  this.</p><p> And you could see people wanting to sell this and look at company if they  are really on the cutting edge of technology.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that are growing.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  But they are looking for places to trim the fat just like  Tracee mentioned, shutting down some of those research centers and sort of  trying to consolidate their resources.  So at least we're moving forward in  that way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've got to.  We'll see what the company says tomorrow.  GE  reports at around 8:30a.m. in the morning, tomorrow morning on its third  quarter. And, of course, a speculation is around that dividend.  Tracee  Carrasco, thank you.  </p><p> We will take a break.  When we come back, months after going public, Blue  Apron is laying off hundreds of employees.  The plan for a company-wide  realignment straight ahead.</p><p> Then Fortune is revealing their new future 50 list of U.S. companies with  the highest potential for growth.  We've got the exclusive first look, back  in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Thursday.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  October 19th.  Your top stories right now 6:30a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> The rally is momentous but the market is pulling back from record highs  yesterday.  The market expected to open down about 100 points after  yesterday's huge day.  The DOW Jones Industrial Average hitting the 23,000  level for the first time ever.</p><p> Markets retreating this morning on some geopolitical tensions.  As you can  see, futures indicating a decline of 100 points and the Nasdaq down about  36 points.  This, of course, the anniversary of Black Monday 30 years ago.</p><p> In Europe this morning and Asia, mixed performances.  Asian markets look  like this, mostly lower this morning.  Hang Seng Index down about two  percent.</p><p> And in Europe this morning, as you see weakness there as well, the FTSE100,  the CAC Krones, and the DAX Index down between the third of a percent and  two-thirds of a percent.  Catalonia in crisis this morning, Spain is moving  to take over the region before it can declare independence, why some fear  that the decision will spur unrest like never before.  </p><p> A farewell fly by in Air Berlin, pilot lands in hot water over his low  flying stunt to say goodbye to the Airline with 200 passengers aboard, the  fallout from the terrifying maneuver, coming up.  And Blue Apron is feeling  the heat from Amazon.  The cooking company announcing hundreds of layoffs  just months after going public, what the move means for the meal kit  industry as a whole.  </p><p> Not standing up for the National Anthem, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell  under fire this morning from both sides, for not taking a stronger stance  on the league's controversial protest.

Get a chance  to turn it, four, six, three and a double play.  And the ball game is over.   The Cubs win.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The highlights from the late-night thriller at Wrigley Field  last night.  The Yankees take the lead in the AL Championship Series now.   We've got more, coming up on that.  But first, a new approach to measuring  success, Fortune Magazine is shining a light on the top names driving the  business world tomorrow, where is the growth?  We want to know.  Fortune is  debuting its future 50 list today, covering the most innovative companies  prime for explosive growth.  Fox Business has the exclusive first look at  the list.  </p><p> Coming in at number five on Fortunes' Future 50 Leaders, medical robotics  leader, Intuitive Surgical, fourth is the king of the stream, Netflix.   Number three on this list, Mark Zuckerberg's dorm project turns social  media titan, Facebook.  Elon Musk, electric automaker Tesla, cruising into  the second spot.  And topping the list is cloud computing giant,  Salesforce, joining us right now in a Fox Business Exclusive, Working  Deputy Editor, Brian O'Keefe.  Brian, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR OF FORTUNE:  My pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, a lot of those names, obviously, very familiar and growth  stories that we all know, how did you come up with this list, what are the  growth metrics that you used?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  So we worked with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), they were our  partners in doing this.  They did an incredible amount of number crunching,  and they looked at 15 years of financial data and they scream for all 2,300  U.S. public companies.  And they really looked at a couple of things.  One  is the market potential of all these companies, what the market is betting,  how much growth the market is betting and assigning their value.  </p><p> And then they also dove into the company's themselves and looked at people,  structure, their technology and investments, they used artificial  intelligence, natural language processing to look at 70,000 10Ks and look  at the way those companies talked about themselves, if they talked about  future and investment and long-term thinking.  And they did a lot of  backtesting and looked at what correlated with real growth over time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's interesting that Salesforce is the number one -- in  the number one spot.  Were you surprised with that, Mike?</p><p> MURPHY:  I was, for sure, because, you know, when you think about growth,  you hear the fangs.  You know, you hear about Facebook, which is there but  Amazon, Netflix, which is there, Google.  So, the way this is -- I think  this is going to create a lot of controversy from people who are saying,  you know, like, oh, here's the big apple, we don't see therearound.</p><p> KELLY:  Apple didn't make the list, actually.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Apple didn't make the list.</p><p> KELLY:  Apple did not make the list, in part to its recent increase  emphasis on paying dividends on over reinvestment.</p><p> O'KEEFE: Yes, I mean, you're seeing -- I mean, Apple is the big exception,  right?  That's, you know, we noted that.  And, you know, Apple is obviously  still an incredible performer but they are piling up cash, they are paying  out dividends under some pressure to shareholders and that's not really a  formula for future growth.  </p><p> You know, you want to see a company, not that Apple is not doing well, but  you want to see them putting it in to new technology, Salesforce, to your  point, you know, they are -- Marc Benioff keeps that company really focused  on the future, they're investing in artificial intelligence and they're  making acquisitions on --</p><p> KELLY:  And I think the important thing about Salesforce, if you look it as  -- it didn't surprise me one bit about this, because he's actually struck  deals and partnerships with other companies like IBM to have a stronger,  better, platform for his customers, right?  So for insurance companies, if  there's a hail storm, they're going to use IBMs (INAUDIBLE) to notify all  the policyholders, so he's done a very good job especially on the  acquisition side.  So if they had a hole on their business model, he went  out and bought them.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  To look at the list overall, though, you know, a lot of people  say the past performance is the best indication of future success and  that's really not the way that you created this list, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that's really, kind of, the whole reason we did  create this list, is that past performance isn't the indicator of future  success and today's environment, things are changing so much faster,  technologies speeding up the pace of change, that we felt like in BCG, felt  like, we need a better metric to do that.  So that, you know, most of the  time, you're measuring a company on.  </p><p> You're trying to project the future on what they've been doing recently.   And this is like really -- that's why it's diving into, sort of, the DNA of  these companies and how they operate and how they talk and how they think  and trying to do that in a scientific way.  And, you know, looking at the  structure of the company, I mean, the hard reality is that younger  companies tend to grow faster, I mean, not just smaller companies, but  tightly-managed younger companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And founder companies, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  And founder companies, a lot of the time, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You also put his list of Future 50 Challengers.  We just showed  it on the screen.  These are companies that are on the fast-track for  growth but aren't quite there yet.  So how did you come up with this list?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Well, the secret about the Future 50 is (INAUDIBLE) list of 25.   So we have the 25 big companies and the 25 challengers, is what we called  it, BCG, didn't want to -- if you're screening for growth, you're going to  naturally get smaller companies, so that's why we did two separate screens  to get the big companies that are still growing.  The challengers are  really the companies that are on the rise, not necessarily small companies,  but, you know, it can be like, $5 to 10-billion market cap companies.  And  you see a lot of software companies on the list overall but especially on  the challenger's list, I mean, it's really like software is eating the  world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what Marc Andreessen said years ago, you know, software  eats the world.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, it's still true.  It's true, maybe more than ever.  I mean,  it's, you know, like Veeva Systems, the number one company in the  challenger's list.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Workday has been taking market share from, like, the  oracles of the world for years.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Workday is huge.  I mean, obviously, it's a huge stock, market  cap has shut up.  And yes, so these are companies that they're displacing  traditional systems and they're doing it with software technology.</p><p> KELLY:  So on Workday, it's a perineal emanate target, right?  And I just  wanted to highlight the point you said, though, earlier, 64 percent of the  companies in this list are software or online service providers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  That highlights that this is the wave and this is the future of  where we are going.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You want to find growth, that's where it is.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, and a bit in every industry.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And one of the things that you have said is that, a lot of  companies that are using artificial intelligence are, sort of, higher on  the list, but you also used artificial intelligence in developing this  list, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that was one of the really cool things that BCG did,  is use this natural language processing to troll through 70,000 10Ks = like  200,000 different earnings calls, transcripts, and really look at the  language that the management uses to talk about how they managed their own  business.   And so, and, you know, I don't -- I don't personally know the details of  how the artificial intelligence did it, but it correlates certain words and  the way they come together with performance.</p><p> MURPHY:  So, how far down did you guys dig?  Like, how low did you go?   Because a company like Salesforces which is number one, they have a  venture, we ran a venture capital funds.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Right.</p><p> MURPHY:  So Salesforce is actively out there looking to acquire early-stage  start-ups.  Is there another 50 list of, kind of, the 50 (INAUDIBLE) that's  going start-ups or early stage companies?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Maybe we will expand that out.  But one thing the BCG did do, was  look at the investments that company's making, compared to high performing  DC funds to, sort of, get a sense of like how good their investments are.   So, that's an interesting way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're hitting on something so important right now.  I'm so  glad you brought it up, Mike, because you're right, Salesforce has an arm  that invests and acquires smaller companies.  That's why a lot of these  companies as Amazon, you know, other big technology --</p><p> KELLY:  Intel.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Intel, you're seeing large tech right now, have venture capital  arm and they are acquiring some of the smaller, no-names out there.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  You know, we have a story on Salesforce that goes deeper into  what they're doing.  They bought 55 companies since 2006.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  And Marc Benioff, you know, a lot of times, like, maybe he  doesn't even exactly know what they're going to do with the company but he  knows there's an interesting technology and they make it an acquisition,  they figure out how it's going to impact their business.</p><p> KELLY:  Is there a super surprised company, for you, because I'm looking at  this list and I'm not surprised by it, but I think people could be as the  intercontinental exchange that, you know, they run the New York stock  exchange, but really, those companies, the exchange have been focusing on  data, licensing, it's not really  --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of (INAUDIBLE) mergers.</p><p> KELLY:  Exactly.  So, is there a company on this list that surprised you  the most?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Surprised me the most, I mean, I'm a little surprised -- Monster  Beverage is a really interesting company.</p><p> KELLY:  Number 20 on that list.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Because they have been growing fast for 20 years, and, you know,  I don't drink Monster Beverage drinks, but a lot of people do.  They're  really smart about how they market their brand, they don't really do a lot  of advertising but they do a lot of really cool, sort of, sponsorship  stuff.  And they just, you know, they keep growing that company year after  year.</p><p> KELLY:  And the next leg of growth for Monster Beverage is over in China  and Asia, so that's where they're looking to go so if you follow the stock  close, you can see they've dominated North America and they've slowly been  making inroads and smart positioning in Asia.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look at that chart.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  You know we have MasterCard and Visa on the list.  And I think  that's really interesting because they seemed like, you know, it's the card  in your wallet.  But they're really doing a lot of innovative things.  They  are trying to be, you know, the future of payments in all different forms.</p><p> MURPHY:  And when we talk about big tech companies or fin-tech companies  doing acquisitions, early-stage investing.  But there's also companies like  Campbell Soup has (INAUDIBLE) so it's not just big tech that's looking to  acquire small innovative companies.  I think it's across all diferent -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Campbell Soup, wow.  And these guys are computer guys like you.   We had Ann Winblad on from Winblad, who is a great venture capitalist.  And  she said, I'm competing with the arms of the soft, you know, of the  SoftBanks, not SoftBanks, of the --</p><p> MURPHY:  The large corporations.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The large corporation.  The largest technology -- </p><p> KELLY:  Imagine if the repatriation happens, of the taxes of all those  trillions of dollars overseas to these companies that they can then re- invest since small businesses start up, things that are happening.  I mean,  not to tie this into the whole tax reform overhaul policy but that could be  a good next leg of growth for this company.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  First, they have to find the right things to invest in.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, of course.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  These lists are helpful.  Brian, thank you so much, Brian  O'Keefe joining us.  We wanted to also -- should we take a look at IBM real  quick.  I mean, IBM was obviously stalled in terms of its revenue growth  for 22 quarters.  You saw a decline in revenue but yesterday, check out  that stock yesterday.  Nine percent, one of the reasons the Dow Industrials  hit 23,000.  I just wanted to mention that, is this a turning point for  IBM?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't think so.  I think when you see that type of move, so much  of the volume in the markets right now is computer driven or algorithmic  trading.  That, to me, smells like a short covering -- short squeeze.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep watching IBM.  Obviously, IBM, GE, two- story stocks that we want to look at today.  Brian, good to see you, thank  you.  Coming up next, the fight is growing over Catalonia's push for  independence.  How the Spanish government is trying to stop the region's  succession, that's next.  And then a terrifying close call, more video of  that scary fly by that put 200 passengers at risk.  We'll tell you all  about it, back in a moment, straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Markets are down this morning after a huge day  yesterday.  Dow Industrials' expected to be down better than 100 points.   No surprise.  The market crossed 23,000 yesterday for the first time ever  in a big rally, and, of course, we're up to better than $5 trillion in  market value since the election.  </p><p> A couple names on the move, Gilead Sciences; the stock right now is up  almost three percent in the premarket after winning FDA approval for a new  cancer gene therapy -- used to treat lymphoma.  The pharmaceutical giant  will sell the treatment at $373,000.  It's only the second gene therapy to  earn approval from the FDA on that.  Novartis brought the first drug of  this class to market back in August.</p><p>EBay shares this morning on the move after delivering third-quarter  earnings after the bell last night.  The results were roughly in line but  fourth-quarter guidance's disappointed.  EBay is revamping its online  marketplace amid tough competition from Amazon.  Stock, right now, taken a  real hit down 6-1/2 percent in the premarket.  </p><p> And then, there's Spain, the government there is set to activate an  emergency measure to take control of Catalonia, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So, Spain's government calling a special cabinet for  the weekend to activate this measure -- it allows for the central  government to take over the semiautonomous power of any of the country's17  regions.  Now, this comes after Catalonia's leader said, Separatist  lawmakers, can vote in favor of declaration of independence.  The measure  has never been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in  Spain.  </p><p> Well, an Air Berlin pilot is in big trouble.  He performed a risky flying  stunt with 200 passengers aboard.  You're watching the video of it right  now.  Reports say he buzzed Dusseldorf Airport terminal in a maneuver that  was met to mark the bankrupt last Trans-Atlantic flight.  Well, a pilot of  another told Reuters that a go-around should only be performed for its  operations, or safety aviation officials are looking at this video and  looking into this incident.  </p><p> Well, Blue Apron, they are tightening their belt.  The company has laid out  six percent of the workforce, that's about 300 workers, as part of a  company or organization.  Blue Apron has struggled since it went public  back in June with its stock price cut in half since then.  Competition from  a rival, a big one that would-be Amazon.  There is the year to date chart,  you can see it on your screen.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Sea World is laying off 350 workers due to low attendance at its  parks -- mainly in Orlando and San Diego.  They've been trying to rebuild  the brand solving protests over its treatment of their killer whales.   Shares of Sea World, down more than 34 percent year to date.  </p><p> And then, finally this, Snickers are getting a facelift, actually three  facelifts.  The candy company announcing they're going to release a line of  three new flavors to combat a number of different, well, emotional issues.   Feeling irritable, wimpy, indecisive?  Well, they've got the cure.  These  three bars: espresso, fiery, and salty and sweet, Maria.  Right now, I  think I want the espresso.  I'm a little tired.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Yes, the expresso sounds good.  </p><p> KELLY:  Thanks to wimpy for fiery, right?  Like, I like spicy stuff, but it  doesn't mean that I'm a wimp.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's taking it personally.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  So -- but personally, I'm really concerned about the espresso  one, because if you're irritable, I think the last thing you actually need  is to have some more caffeine.  More caffeine.  I always like those names,  though.  I actually find that really attractive.  When you're in a store  and you're looking at candy and you're like, yes, you know, I kind of feel  irritable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do you buy right there?  Or will you buy it because of  that?  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  No.  Only if I really want it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking out over  the national anthem protest.  What he said to players and how they're  reacting, next.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a big night at Wrigley Field last night.  The Cubs  fought for their playoff lives and they survived.  Jared Max with the  highlights, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey!  Good morning, Maria.  I know  the Dodgers are only one win from the World Series, but just imagine the  Cubs came all the way back to win the NLC.  Yes, they did what they had to  do last night in a do or die game 4. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> (BASEBALL GAMEPLAY)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Javier Baez at two home runs; Wilson Contreras also (INAUDIBLE) for  the Cubs.  Dodgers would blast from Cody Dellinger and Justin Turner, but  the Cubs win.  Cubs win!  Cubs win, 3-2.  So, there will be a game 5.   Tonight, at Wrigley Field, the Cubs pick Jose Montana.  The Dodgers'  Clayton Kershaw L.A. leads three games to one.  </p><p>New York Yankees rookie, Aaron Judge, a hero again last night.  A third- inning double off Astros Ace, Dallas Keuchel, gave the Yanks a 2-0 lead.   Then, at the seventh inning, fellow baby bomber, Gary Sanchez, smashes a  solo home run against Brad Peacock -- third home run this postseason for  Sanchez.  Yankees' finally got reminisce its Dallas Keuchel and Masahiro  Tanaka.  7-shutout innings, 5-0, Yanks win.  </p><p> Series goes back to Houston where the Astros won the first two games.   Here's to start, Justin Verlander tomorrow night, and Yankees turn to Luis  Severino.  Yanks, one win from their 41st American League pennant.  </p><p> Hey, you know when somebody says, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.   Well, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the opposite yesterday,  regarding players choices to stand or kneel for the national anthem.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER FOR THE NFL:  Everyone should stand for the  national anthem, that's an important part of our policy.  It's also an  important part of our game that we all take great pride in, it's also  important for us to honor our flag and to our country, and we think our  fans expect us to do that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAX:  Everyone should stand, not must stand.  While Goodell said he just  wants to keep the politics out of football.  President Trump, responded on  Twitter, \"NFL, too much talk, not enough action.  Stand for the national  anthem.\"  And while Colin Kaepernick, the first anthem kneeler, remained  silent except for retweets about not enough attention being given to what  he says police brutality against people of color. The Seahawks' Michael  Bennett isn't interested in discussing how to fix these social issues.   While the NFL team owners are trying to.  </p><p> Why?  He says, \"I don't think we can work alongside them until we address  that issue.  I think the issue with Kaepernick is the start to a  conversation.  If they want us to be open to what they want, the dialogue,  then that's something that needs to be on the table right there.\"  So,  Kaepernick first and then the issues.  </p><p> Some kneel, some protests, some put their money where their mouth is, like  the Philadelphia Eagles' Chris Long who has supported teammates protesting  the national anthem but is also doing something else.  Chris Long of the  Eagles, who had donated his first six-game paychecks this season to fund  two scholarships at a prep school in Charlottesville where he grew up is  now donating the rest of his 2017 NFL salary.  Ten more paychecks to help  fund education to make it for folks who are -- don't get the opportunities  in certain cities -- ten weeks of paychecks going to this in cities of St.  Louis, Boston and also Philadelphia.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is great.  </p><p> KELLY:  Leading by example.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Football has a 10 for Tomorrow campaign.  Good on him for that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, go Yanks!  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sorry, Max.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MURPHY:  Yes, this should be the go Yanks.</p><p> MAX:  Some Mets fans started this as soon when the Yankees beat the Mets,  and he got Wednesday missing.  Somehow, the Yankees do this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Mets are still amazing.  Sorry.  All right.  Jared Max.   Catch Jared's sports reports on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7,\" SiriusXM 115.  I  want to bring you this breaking news: the president is tweeting this  morning.  Here is what he said, \"Republicans are going for big budget  approval today.  The first step toward massive tax cuts.  I think we have  the votes, but who knows?\"  Uh-oh!</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> KELLY:  Who knows?  Caveat.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I guess they need the caveat in this day and age.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, cities are mailing in their bid to  Amazon.  We're taking a look at the other crazy stumps from towns competing  for technology giants' second headquarters, wait until you see this.   That's next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Happy  Thursday to you.  Thanks for being with us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is  Thursday, October 19th.  Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  A market milestone yesterday.

Your top stories right now,  6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Thirty years ago a market milestone and yesterday, a major market milestone  as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BARTIROMO:  The DOW Jones Industrial Average closing above 23,000 for the  first time ever yesterday.  It was the f1st record close since President  Trump took office.  An amazing momentum market.</p><p> Earnings driving the gains yesterday, the optimism over tax cuts has  underpinned market gains for months as well and we could be one step closer  to it today.  The Senate gears up for the budget vote later today.   President Trump is calling this a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will be the largest tax  cut in the history of our country.  I focus on tax cuts because it's such  an important weapon to get our country really moving.  </p><p> So we'll go from being one of the highest tax nations in the world to one  of the lowest tax.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in my opinion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got all of the updates coming up.  Geopolitical tensions  this morning however weighing on markets.  Pulling things back from  yesterday's all time high.  </p><p>DOW Industrial expected to be down about 80 points at the opening of  trading, down about a third of a percent, Nasdaq down two-thirds of a  percent right now.</p><p> In Europe this morning, take a look at the action, all the major averages  down as you see there with the FTSE100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC  Krones down almost half of a percent and the DAX Index down better than one  half of one percent.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Japan  which was up again taking a cue from the U.S., up half of a percent.</p><p> A brand new terrorism threat to report, the Department of Homeland Security  is warning that ISIS is plotting another 9/11 style attack, details on this  terrifying plan aiming to inflict mass casualties.  We've got all the  details.</p><p> And a scary scene at the German airport, an Air Berlin Jet does a dangerous  fly-by with 200 passengers on board, the fallout from the active defiance  coming up.</p><p> NFL Commission Roger Goodell refusing to take a tougher stance on anthem  protests and nobody is happy with Goodell's comments even Colin Kaepernick,  he fired back without opening his mouth.  We'll tell you what he said.</p><p>General Electric eyes major cost cuts, \"The Wall Street Journal\" this  morning reporting some of the excessive spending at the company including  Former CEO Jeff Immelt flying an empty jet next to his jet as a back up  during his 16-year tenure.  Wow.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle is here.  Kelly and Company  Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly is here.  And Rosecliff Capital CEO, Mike  Murphy is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Great to  be here.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Happy Thursday everybody.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  We have 5,000 foot jump since President Trump took office in  the DOW but this tax plan, man, I'll tell you, we're going to have to see  what happens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely, 23,000 and counting.  I mean, come on.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  And you know what's fascinating is actually  Janet Yellen is due to have a meeting today at the White House with  President Trump.</p><p> And so whatever happens at the Fed and whoever they pick next is going to  have significant impacts on the markets and one of the reasons why you can  see that is because the Fed has been so accommodative to this market.</p><p> You've seen asset inflation, I mean valuations are at all time highs.  So  it's a fascinating aspect because Secretary MNuchin has reported that he  doesn't like Kevin Warsh because he think he could royal markets, right?</p><p> He wasn't for quantitative using, he actually was very adamant against it.   And so Jerome Powell is more accommodative. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We may know this week or next who the president decides on,  we're going to get to all of that coming up.</p><p> But first, our top story this hour and that is the market milestone,  23,000.  The DOW Industrial closed above the 23,000 mark for the first time  ever yesterday.  Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin though made an important  comment throughout the day warning that all of those games could be in  jeopardy should Congress fail to pass tax reform.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY TEXT: </p><p> There is no question that the rally in the stock market has based into it  reasonably high expectations of us getting tax cuts and tax reform done.   It also has based into it optimism on regulatory relief which they begun to  see and there's expectations.  So I think to the extent we get the tax deal  done, the stock market will go up higher but there's no question in my mind  if we don't get it done, you're going to see a reversal of the significant  amount of these gains.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  sounds about right, the Senate is expected to vote today on a  budget that would allow the Chamber to pass a tax bill with just 51 votes  instead of the 60 needed for major legislation.  </p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is Former Chief Strategist for  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, his senate and president campaign, Jason Johnson is  with us along with Former Deputy Secretary of Labor in the Obama  Administration, now a Senior Fellow at the University of Virginia Miller  Center, Chris Liu.  Good to see you both gentlemen, Thank you so much for  joining us this morning.</p><p> CHRIS LIU, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LABOR, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION:  Thank  you. </p><p> JASON JOHNSON, FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Jason, in that same interview, the Treasury Secretary made  those comments about the market, he offered this, an absolutely guarantee  that a tax overhaul would be sign into law by the end of this year.  Is  that a reasonable time table?  Do you think they will get this done?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well certainly if you look at the performance this year with  other major pieces of legislation it doesn't seem reasonable.  But I  understand why the Secretary is saying what he's saying.</p><p> There is an absolute expectation that this has to be done in the political  market if you will.  And so I'm not incredibly optimistic that it happens  by the end of the year.  There certainly seems to be a mixed message coming  from some leaders on the Hill as to whether or not the deadline is the end  of the year.  But whether it's the end of the year or after the first of  the year, it must happen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Chris, do you agree with that that it must happen and that it  will happen?</p><p> LIU:  I agree with Senator McConnell who said it's more important that we  get it right instead of just running this through.  And I think it's  important to look at the details here and we don't really know yet  percentage is going to go to the super wealthy, how it's going to add to  the deficit whether it's really going to fix the idiosyncrasies in the tax  code right now.</p><p> And so putting it on an artificial deadline does not bode well for coming  up with good policy and that's really what the market wants to see right  now.  They really want to see the once in a generation tax reform proposal,  not another giveaway that just goes to the super wealthy.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, Chris considering -- it's Kevin Kelly here.  Considering you  spent time in the White House especially with President Obama, do you think  it's appropriate for a cabinet secretaries or anybody in this  administration to be talking about the impact on stock markets given that  they should be focusing on policy and talking about the implements, what it  could do to the real economy as opposed to really focusing on markets that  should do whatever they should be doing?</p><p> LIU:  That's exactly right.  It's one of the reasons why we in the Obama  Administration didn't talk about the stock market even though we had  significant gains as well because the market goes up and unfortunately it  goes down as well.</p><p> And it goes up or down for reasons that have nothing to do with Washington.   And if I were Secretary MNuchin, I would probably take my cues from the  leaders on the Hill as to what the timing should be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, I know.  I think that's a good point but at the same  time, $5.3 trillion in market value doesn't come out of air.  It's clear  that the market value that we've seen in these gains is partly due to  optimism over what President Trump is doing.  </p><p> He's rolled back an incredible amount of regulation and they're expecting  tax reform.  Are you saying $5.3 trillion in market value is just a  coincidence?</p><p> LIU:  Well I would say that it's based on the expectation something's  happening.  This is a recovery, economic recovery that began in early 2010  and we've had essentially seven straight years of economic growth.</p><p> There have been rollbacks of regulations but there hasn't been this  significant economic change that Donald Trump has promised yet.  So a lot  of this is --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we did see a 3.1 percent GDP the other day and GDP was  averaging about one and a half percent under President Obama.  So -- I mean  there's something to it that the economy is definitely better.  </p><p> You're (INAUDIBLE) in small business, do you see that Mike Murphy?  Do you  see things getting better?  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.  We see small business optimism out there, we see  startups, we see companies that are looking to disrupt existing industries  coming out hiring people, raising money, going out and creating -- using  technology to make our lives better.  So I think right now the optimism  that we see nationwide is something we haven't seen in a long time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jason, let me ask you this, in terms of this bill, if it gets  done in the first quarter, do you think that still has a positive impact?   If we don't see a bill on the president's desk by Thanksgiving, this is  going to be a problem for certainly into the 2018 election for the  republicans.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Sure.  Going back to the comment earlier that we shouldn't have  artificial deadlines.  I don't believe getting this done by the end of the  year or seeing that we need to get it done by the end of the year is an  artificial deadline because we know historically that very few things  happen in election year.</p><p> And as we all know, next year is an election year.  So Maria, into the  first quarter, maybe so but we know that you get much passed the first  quarter these guys don't like to do much in an election year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you're right, if they don't get it done maybe that's  -- they should move out because this is something that the American people  want, Lea Gabrielle.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.  Chris, Senator Schumer said our republican friends are  trying to hide what's in the tax bill that they don't want people to know.  </p><p> Is this just resistance sort of popping up already from the democrats on  this obstructionist because really tax reform is good for all Americans  right now, is it?</p><p> LIU:  A hundred percent agree tax reform is good.  What we have seen so far  is simply tax cuts and some of the initial estimates are that becoming 50  to 80 percent of the benefits would go to the top one percent.  Look --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's not true.  That's just not true.  I don't want to spew  out nonsense because 80 percent of the tax reform package going to the top  one percent is nonsense.</p><p> LIU:  An important issue to get right.  For instance, it's the state and  local tax deduction which is going to affect a lot republican members and  understanding the details of that is not just resistance, it's actually  trying to make sure that this is legitimate tax reform and there are so  many issues.  This is why this is hard and it's hard to get it right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're talking about a corporate rate of 20 percent.  If you  see the corporate rate go down from 35 percent to 20 percent, that will be  a positive for corporations and the idea is is that they are going to  reinvest in higher (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> KELLY:  It's small businesses.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Small business with 25 percent pass through rate, same thing  down from 39.6.  So this is a significant move.  He's also talking about  three brackets, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent --</p><p> MURPHY:  I mean, small businesses is like --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Doubling the standard deduction.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I'd like to point out, those aren't republican small  businesses, those are democrat, republican, American small businesses.  So  that impacts everybody not just one side.  This isn't a one side versus the  other.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the reason that I have to push back on that Chris  is because we were expecting the talking points after this plan and it's  just not true that 80 percent of the tax plan impacts the top one percent,  it's just not true and we have to make it clear.</p><p> LIU:  You know, the problem is, we don't have the details yet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p> LIU:  We don't have the -- we don't have the details yet and I think that's  the problem --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well we have the details that we just mentioned, we got three  brackets on the individual rates, we got a doubling of the standard  deduction, corporate rate of 20 percent, pass through rate of 25 percent,  and the elimination of most deductions.</p><p> LIU:  Well look, we don't really know what the impact is on average  Americans, we don't know what the size of the (INAUDIBLE) tax credit is  going to be, we don't understand all the other archaic idiosyncrasy that's  --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So then how can you say it benefits the one percent if you  don't even have the details?</p><p> LIU:  Well -- look, we're -- the folks that have looked at this are basing  this on the initial proposal.  Let's have a whole debate on this and let's  make sure we get this right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because this is -- we're watching President  Obama return to the campaign trail Chris to stump for democratic candidates  and governance races, of course, in New Jersey and in Virginia, out of next  month elections.</p><p> This development comes amid a shakeup at the DNC where several key long  time officials have lost their post.  The party's new chairman, Tom Perez  obviously preparing to host his first meeting since taking over the job  earlier this year.</p><p> You were among the 75 people nominated by Tom Perez to become the new at  large DNC member, what's behind the shakeup?  Tell us how you're feeling?   Congratulations by that nomination by the way Chris.</p><p> LIU:  Well look, there are about 400 members of the Democratic National  Committee.  The new chairman get to pick 75.  This is a time of change  within the Democratic Party and I think we need to admit that things  haven't gone as well as they should have over the last couple of years.</p><p> And so unfortunately when you bring new people in, some people that have  served for a while have to be moved and that's just part of change.  And  this is a big 10 party and change happens and change is good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, one thing that seems to be happening is that the  Democratic Party is being hijacked by the extreme left Chris.  </p><p> Are you going to be able to come up with a message that will resonate with  the broad American people, the population given the fact that you've got  Barrack Obama, you've got Bernie Sanders, you've got Elizabeth Warren going  to the extreme left and really hijacking what was a moderate party at one  point?</p><p> LIU:  Tom Perez has made a commitment that the democrats need to compete in  every seat from the school board to the Senate to the White House.</p><p> And we need to understand that we as a party can't have one monolithic  message.  That doesn't work in all state and certainly doesn't even work in  all rural areas versus urban areas as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  All right.  Gentlemen, thanks very  much for the conversation we appreciate you joining us this morning.  Chris  Liu.  Jason, good to see you as well.  We will talk with you soon  gentlemen.</p><p> Coming up, the head of Homeland Security is warning Americans of a new  threat, the concern over ISIS plotting another 9/11 next.  We are going to  tell you the details of what we know.  </p><p> Then Colin Kaepernick firing back at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the  new way he's lashing out against him straight ahead.  </p><p> A fired up morning thins morning, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A top U.S. security chief warning terror groups  are planning a major attack on the scale of 9/11.  Cheryl Casone with the  details now, Cheryl --</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Maria, good morning.  Acting Homeland Security  Secretary Elaine Duke saying it is clear that ISIS and other terror groups  are planning to take down planes as an aim to carry out another massive  attack.  Duke also saying terror groups have been using knife and van  attacks to keep their members engaged.</p><p> Well the head of American Express, one of the country's most prominent  African-American corporate leaders is leaving the company, Kenneth Chenault  depature caps a 16-year run at the credit card company.  He's going to be  succeeding a CEO by Stephen Squeri a three decade AmEx veteran.  Shares of  AmEx up 23 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, American cities are pulling all the stops in their bid to become home  to Amazon's second headquarters.  Stonecrest, Georgia has offered to change  its name to Amazon.  Tucson, Arizona tried to send a company a 21-foot  cactus.</p><p>Amazon has promised to invest $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs.  The  deadline to submit bids is today.  And, of course, check this out, New York  City lit up famous buildings including the Empire State Building and one  World Trade in Amazon's orange color last night trying to help seal the  deal.  Probably going to be a little more than light that's going to get  Amazon somewhere.</p><p> And then finally there's this, first lady Melania Trump is donating her  inaugural ball gown to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.   She is handing over the vanilla silk off the shoulder gown, it's got a slit  skirt.  The tradition first began Maria with Helen Taft back in 1912.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Cool.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Interesting.  Would you  go see the first lady's gown at the Smithsonian Lea?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think if I was already going to the Smithsonian then I would  happen to pass by and see the first lady's gown.</p><p> But I do think that this is really nice about making (INAUDIBLE) because it  gives you a sense of being able to even that you can't touch them, just  being able to sort of look at them and sort of have the essence of what it  must have been like to be there that day.  So I think it's wonderful that  they do this.</p><p> KELLY:  I think it also highlights the importance of the first lady, right?   I mean you go throughout history and you look at the contributions they've  made.  So it's nice that --</p><p> MURPHY:  The guy who's getting married in New York.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  I was going to say behind every great man is a better woman.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, says the guy who's getting married.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your upcoming nuptial.</p><p> KELLY:  Well she did get her dress last Friday so maybe I'm just kind of  high upbeat excited.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, she got the dress.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, I know.  So obviously I didn't see it but it was a fun and  exciting experience.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I was going to say, let's see a live TV picture of this and get  you in really big trouble.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep following all of that.  Coming up next  though, a real scare in the sky to tell you about, more video of the risky  fly-by stunt that got pilot suspended, that's coming up.</p><p> And then GE's new chief taking away company cars and cancelling fancy  retreats.  The new cost cutting direction for General Electric ahead of its  earnings tomorrow, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric's new CEO John Flannery making  some changes starting with some old favorites.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details, Tracee --</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.  You know,  John Flannery, he's only been on the job since August 1st but he's already  making some big changes.</p><p> One of his first belt tightening moves was to ground GE's fleet of six  business jets which was a favorite of former GE CEO Jeff Immelt who used to  have an empty private jet fly next to his just as a spare and that's just  the beginning.</p><p> Bob Nardelli, former Chrysler CEO and Home CEO was on the show yesterday  and here's what he had to say.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO HOME DEPOT &amp; CHRYSLER:  They have to get their  fundamental businesses that are left to get some growth.  They got to get  growth, they've got to get top line growth, they got to get productivity,  they got to get innovation.</p><p> The key to GE over the last 16 years Maria as we've seen that goes out have  been a lot more than the goes in.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARRASCO:  And Nardelli worked at GE for several years.  And according to  \"The Wall Street Journal,\" next month Flannery is expected to unveil the  results of a strategic review that includes thousands of corporate level  job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure.</p><p> He is shutting down research centers in Shanghai, Munich, and Rio democrats  Janiero.  A GE spokesperson said:</p><p> TEXT: The company will continue to have an intense focus on our global  operations and customer base.</p><p> The company is expected to report quarterly reports tomorrow.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at that stock ahead of those --</p><p> CARRASCO:  Hasn't been good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ahead of those numbers.  The stock has been cut in half from  the highs.  No, wait a minute.  Let's just underline what you just said  Tracee, he had a separate jet flying behind his jet on business trips and  the jet flying behind him was empty.</p><p> CARRASCO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he did that for what reason?</p><p> CARRASCO:  Just in case there were any issues with the private jet he was  already on.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I mean --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I flew in the navy and I have a commanding officer who made me  take a jet to an air show because it was his hometown and he wanted to make  sure that if his jet, if there's anything wrong with it he couldn't fly in  the air show but there was a spare there.  So I've seen this before, pretty  wasteful.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  But the biggest problem is they have shareholders, right,  that they're held accountable too and I'm sorry --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a public company.</p><p> KELLY:  Listen, you don't need to fly a private jet next to you.  Listen,  if your plane has mechanical issues, guess what, then we'll figure out and  we'll rent a private jet that's there to take you back to wherever you need  to go.  You don't -- yes, exactly.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  Well here's the problem, the board.  If I was a member on the  board, how can you -- you've got to be held accountable.  I mean, they --  like coming out of GE tomorrow and whether they cut the dividend, that's  one of the biggest concerns that shareholders are having right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, sure is.</p><p> KELLY:  But also what is this board doing if they're allowing this, right?   Shareholder capital --</p><p> MURPHY:  And (INAUDIBLE) I think for an old company like GE that's trying  to figure out how to stay relevant in this new economy, I think something  like this coming out makes it really hard for shareholders to believe in  this.</p><p> And you could see people wanting to sell this and look at company if they  are really on the cutting edge of technology.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that are growing.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  But they are looking for places to trim the fat just like  Tracee mentioned, shutting down some of those research centers and sort of  trying to consolidate their resources.  So at least we're moving forward in  that way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've got to.  We'll see what the company says tomorrow.  GE  reports at around 8:30a.m. in the morning, tomorrow morning on its third  quarter. And, of course, a speculation is around that dividend.  Tracee  Carrasco, thank you.  </p><p> We will take a break.  When we come back, months after going public, Blue  Apron is laying off hundreds of employees.

We want to know.  Fortune is  debuting its future 50 list today, covering the most innovative companies  prime for explosive growth.  Fox Business has the exclusive first look at  the list.  </p><p> Coming in at number five on Fortunes' Future 50 Leaders, medical robotics  leader, Intuitive Surgical, fourth is the king of the stream, Netflix.   Number three on this list, Mark Zuckerberg's dorm project turns social  media titan, Facebook.  Elon Musk, electric automaker Tesla, cruising into  the second spot.  And topping the list is cloud computing giant,  Salesforce, joining us right now in a Fox Business Exclusive, Working  Deputy Editor, Brian O'Keefe.  Brian, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR OF FORTUNE:  My pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, a lot of those names, obviously, very familiar and growth  stories that we all know, how did you come up with this list, what are the  growth metrics that you used?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  So we worked with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), they were our  partners in doing this.  They did an incredible amount of number crunching,  and they looked at 15 years of financial data and they scream for all 2,300  U.S. public companies.  And they really looked at a couple of things.  One  is the market potential of all these companies, what the market is betting,  how much growth the market is betting and assigning their value.  </p><p> And then they also dove into the company's themselves and looked at people,  structure, their technology and investments, they used artificial  intelligence, natural language processing to look at 70,000 10Ks and look  at the way those companies talked about themselves, if they talked about  future and investment and long-term thinking.  And they did a lot of  backtesting and looked at what correlated with real growth over time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's interesting that Salesforce is the number one -- in  the number one spot.  Were you surprised with that, Mike?</p><p> MURPHY:  I was, for sure, because, you know, when you think about growth,  you hear the fangs.  You know, you hear about Facebook, which is there but  Amazon, Netflix, which is there, Google.  So, the way this is -- I think  this is going to create a lot of controversy from people who are saying,  you know, like, oh, here's the big apple, we don't see therearound.</p><p> KELLY:  Apple didn't make the list, actually.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Apple didn't make the list.</p><p> KELLY:  Apple did not make the list, in part to its recent increase  emphasis on paying dividends on over reinvestment.</p><p> O'KEEFE: Yes, I mean, you're seeing -- I mean, Apple is the big exception,  right?  That's, you know, we noted that.  And, you know, Apple is obviously  still an incredible performer but they are piling up cash, they are paying  out dividends under some pressure to shareholders and that's not really a  formula for future growth.  </p><p> You know, you want to see a company, not that Apple is not doing well, but  you want to see them putting it in to new technology, Salesforce, to your  point, you know, they are -- Marc Benioff keeps that company really focused  on the future, they're investing in artificial intelligence and they're  making acquisitions on --</p><p> KELLY:  And I think the important thing about Salesforce, if you look it as  -- it didn't surprise me one bit about this, because he's actually struck  deals and partnerships with other companies like IBM to have a stronger,  better, platform for his customers, right?  So for insurance companies, if  there's a hail storm, they're going to use IBMs (INAUDIBLE) to notify all  the policyholders, so he's done a very good job especially on the  acquisition side.  So if they had a hole on their business model, he went  out and bought them.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  To look at the list overall, though, you know, a lot of people  say the past performance is the best indication of future success and  that's really not the way that you created this list, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that's really, kind of, the whole reason we did  create this list, is that past performance isn't the indicator of future  success and today's environment, things are changing so much faster,  technologies speeding up the pace of change, that we felt like in BCG, felt  like, we need a better metric to do that.  So that, you know, most of the  time, you're measuring a company on.  </p><p> You're trying to project the future on what they've been doing recently.   And this is like really -- that's why it's diving into, sort of, the DNA of  these companies and how they operate and how they talk and how they think  and trying to do that in a scientific way.  And, you know, looking at the  structure of the company, I mean, the hard reality is that younger  companies tend to grow faster, I mean, not just smaller companies, but  tightly-managed younger companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And founder companies, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  And founder companies, a lot of the time, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You also put his list of Future 50 Challengers.  We just showed  it on the screen.  These are companies that are on the fast-track for  growth but aren't quite there yet.  So how did you come up with this list?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Well, the secret about the Future 50 is (INAUDIBLE) list of 25.   So we have the 25 big companies and the 25 challengers, is what we called  it, BCG, didn't want to -- if you're screening for growth, you're going to  naturally get smaller companies, so that's why we did two separate screens  to get the big companies that are still growing.  The challengers are  really the companies that are on the rise, not necessarily small companies,  but, you know, it can be like, $5 to 10-billion market cap companies.  And  you see a lot of software companies on the list overall but especially on  the challenger's list, I mean, it's really like software is eating the  world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what Marc Andreessen said years ago, you know, software  eats the world.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, it's still true.  It's true, maybe more than ever.  I mean,  it's, you know, like Veeva Systems, the number one company in the  challenger's list.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Workday has been taking market share from, like, the  oracles of the world for years.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Workday is huge.  I mean, obviously, it's a huge stock, market  cap has shut up.  And yes, so these are companies that they're displacing  traditional systems and they're doing it with software technology.</p><p> KELLY:  So on Workday, it's a perineal emanate target, right?  And I just  wanted to highlight the point you said, though, earlier, 64 percent of the  companies in this list are software or online service providers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  That highlights that this is the wave and this is the future of  where we are going.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You want to find growth, that's where it is.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, and a bit in every industry.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And one of the things that you have said is that, a lot of  companies that are using artificial intelligence are, sort of, higher on  the list, but you also used artificial intelligence in developing this  list, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that was one of the really cool things that BCG did,  is use this natural language processing to troll through 70,000 10Ks = like  200,000 different earnings calls, transcripts, and really look at the  language that the management uses to talk about how they managed their own  business.   And so, and, you know, I don't -- I don't personally know the details of  how the artificial intelligence did it, but it correlates certain words and  the way they come together with performance.</p><p> MURPHY:  So, how far down did you guys dig?  Like, how low did you go?   Because a company like Salesforces which is number one, they have a  venture, we ran a venture capital funds.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Right.</p><p> MURPHY:  So Salesforce is actively out there looking to acquire early-stage  start-ups.  Is there another 50 list of, kind of, the 50 (INAUDIBLE) that's  going start-ups or early stage companies?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Maybe we will expand that out.  But one thing the BCG did do, was  look at the investments that company's making, compared to high performing  DC funds to, sort of, get a sense of like how good their investments are.   So, that's an interesting way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're hitting on something so important right now.  I'm so  glad you brought it up, Mike, because you're right, Salesforce has an arm  that invests and acquires smaller companies.  That's why a lot of these  companies as Amazon, you know, other big technology --</p><p> KELLY:  Intel.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Intel, you're seeing large tech right now, have venture capital  arm and they are acquiring some of the smaller, no-names out there.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  You know, we have a story on Salesforce that goes deeper into  what they're doing.  They bought 55 companies since 2006.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  And Marc Benioff, you know, a lot of times, like, maybe he  doesn't even exactly know what they're going to do with the company but he  knows there's an interesting technology and they make it an acquisition,  they figure out how it's going to impact their business.</p><p> KELLY:  Is there a super surprised company, for you, because I'm looking at  this list and I'm not surprised by it, but I think people could be as the  intercontinental exchange that, you know, they run the New York stock  exchange, but really, those companies, the exchange have been focusing on  data, licensing, it's not really  --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of (INAUDIBLE) mergers.</p><p> KELLY:  Exactly.  So, is there a company on this list that surprised you  the most?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Surprised me the most, I mean, I'm a little surprised -- Monster  Beverage is a really interesting company.</p><p> KELLY:  Number 20 on that list.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Because they have been growing fast for 20 years, and, you know,  I don't drink Monster Beverage drinks, but a lot of people do.  They're  really smart about how they market their brand, they don't really do a lot  of advertising but they do a lot of really cool, sort of, sponsorship  stuff.  And they just, you know, they keep growing that company year after  year.</p><p> KELLY:  And the next leg of growth for Monster Beverage is over in China  and Asia, so that's where they're looking to go so if you follow the stock  close, you can see they've dominated North America and they've slowly been  making inroads and smart positioning in Asia.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look at that chart.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  You know we have MasterCard and Visa on the list.  And I think  that's really interesting because they seemed like, you know, it's the card  in your wallet.  But they're really doing a lot of innovative things.  They  are trying to be, you know, the future of payments in all different forms.</p><p> MURPHY:  And when we talk about big tech companies or fin-tech companies  doing acquisitions, early-stage investing.  But there's also companies like  Campbell Soup has (INAUDIBLE) so it's not just big tech that's looking to  acquire small innovative companies.  I think it's across all diferent -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Campbell Soup, wow.  And these guys are computer guys like you.   We had Ann Winblad on from Winblad, who is a great venture capitalist.  And  she said, I'm competing with the arms of the soft, you know, of the  SoftBanks, not SoftBanks, of the --</p><p> MURPHY:  The large corporations.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The large corporation.  The largest technology -- </p><p> KELLY:  Imagine if the repatriation happens, of the taxes of all those  trillions of dollars overseas to these companies that they can then re- invest since small businesses start up, things that are happening.  I mean,  not to tie this into the whole tax reform overhaul policy but that could be  a good next leg of growth for this company.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  First, they have to find the right things to invest in.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, of course.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  These lists are helpful.  Brian, thank you so much, Brian  O'Keefe joining us.  We wanted to also -- should we take a look at IBM real  quick.  I mean, IBM was obviously stalled in terms of its revenue growth  for 22 quarters.  You saw a decline in revenue but yesterday, check out  that stock yesterday.  Nine percent, one of the reasons the Dow Industrials  hit 23,000.  I just wanted to mention that, is this a turning point for  IBM?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't think so.  I think when you see that type of move, so much  of the volume in the markets right now is computer driven or algorithmic  trading.  That, to me, smells like a short covering -- short squeeze.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep watching IBM.  Obviously, IBM, GE, two- story stocks that we want to look at today.  Brian, good to see you, thank  you.  Coming up next, the fight is growing over Catalonia's push for  independence.  How the Spanish government is trying to stop the region's  succession, that's next.  And then a terrifying close call, more video of  that scary fly by that put 200 passengers at risk.  We'll tell you all  about it, back in a moment, straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Markets are down this morning after a huge day  yesterday.  Dow Industrials' expected to be down better than 100 points.   No surprise.  The market crossed 23,000 yesterday for the first time ever  in a big rally, and, of course, we're up to better than $5 trillion in  market value since the election.  </p><p> A couple names on the move, Gilead Sciences; the stock right now is up  almost three percent in the premarket after winning FDA approval for a new  cancer gene therapy -- used to treat lymphoma.  The pharmaceutical giant  will sell the treatment at $373,000.  It's only the second gene therapy to  earn approval from the FDA on that.  Novartis brought the first drug of  this class to market back in August.</p><p>EBay shares this morning on the move after delivering third-quarter  earnings after the bell last night.  The results were roughly in line but  fourth-quarter guidance's disappointed.  EBay is revamping its online  marketplace amid tough competition from Amazon.  Stock, right now, taken a  real hit down 6-1/2 percent in the premarket.  </p><p> And then, there's Spain, the government there is set to activate an  emergency measure to take control of Catalonia, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So, Spain's government calling a special cabinet for  the weekend to activate this measure -- it allows for the central  government to take over the semiautonomous power of any of the country's17  regions.  Now, this comes after Catalonia's leader said, Separatist  lawmakers, can vote in favor of declaration of independence.  The measure  has never been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in  Spain.  </p><p> Well, an Air Berlin pilot is in big trouble.  He performed a risky flying  stunt with 200 passengers aboard.  You're watching the video of it right  now.  Reports say he buzzed Dusseldorf Airport terminal in a maneuver that  was met to mark the bankrupt last Trans-Atlantic flight.  Well, a pilot of  another told Reuters that a go-around should only be performed for its  operations, or safety aviation officials are looking at this video and  looking into this incident.  </p><p> Well, Blue Apron, they are tightening their belt.  The company has laid out  six percent of the workforce, that's about 300 workers, as part of a  company or organization.  Blue Apron has struggled since it went public  back in June with its stock price cut in half since then.  Competition from  a rival, a big one that would-be Amazon.  There is the year to date chart,  you can see it on your screen.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Sea World is laying off 350 workers due to low attendance at its  parks -- mainly in Orlando and San Diego.  They've been trying to rebuild  the brand solving protests over its treatment of their killer whales.   Shares of Sea World, down more than 34 percent year to date.  </p><p> And then, finally this, Snickers are getting a facelift, actually three  facelifts.  The candy company announcing they're going to release a line of  three new flavors to combat a number of different, well, emotional issues.   Feeling irritable, wimpy, indecisive?  Well, they've got the cure.  These  three bars: espresso, fiery, and salty and sweet, Maria.  Right now, I  think I want the espresso.  I'm a little tired.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Yes, the expresso sounds good.  </p><p> KELLY:  Thanks to wimpy for fiery, right?  Like, I like spicy stuff, but it  doesn't mean that I'm a wimp.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's taking it personally.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  So -- but personally, I'm really concerned about the espresso  one, because if you're irritable, I think the last thing you actually need  is to have some more caffeine.  More caffeine.  I always like those names,  though.  I actually find that really attractive.  When you're in a store  and you're looking at candy and you're like, yes, you know, I kind of feel  irritable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do you buy right there?  Or will you buy it because of  that?  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  No.  Only if I really want it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking out over  the national anthem protest.  What he said to players and how they're  reacting, next.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a big night at Wrigley Field last night.  The Cubs  fought for their playoff lives and they survived.  Jared Max with the  highlights, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey!  Good morning, Maria.  I know  the Dodgers are only one win from the World Series, but just imagine the  Cubs came all the way back to win the NLC.  Yes, they did what they had to  do last night in a do or die game 4. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> (BASEBALL GAMEPLAY)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Javier Baez at two home runs; Wilson Contreras also (INAUDIBLE) for  the Cubs.  Dodgers would blast from Cody Dellinger and Justin Turner, but  the Cubs win.  Cubs win!  Cubs win, 3-2.  So, there will be a game 5.   Tonight, at Wrigley Field, the Cubs pick Jose Montana.  The Dodgers'  Clayton Kershaw L.A. leads three games to one.  </p><p>New York Yankees rookie, Aaron Judge, a hero again last night.  A third- inning double off Astros Ace, Dallas Keuchel, gave the Yanks a 2-0 lead.   Then, at the seventh inning, fellow baby bomber, Gary Sanchez, smashes a  solo home run against Brad Peacock -- third home run this postseason for  Sanchez.  Yankees' finally got reminisce its Dallas Keuchel and Masahiro  Tanaka.  7-shutout innings, 5-0, Yanks win.  </p><p> Series goes back to Houston where the Astros won the first two games.   Here's to start, Justin Verlander tomorrow night, and Yankees turn to Luis  Severino.  Yanks, one win from their 41st American League pennant.  </p><p> Hey, you know when somebody says, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.   Well, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the opposite yesterday,  regarding players choices to stand or kneel for the national anthem.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER FOR THE NFL:  Everyone should stand for the  national anthem, that's an important part of our policy.  It's also an  important part of our game that we all take great pride in, it's also  important for us to honor our flag and to our country, and we think our  fans expect us to do that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAX:  Everyone should stand, not must stand.  While Goodell said he just  wants to keep the politics out of football.  President Trump, responded on  Twitter, \"NFL, too much talk, not enough action.  Stand for the national  anthem.\"  And while Colin Kaepernick, the first anthem kneeler, remained  silent except for retweets about not enough attention being given to what  he says police brutality against people of color. The Seahawks' Michael  Bennett isn't interested in discussing how to fix these social issues.   While the NFL team owners are trying to.  </p><p> Why?  He says, \"I don't think we can work alongside them until we address  that issue.  I think the issue with Kaepernick is the start to a  conversation.  If they want us to be open to what they want, the dialogue,  then that's something that needs to be on the table right there.\"  So,  Kaepernick first and then the issues.  </p><p> Some kneel, some protests, some put their money where their mouth is, like  the Philadelphia Eagles' Chris Long who has supported teammates protesting  the national anthem but is also doing something else.  Chris Long of the  Eagles, who had donated his first six-game paychecks this season to fund  two scholarships at a prep school in Charlottesville where he grew up is  now donating the rest of his 2017 NFL salary.  Ten more paychecks to help  fund education to make it for folks who are -- don't get the opportunities  in certain cities -- ten weeks of paychecks going to this in cities of St.  Louis, Boston and also Philadelphia.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is great.  </p><p> KELLY:  Leading by example.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Football has a 10 for Tomorrow campaign.  Good on him for that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, go Yanks!  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sorry, Max.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MURPHY:  Yes, this should be the go Yanks.</p><p> MAX:  Some Mets fans started this as soon when the Yankees beat the Mets,  and he got Wednesday missing.  Somehow, the Yankees do this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Mets are still amazing.  Sorry.  All right.  Jared Max.   Catch Jared's sports reports on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7,\" SiriusXM 115.  I  want to bring you this breaking news: the president is tweeting this  morning.  Here is what he said, \"Republicans are going for big budget  approval today.  The first step toward massive tax cuts.  I think we have  the votes, but who knows?\"  Uh-oh!</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> KELLY:  Who knows?  Caveat.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I guess they need the caveat in this day and age.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, cities are mailing in their bid to  Amazon.  We're taking a look at the other crazy stumps from towns competing  for technology giants' second headquarters, wait until you see this.   That's next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Happy  Thursday to you.  Thanks for being with us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is  Thursday, October 19th.  Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  A market milestone yesterday.

Thank you so  much and good morning everybody.  Happy Thursday to you.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Thursday, October 19th.  Your top stories right now,  6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thirty years ago a market milestone and yesterday, a major market milestone  as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARTIROMO:  The DOW Jones Industrial Average closing above 23,000 for the  first time ever yesterday.  It was the f1st record close since President  Trump took office.  An amazing momentum market.</p><p>Earnings driving the gains yesterday, the optimism over tax cuts has  underpinned market gains for months as well and we could be one step closer  to it today.  The Senate gears up for the budget vote later today.   President Trump is calling this a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will be the largest tax  cut in the history of our country.  I focus on tax cuts because it's such  an important weapon to get our country really moving.  </p><p>So we'll go from being one of the highest tax nations in the world to one  of the lowest tax.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in my opinion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got all of the updates coming up.  Geopolitical tensions  this morning however weighing on markets.  Pulling things back from  yesterday's all time high.  </p><p>DOW Industrial expected to be down about 80 points at the opening of  trading, down about a third of a percent, Nasdaq down two-thirds of a  percent right now.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the action, all the major averages  down as you see there with the FTSE100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC  Krones down almost half of a percent and the DAX Index down better than one  half of one percent.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Japan  which was up again taking a cue from the U.S., up half of a percent.</p><p>A brand new terrorism threat to report, the Department of Homeland Security  is warning that ISIS is plotting another 9/11 style attack, details on this  terrifying plan aiming to inflict mass casualties.  We've got all the  details.</p><p>And a scary scene at the German airport, an Air Berlin Jet does a dangerous  fly-by with 200 passengers on board, the fallout from the active defiance  coming up.</p><p>NFL Commission Roger Goodell refusing to take a tougher stance on anthem  protests and nobody is happy with Goodell's comments even Colin Kaepernick,  he fired back without opening his mouth.  We'll tell you what he said.</p><p>General Electric eyes major cost cuts, \"The Wall Street Journal\" this  morning reporting some of the excessive spending at the company including  Former CEO Jeff Immelt flying an empty jet next to his jet as a back up  during his 16-year tenure.  Wow.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle is here.  Kelly and Company  Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly is here.  And Rosecliff Capital CEO, Mike  Murphy is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Great to  be here.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Thursday everybody.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We have 5,000 foot jump since President Trump took office in  the DOW but this tax plan, man, I'll tell you, we're going to have to see  what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely, 23,000 and counting.  I mean, come on.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  And you know what's fascinating is actually  Janet Yellen is due to have a meeting today at the White House with  President Trump.</p><p>And so whatever happens at the Fed and whoever they pick next is going to  have significant impacts on the markets and one of the reasons why you can  see that is because the Fed has been so accommodative to this market.</p><p>You've seen asset inflation, I mean valuations are at all time highs.  So  it's a fascinating aspect because Secretary MNuchin has reported that he  doesn't like Kevin Warsh because he think he could royal markets, right?</p><p>He wasn't for quantitative using, he actually was very adamant against it.   And so Jerome Powell is more accommodative. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We may know this week or next who the president decides on,  we're going to get to all of that coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story this hour and that is the market milestone,  23,000.  The DOW Industrial closed above the 23,000 mark for the first time  ever yesterday.  Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin though made an important  comment throughout the day warning that all of those games could be in  jeopardy should Congress fail to pass tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY TEXT: </p><p>There is no question that the rally in the stock market has based into it  reasonably high expectations of us getting tax cuts and tax reform done.   It also has based into it optimism on regulatory relief which they begun to  see and there's expectations.  So I think to the extent we get the tax deal  done, the stock market will go up higher but there's no question in my mind  if we don't get it done, you're going to see a reversal of the significant  amount of these gains.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  sounds about right, the Senate is expected to vote today on a  budget that would allow the Chamber to pass a tax bill with just 51 votes  instead of the 60 needed for major legislation.  </p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Former Chief Strategist for  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, his senate and president campaign, Jason Johnson is  with us along with Former Deputy Secretary of Labor in the Obama  Administration, now a Senior Fellow at the University of Virginia Miller  Center, Chris Liu.  Good to see you both gentlemen, Thank you so much for  joining us this morning.</p><p>CHRIS LIU, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LABOR, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION:  Thank  you. </p><p>JASON JOHNSON, FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Jason, in that same interview, the Treasury Secretary made  those comments about the market, he offered this, an absolutely guarantee  that a tax overhaul would be sign into law by the end of this year.  Is  that a reasonable time table?  Do you think they will get this done?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Well certainly if you look at the performance this year with  other major pieces of legislation it doesn't seem reasonable.  But I  understand why the Secretary is saying what he's saying.</p><p>There is an absolute expectation that this has to be done in the political  market if you will.  And so I'm not incredibly optimistic that it happens  by the end of the year.  There certainly seems to be a mixed message coming  from some leaders on the Hill as to whether or not the deadline is the end  of the year.  But whether it's the end of the year or after the first of  the year, it must happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chris, do you agree with that that it must happen and that it  will happen?</p><p>LIU:  I agree with Senator McConnell who said it's more important that we  get it right instead of just running this through.  And I think it's  important to look at the details here and we don't really know yet  percentage is going to go to the super wealthy, how it's going to add to  the deficit whether it's really going to fix the idiosyncrasies in the tax  code right now.</p><p>And so putting it on an artificial deadline does not bode well for coming  up with good policy and that's really what the market wants to see right  now.  They really want to see the once in a generation tax reform proposal,  not another giveaway that just goes to the super wealthy.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, Chris considering -- it's Kevin Kelly here.  Considering you  spent time in the White House especially with President Obama, do you think  it's appropriate for a cabinet secretaries or anybody in this  administration to be talking about the impact on stock markets given that  they should be focusing on policy and talking about the implements, what it  could do to the real economy as opposed to really focusing on markets that  should do whatever they should be doing?</p><p>LIU:  That's exactly right.  It's one of the reasons why we in the Obama  Administration didn't talk about the stock market even though we had  significant gains as well because the market goes up and unfortunately it  goes down as well.</p><p>And it goes up or down for reasons that have nothing to do with Washington.   And if I were Secretary MNuchin, I would probably take my cues from the  leaders on the Hill as to what the timing should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, I know.  I think that's a good point but at the same  time, $5.3 trillion in market value doesn't come out of air.  It's clear  that the market value that we've seen in these gains is partly due to  optimism over what President Trump is doing.  </p><p>He's rolled back an incredible amount of regulation and they're expecting  tax reform.  Are you saying $5.3 trillion in market value is just a  coincidence?</p><p>LIU:  Well I would say that it's based on the expectation something's  happening.  This is a recovery, economic recovery that began in early 2010  and we've had essentially seven straight years of economic growth.</p><p>There have been rollbacks of regulations but there hasn't been this  significant economic change that Donald Trump has promised yet.  So a lot  of this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we did see a 3.1 percent GDP the other day and GDP was  averaging about one and a half percent under President Obama.  So -- I mean  there's something to it that the economy is definitely better.  </p><p>You're (INAUDIBLE) in small business, do you see that Mike Murphy?  Do you  see things getting better?  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  We see small business optimism out there, we see  startups, we see companies that are looking to disrupt existing industries  coming out hiring people, raising money, going out and creating -- using  technology to make our lives better.  So I think right now the optimism  that we see nationwide is something we haven't seen in a long time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason, let me ask you this, in terms of this bill, if it gets  done in the first quarter, do you think that still has a positive impact?   If we don't see a bill on the president's desk by Thanksgiving, this is  going to be a problem for certainly into the 2018 election for the  republicans.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Sure.  Going back to the comment earlier that we shouldn't have  artificial deadlines.  I don't believe getting this done by the end of the  year or seeing that we need to get it done by the end of the year is an  artificial deadline because we know historically that very few things  happen in election year.</p><p>And as we all know, next year is an election year.  So Maria, into the  first quarter, maybe so but we know that you get much passed the first  quarter these guys don't like to do much in an election year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you're right, if they don't get it done maybe that's  -- they should move out because this is something that the American people  want, Lea Gabrielle.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.  Chris, Senator Schumer said our republican friends are  trying to hide what's in the tax bill that they don't want people to know.  </p><p>Is this just resistance sort of popping up already from the democrats on  this obstructionist because really tax reform is good for all Americans  right now, is it?</p><p>LIU:  A hundred percent agree tax reform is good.  What we have seen so far  is simply tax cuts and some of the initial estimates are that becoming 50  to 80 percent of the benefits would go to the top one percent.  Look --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not true.  That's just not true.  I don't want to spew  out nonsense because 80 percent of the tax reform package going to the top  one percent is nonsense.</p><p>LIU:  An important issue to get right.  For instance, it's the state and  local tax deduction which is going to affect a lot republican members and  understanding the details of that is not just resistance, it's actually  trying to make sure that this is legitimate tax reform and there are so  many issues.  This is why this is hard and it's hard to get it right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about a corporate rate of 20 percent.  If you  see the corporate rate go down from 35 percent to 20 percent, that will be  a positive for corporations and the idea is is that they are going to  reinvest in higher (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KELLY:  It's small businesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Small business with 25 percent pass through rate, same thing  down from 39.6.  So this is a significant move.  He's also talking about  three brackets, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent --</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean, small businesses is like --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I'd like to point out, those aren't republican small  businesses, those are democrat, republican, American small businesses.  So  that impacts everybody not just one side.  This isn't a one side versus the  other.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the reason that I have to push back on that Chris  is because we were expecting the talking points after this plan and it's  just not true that 80 percent of the tax plan impacts the top one percent,  it's just not true and we have to make it clear.</p><p>LIU:  You know, the problem is, we don't have the details yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>LIU:  We don't have the -- we don't have the details yet and I think that's  the problem --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well we have the details that we just mentioned, we got three  brackets on the individual rates, we got a doubling of the standard  deduction, corporate rate of 20 percent, pass through rate of 25 percent,  and the elimination of most deductions.</p><p>LIU:  Well look, we don't really know what the impact is on average  Americans, we don't know what the size of the (INAUDIBLE) tax credit is  going to be, we don't understand all the other archaic idiosyncrasy that's  --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then how can you say it benefits the one percent if you  don't even have the details?</p><p>LIU:  Well -- look, we're -- the folks that have looked at this are basing  this on the initial proposal.  Let's have a whole debate on this and let's  make sure we get this right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because this is -- we're watching President  Obama return to the campaign trail Chris to stump for democratic candidates  and governance races, of course, in New Jersey and in Virginia, out of next  month elections.</p><p>This development comes amid a shakeup at the DNC where several key long  time officials have lost their post.  The party's new chairman, Tom Perez  obviously preparing to host his first meeting since taking over the job  earlier this year.</p><p>You were among the 75 people nominated by Tom Perez to become the new at  large DNC member, what's behind the shakeup?  Tell us how you're feeling?   Congratulations by that nomination by the way Chris.</p><p>LIU:  Well look, there are about 400 members of the Democratic National  Committee.  The new chairman get to pick 75.  This is a time of change  within the Democratic Party and I think we need to admit that things  haven't gone as well as they should have over the last couple of years.</p><p>And so unfortunately when you bring new people in, some people that have  served for a while have to be moved and that's just part of change.  And  this is a big 10 party and change happens and change is good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, one thing that seems to be happening is that the  Democratic Party is being hijacked by the extreme left Chris.  </p><p>Are you going to be able to come up with a message that will resonate with  the broad American people, the population given the fact that you've got  Barrack Obama, you've got Bernie Sanders, you've got Elizabeth Warren going  to the extreme left and really hijacking what was a moderate party at one  point?</p><p>LIU:  Tom Perez has made a commitment that the democrats need to compete in  every seat from the school board to the Senate to the White House.</p><p>And we need to understand that we as a party can't have one monolithic  message.  That doesn't work in all state and certainly doesn't even work in  all rural areas versus urban areas as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  All right.  Gentlemen, thanks very  much for the conversation we appreciate you joining us this morning.  Chris  Liu.  Jason, good to see you as well.  We will talk with you soon  gentlemen.</p><p>Coming up, the head of Homeland Security is warning Americans of a new  threat, the concern over ISIS plotting another 9/11 next.  We are going to  tell you the details of what we know.  </p><p>Then Colin Kaepernick firing back at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the  new way he's lashing out against him straight ahead.  </p><p>A fired up morning thins morning, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A top U.S. security chief warning terror groups  are planning a major attack on the scale of 9/11.  Cheryl Casone with the  details now, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Maria, good morning.  Acting Homeland Security  Secretary Elaine Duke saying it is clear that ISIS and other terror groups  are planning to take down planes as an aim to carry out another massive  attack.  Duke also saying terror groups have been using knife and van  attacks to keep their members engaged.</p><p>Well the head of American Express, one of the country's most prominent  African-American corporate leaders is leaving the company, Kenneth Chenault  depature caps a 16-year run at the credit card company.  He's going to be  succeeding a CEO by Stephen Squeri a three decade AmEx veteran.  Shares of  AmEx up 23 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, American cities are pulling all the stops in their bid to become home  to Amazon's second headquarters.  Stonecrest, Georgia has offered to change  its name to Amazon.  Tucson, Arizona tried to send a company a 21-foot  cactus.</p><p>Amazon has promised to invest $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs.  The  deadline to submit bids is today.  And, of course, check this out, New York  City lit up famous buildings including the Empire State Building and one  World Trade in Amazon's orange color last night trying to help seal the  deal.  Probably going to be a little more than light that's going to get  Amazon somewhere.</p><p>And then finally there's this, first lady Melania Trump is donating her  inaugural ball gown to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.   She is handing over the vanilla silk off the shoulder gown, it's got a slit  skirt.  The tradition first began Maria with Helen Taft back in 1912.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Cool.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Interesting.  Would you  go see the first lady's gown at the Smithsonian Lea?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think if I was already going to the Smithsonian then I would  happen to pass by and see the first lady's gown.</p><p>But I do think that this is really nice about making (INAUDIBLE) because it  gives you a sense of being able to even that you can't touch them, just  being able to sort of look at them and sort of have the essence of what it  must have been like to be there that day.  So I think it's wonderful that  they do this.</p><p>KELLY:  I think it also highlights the importance of the first lady, right?   I mean you go throughout history and you look at the contributions they've  made.  So it's nice that --</p><p>MURPHY:  The guy who's getting married in New York.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I was going to say behind every great man is a better woman.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, says the guy who's getting married.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your upcoming nuptial.</p><p>KELLY:  Well she did get her dress last Friday so maybe I'm just kind of  high upbeat excited.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, she got the dress.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I know.  So obviously I didn't see it but it was a fun and  exciting experience.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I was going to say, let's see a live TV picture of this and get  you in really big trouble.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep following all of that.  Coming up next  though, a real scare in the sky to tell you about, more video of the risky  fly-by stunt that got pilot suspended, that's coming up.</p><p>And then GE's new chief taking away company cars and cancelling fancy  retreats.  The new cost cutting direction for General Electric ahead of its  earnings tomorrow, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric's new CEO John Flannery making  some changes starting with some old favorites.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details, Tracee --</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.  You know,  John Flannery, he's only been on the job since August 1st but he's already  making some big changes.</p><p>One of his first belt tightening moves was to ground GE's fleet of six  business jets which was a favorite of former GE CEO Jeff Immelt who used to  have an empty private jet fly next to his just as a spare and that's just  the beginning.</p><p>Bob Nardelli, former Chrysler CEO and Home CEO was on the show yesterday  and here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO HOME DEPOT &amp; CHRYSLER:  They have to get their  fundamental businesses that are left to get some growth.  They got to get  growth, they've got to get top line growth, they got to get productivity,  they got to get innovation.</p><p>The key to GE over the last 16 years Maria as we've seen that goes out have  been a lot more than the goes in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARRASCO:  And Nardelli worked at GE for several years.  And according to  \"The Wall Street Journal,\" next month Flannery is expected to unveil the  results of a strategic review that includes thousands of corporate level  job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure.</p><p>He is shutting down research centers in Shanghai, Munich, and Rio democrats  Janiero.  A GE spokesperson said:</p><p>TEXT: The company will continue to have an intense focus on our global  operations and customer base.</p><p>The company is expected to report quarterly reports tomorrow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at that stock ahead of those --</p><p>CARRASCO:  Hasn't been good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ahead of those numbers.  The stock has been cut in half from  the highs.  No, wait a minute.  Let's just underline what you just said  Tracee, he had a separate jet flying behind his jet on business trips and  the jet flying behind him was empty.</p><p>CARRASCO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he did that for what reason?</p><p>CARRASCO:  Just in case there were any issues with the private jet he was  already on.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean --</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I flew in the navy and I have a commanding officer who made me  take a jet to an air show because it was his hometown and he wanted to make  sure that if his jet, if there's anything wrong with it he couldn't fly in  the air show but there was a spare there.  So I've seen this before, pretty  wasteful.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  But the biggest problem is they have shareholders, right,  that they're held accountable too and I'm sorry --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a public company.</p><p>KELLY:  Listen, you don't need to fly a private jet next to you.  Listen,  if your plane has mechanical issues, guess what, then we'll figure out and  we'll rent a private jet that's there to take you back to wherever you need  to go.  You don't -- yes, exactly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Well here's the problem, the board.  If I was a member on the  board, how can you -- you've got to be held accountable.  I mean, they --  like coming out of GE tomorrow and whether they cut the dividend, that's  one of the biggest concerns that shareholders are having right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, sure is.</p><p>KELLY:  But also what is this board doing if they're allowing this, right?   Shareholder capital --</p><p>MURPHY:  And (INAUDIBLE) I think for an old company like GE that's trying  to figure out how to stay relevant in this new economy, I think something  like this coming out makes it really hard for shareholders to believe in  this.</p><p>And you could see people wanting to sell this and look at company if they  are really on the cutting edge of technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that are growing.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  But they are looking for places to trim the fat just like  Tracee mentioned, shutting down some of those research centers and sort of  trying to consolidate their resources.  So at least we're moving forward in  that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've got to.  We'll see what the company says tomorrow.  GE  reports at around 8:30a.m. in the morning, tomorrow morning on its third  quarter. And, of course, a speculation is around that dividend.  Tracee  Carrasco, thank you.  </p><p>We will take a break.  When we come back, months after going public, Blue  Apron is laying off hundreds of employees.

We've got more, coming up on that.  But first, a new approach to measuring  success, Fortune Magazine is shining a light on the top names driving the  business world tomorrow, where is the growth?  We want to know.  Fortune is  debuting its future 50 list today, covering the most innovative companies  prime for explosive growth.  Fox Business has the exclusive first look at  the list.  </p><p>Coming in at number five on Fortunes' Future 50 Leaders, medical robotics  leader, Intuitive Surgical, fourth is the king of the stream, Netflix.   Number three on this list, Mark Zuckerberg's dorm project turns social  media titan, Facebook.  Elon Musk, electric automaker Tesla, cruising into  the second spot.  And topping the list is cloud computing giant,  Salesforce, joining us right now in a Fox Business Exclusive, Working  Deputy Editor, Brian O'Keefe.  Brian, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR OF FORTUNE:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, a lot of those names, obviously, very familiar and growth  stories that we all know, how did you come up with this list, what are the  growth metrics that you used?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  So we worked with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), they were our  partners in doing this.  They did an incredible amount of number crunching,  and they looked at 15 years of financial data and they scream for all 2,300  U.S. public companies.  And they really looked at a couple of things.  One  is the market potential of all these companies, what the market is betting,  how much growth the market is betting and assigning their value.  </p><p>And then they also dove into the company's themselves and looked at people,  structure, their technology and investments, they used artificial  intelligence, natural language processing to look at 70,000 10Ks and look  at the way those companies talked about themselves, if they talked about  future and investment and long-term thinking.  And they did a lot of  backtesting and looked at what correlated with real growth over time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's interesting that Salesforce is the number one -- in  the number one spot.  Were you surprised with that, Mike?</p><p>MURPHY:  I was, for sure, because, you know, when you think about growth,  you hear the fangs.  You know, you hear about Facebook, which is there but  Amazon, Netflix, which is there, Google.  So, the way this is -- I think  this is going to create a lot of controversy from people who are saying,  you know, like, oh, here's the big apple, we don't see therearound.</p><p>KELLY:  Apple didn't make the list, actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Apple didn't make the list.</p><p>KELLY:  Apple did not make the list, in part to its recent increase  emphasis on paying dividends on over reinvestment.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Yes, I mean, you're seeing -- I mean, Apple is the big exception,  right?  That's, you know, we noted that.  And, you know, Apple is obviously  still an incredible performer but they are piling up cash, they are paying  out dividends under some pressure to shareholders and that's not really a  formula for future growth.  </p><p>You know, you want to see a company, not that Apple is not doing well, but  you want to see them putting it in to new technology, Salesforce, to your  point, you know, they are -- Marc Benioff keeps that company really focused  on the future, they're investing in artificial intelligence and they're  making acquisitions on --</p><p>KELLY:  And I think the important thing about Salesforce, if you look it as  -- it didn't surprise me one bit about this, because he's actually struck  deals and partnerships with other companies like IBM to have a stronger,  better, platform for his customers, right?  So for insurance companies, if  there's a hail storm, they're going to use IBMs (INAUDIBLE) to notify all  the policyholders, so he's done a very good job especially on the  acquisition side.  So if they had a hole on their business model, he went  out and bought them.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  To look at the list overall, though, you know, a lot of people  say the past performance is the best indication of future success and  that's really not the way that you created this list, right?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that's really, kind of, the whole reason we did  create this list, is that past performance isn't the indicator of future  success and today's environment, things are changing so much faster,  technologies speeding up the pace of change, that we felt like in BCG, felt  like, we need a better metric to do that.  So that, you know, most of the  time, you're measuring a company on.  </p><p>You're trying to project the future on what they've been doing recently.   And this is like really -- that's why it's diving into, sort of, the DNA of  these companies and how they operate and how they talk and how they think  and trying to do that in a scientific way.  And, you know, looking at the  structure of the company, I mean, the hard reality is that younger  companies tend to grow faster, I mean, not just smaller companies, but  tightly-managed younger companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And founder companies, right?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  And founder companies, a lot of the time, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You also put his list of Future 50 Challengers.  We just showed  it on the screen.  These are companies that are on the fast-track for  growth but aren't quite there yet.  So how did you come up with this list?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Well, the secret about the Future 50 is (INAUDIBLE) list of 25.   So we have the 25 big companies and the 25 challengers, is what we called  it, BCG, didn't want to -- if you're screening for growth, you're going to  naturally get smaller companies, so that's why we did two separate screens  to get the big companies that are still growing.  The challengers are  really the companies that are on the rise, not necessarily small companies,  but, you know, it can be like, $5 to 10-billion market cap companies.  And  you see a lot of software companies on the list overall but especially on  the challenger's list, I mean, it's really like software is eating the  world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Marc Andreessen said years ago, you know, software  eats the world.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Yes, it's still true.  It's true, maybe more than ever.  I mean,  it's, you know, like Veeva Systems, the number one company in the  challenger's list.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Workday has been taking market share from, like, the  oracles of the world for years.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Workday is huge.  I mean, obviously, it's a huge stock, market  cap has shut up.  And yes, so these are companies that they're displacing  traditional systems and they're doing it with software technology.</p><p>KELLY:  So on Workday, it's a perineal emanate target, right?  And I just  wanted to highlight the point you said, though, earlier, 64 percent of the  companies in this list are software or online service providers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  That highlights that this is the wave and this is the future of  where we are going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to find growth, that's where it is.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, and a bit in every industry.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And one of the things that you have said is that, a lot of  companies that are using artificial intelligence are, sort of, higher on  the list, but you also used artificial intelligence in developing this  list, right?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that was one of the really cool things that BCG did,  is use this natural language processing to troll through 70,000 10Ks = like  200,000 different earnings calls, transcripts, and really look at the  language that the management uses to talk about how they managed their own  business.   And so, and, you know, I don't -- I don't personally know the details of  how the artificial intelligence did it, but it correlates certain words and  the way they come together with performance.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, how far down did you guys dig?  Like, how low did you go?   Because a company like Salesforces which is number one, they have a  venture, we ran a venture capital funds.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  So Salesforce is actively out there looking to acquire early-stage  start-ups.  Is there another 50 list of, kind of, the 50 (INAUDIBLE) that's  going start-ups or early stage companies?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Maybe we will expand that out.  But one thing the BCG did do, was  look at the investments that company's making, compared to high performing  DC funds to, sort of, get a sense of like how good their investments are.   So, that's an interesting way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're hitting on something so important right now.  I'm so  glad you brought it up, Mike, because you're right, Salesforce has an arm  that invests and acquires smaller companies.  That's why a lot of these  companies as Amazon, you know, other big technology --</p><p>KELLY:  Intel.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Intel, you're seeing large tech right now, have venture capital  arm and they are acquiring some of the smaller, no-names out there.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  You know, we have a story on Salesforce that goes deeper into  what they're doing.  They bought 55 companies since 2006.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  And Marc Benioff, you know, a lot of times, like, maybe he  doesn't even exactly know what they're going to do with the company but he  knows there's an interesting technology and they make it an acquisition,  they figure out how it's going to impact their business.</p><p>KELLY:  Is there a super surprised company, for you, because I'm looking at  this list and I'm not surprised by it, but I think people could be as the  intercontinental exchange that, you know, they run the New York stock  exchange, but really, those companies, the exchange have been focusing on  data, licensing, it's not really  --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of (INAUDIBLE) mergers.</p><p>KELLY:  Exactly.  So, is there a company on this list that surprised you  the most?</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Surprised me the most, I mean, I'm a little surprised -- Monster  Beverage is a really interesting company.</p><p>KELLY:  Number 20 on that list.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Because they have been growing fast for 20 years, and, you know,  I don't drink Monster Beverage drinks, but a lot of people do.  They're  really smart about how they market their brand, they don't really do a lot  of advertising but they do a lot of really cool, sort of, sponsorship  stuff.  And they just, you know, they keep growing that company year after  year.</p><p>KELLY:  And the next leg of growth for Monster Beverage is over in China  and Asia, so that's where they're looking to go so if you follow the stock  close, you can see they've dominated North America and they've slowly been  making inroads and smart positioning in Asia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at that chart.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  You know we have MasterCard and Visa on the list.  And I think  that's really interesting because they seemed like, you know, it's the card  in your wallet.  But they're really doing a lot of innovative things.  They  are trying to be, you know, the future of payments in all different forms.</p><p>MURPHY:  And when we talk about big tech companies or fin-tech companies  doing acquisitions, early-stage investing.  But there's also companies like  Campbell Soup has (INAUDIBLE) so it's not just big tech that's looking to  acquire small innovative companies.  I think it's across all diferent -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Campbell Soup, wow.  And these guys are computer guys like you.   We had Ann Winblad on from Winblad, who is a great venture capitalist.  And  she said, I'm competing with the arms of the soft, you know, of the  SoftBanks, not SoftBanks, of the --</p><p>MURPHY:  The large corporations.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The large corporation.  The largest technology -- </p><p>KELLY:  Imagine if the repatriation happens, of the taxes of all those  trillions of dollars overseas to these companies that they can then re- invest since small businesses start up, things that are happening.  I mean,  not to tie this into the whole tax reform overhaul policy but that could be  a good next leg of growth for this company.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  First, they have to find the right things to invest in.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These lists are helpful.  Brian, thank you so much, Brian  O'Keefe joining us.  We wanted to also -- should we take a look at IBM real  quick.  I mean, IBM was obviously stalled in terms of its revenue growth  for 22 quarters.  You saw a decline in revenue but yesterday, check out  that stock yesterday.  Nine percent, one of the reasons the Dow Industrials  hit 23,000.  I just wanted to mention that, is this a turning point for  IBM?</p><p>MURPHY:  I don't think so.  I think when you see that type of move, so much  of the volume in the markets right now is computer driven or algorithmic  trading.  That, to me, smells like a short covering -- short squeeze.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep watching IBM.  Obviously, IBM, GE, two- story stocks that we want to look at today.  Brian, good to see you, thank  you.  Coming up next, the fight is growing over Catalonia's push for  independence.  How the Spanish government is trying to stop the region's  succession, that's next.  And then a terrifying close call, more video of  that scary fly by that put 200 passengers at risk.  We'll tell you all  about it, back in a moment, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Markets are down this morning after a huge day  yesterday.  Dow Industrials' expected to be down better than 100 points.   No surprise.  The market crossed 23,000 yesterday for the first time ever  in a big rally, and, of course, we're up to better than $5 trillion in  market value since the election.  </p><p>A couple names on the move, Gilead Sciences; the stock right now is up  almost three percent in the premarket after winning FDA approval for a new  cancer gene therapy -- used to treat lymphoma.  The pharmaceutical giant  will sell the treatment at $373,000.  It's only the second gene therapy to  earn approval from the FDA on that.  Novartis brought the first drug of  this class to market back in August.</p><p>EBay shares this morning on the move after delivering third-quarter  earnings after the bell last night.  The results were roughly in line but  fourth-quarter guidance's disappointed.  EBay is revamping its online  marketplace amid tough competition from Amazon.  Stock, right now, taken a  real hit down 6-1/2 percent in the premarket.  </p><p>And then, there's Spain, the government there is set to activate an  emergency measure to take control of Catalonia, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So, Spain's government calling a special cabinet for  the weekend to activate this measure -- it allows for the central  government to take over the semiautonomous power of any of the country's17  regions.  Now, this comes after Catalonia's leader said, Separatist  lawmakers, can vote in favor of declaration of independence.  The measure  has never been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in  Spain.  </p><p>Well, an Air Berlin pilot is in big trouble.  He performed a risky flying  stunt with 200 passengers aboard.  You're watching the video of it right  now.  Reports say he buzzed Dusseldorf Airport terminal in a maneuver that  was met to mark the bankrupt last Trans-Atlantic flight.  Well, a pilot of  another told Reuters that a go-around should only be performed for its  operations, or safety aviation officials are looking at this video and  looking into this incident.  </p><p>Well, Blue Apron, they are tightening their belt.  The company has laid out  six percent of the workforce, that's about 300 workers, as part of a  company or organization.  Blue Apron has struggled since it went public  back in June with its stock price cut in half since then.  Competition from  a rival, a big one that would-be Amazon.  There is the year to date chart,  you can see it on your screen.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Sea World is laying off 350 workers due to low attendance at its  parks -- mainly in Orlando and San Diego.  They've been trying to rebuild  the brand solving protests over its treatment of their killer whales.   Shares of Sea World, down more than 34 percent year to date.  </p><p>And then, finally this, Snickers are getting a facelift, actually three  facelifts.  The candy company announcing they're going to release a line of  three new flavors to combat a number of different, well, emotional issues.   Feeling irritable, wimpy, indecisive?  Well, they've got the cure.  These  three bars: espresso, fiery, and salty and sweet, Maria.  Right now, I  think I want the espresso.  I'm a little tired.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Yes, the expresso sounds good.  </p><p>KELLY:  Thanks to wimpy for fiery, right?  Like, I like spicy stuff, but it  doesn't mean that I'm a wimp.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's taking it personally.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  So -- but personally, I'm really concerned about the espresso  one, because if you're irritable, I think the last thing you actually need  is to have some more caffeine.  More caffeine.  I always like those names,  though.  I actually find that really attractive.  When you're in a store  and you're looking at candy and you're like, yes, you know, I kind of feel  irritable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do you buy right there?  Or will you buy it because of  that?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  No.  Only if I really want it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking out over  the national anthem protest.  What he said to players and how they're  reacting, next.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a big night at Wrigley Field last night.  The Cubs  fought for their playoff lives and they survived.  Jared Max with the  highlights, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey!  Good morning, Maria.  I know  the Dodgers are only one win from the World Series, but just imagine the  Cubs came all the way back to win the NLC.  Yes, they did what they had to  do last night in a do or die game 4. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>(BASEBALL GAMEPLAY)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Javier Baez at two home runs; Wilson Contreras also (INAUDIBLE) for  the Cubs.  Dodgers would blast from Cody Dellinger and Justin Turner, but  the Cubs win.  Cubs win!  Cubs win, 3-2.  So, there will be a game 5.   Tonight, at Wrigley Field, the Cubs pick Jose Montana.  The Dodgers'  Clayton Kershaw L.A. leads three games to one.  </p><p>New York Yankees rookie, Aaron Judge, a hero again last night.  A third- inning double off Astros Ace, Dallas Keuchel, gave the Yanks a 2-0 lead.   Then, at the seventh inning, fellow baby bomber, Gary Sanchez, smashes a  solo home run against Brad Peacock -- third home run this postseason for  Sanchez.  Yankees' finally got reminisce its Dallas Keuchel and Masahiro  Tanaka.  7-shutout innings, 5-0, Yanks win.  </p><p>Series goes back to Houston where the Astros won the first two games.   Here's to start, Justin Verlander tomorrow night, and Yankees turn to Luis  Severino.  Yanks, one win from their 41st American League pennant.  </p><p>Hey, you know when somebody says, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.   Well, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the opposite yesterday,  regarding players choices to stand or kneel for the national anthem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER FOR THE NFL:  Everyone should stand for the  national anthem, that's an important part of our policy.  It's also an  important part of our game that we all take great pride in, it's also  important for us to honor our flag and to our country, and we think our  fans expect us to do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  Everyone should stand, not must stand.  While Goodell said he just  wants to keep the politics out of football.  President Trump, responded on  Twitter, \"NFL, too much talk, not enough action.  Stand for the national  anthem.\"  And while Colin Kaepernick, the first anthem kneeler, remained  silent except for retweets about not enough attention being given to what  he says police brutality against people of color. The Seahawks' Michael  Bennett isn't interested in discussing how to fix these social issues.   While the NFL team owners are trying to.  </p><p>Why?  He says, \"I don't think we can work alongside them until we address  that issue.  I think the issue with Kaepernick is the start to a  conversation.  If they want us to be open to what they want, the dialogue,  then that's something that needs to be on the table right there.\"  So,  Kaepernick first and then the issues.  </p><p>Some kneel, some protests, some put their money where their mouth is, like  the Philadelphia Eagles' Chris Long who has supported teammates protesting  the national anthem but is also doing something else.  Chris Long of the  Eagles, who had donated his first six-game paychecks this season to fund  two scholarships at a prep school in Charlottesville where he grew up is  now donating the rest of his 2017 NFL salary.  Ten more paychecks to help  fund education to make it for folks who are -- don't get the opportunities  in certain cities -- ten weeks of paychecks going to this in cities of St.  Louis, Boston and also Philadelphia.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is great.  </p><p>KELLY:  Leading by example.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Football has a 10 for Tomorrow campaign.  Good on him for that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, go Yanks!  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sorry, Max.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, this should be the go Yanks.</p><p>MAX:  Some Mets fans started this as soon when the Yankees beat the Mets,  and he got Wednesday missing.  Somehow, the Yankees do this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Mets are still amazing.  Sorry.  All right.  Jared Max.   Catch Jared's sports reports on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7,\" SiriusXM 115.  I  want to bring you this breaking news: the president is tweeting this  morning.  Here is what he said, \"Republicans are going for big budget  approval today.  The first step toward massive tax cuts.  I think we have  the votes, but who knows?\"  Uh-oh!</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KELLY:  Who knows?  Caveat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I guess they need the caveat in this day and age.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, cities are mailing in their bid to  Amazon.  We're taking a look at the other crazy stumps from towns competing  for technology giants' second headquarters, wait until you see this.   That's next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Happy  Thursday to you.  Thanks for being with us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is  Thursday, October 19th.  Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  A market milestone yesterday.  Yes, the Dow Jones Industrial  Average closing above 23,000 for the first time ever.  This was the 51st  record close since President Trump took office.

Thank you so  much and good morning everybody.  Happy Thursday to you.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Thursday, October 19th.  Your top stories right now,  6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Thirty years ago a market milestone and yesterday, a major market milestone  as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> BARTIROMO:  The DOW Jones Industrial Average closing above 23,000 for the  first time ever yesterday.  It was the f1st record close since President  Trump took office.  An amazing momentum market.</p><p> Earnings driving the gains yesterday, the optimism over tax cuts has  underpinned market gains for months as well and we could be one step closer  to it today.  The Senate gears up for the budget vote later today.   President Trump is calling this a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will be the largest tax  cut in the history of our country.  I focus on tax cuts because it's such  an important weapon to get our country really moving.  </p><p> So we'll go from being one of the highest tax nations in the world to one  of the lowest tax.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in my opinion.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got all of the updates coming up.  Geopolitical tensions  this morning however weighing on markets.  Pulling things back from  yesterday's all time high.  </p><p>DOW Industrial expected to be down about 80 points at the opening of  trading, down about a third of a percent, Nasdaq down two-thirds of a  percent right now.</p><p> In Europe this morning, take a look at the action, all the major averages  down as you see there with the FTSE100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC  Krones down almost half of a percent and the DAX Index down better than one  half of one percent.</p><p> In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Japan  which was up again taking a cue from the U.S., up half of a percent.</p><p> A brand new terrorism threat to report, the Department of Homeland Security  is warning that ISIS is plotting another 9/11 style attack, details on this  terrifying plan aiming to inflict mass casualties.  We've got all the  details.</p><p> And a scary scene at the German airport, an Air Berlin Jet does a dangerous  fly-by with 200 passengers on board, the fallout from the active defiance  coming up.</p><p> NFL Commission Roger Goodell refusing to take a tougher stance on anthem  protests and nobody is happy with Goodell's comments even Colin Kaepernick,  he fired back without opening his mouth.  We'll tell you what he said.</p><p> General Electric eyes major cost cuts, \"The Wall Street Journal\" this  morning reporting some of the excessive spending at the company including  Former CEO Jeff Immelt flying an empty jet next to his jet as a back up  during his 16-year tenure.  Wow.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle is here.  Kelly and Company  Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly is here.  And Rosecliff Capital CEO, Mike  Murphy is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER:  Good morning.  Great to  be here.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Happy Thursday everybody.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  We have 5,000 foot jump since President Trump took office in  the DOW but this tax plan, man, I'll tell you, we're going to have to see  what happens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Absolutely, 23,000 and counting.  I mean, come on.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  And you know what's fascinating is actually  Janet Yellen is due to have a meeting today at the White House with  President Trump.</p><p> And so whatever happens at the Fed and whoever they pick next is going to  have significant impacts on the markets and one of the reasons why you can  see that is because the Fed has been so accommodative to this market.</p><p> You've seen asset inflation, I mean valuations are at all time highs.  So  it's a fascinating aspect because Secretary MNuchin has reported that he  doesn't like Kevin Warsh because he think he could royal markets, right?</p><p> He wasn't for quantitative using, he actually was very adamant against it.   And so Jerome Powell is more accommodative. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We may know this week or next who the president decides on,  we're going to get to all of that coming up.</p><p> But first, our top story this hour and that is the market milestone,  23,000.  The DOW Industrial closed above the 23,000 mark for the first time  ever yesterday.  Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin though made an important  comment throughout the day warning that all of those games could be in  jeopardy should Congress fail to pass tax reform.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY TEXT: </p><p> There is no question that the rally in the stock market has based into it  reasonably high expectations of us getting tax cuts and tax reform done.   It also has based into it optimism on regulatory relief which they begun to  see and there's expectations.  So I think to the extent we get the tax deal  done, the stock market will go up higher but there's no question in my mind  if we don't get it done, you're going to see a reversal of the significant  amount of these gains.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  sounds about right, the Senate is expected to vote today on a  budget that would allow the Chamber to pass a tax bill with just 51 votes  instead of the 60 needed for major legislation.  </p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about that is Former Chief Strategist for  Texas Senator Ted Cruz, his senate and president campaign, Jason Johnson is  with us along with Former Deputy Secretary of Labor in the Obama  Administration, now a Senior Fellow at the University of Virginia Miller  Center, Chris Liu.  Good to see you both gentlemen, Thank you so much for  joining us this morning.</p><p> CHRIS LIU, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LABOR, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION:  Thank  you. </p><p> JASON JOHNSON, FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Thank you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Jason, in that same interview, the Treasury Secretary made  those comments about the market, he offered this, an absolutely guarantee  that a tax overhaul would be sign into law by the end of this year.  Is  that a reasonable time table?  Do you think they will get this done?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well certainly if you look at the performance this year with  other major pieces of legislation it doesn't seem reasonable.  But I  understand why the Secretary is saying what he's saying.</p><p> There is an absolute expectation that this has to be done in the political  market if you will.  And so I'm not incredibly optimistic that it happens  by the end of the year.  There certainly seems to be a mixed message coming  from some leaders on the Hill as to whether or not the deadline is the end  of the year.  But whether it's the end of the year or after the first of  the year, it must happen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Chris, do you agree with that that it must happen and that it  will happen?</p><p> LIU:  I agree with Senator McConnell who said it's more important that we  get it right instead of just running this through.  And I think it's  important to look at the details here and we don't really know yet  percentage is going to go to the super wealthy, how it's going to add to  the deficit whether it's really going to fix the idiosyncrasies in the tax  code right now.</p><p> And so putting it on an artificial deadline does not bode well for coming  up with good policy and that's really what the market wants to see right  now.  They really want to see the once in a generation tax reform proposal,  not another giveaway that just goes to the super wealthy.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, Chris considering -- it's Kevin Kelly here.  Considering you  spent time in the White House especially with President Obama, do you think  it's appropriate for a cabinet secretaries or anybody in this  administration to be talking about the impact on stock markets given that  they should be focusing on policy and talking about the implements, what it  could do to the real economy as opposed to really focusing on markets that  should do whatever they should be doing?</p><p> LIU:  That's exactly right.  It's one of the reasons why we in the Obama  Administration didn't talk about the stock market even though we had  significant gains as well because the market goes up and unfortunately it  goes down as well.</p><p> And it goes up or down for reasons that have nothing to do with Washington.   And if I were Secretary MNuchin, I would probably take my cues from the  leaders on the Hill as to what the timing should be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, I know.  I think that's a good point but at the same  time, $5.3 trillion in market value doesn't come out of air.  It's clear  that the market value that we've seen in these gains is partly due to  optimism over what President Trump is doing.  </p><p> He's rolled back an incredible amount of regulation and they're expecting  tax reform.  Are you saying $5.3 trillion in market value is just a  coincidence?</p><p> LIU:  Well I would say that it's based on the expectation something's  happening.  This is a recovery, economic recovery that began in early 2010  and we've had essentially seven straight years of economic growth.</p><p> There have been rollbacks of regulations but there hasn't been this  significant economic change that Donald Trump has promised yet.  So a lot  of this is --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we did see a 3.1 percent GDP the other day and GDP was  averaging about one and a half percent under President Obama.  So -- I mean  there's something to it that the economy is definitely better.  </p><p> You're (INAUDIBLE) in small business, do you see that Mike Murphy?  Do you  see things getting better?  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.  We see small business optimism out there, we see  startups, we see companies that are looking to disrupt existing industries  coming out hiring people, raising money, going out and creating -- using  technology to make our lives better.  So I think right now the optimism  that we see nationwide is something we haven't seen in a long time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jason, let me ask you this, in terms of this bill, if it gets  done in the first quarter, do you think that still has a positive impact?   If we don't see a bill on the president's desk by Thanksgiving, this is  going to be a problem for certainly into the 2018 election for the  republicans.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Sure.  Going back to the comment earlier that we shouldn't have  artificial deadlines.  I don't believe getting this done by the end of the  year or seeing that we need to get it done by the end of the year is an  artificial deadline because we know historically that very few things  happen in election year.</p><p> And as we all know, next year is an election year.  So Maria, into the  first quarter, maybe so but we know that you get much passed the first  quarter these guys don't like to do much in an election year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you're right, if they don't get it done maybe that's  -- they should move out because this is something that the American people  want, Lea Gabrielle.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.  Chris, Senator Schumer said our republican friends are  trying to hide what's in the tax bill that they don't want people to know.  </p><p> Is this just resistance sort of popping up already from the democrats on  this obstructionist because really tax reform is good for all Americans  right now, is it?</p><p> LIU:  A hundred percent agree tax reform is good.  What we have seen so far  is simply tax cuts and some of the initial estimates are that becoming 50  to 80 percent of the benefits would go to the top one percent.  Look --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's not true.  That's just not true.  I don't want to spew  out nonsense because 80 percent of the tax reform package going to the top  one percent is nonsense.</p><p> LIU:  An important issue to get right.  For instance, it's the state and  local tax deduction which is going to affect a lot republican members and  understanding the details of that is not just resistance, it's actually  trying to make sure that this is legitimate tax reform and there are so  many issues.  This is why this is hard and it's hard to get it right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're talking about a corporate rate of 20 percent.  If you  see the corporate rate go down from 35 percent to 20 percent, that will be  a positive for corporations and the idea is is that they are going to  reinvest in higher (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> KELLY:  It's small businesses.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Small business with 25 percent pass through rate, same thing  down from 39.6.  So this is a significant move.  He's also talking about  three brackets, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent --</p><p> MURPHY:  I mean, small businesses is like --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Doubling the standard deduction.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  I'd like to point out, those aren't republican small  businesses, those are democrat, republican, American small businesses.  So  that impacts everybody not just one side.  This isn't a one side versus the  other.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the reason that I have to push back on that Chris  is because we were expecting the talking points after this plan and it's  just not true that 80 percent of the tax plan impacts the top one percent,  it's just not true and we have to make it clear.</p><p> LIU:  You know, the problem is, we don't have the details yet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p> LIU:  We don't have the -- we don't have the details yet and I think that's  the problem --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well we have the details that we just mentioned, we got three  brackets on the individual rates, we got a doubling of the standard  deduction, corporate rate of 20 percent, pass through rate of 25 percent,  and the elimination of most deductions.</p><p> LIU:  Well look, we don't really know what the impact is on average  Americans, we don't know what the size of the (INAUDIBLE) tax credit is  going to be, we don't understand all the other archaic idiosyncrasy that's  --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So then how can you say it benefits the one percent if you  don't even have the details?</p><p> LIU:  Well -- look, we're -- the folks that have looked at this are basing  this on the initial proposal.  Let's have a whole debate on this and let's  make sure we get this right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because this is -- we're watching President  Obama return to the campaign trail Chris to stump for democratic candidates  and governance races, of course, in New Jersey and in Virginia, out of next  month elections.</p><p> This development comes amid a shakeup at the DNC where several key long  time officials have lost their post.  The party's new chairman, Tom Perez  obviously preparing to host his first meeting since taking over the job  earlier this year.</p><p> You were among the 75 people nominated by Tom Perez to become the new at  large DNC member, what's behind the shakeup?  Tell us how you're feeling?   Congratulations by that nomination by the way Chris.</p><p> LIU:  Well look, there are about 400 members of the Democratic National  Committee.  The new chairman get to pick 75.  This is a time of change  within the Democratic Party and I think we need to admit that things  haven't gone as well as they should have over the last couple of years.</p><p> And so unfortunately when you bring new people in, some people that have  served for a while have to be moved and that's just part of change.  And  this is a big 10 party and change happens and change is good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, one thing that seems to be happening is that the  Democratic Party is being hijacked by the extreme left Chris.  </p><p> Are you going to be able to come up with a message that will resonate with  the broad American people, the population given the fact that you've got  Barrack Obama, you've got Bernie Sanders, you've got Elizabeth Warren going  to the extreme left and really hijacking what was a moderate party at one  point?</p><p> LIU:  Tom Perez has made a commitment that the democrats need to compete in  every seat from the school board to the Senate to the White House.</p><p> And we need to understand that we as a party can't have one monolithic  message.  That doesn't work in all state and certainly doesn't even work in  all rural areas versus urban areas as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  All right.  Gentlemen, thanks very  much for the conversation we appreciate you joining us this morning.  Chris  Liu.  Jason, good to see you as well.  We will talk with you soon  gentlemen.</p><p> Coming up, the head of Homeland Security is warning Americans of a new  threat, the concern over ISIS plotting another 9/11 next.  We are going to  tell you the details of what we know.  </p><p> Then Colin Kaepernick firing back at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the  new way he's lashing out against him straight ahead.  </p><p> A fired up morning thins morning, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A top U.S. security chief warning terror groups  are planning a major attack on the scale of 9/11.  Cheryl Casone with the  details now, Cheryl --</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Maria, good morning.  Acting Homeland Security  Secretary Elaine Duke saying it is clear that ISIS and other terror groups  are planning to take down planes as an aim to carry out another massive  attack.  Duke also saying terror groups have been using knife and van  attacks to keep their members engaged.</p><p> Well the head of American Express, one of the country's most prominent  African-American corporate leaders is leaving the company, Kenneth Chenault  depature caps a 16-year run at the credit card company.  He's going to be  succeeding a CEO by Stephen Squeri a three decade AmEx veteran.  Shares of  AmEx up 23 percent so far this year.</p><p> Well, American cities are pulling all the stops in their bid to become home  to Amazon's second headquarters.  Stonecrest, Georgia has offered to change  its name to Amazon.  Tucson, Arizona tried to send a company a 21-foot  cactus.</p><p> Amazon has promised to invest $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs.  The  deadline to submit bids is today.  And, of course, check this out, New York  City lit up famous buildings including the Empire State Building and one  World Trade in Amazon's orange color last night trying to help seal the  deal.  Probably going to be a little more than light that's going to get  Amazon somewhere.</p><p> And then finally there's this, first lady Melania Trump is donating her  inaugural ball gown to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.   She is handing over the vanilla silk off the shoulder gown, it's got a slit  skirt.  The tradition first began Maria with Helen Taft back in 1912.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Cool.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Interesting.  Would you  go see the first lady's gown at the Smithsonian Lea?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think if I was already going to the Smithsonian then I would  happen to pass by and see the first lady's gown.</p><p> But I do think that this is really nice about making (INAUDIBLE) because it  gives you a sense of being able to even that you can't touch them, just  being able to sort of look at them and sort of have the essence of what it  must have been like to be there that day.  So I think it's wonderful that  they do this.</p><p> KELLY:  I think it also highlights the importance of the first lady, right?   I mean you go throughout history and you look at the contributions they've  made.  So it's nice that --</p><p> MURPHY:  The guy who's getting married in New York.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  I was going to say behind every great man is a better woman.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, says the guy who's getting married.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  So --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your upcoming nuptial.</p><p> KELLY:  Well she did get her dress last Friday so maybe I'm just kind of  high upbeat excited.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, she got the dress.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, I know.  So obviously I didn't see it but it was a fun and  exciting experience.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I was going to say, let's see a live TV picture of this and get  you in really big trouble.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep following all of that.  Coming up next  though, a real scare in the sky to tell you about, more video of the risky  fly-by stunt that got pilot suspended, that's coming up.</p><p> And then GE's new chief taking away company cars and cancelling fancy  retreats.  The new cost cutting direction for General Electric ahead of its  earnings tomorrow, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  General Electric's new CEO John Flannery making  some changes starting with some old favorites.  Tracee Carrasco with the  details, Tracee --</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.  You know,  John Flannery, he's only been on the job since August 1st but he's already  making some big changes.</p><p> One of his first belt tightening moves was to ground GE's fleet of six  business jets which was a favorite of former GE CEO Jeff Immelt who used to  have an empty private jet fly next to his just as a spare and that's just  the beginning.</p><p> Bob Nardelli, former Chrysler CEO and Home CEO was on the show yesterday  and here's what he had to say.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO HOME DEPOT &amp; CHRYSLER:  They have to get their  fundamental businesses that are left to get some growth.  They got to get  growth, they've got to get top line growth, they got to get productivity,  they got to get innovation.</p><p> The key to GE over the last 16 years Maria as we've seen that goes out have  been a lot more than the goes in.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARRASCO:  And Nardelli worked at GE for several years.  And according to  \"The Wall Street Journal,\" next month Flannery is expected to unveil the  results of a strategic review that includes thousands of corporate level  job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure.</p><p> He is shutting down research centers in Shanghai, Munich, and Rio democrats  Janiero.  A GE spokesperson said:</p><p> TEXT: The company will continue to have an intense focus on our global  operations and customer base.</p><p> The company is expected to report quarterly reports tomorrow.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at that stock ahead of those --</p><p> CARRASCO:  Hasn't been good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ahead of those numbers.  The stock has been cut in half from  the highs.  No, wait a minute.  Let's just underline what you just said  Tracee, he had a separate jet flying behind his jet on business trips and  the jet flying behind him was empty.</p><p> CARRASCO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he did that for what reason?</p><p> CARRASCO:  Just in case there were any issues with the private jet he was  already on.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I mean --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I flew in the navy and I have a commanding officer who made me  take a jet to an air show because it was his hometown and he wanted to make  sure that if his jet, if there's anything wrong with it he couldn't fly in  the air show but there was a spare there.  So I've seen this before, pretty  wasteful.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  But the biggest problem is they have shareholders, right,  that they're held accountable too and I'm sorry --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a public company.</p><p> KELLY:  Listen, you don't need to fly a private jet next to you.  Listen,  if your plane has mechanical issues, guess what, then we'll figure out and  we'll rent a private jet that's there to take you back to wherever you need  to go.  You don't -- yes, exactly.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  Well here's the problem, the board.  If I was a member on the  board, how can you -- you've got to be held accountable.  I mean, they --  like coming out of GE tomorrow and whether they cut the dividend, that's  one of the biggest concerns that shareholders are having right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, sure is.</p><p> KELLY:  But also what is this board doing if they're allowing this, right?   Shareholder capital --</p><p> MURPHY:  And (INAUDIBLE) I think for an old company like GE that's trying  to figure out how to stay relevant in this new economy, I think something  like this coming out makes it really hard for shareholders to believe in  this.</p><p> And you could see people wanting to sell this and look at company if they  are really on the cutting edge of technology.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that are growing.</p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  But they are looking for places to trim the fat just like  Tracee mentioned, shutting down some of those research centers and sort of  trying to consolidate their resources.  So at least we're moving forward in  that way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've got to.  We'll see what the company says tomorrow.  GE  reports at around 8:30a.m. in the morning, tomorrow morning on its third  quarter. And, of course, a speculation is around that dividend.  Tracee  Carrasco, thank you.  </p><p> We will take a break.  When we come back, months after going public, Blue  Apron is laying off hundreds of employees.

We want to know.  Fortune is  debuting its future 50 list today, covering the most innovative companies  prime for explosive growth.  Fox Business has the exclusive first look at  the list.  </p><p> Coming in at number five on Fortunes' Future 50 Leaders, medical robotics  leader, Intuitive Surgical, fourth is the king of the stream, Netflix.   Number three on this list, Mark Zuckerberg's dorm project turns social  media titan, Facebook.  Elon Musk, electric automaker Tesla, cruising into  the second spot.  And topping the list is cloud computing giant,  Salesforce, joining us right now in a Fox Business Exclusive, Working  Deputy Editor, Brian O'Keefe.  Brian, good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR OF FORTUNE:  My pleasure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, a lot of those names, obviously, very familiar and growth  stories that we all know, how did you come up with this list, what are the  growth metrics that you used?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  So we worked with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), they were our  partners in doing this.  They did an incredible amount of number crunching,  and they looked at 15 years of financial data and they scream for all 2,300  U.S. public companies.  And they really looked at a couple of things.  One  is the market potential of all these companies, what the market is betting,  how much growth the market is betting and assigning their value.  </p><p> And then they also dove into the company's themselves and looked at people,  structure, their technology and investments, they used artificial  intelligence, natural language processing to look at 70,000 10Ks and look  at the way those companies talked about themselves, if they talked about  future and investment and long-term thinking.  And they did a lot of  backtesting and looked at what correlated with real growth over time.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's interesting that Salesforce is the number one -- in  the number one spot.  Were you surprised with that, Mike?</p><p> MURPHY:  I was, for sure, because, you know, when you think about growth,  you hear the fangs.  You know, you hear about Facebook, which is there but  Amazon, Netflix, which is there, Google.  So, the way this is -- I think  this is going to create a lot of controversy from people who are saying,  you know, like, oh, here's the big apple, we don't see therearound.</p><p> KELLY:  Apple didn't make the list, actually.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Apple didn't make the list.</p><p> KELLY:  Apple did not make the list, in part to its recent increase  emphasis on paying dividends on over reinvestment.</p><p> O'KEEFE: Yes, I mean, you're seeing -- I mean, Apple is the big exception,  right?  That's, you know, we noted that.  And, you know, Apple is obviously  still an incredible performer but they are piling up cash, they are paying  out dividends under some pressure to shareholders and that's not really a  formula for future growth.  </p><p> You know, you want to see a company, not that Apple is not doing well, but  you want to see them putting it in to new technology, Salesforce, to your  point, you know, they are -- Marc Benioff keeps that company really focused  on the future, they're investing in artificial intelligence and they're  making acquisitions on --</p><p> KELLY:  And I think the important thing about Salesforce, if you look it as  -- it didn't surprise me one bit about this, because he's actually struck  deals and partnerships with other companies like IBM to have a stronger,  better, platform for his customers, right?  So for insurance companies, if  there's a hail storm, they're going to use IBMs (INAUDIBLE) to notify all  the policyholders, so he's done a very good job especially on the  acquisition side.  So if they had a hole on their business model, he went  out and bought them.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  To look at the list overall, though, you know, a lot of people  say the past performance is the best indication of future success and  that's really not the way that you created this list, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that's really, kind of, the whole reason we did  create this list, is that past performance isn't the indicator of future  success and today's environment, things are changing so much faster,  technologies speeding up the pace of change, that we felt like in BCG, felt  like, we need a better metric to do that.  So that, you know, most of the  time, you're measuring a company on.  </p><p> You're trying to project the future on what they've been doing recently.   And this is like really -- that's why it's diving into, sort of, the DNA of  these companies and how they operate and how they talk and how they think  and trying to do that in a scientific way.  And, you know, looking at the  structure of the company, I mean, the hard reality is that younger  companies tend to grow faster, I mean, not just smaller companies, but  tightly-managed younger companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And founder companies, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  And founder companies, a lot of the time, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You also put his list of Future 50 Challengers.  We just showed  it on the screen.  These are companies that are on the fast-track for  growth but aren't quite there yet.  So how did you come up with this list?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Well, the secret about the Future 50 is (INAUDIBLE) list of 25.   So we have the 25 big companies and the 25 challengers, is what we called  it, BCG, didn't want to -- if you're screening for growth, you're going to  naturally get smaller companies, so that's why we did two separate screens  to get the big companies that are still growing.  The challengers are  really the companies that are on the rise, not necessarily small companies,  but, you know, it can be like, $5 to 10-billion market cap companies.  And  you see a lot of software companies on the list overall but especially on  the challenger's list, I mean, it's really like software is eating the  world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what Marc Andreessen said years ago, you know, software  eats the world.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, it's still true.  It's true, maybe more than ever.  I mean,  it's, you know, like Veeva Systems, the number one company in the  challenger's list.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Workday has been taking market share from, like, the  oracles of the world for years.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Workday is huge.  I mean, obviously, it's a huge stock, market  cap has shut up.  And yes, so these are companies that they're displacing  traditional systems and they're doing it with software technology.</p><p> KELLY:  So on Workday, it's a perineal emanate target, right?  And I just  wanted to highlight the point you said, though, earlier, 64 percent of the  companies in this list are software or online service providers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  That highlights that this is the wave and this is the future of  where we are going.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You want to find growth, that's where it is.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, and a bit in every industry.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And one of the things that you have said is that, a lot of  companies that are using artificial intelligence are, sort of, higher on  the list, but you also used artificial intelligence in developing this  list, right?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Yes, I mean, that was one of the really cool things that BCG did,  is use this natural language processing to troll through 70,000 10Ks = like  200,000 different earnings calls, transcripts, and really look at the  language that the management uses to talk about how they managed their own  business.   And so, and, you know, I don't -- I don't personally know the details of  how the artificial intelligence did it, but it correlates certain words and  the way they come together with performance.</p><p> MURPHY:  So, how far down did you guys dig?  Like, how low did you go?   Because a company like Salesforces which is number one, they have a  venture, we ran a venture capital funds.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Right.</p><p> MURPHY:  So Salesforce is actively out there looking to acquire early-stage  start-ups.  Is there another 50 list of, kind of, the 50 (INAUDIBLE) that's  going start-ups or early stage companies?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Maybe we will expand that out.  But one thing the BCG did do, was  look at the investments that company's making, compared to high performing  DC funds to, sort of, get a sense of like how good their investments are.   So, that's an interesting way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're hitting on something so important right now.  I'm so  glad you brought it up, Mike, because you're right, Salesforce has an arm  that invests and acquires smaller companies.  That's why a lot of these  companies as Amazon, you know, other big technology --</p><p> KELLY:  Intel.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Intel, you're seeing large tech right now, have venture capital  arm and they are acquiring some of the smaller, no-names out there.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  You know, we have a story on Salesforce that goes deeper into  what they're doing.  They bought 55 companies since 2006.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  And Marc Benioff, you know, a lot of times, like, maybe he  doesn't even exactly know what they're going to do with the company but he  knows there's an interesting technology and they make it an acquisition,  they figure out how it's going to impact their business.</p><p> KELLY:  Is there a super surprised company, for you, because I'm looking at  this list and I'm not surprised by it, but I think people could be as the  intercontinental exchange that, you know, they run the New York stock  exchange, but really, those companies, the exchange have been focusing on  data, licensing, it's not really  --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot of (INAUDIBLE) mergers.</p><p> KELLY:  Exactly.  So, is there a company on this list that surprised you  the most?</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Surprised me the most, I mean, I'm a little surprised -- Monster  Beverage is a really interesting company.</p><p> KELLY:  Number 20 on that list.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  Because they have been growing fast for 20 years, and, you know,  I don't drink Monster Beverage drinks, but a lot of people do.  They're  really smart about how they market their brand, they don't really do a lot  of advertising but they do a lot of really cool, sort of, sponsorship  stuff.  And they just, you know, they keep growing that company year after  year.</p><p> KELLY:  And the next leg of growth for Monster Beverage is over in China  and Asia, so that's where they're looking to go so if you follow the stock  close, you can see they've dominated North America and they've slowly been  making inroads and smart positioning in Asia.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look at that chart.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  You know we have MasterCard and Visa on the list.  And I think  that's really interesting because they seemed like, you know, it's the card  in your wallet.  But they're really doing a lot of innovative things.  They  are trying to be, you know, the future of payments in all different forms.</p><p> MURPHY:  And when we talk about big tech companies or fin-tech companies  doing acquisitions, early-stage investing.  But there's also companies like  Campbell Soup has (INAUDIBLE) so it's not just big tech that's looking to  acquire small innovative companies.  I think it's across all diferent -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Campbell Soup, wow.  And these guys are computer guys like you.   We had Ann Winblad on from Winblad, who is a great venture capitalist.  And  she said, I'm competing with the arms of the soft, you know, of the  SoftBanks, not SoftBanks, of the --</p><p> MURPHY:  The large corporations.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The large corporation.  The largest technology -- </p><p> KELLY:  Imagine if the repatriation happens, of the taxes of all those  trillions of dollars overseas to these companies that they can then re- invest since small businesses start up, things that are happening.  I mean,  not to tie this into the whole tax reform overhaul policy but that could be  a good next leg of growth for this company.</p><p> O'KEEFE:  First, they have to find the right things to invest in.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, of course.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  These lists are helpful.  Brian, thank you so much, Brian  O'Keefe joining us.  We wanted to also -- should we take a look at IBM real  quick.  I mean, IBM was obviously stalled in terms of its revenue growth  for 22 quarters.  You saw a decline in revenue but yesterday, check out  that stock yesterday.  Nine percent, one of the reasons the Dow Industrials  hit 23,000.  I just wanted to mention that, is this a turning point for  IBM?</p><p> MURPHY:  I don't think so.  I think when you see that type of move, so much  of the volume in the markets right now is computer driven or algorithmic  trading.  That, to me, smells like a short covering -- short squeeze.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep watching IBM.  Obviously, IBM, GE, two- story stocks that we want to look at today.  Brian, good to see you, thank  you.  Coming up next, the fight is growing over Catalonia's push for  independence.  How the Spanish government is trying to stop the region's  succession, that's next.  And then a terrifying close call, more video of  that scary fly by that put 200 passengers at risk.  We'll tell you all  about it, back in a moment, straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Markets are down this morning after a huge day  yesterday.  Dow Industrials' expected to be down better than 100 points.   No surprise.  The market crossed 23,000 yesterday for the first time ever  in a big rally, and, of course, we're up to better than $5 trillion in  market value since the election.  </p><p> A couple names on the move, Gilead Sciences; the stock right now is up  almost three percent in the premarket after winning FDA approval for a new  cancer gene therapy -- used to treat lymphoma.  The pharmaceutical giant  will sell the treatment at $373,000.  It's only the second gene therapy to  earn approval from the FDA on that.  Novartis brought the first drug of  this class to market back in August.</p><p> EBay shares this morning on the move after delivering third-quarter  earnings after the bell last night.  The results were roughly in line but  fourth-quarter guidance's disappointed.  EBay is revamping its online  marketplace amid tough competition from Amazon.  Stock, right now, taken a  real hit down 6-1/2 percent in the premarket.  </p><p> And then, there's Spain, the government there is set to activate an  emergency measure to take control of Catalonia, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So, Spain's government calling a special cabinet for  the weekend to activate this measure -- it allows for the central  government to take over the semiautonomous power of any of the country's17  regions.  Now, this comes after Catalonia's leader said, Separatist  lawmakers, can vote in favor of declaration of independence.  The measure  has never been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in  Spain.  </p><p> Well, an Air Berlin pilot is in big trouble.  He performed a risky flying  stunt with 200 passengers aboard.  You're watching the video of it right  now.  Reports say he buzzed Dusseldorf Airport terminal in a maneuver that  was met to mark the bankrupt last Trans-Atlantic flight.  Well, a pilot of  another told Reuters that a go-around should only be performed for its  operations, or safety aviation officials are looking at this video and  looking into this incident.  </p><p> Well, Blue Apron, they are tightening their belt.  The company has laid out  six percent of the workforce, that's about 300 workers, as part of a  company or organization.  Blue Apron has struggled since it went public  back in June with its stock price cut in half since then.  Competition from  a rival, a big one that would-be Amazon.  There is the year to date chart,  you can see it on your screen.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Sea World is laying off 350 workers due to low attendance at its  parks -- mainly in Orlando and San Diego.  They've been trying to rebuild  the brand solving protests over its treatment of their killer whales.   Shares of Sea World, down more than 34 percent year to date.  </p><p> And then, finally this, Snickers are getting a facelift, actually three  facelifts.  The candy company announcing they're going to release a line of  three new flavors to combat a number of different, well, emotional issues.   Feeling irritable, wimpy, indecisive?  Well, they've got the cure.  These  three bars: espresso, fiery, and salty and sweet, Maria.  Right now, I  think I want the espresso.  I'm a little tired.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Yes, the expresso sounds good.  </p><p> KELLY:  Thanks to wimpy for fiery, right?  Like, I like spicy stuff, but it  doesn't mean that I'm a wimp.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's taking it personally.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  So -- but personally, I'm really concerned about the espresso  one, because if you're irritable, I think the last thing you actually need  is to have some more caffeine.  More caffeine.  I always like those names,  though.  I actually find that really attractive.  When you're in a store  and you're looking at candy and you're like, yes, you know, I kind of feel  irritable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do you buy right there?  Or will you buy it because of  that?  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  No.  Only if I really want it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking out over  the national anthem protest.  What he said to players and how they're  reacting, next.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a big night at Wrigley Field last night.  The Cubs  fought for their playoff lives and they survived.  Jared Max with the  highlights, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey!  Good morning, Maria.  I know  the Dodgers are only one win from the World Series, but just imagine the  Cubs came all the way back to win the NLC.  Yes, they did what they had to  do last night in a do or die game 4. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> (BASEBALL GAMEPLAY)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAX:  Javier Baez at two home runs; Wilson Contreras also (INAUDIBLE) for  the Cubs.  Dodgers would blast from Cody Dellinger and Justin Turner, but  the Cubs win.  Cubs win!  Cubs win, 3-2.  So, there will be a game 5.   Tonight, at Wrigley Field, the Cubs pick Jose Montana.  The Dodgers'  Clayton Kershaw L.A. leads three games to one.  </p><p>New York Yankees rookie, Aaron Judge, a hero again last night.  A third- inning double off Astros Ace, Dallas Keuchel, gave the Yanks a 2-0 lead.   Then, at the seventh inning, fellow baby bomber, Gary Sanchez, smashes a  solo home run against Brad Peacock -- third home run this postseason for  Sanchez.  Yankees' finally got reminisce its Dallas Keuchel and Masahiro  Tanaka.  7-shutout innings, 5-0, Yanks win.  </p><p> Series goes back to Houston where the Astros won the first two games.   Here's to start, Justin Verlander tomorrow night, and Yankees turn to Luis  Severino.  Yanks, one win from their 41st American League pennant.  </p><p> Hey, you know when somebody says, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.   Well, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the opposite yesterday,  regarding players choices to stand or kneel for the national anthem.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER FOR THE NFL:  Everyone should stand for the  national anthem, that's an important part of our policy.  It's also an  important part of our game that we all take great pride in, it's also  important for us to honor our flag and to our country, and we think our  fans expect us to do that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAX:  Everyone should stand, not must stand.  While Goodell said he just  wants to keep the politics out of football.  President Trump, responded on  Twitter, \"NFL, too much talk, not enough action.  Stand for the national  anthem.\"  And while Colin Kaepernick, the first anthem kneeler, remained  silent except for retweets about not enough attention being given to what  he says police brutality against people of color. The Seahawks' Michael  Bennett isn't interested in discussing how to fix these social issues.   While the NFL team owners are trying to.  </p><p> Why?  He says, \"I don't think we can work alongside them until we address  that issue.  I think the issue with Kaepernick is the start to a  conversation.  If they want us to be open to what they want, the dialogue,  then that's something that needs to be on the table right there.\"  So,  Kaepernick first and then the issues.  </p><p> Some kneel, some protests, some put their money where their mouth is, like  the Philadelphia Eagles' Chris Long who has supported teammates protesting  the national anthem but is also doing something else.  Chris Long of the  Eagles, who had donated his first six-game paychecks this season to fund  two scholarships at a prep school in Charlottesville where he grew up is  now donating the rest of his 2017 NFL salary.  Ten more paychecks to help  fund education to make it for folks who are -- don't get the opportunities  in certain cities -- ten weeks of paychecks going to this in cities of St.  Louis, Boston and also Philadelphia.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is great.  </p><p> KELLY:  Leading by example.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Football has a 10 for Tomorrow campaign.  Good on him for that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hey, go Yanks!  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sorry, Max.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> MURPHY:  Yes, this should be the go Yanks.</p><p> MAX:  Some Mets fans started this as soon when the Yankees beat the Mets,  and he got Wednesday missing.  Somehow, the Yankees do this.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, Mets are still amazing.  Sorry.  All right.  Jared Max.   Catch Jared's sports reports on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7,\" SiriusXM 115.  I  want to bring you this breaking news: the president is tweeting this  morning.  Here is what he said, \"Republicans are going for big budget  approval today.  The first step toward massive tax cuts.  I think we have  the votes, but who knows?\"  Uh-oh!</p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> KELLY:  Who knows?  Caveat.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I guess they need the caveat in this day and age.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, cities are mailing in their bid to  Amazon.  We're taking a look at the other crazy stumps from towns competing  for technology giants' second headquarters, wait until you see this.   That's next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back!  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Happy  Thursday to you.  Thanks for being with us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is  Thursday, October 19th.  Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  A market milestone yesterday.

Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thirty years ago a market milestone and yesterday, a major market milestone as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARTIROMO: The DOW Jones Industrial Average closing above 23,000 for the first time ever yesterday. It was the f1st record close since <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>took office. An amazing momentum market.</p><p>Earnings driving the gains yesterday, the optimism over tax cuts has underpinned market gains for months as well and we could be one step closer to it today. The Senate gears up for the budget vote later today. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is calling this a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It will be the largest tax cut in the history of our country. I focus on tax cuts because it's such an important weapon to get our country really moving.</p><p>So we'll go from being one of the highest tax nations in the world to one of the lowest tax. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity in my opinion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got all of the updates coming up. Geopolitical tensions this morning however weighing on markets. Pulling things back from yesterday's all time high.</p><p>DOW Industrial expected to be down about 80 points at the opening of trading, down about a third of a percent, Nasdaq down two-thirds of a percent right now.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the action, all the major averages down as you see there with the FTSE100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC Krones down almost half of a percent and the DAX Index down better than one half of one percent.</p><p>In Asia Overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Japan which was up again taking a cue from the U.S., up half of a percent.</p><p>A brand new terrorism threat to report, the Department of Homeland Security is warning that ISIS is plotting another 9/11 style attack, details on this terrifying plan aiming to inflict mass casualties. We've got all the details.</p><p>And a scary scene at the German airport, an Air Berlin Jet does a dangerous fly-by with 200 passengers on board, the fallout from the active defiance coming up.</p><p>NFL Commission Roger Goodell refusing to take a tougher stance on anthem protests and nobody is happy with Goodell's comments even Colin Kaepernick, he fired back without opening his mouth. We'll tell you what he said.</p><p>General Electriceyes major cost cuts, \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning reporting some of the excessive spending at the company including Former CEO Jeff Immelt flying an empty jet next to his jet as a back up during his 16-year tenure. Wow.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it, FOX News Correspondent, Lea Gabrielle is here. Kelly and Company Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly is here. And Rosecliff Capital CEO, Mike Murphy is here. Great to see you.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, ROSECLIFF CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER: Good morning. Great to be here.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Happy Thursday everybody.</p><p>GABRIELLE: We have 5,000 foot jump since <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>took office in the DOW but this tax plan, man, I'll tell you, we're going to have to see what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely, 23,000 and counting. I mean, come on.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: And you know what's fascinating is actually Janet Yellen is due to have a meeting today at the White House with <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>And so whatever happens at the Fed and whoever they pick next is going to have significant impacts on the markets and one of the reasons why you can see that is because the Fed has been so accommodative to this market.</p><p>You've seen asset inflation, I mean valuations are at all time highs. So it's a fascinating aspect because Secretary MNuchin has reported that he doesn't like Kevin Warsh because he think he could royal markets, right?</p><p>He wasn't for quantitative using, he actually was very adamant against it. And so Jerome Powell is more accommodative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We may know this week or next who the president decides on, we're going to get to all of that coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story this hour and that is the market milestone, 23,000. The DOW Industrial closed above the 23,000 mark for the first time ever yesterday. Treasury Secretary Steven MNuchin though made an important comment throughout the day warning that all of those games could be in jeopardy should Congress fail to pass tax reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY TEXT:</p><p>There is no question that the rally in the stock market has based into it reasonably high expectations of us getting tax cuts and tax reform done. It also has based into it optimism on regulatory relief which they begun to see and there's expectations. So I think to the extent we get the tax deal done, the stock market will go up higher but there's no question in my mind if we don't get it done, you're going to see a reversal of the significant amount of these gains.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: sounds about right, the Senate is expected to vote today on a budget that would allow the Chamber to pass a tax bill with just 51 votes instead of the 60 needed for major legislation.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Former Chief Strategist for Texas Senator Ted Cruz, his senate and president campaign, Jason Johnson is with us along with Former Deputy Secretary of Labor in the Obama Administration, now a Senior Fellow at the University of Virginia Miller Center, Chris Liu. Good to see you both gentlemen, Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>CHRIS LIU, FORMER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF LABOR, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION: Thank you.</p><p>JASON JOHNSON, FORMER CRUZ CAMPAIGN CHIEF STRATEGIST: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Jason, in that same interview, the Treasury Secretary made those comments about the market, he offered this, an absolutely guarantee that a tax overhaul would be sign into law by the end of this year. Is that a reasonable time table? Do you think they will get this done?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well certainly if you look at the performance this year with other major pieces of legislation it doesn't seem reasonable. But I understand why the Secretary is saying what he's saying.</p><p>There is an absolute expectation that this has to be done in the political market if you will. And so I'm not incredibly optimistic that it happens by the end of the year. There certainly seems to be a mixed message coming from some leaders on the Hill as to whether or not the deadline is the end of the year. But whether it's the end of the year or after the first of the year, it must happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chris, do you agree with that that it must happen and that it will happen?</p><p>LIU: I agree with Senator McConnell who said it's more important that we get it right instead of just running this through. And I think it's important to look at the details here and we don't really know yet percentage is going to go to the super wealthy, how it's going to add to the deficit whether it's really going to fix the idiosyncrasies in the tax code right now.</p><p>And so putting it on an artificial deadline does not bode well for coming up with good policy and that's really what the market wants to see right now. They really want to see the once in a generation tax reform proposal, not another giveaway that just goes to the super wealthy.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, Chris considering -- it's Kevin Kelly here. Considering you spent time in the White House especially with President Obama, do you think it's appropriate for a cabinet secretaries or anybody in this administration to be talking about the impact on stock markets given that they should be focusing on policy and talking about the implements, what it could do to the real economy as opposed to really focusing on markets that should do whatever they should be doing?</p><p>LIU: That's exactly right. It's one of the reasons why we in the Obama Administration didn't talk about the stock market even though we had significant gains as well because the market goes up and unfortunately it goes down as well.</p><p>And it goes up or down for reasons that have nothing to do with Washington. And if I were Secretary MNuchin, I would probably take my cues from the leaders on the Hill as to what the timing should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, I know. I think that's a good point but at the same time, $5.3 trillion in market value doesn't come out of air. It's clear that the market value that we've seen in these gains is partly due to optimism over what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is doing.</p><p>He's rolled back an incredible amount of regulation and they're expecting tax reform. Are you saying $5.3 trillion in market value is just a coincidence?</p><p>LIU: Well I would say that it's based on the expectation something's happening. This is a recovery, economic recovery that began in early 2010 and we've had essentially seven straight years of economic growth.</p><p>There have been rollbacks of regulations but there hasn't been this significant economic change that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has promised yet. So a lot of this is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we did see a 3.1 percent GDP the other day and GDP was averaging about one and a half percent under President Obama. So -- I mean there's something to it that the economy is definitely better.</p><p>You're (INAUDIBLE) in small business, do you see that Mike Murphy? Do you see things getting better? Yes.</p><p>MURPHY: Absolutely. We see small business optimism out there, we see startups, we see companies that are looking to disrupt existing industries coming out hiring people, raising money, going out and creating -- using technology to make our lives better. So I think right now the optimism that we see nationwide is something we haven't seen in a long time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jason, let me ask you this, in terms of this bill, if it gets done in the first quarter, do you think that still has a positive impact? If we don't see a bill on the president's desk by Thanksgiving, this is going to be a problem for certainly into the 2018 election for the republicans.</p><p>JOHNSON: Sure. Going back to the comment earlier that we shouldn't have artificial deadlines. I don't believe getting this done by the end of the year or seeing that we need to get it done by the end of the year is an artificial deadline because we know historically that very few things happen in election year.</p><p>And as we all know, next year is an election year. So Maria, into the first quarter, maybe so but we know that you get much passed the first quarter these guys don't like to do much in an election year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And you're right, if they don't get it done maybe that's -- they should move out because this is something that the American people want, Lea Gabrielle.</p><p>GABRIELLE: Yes. Chris, Senator Schumer said our republican friends are trying to hide what's in the tax bill that they don't want people to know.</p><p>Is this just resistance sort of popping up already from the democrats on this obstructionist because really tax reform is good for all Americans right now, is it?</p><p>LIU: A hundred percent agree tax reform is good. What we have seen so far is simply tax cuts and some of the initial estimates are that becoming 50 to 80 percent of the benefits would go to the top one percent. Look --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's not true. That's just not true. I don't want to spew out nonsense because 80 percent of the tax reform package going to the top one percent is nonsense.</p><p>LIU: An important issue to get right. For instance, it's the state and local tax deduction which is going to affect a lot republican members and understanding the details of that is not just resistance, it's actually trying to make sure that this is legitimate tax reform and there are so many issues. This is why this is hard and it's hard to get it right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're talking about a corporate rate of 20 percent. If you see the corporate rate go down from 35 percent to 20 percent, that will be a positive for corporations and the idea is is that they are going to reinvest in higher (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KELLY: It's small businesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Small business with 25 percent pass through rate, same thing down from 39.6. So this is a significant move. He's also talking about three brackets, 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent --</p><p>MURPHY: I mean, small businesses is like --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. I'd like to point out, those aren't republican small businesses, those are democrat, republican, American small businesses. So that impacts everybody not just one side. This isn't a one side versus the other.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And the reason that I have to push back on that Chris is because we were expecting the talking points after this plan and it's just not true that 80 percent of the tax plan impacts the top one percent, it's just not true and we have to make it clear.</p><p>LIU: You know, the problem is, we don't have the details yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm sorry?</p><p>LIU: We don't have the -- we don't have the details yet and I think that's the problem --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well we have the details that we just mentioned, we got three brackets on the individual rates, we got a doubling of the standard deduction, corporate rate of 20 percent, pass through rate of 25 percent, and the elimination of most deductions.</p><p>LIU: Well look, we don't really know what the impact is on average Americans, we don't know what the size of the (INAUDIBLE) tax credit is going to be, we don't understand all the other archaic idiosyncrasy that's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So then how can you say it benefits the one percent if you don't even have the details?</p><p>LIU: Well -- look, we're -- the folks that have looked at this are basing this on the initial proposal. Let's have a whole debate on this and let's make sure we get this right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this because this is -- we're watching President Obama return to the campaign trail Chris to stump for democratic candidates and governance races, of course, in New Jersey and in Virginia, out of next month elections.</p><p>This development comes amid a shakeup at the DNC where several key long time officials have lost their post. The party's new chairman, Tom Perez obviously preparing to host his first meeting since taking over the job earlier this year.</p><p>You were among the 75 people nominated by Tom Perez to become the new at large DNC member, what's behind the shakeup? Tell us how you're feeling? Congratulations by that nomination by the way Chris.</p><p>LIU: Well look, there are about 400 members of the Democratic National Committee. The new chairman get to pick 75. This is a time of change within the Democratic Party and I think we need to admit that things haven't gone as well as they should have over the last couple of years.</p><p>And so unfortunately when you bring new people in, some people that have served for a while have to be moved and that's just part of change. And this is a big 10 party and change happens and change is good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, one thing that seems to be happening is that the Democratic Party is being hijacked by the extreme left Chris.</p><p>Are you going to be able to come up with a message that will resonate with the broad American people, the population given the fact that you've got Barrack Obama, you've got Bernie Sanders, you've got Elizabeth Warren going to the extreme left and really hijacking what was a moderate party at one point?</p><p>LIU: Tom Perez has made a commitment that the democrats need to compete in every seat from the school board to the Senate to the White House.</p><p>And we need to understand that we as a party can't have one monolithic message. That doesn't work in all state and certainly doesn't even work in all rural areas versus urban areas as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point. All right. Gentlemen, thanks very much for the conversation we appreciate you joining us this morning. Chris Liu. Jason, good to see you as well. We will talk with you soon gentlemen.</p><p>Coming up, the head of Homeland Security is warning Americans of a new threat, the concern over ISIS plotting another 9/11 next. We are going to tell you the details of what we know.</p><p>Then Colin Kaepernick firing back at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the new way he's lashing out against him straight ahead.</p><p>A fired up morning thins morning, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A top U.S. security chief warning terror groups are planning a major attack on the scale of 9/11. Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE: That's right Maria, good morning. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke saying it is clear that ISIS and other terror groups are planning to take down planes as an aim to carry out another massive attack. Duke also saying terror groups have been using knife and van attacks to keep their members engaged.</p><p>Well the head of American Express, one of the country's most prominent African-American corporate leaders is leaving the company, Kenneth Chenault depature caps a 16-year run at the credit card company. He's going to be succeeding a CEO by Stephen Squeri a three decade AmEx veteran. Shares of AmEx up 23 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, American cities are pulling all the stops in their bid to become home to Amazon's second headquarters. Stonecrest, Georgia has offered to change its name to Amazon. Tucson, Arizona tried to send a company a 21-foot cactus.</p><p>Amazon has promised to invest $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs. The deadline to submit bids is today. And, of course, check this out, New York City lit up famous buildings including the Empire State Building and one World Trade in Amazon's orange color last night trying to help seal the deal. Probably going to be a little more than light that's going to get Amazon somewhere.</p><p>And then finally there's this, first lady <person><nameText>Melania Trump </nameText></person>is donating her inaugural ball gown to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. She is handing over the vanilla silk off the shoulder gown, it's got a slit skirt. The tradition first began Maria with Helen Taft back in 1912.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. Cool. Thank you so much Cheryl. Interesting. Would you go see the first lady's gown at the Smithsonian Lea?</p><p>GABRIELLE: I think if I was already going to the Smithsonian then I would happen to pass by and see the first lady's gown.</p><p>But I do think that this is really nice about making (INAUDIBLE) because it gives you a sense of being able to even that you can't touch them, just being able to sort of look at them and sort of have the essence of what it must have been like to be there that day. So I think it's wonderful that they do this.</p><p>KELLY: I think it also highlights the importance of the first lady, right? I mean you go throughout history and you look at the contributions they've made. So it's nice that --</p><p>MURPHY: The guy who's getting married in New York.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>MURPHY: I was going to say behind every great man is a better woman.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, says the guy who's getting married.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Yes, exactly. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about your upcoming nuptial.</p><p>KELLY: Well she did get her dress last Friday so maybe I'm just kind of high upbeat excited.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, she got the dress.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, I know. So obviously I didn't see it but it was a fun and exciting experience.</p><p>GABRIELLE: I was going to say, let's see a live TV picture of this and get you in really big trouble.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll keep following all of that. Coming up next though, a real scare in the sky to tell you about, more video of the risky fly-by stunt that got pilot suspended, that's coming up.</p><p>And then GE's new chief taking away company cars and cancelling fancy retreats. The new cost cutting direction for General Electricahead of its earnings tomorrow, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. General Electric's new CEO John Flannery making some changes starting with some old favorites. Tracee Carrasco with the details, Tracee --</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Maria. You know, John Flannery, he's only been on the job since August 1st but he's already making some big changes.</p><p>One of his first belt tightening moves was to ground GE's fleet of six business jets which was a favorite of former GE CEO Jeff Immelt who used to have an empty private jet fly next to his just as a spare and that's just the beginning.</p><p>Bob Nardelli, former Chrysler CEO and Home CEO was on the show yesterday and here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOB NARDELLI, FORMER CEO HOME DEPOT &amp; CHRYSLER: They have to get their fundamental businesses that are left to get some growth. They got to get growth, they've got to get top line growth, they got to get productivity, they got to get innovation.</p><p>The key to GE over the last 16 years Maria as we've seen that goes out have been a lot more than the goes in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARRASCO: And Nardelli worked at GE for several years. And according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" next month Flannery is expected to unveil the results of a strategic review that includes thousands of corporate level job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure.</p><p>He is shutting down research centers in Shanghai, Munich, and Rio democrats Janiero. A GE spokesperson said:</p><p>TEXT: The company will continue to have an intense focus on our global operations and customer base.</p><p>The company is expected to report quarterly reports tomorrow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Look at that stock ahead of those --</p><p>CARRASCO: Hasn't been good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ahead of those numbers. The stock has been cut in half from the highs. No, wait a minute. Let's just underline what you just said Tracee, he had a separate jet flying behind his jet on business trips and the jet flying behind him was empty.</p><p>CARRASCO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he did that for what reason?</p><p>CARRASCO: Just in case there were any issues with the private jet he was already on.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. I mean --</p><p>GABRIELLE: I flew in the navy and I have a commanding officer who made me take a jet to an air show because it was his hometown and he wanted to make sure that if his jet, if there's anything wrong with it he couldn't fly in the air show but there was a spare there. So I've seen this before, pretty wasteful.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. But the biggest problem is they have shareholders, right, that they're held accountable too and I'm sorry --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a public company.</p><p>KELLY: Listen, you don't need to fly a private jet next to you. Listen, if your plane has mechanical issues, guess what, then we'll figure out and we'll rent a private jet that's there to take you back to wherever you need to go. You don't -- yes, exactly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY: Well here's the problem, the board. If I was a member on the board, how can you -- you've got to be held accountable. I mean, they -- like coming out of GE tomorrow and whether they cut the dividend, that's one of the biggest concerns that shareholders are having right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, sure is.</p><p>KELLY: But also what is this board doing if they're allowing this, right? Shareholder capital --</p><p>MURPHY: And (INAUDIBLE) I think for an old company like GE that's trying to figure out how to stay relevant in this new economy, I think something like this coming out makes it really hard for shareholders to believe in this.</p><p>And you could see people wanting to sell this and look at company if they are really on the cutting edge of technology.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that are growing.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes.</p><p>GABRIELLE: But they are looking for places to trim the fat just like Tracee mentioned, shutting down some of those research centers and sort of trying to consolidate their resources. So at least we're moving forward in that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They've got to. We'll see what the company says tomorrow. GE reports at around 8:30a.m. in the morning, tomorrow morning on its third quarter. And, of course, a speculation is around that dividend. Tracee Carrasco, thank you.</p><p>We will take a break.

We've got more, coming up on that. But first, a new approach to measuring success, Fortune Magazine is shining a light on the top names driving the business world tomorrow, where is the growth? We want to know. Fortune is debuting its future 50 list today, covering the most innovative companies prime for explosive growth. Fox Business has the exclusive first look at the list.</p><p>Coming in at number five on Fortunes' Future 50 Leaders, medical robotics leader, Intuitive Surgical, fourth is the king of the stream, Netflix. Number three on this list, Mark Zuckerberg's dorm project turns social media titan, Facebook. Elon Musk, electric automaker Tesla, cruising into the second spot. And topping the list is cloud computing giant, Salesforce, joining us right now in a Fox Business Exclusive, Working Deputy Editor, Brian O'Keefe. Brian, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BRIAN O'KEEFE, DEPUTY EDITOR OF FORTUNE: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, a lot of those names, obviously, very familiar and growth stories that we all know, how did you come up with this list, what are the growth metrics that you used?</p><p>O'KEEFE: So we worked with Boston Consulting Group (BCG), they were our partners in doing this. They did an incredible amount of number crunching, and they looked at 15 years of financial data and they scream for all 2,300 U.S. public companies. And they really looked at a couple of things. One is the market potential of all these companies, what the market is betting, how much growth the market is betting and assigning their value.</p><p>And then they also dove into the company's themselves and looked at people, structure, their technology and investments, they used artificial intelligence, natural language processing to look at 70,000 10Ks and look at the way those companies talked about themselves, if they talked about future and investment and long-term thinking. And they did a lot of backtesting and looked at what correlated with real growth over time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's interesting that Salesforce is the number one -- in the number one spot. Were you surprised with that, Mike?</p><p>MURPHY: I was, for sure, because, you know, when you think about growth, you hear the fangs. You know, you hear about Facebook, which is there but Amazon, Netflix, which is there, Google. So, the way this is -- I think this is going to create a lot of controversy from people who are saying, you know, like, oh, here's the big apple, we don't see therearound.</p><p>KELLY: Apple didn't make the list, actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Apple didn't make the list.</p><p>KELLY: Apple did not make the list, in part to its recent increase emphasis on paying dividends on over reinvestment.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Yes, I mean, you're seeing -- I mean, Apple is the big exception, right? That's, you know, we noted that. And, you know, Apple is obviously still an incredible performer but they are piling up cash, they are paying out dividends under some pressure to shareholders and that's not really a formula for future growth.</p><p>You know, you want to see a company, not that Apple is not doing well, but you want to see them putting it in to new technology, Salesforce, to your point, you know, they are -- Marc Benioff keeps that company really focused on the future, they're investing in artificial intelligence and they're making acquisitions on --</p><p>KELLY: And I think the important thing about Salesforce, if you look it as -- it didn't surprise me one bit about this, because he's actually struck deals and partnerships with other companies like IBM to have a stronger, better, platform for his customers, right? So for insurance companies, if there's a hail storm, they're going to use IBMs (INAUDIBLE) to notify all the policyholders, so he's done a very good job especially on the acquisition side. So if they had a hole on their business model, he went out and bought them.</p><p>GABRIELLE: To look at the list overall, though, you know, a lot of people say the past performance is the best indication of future success and that's really not the way that you created this list, right?</p><p>O'KEEFE: Yes, I mean, that's really, kind of, the whole reason we did create this list, is that past performance isn't the indicator of future success and today's environment, things are changing so much faster, technologies speeding up the pace of change, that we felt like in BCG, felt like, we need a better metric to do that. So that, you know, most of the time, you're measuring a company on.</p><p>You're trying to project the future on what they've been doing recently. And this is like really -- that's why it's diving into, sort of, the DNA of these companies and how they operate and how they talk and how they think and trying to do that in a scientific way. And, you know, looking at the structure of the company, I mean, the hard reality is that younger companies tend to grow faster, I mean, not just smaller companies, but tightly-managed younger companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And founder companies, right?</p><p>O'KEEFE: And founder companies, a lot of the time, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You also put his list of Future 50 Challengers. We just showed it on the screen. These are companies that are on the fast-track for growth but aren't quite there yet. So how did you come up with this list?</p><p>O'KEEFE: Well, the secret about the Future 50 is (INAUDIBLE) list of 25. So we have the 25 big companies and the 25 challengers, is what we called it, BCG, didn't want to -- if you're screening for growth, you're going to naturally get smaller companies, so that's why we did two separate screens to get the big companies that are still growing. The challengers are really the companies that are on the rise, not necessarily small companies, but, you know, it can be like, $5 to 10-billion market cap companies. And you see a lot of software companies on the list overall but especially on the challenger's list, I mean, it's really like software is eating the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what Marc Andreessen said years ago, you know, software eats the world.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Yes, it's still true. It's true, maybe more than ever. I mean, it's, you know, like Veeva Systems, the number one company in the challenger's list.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Workday has been taking market share from, like, the oracles of the world for years.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Workday is huge. I mean, obviously, it's a huge stock, market cap has shut up. And yes, so these are companies that they're displacing traditional systems and they're doing it with software technology.</p><p>KELLY: So on Workday, it's a perineal emanate target, right? And I just wanted to highlight the point you said, though, earlier, 64 percent of the companies in this list are software or online service providers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible.</p><p>GABRIELLE: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: That highlights that this is the wave and this is the future of where we are going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want to find growth, that's where it is.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, and a bit in every industry.</p><p>GABRIELLE: And one of the things that you have said is that, a lot of companies that are using artificial intelligence are, sort of, higher on the list, but you also used artificial intelligence in developing this list, right?</p><p>O'KEEFE: Yes, I mean, that was one of the really cool things that BCG did, is use this natural language processing to troll through 70,000 10Ks = like 200,000 different earnings calls, transcripts, and really look at the language that the management uses to talk about how they managed their own business. And so, and, you know, I don't -- I don't personally know the details of how the artificial intelligence did it, but it correlates certain words and the way they come together with performance.</p><p>MURPHY: So, how far down did you guys dig? Like, how low did you go? Because a company like Salesforces which is number one, they have a venture, we ran a venture capital funds.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Right.</p><p>MURPHY: So Salesforce is actively out there looking to acquire early-stage start-ups. Is there another 50 list of, kind of, the 50 (INAUDIBLE) that's going start-ups or early stage companies?</p><p>O'KEEFE: Maybe we will expand that out. But one thing the BCG did do, was look at the investments that company's making, compared to high performing DC funds to, sort of, get a sense of like how good their investments are. So, that's an interesting way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're hitting on something so important right now. I'm so glad you brought it up, Mike, because you're right, Salesforce has an arm that invests and acquires smaller companies. That's why a lot of these companies as Amazon, you know, other big technology --</p><p>KELLY: Intel.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Intel, you're seeing large tech right now, have venture capital arm and they are acquiring some of the smaller, no-names out there.</p><p>O'KEEFE: You know, we have a story on Salesforce that goes deeper into what they're doing. They bought 55 companies since 2006.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>O'KEEFE: And Marc Benioff, you know, a lot of times, like, maybe he doesn't even exactly know what they're going to do with the company but he knows there's an interesting technology and they make it an acquisition, they figure out how it's going to impact their business.</p><p>KELLY: Is there a super surprised company, for you, because I'm looking at this list and I'm not surprised by it, but I think people could be as the intercontinental exchange that, you know, they run the New York stock exchange, but really, those companies, the exchange have been focusing on data, licensing, it's not really --</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of (INAUDIBLE) mergers.</p><p>KELLY: Exactly. So, is there a company on this list that surprised you the most?</p><p>O'KEEFE: Surprised me the most, I mean, I'm a little surprised -- Monster Beverage is a really interesting company.</p><p>KELLY: Number 20 on that list.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Because they have been growing fast for 20 years, and, you know, I don't drink Monster Beverage drinks, but a lot of people do. They're really smart about how they market their brand, they don't really do a lot of advertising but they do a lot of really cool, sort of, sponsorship stuff. And they just, you know, they keep growing that company year after year.</p><p>KELLY: And the next leg of growth for Monster Beverage is over in China and Asia, so that's where they're looking to go so if you follow the stock close, you can see they've dominated North America and they've slowly been making inroads and smart positioning in Asia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look at that chart.</p><p>O'KEEFE: You know we have MasterCard and Visa on the list. And I think that's really interesting because they seemed like, you know, it's the card in your wallet. But they're really doing a lot of innovative things. They are trying to be, you know, the future of payments in all different forms.</p><p>MURPHY: And when we talk about big tech companies or fin-tech companies doing acquisitions, early-stage investing. But there's also companies like Campbell Soup has (INAUDIBLE) so it's not just big tech that's looking to acquire small innovative companies. I think it's across all diferent --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Campbell Soup, wow. And these guys are computer guys like you. We had Ann Winblad on from Winblad, who is a great venture capitalist. And she said, I'm competing with the arms of the soft, you know, of the SoftBanks, not SoftBanks, of the --</p><p>MURPHY: The large corporations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The large corporation. The largest technology --</p><p>KELLY: Imagine if the repatriation happens, of the taxes of all those trillions of dollars overseas to these companies that they can then re- invest since small businesses start up, things that are happening. I mean, not to tie this into the whole tax reform overhaul policy but that could be a good next leg of growth for this company.</p><p>O'KEEFE: First, they have to find the right things to invest in.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO: These lists are helpful. Brian, thank you so much, Brian O'Keefe joining us. We wanted to also -- should we take a look at IBM real quick. I mean, IBM was obviously stalled in terms of its revenue growth for 22 quarters. You saw a decline in revenue but yesterday, check out that stock yesterday. Nine percent, one of the reasons the Dow Industrials hit 23,000. I just wanted to mention that, is this a turning point for IBM?</p><p>MURPHY: I don't think so. I think when you see that type of move, so much of the volume in the markets right now is computer driven or algorithmic trading. That, to me, smells like a short covering -- short squeeze.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll keep watching IBM. Obviously, IBM, GE, two- story stocks that we want to look at today. Brian, good to see you, thank you. Coming up next, the fight is growing over Catalonia's push for independence. How the Spanish government is trying to stop the region's succession, that's next. And then a terrifying close call, more video of that scary fly by that put 200 passengers at risk. We'll tell you all about it, back in a moment, straight ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back! Markets are down this morning after a huge day yesterday. Dow Industrials' expected to be down better than 100 points. No surprise. The market crossed 23,000 yesterday for the first time ever in a big rally, and, of course, we're up to better than $5 trillion in market value since the election.</p><p>A couple names on the move, Gilead Sciences; the stock right now is up almost three percent in the premarket after winning FDA approval for a new cancer gene therapy -- used to treat lymphoma. The pharmaceutical giant will sell the treatment at $373,000. It's only the second gene therapy to earn approval from the FDA on that. Novartis brought the first drug of this class to market back in August.</p><p>EBay shares this morning on the move after delivering third-quarter earnings after the bell last night. The results were roughly in line but fourth-quarter guidance's disappointed. EBay is revamping its online marketplace amid tough competition from Amazon. Stock, right now, taken a real hit down 6-1/2 percent in the premarket.</p><p>And then, there's Spain, the government there is set to activate an emergency measure to take control of Catalonia, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria. So, Spain's government calling a special cabinet for the weekend to activate this measure -- it allows for the central government to take over the semiautonomous power of any of the country's17 regions. Now, this comes after Catalonia's leader said, Separatist lawmakers, can vote in favor of declaration of independence. The measure has never been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in Spain.</p><p>Well, an Air Berlin pilot is in big trouble. He performed a risky flying stunt with 200 passengers aboard. You're watching the video of it right now. Reports say he buzzed Dusseldorf Airport terminal in a maneuver that was met to mark the bankrupt last Trans-Atlantic flight. Well, a pilot of another told Reuters that a go-around should only be performed for its operations, or safety aviation officials are looking at this video and looking into this incident.</p><p>Well, Blue Apron, they are tightening their belt. The company has laid out six percent of the workforce, that's about 300 workers, as part of a company or organization. Blue Apron has struggled since it went public back in June with its stock price cut in half since then. Competition from a rival, a big one that would-be Amazon. There is the year to date chart, you can see it on your screen.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sea World is laying off 350 workers due to low attendance at its parks -- mainly in Orlando and San Diego. They've been trying to rebuild the brand solving protests over its treatment of their killer whales. Shares of Sea World, down more than 34 percent year to date.</p><p>And then, finally this, Snickers are getting a facelift, actually three facelifts. The candy company announcing they're going to release a line of three new flavors to combat a number of different, well, emotional issues. Feeling irritable, wimpy, indecisive? Well, they've got the cure. These three bars: espresso, fiery, and salty and sweet, Maria. Right now, I think I want the espresso. I'm a little tired.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow! Yes, the expresso sounds good.</p><p>KELLY: Thanks to wimpy for fiery, right? Like, I like spicy stuff, but it doesn't mean that I'm a wimp.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's taking it personally.</p><p>GABRIELLE: So -- but personally, I'm really concerned about the espresso one, because if you're irritable, I think the last thing you actually need is to have some more caffeine. More caffeine. I always like those names, though. I actually find that really attractive. When you're in a store and you're looking at candy and you're like, yes, you know, I kind of feel irritable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But do you buy right there? Or will you buy it because of that?</p><p>GABRIELLE: No. Only if I really want it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking out over the national anthem protest. What he said to players and how they're reacting, next. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's a big night at Wrigley Field last night. The Cubs fought for their playoff lives and they survived. Jared Max with the highlights, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER: Hey! Good morning, Maria. I know the Dodgers are only one win from the World Series, but just imagine the Cubs came all the way back to win the NLC. Yes, they did what they had to do last night in a do or die game 4.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BASEBALL GAMEPLAY)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Javier Baez at two home runs; Wilson Contreras also (INAUDIBLE) for the Cubs. Dodgers would blast from Cody Dellinger and Justin Turner, but the Cubs win. Cubs win! Cubs win, 3-2. So, there will be a game 5. Tonight, at Wrigley Field, the Cubs pick Jose Montana. The Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw L.A. leads three games to one.</p><p>New York Yankees rookie, Aaron Judge, a hero again last night.

Here's to start, Justin Verlander tomorrow night, and Yankees turn to Luis Severino. Yanks, one win from their 41st American League pennant.</p><p>Hey, you know when somebody says, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. Well, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the opposite yesterday, regarding players choices to stand or kneel for the national anthem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROGER GOODELL, COMMISSIONER FOR THE NFL: Everyone should stand for the national anthem, that's an important part of our policy. It's also an important part of our game that we all take great pride in, it's also important for us to honor our flag and to our country, and we think our fans expect us to do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Everyone should stand, not must stand. While Goodell said he just wants to keep the politics out of football. <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>responded on Twitter, \"NFL, too much talk, not enough action. Stand for the national anthem.\" And while Colin Kaepernick, the first anthem kneeler, remained silent except for retweets about not enough attention being given to what he says police brutality against people of color. The Seahawks' Michael Bennett isn't interested in discussing how to fix these social issues. While the NFL team owners are trying to.</p><p>Why? He says, \"I don't think we can work alongside them until we address that issue. I think the issue with Kaepernick is the start to a conversation. If they want us to be open to what they want, the dialogue, then that's something that needs to be on the table right there.\" So, Kaepernick first and then the issues.</p><p>Some kneel, some protests, some put their money where their mouth is, like the Philadelphia Eagles' Chris Long who has supported teammates protesting the national anthem but is also doing something else. Chris Long of the Eagles, who had donated his first six-game paychecks this season to fund two scholarships at a prep school in Charlottesville where he grew up is now donating the rest of his 2017 NFL salary. Ten more paychecks to help fund education to make it for folks who are -- don't get the opportunities in certain cities -- ten weeks of paychecks going to this in cities of St. Louis, Boston and also Philadelphia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is great.</p><p>KELLY: Leading by example.</p><p>GABRIELLE: Football has a 10 for Tomorrow campaign. Good on him for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, go Yanks!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sorry, Max.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MURPHY: Yes, this should be the go Yanks.</p><p>MAX: Some Mets fans started this as soon when the Yankees beat the Mets, and he got Wednesday missing. Somehow, the Yankees do this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Mets are still amazing. Sorry. All right. Jared Max. Catch Jared's sports reports on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7,\" SiriusXM 115. I want to bring you this breaking news: the president is tweeting this morning. Here is what he said, \"Republicans are going for big budget approval today. The first step toward massive tax cuts. I think we have the votes, but who knows?\" Uh-oh!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KELLY: Who knows? Caveat.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I guess they need the caveat in this day and age. We'll take a break. When we come back, cities are mailing in their bid to Amazon. We're taking a look at the other crazy stumps from towns competing for technology giants' second headquarters, wait until you see this. That's next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back! Good Thursday morning, everybody. Happy Thursday to you. Thanks for being with us. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo, </nameText></person>and it is Thursday, October 19th. Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast. A market milestone yesterday.

Since Dec. 31, the Nasdaq Composite Index is up 6.7 per cent, while the S&amp;;P/TSX Composite Index gained more than seven per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The market's bounceback hasn't comforted Horizons ETFs portfolio manager Hans Albrecht, who describes it as a \"show-me-first market\" -\u00a0one that requires positive results to convince investors to buy in. With Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. each reporting this week, it's set to get its first major test of 2019.</p><p>\"I think the market is on tenterhooks,\" said Albrecht, who runs a covered-call fund that is made up of some of the largest tech companies in the world. \"I think at any moment we could see a resumption of that selling.\"</p><p>Of the tech giants, Albrecht and KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves agree that Apple is the one investors should be most concerned with. In terms of its impact on the market, Apple's earnings could signal broader issues in the global market, Hargreaves said. In a letter to investors, Apple CEO Tim Cook already warned that revenue for the company's first fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 29, would be 15 per cent weaker than expected, blaming the shortfall on iPhone sales in China.</p><p>Although the company, which shocked analysts last year by announcing it would no longer publish iPhone sales numbers before posting an earnings miss, has already announced its bad news, analysts are still in the dark over guidance. Should those numbers fail to impress, it would suggest to Hargreaves that the company's issues have seeped into its other products and other geographical locations. Even though Apple's stock has plunged more than 33 per cent since hitting a peak in October, it remains a risky play.</p><p>\"I'm still of the view that there's more risk there than opportunity for upside even with the big reset because the perception there is that it's still mostly a China issue ... and that the rest of the world is fine,\" Hargreaves said.</p><p>While poorly received guidance from Apple could offer yet another sign of a global slowdown and convince investors to sell, an earnings miss for Facebook would be treated differently, Hargreaves said. For the social media company, which has seen headline risk mainly over privacy concerns, a miss would instead be seen as a company-specific problem, lessening its potential to drag the market down.</p><p>According to BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon, the stock is still expected to outperform as long as \"Custom Audiences capabilities are not hindered by regulation and negative press doesn't thwart agencies/brands, but visibility remains low.\"</p><p>Due to the possible return of volatility, Albrecht suggested investors should dip into the options market for protection. Buying puts on the individual names would leave investors at the mercy of inflated volatility, he said. He suggests buying six-month to one-year put options on the Nasdaq Composite Index with a 12 per cent strike range on the downside, he said. They're more expensive than short-term puts, he said, but would protect investors in the event the FAANG stocks are responsible for volatility returning to the market.</p><p>\"Spend your money on your insurance like you would for your house or your car and hope you don't need it,\" Albrecht said. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Times &amp;; Transcript (Moncton)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMTE-384544361MOTT</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9M-1391-F084-B135-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Times &amp; Transcript.
