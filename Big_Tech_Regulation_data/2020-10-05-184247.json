The probe may lead to a \"probable loss\" of $150 million to $250 million, the San Francisco-based company said.</p><p>\"The matter remains unresolved and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome,\" Twitter said.</p><p>Twitter's 2011 settlement with the FTC barred the company for 20 years from \"misleading consumers about the extent to which it protects the security, privacy, and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information.\" The agreement sprang from a 2009 hack of the social media platform that allowed intruders to send out phony messages from any account, among other issues. Under the settlement, the company also had to honour users'privacy choices and faced fines of as much as $16,000 per violation of the order in the future, the FTC said at the time. A spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment.</p><p>Twitter's shares fell about one per cent in extended trading after closing at $36.39 in New York. The stock has gained 14 per cent this year.</p><p>\"Following the announcement of our Q2 financial results, we received a draft complaint from the FTC alleging violations of our 2011 consent order,\" a Twitter spokesperson said. \"Following standard accounting rules we included an estimated range for settlement.\"</p><p>The FTC has been fining big tech platforms in recent years for data lapses, including the recent record $5 billion fine against Facebook and a settlement with Google's YouTube over alleged collection of children's data that included a $170 million fine.</p><p>Twitter confirmed in 2019 that it was using phone numbers provided to the company for security purposes to target those users with advertising. The current complaint says the company violated the terms of the agreement by misusing phone numbers or emails \"during periods between 2013 and 2019,\" according to the filing.</p><p>It's unknown whether Twitter will face a similar investigation for a high-profile incident last month in which hackers took control of the accounts of some of the service's most famous users as part of a Bitcoin scam. That attackers gained access to 130 Twitter accounts, including those of former president Barack Obama, current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Hackers accessed the direct messages linked to 36 of those accounts, and downloaded the personal data from seven of them, Twitter said.</p><p>Twitter said a hacker gained access to the accounts in part by tricking some employees over the phone. Three people were charged last week in the attack. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGE-407120243FRDG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGLR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HJ-23K1-JCT2-K1FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306536</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"504\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Daily Gleaner All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Gleaner (New Brunswick)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>twitter,being,investigated,federal,trade,commission</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

American negotiators have proposed including the language in other prospective deals, including with the European Union, Britain and members of the World Trade Organization. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The administration's push is the latest salvo in a global fight over who sets the rules for the internet. While the rules for trading goods have largely been written -- often by the United States -- the world has far fewer standards for digital products. Countries are rushing into this vacuum, and in most cases writing regulations that are far more restrictive than the tech industry would prefer.</p><p>  Europe has enacted tough policies to curb the behavior of companies like Facebook and Google and passed laws to deal with privacy, hate speech and disinformation. China has largely cordoned itself off from the rest of the internet, allowing Beijing to censor political content and bolster Chinese tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent. In India, Indonesia, Russia and Vietnam, governments are introducing regulations to ostensibly protect their citizens' privacy and build domestic internet industries that critics say will stymie the ability of American companies to provide services in those countries.</p><p>  The United States wants its more permissive rules to form the basis for worldwide regulation. But there is a rising debate about whether its regime of internet regulations has failed to protect consumer privacy, encouraged the spread of disinformation and supported a powerful forum for harassment and bullying.</p><p>  The American rules, codified in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, shield online platforms from many lawsuits related to user content and protect them from legal challenges stemming from how they moderate content. Those rules are largely credited with fueling Silicon Valley's rapid growth. The language in the trade deals echoes those provisions but contains some differences.</p><p>  [Read more about Section 230 and why it is so consequential.]</p><p>  That freedom has come under intense criticism from lawmakers and advocates. They say the 23-year-old law has allowed companies like Facebook and Google to avoid responsibility for harm associated with content that reaches billions of users. That anger has been compounded by revelations about the role of Silicon Valley's business practices in the spread of disinformation and treatment of user data.</p><p>  The leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in August that it was ''inappropriate for the United States to export language mirroring Section 230 while such serious policy discussions are ongoing.'' The committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, and its ranking Republican, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, warned Mr. Trump's top trade adviser, Robert Lighthizer, that it would be a mistake to include the protections ''in any trade deal going forward.''</p><p>  On Monday, they called on Mr. Lighthizer to testify before the committee on the issue.</p><p>  Enmity toward Section 230 is bipartisan. Conservatives have raised concerns in light of claims, largely made without evidence, that major online platforms like Facebook are biased against their positions. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, has said the liability shield should cover large platforms only if they are certified as politically neutral. The White House is also said to be drafting an executive order that would narrow the law's protections.</p><p>  Last year, Congress overwhelmingly approved a bill making it possible to sue online platforms for knowingly facilitating sex trafficking. Lawmakers have raised the prospect of creating additional carve-outs for the online sale of opioids.</p><p>  Critics of Section 230 say they are alarmed by the inclusion of its provisions in trade deals.</p><p>  ''These trade agreements are only allocating more power to the companies at the expense of the individual,'' said Carrie Goldberg, a New York lawyer who is challenging the gay dating app Grindr's ability to use Section 230 to defend itself from a lawsuit.</p><p>  American trade negotiators have largely shrugged off those concerns, insisting that new trade deals include language that requires partners to limit legal liability for online platforms. Similar protections first appeared last year in the draft pact with Canada and Mexico that Mr. Trump hopes will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>  Administration officials say Congress has tasked them with negotiating trade agreements that closely mirror American law. If those laws are a problem, it is up to Congress to change them, they say.</p><p>  ''This is U.S. law,'' Mr. Lighthizer said in a congressional hearing in June. ''I didn't write 230. The Congress did -- it was signed by the president, number one.</p><p>  ''Number two, we think it's -- that there are -- there are nowhere near the problems that you see on issues of public morality and the like,'' he added. ''We put in specific language to make sure that that was not a problem.''</p><p>  Trade agreements don't completely prevent a country from passing legislation that contradicts their terms -- including on legal liability -- but they make doing so more complicated and risky. If a country violates a trade agreement, other members of the pact can bring trade disputes against them and may be able to impose tariffs or argue for leaving the pact.</p><p>  The Trump administration describes the broader tech provisions in the agreements as a ''gold standard'' for the digital economy, and says it plans to use them in future negotiations, including with the European Union and Britain, if it leaves the bloc. The rules, which also provide for open access to government data and protections for company source codes and algorithms, are also part of the United States proposal for negotiations over e-commerce with dozens of countries at the World Trade Organization.</p><p>  The tech industry has provided vocal support for the provisions as a way to discourage other countries from making platforms liable for their content. They argue that such legal exposure could clamp down on many kinds of normal business activity -- including hosting user reviews and ratings -- and could become a tool of governments hoping to crack down on free speech.</p><p>  ''Failing to include these protections -- which have been a part of U.S. law for two decades -- in trade agreements would negatively impact the countless small businesses and entrepreneurs that use online platforms to export and advertise their businesses,'' said Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, which represents companies including Google, Amazon, Facebook, eBay and Twitter.</p><p>  The idea has a powerful supporter in Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade. Mr. Wyden also has a personal connection to the issue: He co-wrote Section 230 while serving in the House.</p><p>  In an interview, Mr. Wyden rejected the idea that trade agreements were an end run around Congress.</p><p>  ''I know some people are trying to say, 'Oh, my goodness, there's this brand-new thing: Somebody's talking about trade and 230,''' he said. ''Get real.''</p><p>  Mr. Wyden said strong digital trade agreements should support free speech and ''include the principle that online businesses are able to moderate content generated by users without being treated as the speaker.''</p><p>  Regardless, countries around the world have weighed whether to increase the responsibility that companies have for user content on their platforms -- raising the prospect that American trade efforts to enshrine the Communications Decency Act's protections may run aground.</p><p>  ''I don't think there's a chance that major economies like the E.U. are going to accept C.D.A. 230'' said Daphne Keller, the director of intermediary liability at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society. ''So I'm not sure what the net effect is.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Companies like Facebook support the Trump administration's efforts to enshrine liability protections in trade deals despite congressional resistance.

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.''If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes. </p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,'' Mnuchin said.On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,'' Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.'' <url normalizedValue=\"https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-06/7ADD176E-3FB7-4051-844F-0669FD42FF78.jpg?itok=nMzpBAm6FILE\">https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-06/7ADD176E-3FB7-4051-844F-0669FD42FF78.jpg?itok=nMzpBAm6FILE</url> - Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a news conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, May 1, 2019, in Washington. Unlike Mnuchin, Powell -as head of the central bank -is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.'' She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system'' that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.''Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,'' Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.''The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin'' backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet'' subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from Calibra, the company says. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121563246536333251762500172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK6-MMC1-DXN1-C044-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><timeReceived>3:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\u201d</p><p> If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p> The Treasury chief\u2019s comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p> The Treasury Department has \u201cvery serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\u201d he said.</p><p>Facebook has \u201ca lot of work to do before we get to the point where we\u2019re comfortable with it,\u201d Mnuchin said.</p><p> On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook\u2019s Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s plan \u201craises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony.</p><p> \u201cThose are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.\u201d</p><p> Unlike Mnuchin, Powell \u2014 as head of the central bank \u2014 is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p> Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency.</p><p> Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p> Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., called Libra \u201ca new Swiss-based financial system\u201d that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p> David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for today\u2019s hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \u201cis about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKDE-174B5F02D5F825F7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289954A2E7F463 NWBKDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK7-SY31-JBCN-42MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409133</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"531\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Delaware State News.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In a press conference[2] today, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns\" that Libra could be misused by money launderers, terrorist financiers and other bad players. While the concerns are not entirely surprising, they do make the US government's stance on cryptocurrency more than clear.According to Mnuchin, the US has been at the forefront of regulating entities that provide cryptocurrencies. </p><p>It has also seen cryptocurrencies exploited to support illicit activities including cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, human trafficking and more. Still, Mnuchin said the US \"welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services.\"\"With respect to Facebook's Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse,\" Mnuchin said. He noted that Facebook (and any other cryptocurrency providers[3]) will have to meet the same safeguards as traditional financial institutions, including those put in place by the Anti-Money Laundering Council, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Bank Secrecy Act.That should come as no surprise to Facebook. While it's likely prepared to meet those standards, it will have to navigate pushback like this from the Treasury Department and the President himself, who claims cryptocurrencies are \"highly volatile and based on thin air.\"[4] Some lawmakers have called for Facebook to halt Libra's development[5], and others want to block all big tech companies[6] from providing cryptocurrencies. Facebook is scheduled to testify[7] at a Senate hearing tomorrow, and it has said it won't launch Libra until all of the regulatory issues are addressed.

In May 2010, O'Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanour in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans district office.</p><p>\"He's not controversial, he's truthful,\" Trump insisted of O'Keefe.</p><p>Playing to the friendly crowd in the East Room, Trump was at ease, joking about everything from his spelling in tweets (blaming his thumbs, not his brain, for any mistakes) to his hair (saying the rainy weather at his July 4 outdoor speech at least proved his hair was real.)</p><p>\"With amazing creativity and determination, you are bypassing the corrupt establishment, and it is corrupt,\" Trump said. \"And you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media.\"</p><p>In lengthy remarks, he said: \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. ... You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\"</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p>The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with companies like Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has an estimated 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>He announced Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\"</p><p>And Trump said he is inviting executives from major social media platforms to join him at the White House over the next month or so.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump unleased a volley of Twitter messages Thursday leading up to the conference. The targets were familiar - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020.</p><p>After the conference, Trump published a series of tweets slamming Bitcoin and other types of digital currency - including Facebook's recently announced Libra.</p><p>Among the other conservative organizations participating in the White House meeting were Turning Point USA, a non-profit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think-tank .</p><p>Accusations commonly levelled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. Twitter policy prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Lila Rose, president of Live Action, said at the event that her group has been banned from advertising on Twitter while Planned Parenthood is allowed to do so. Pinterest also suspended the group from its platform, she said.</p><p>\"This double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech,\" Rose said.</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has been sharply critical of the big companies because of their market dominance and effect on competition. He leads a House Judiciary subcommittee that has opened a bipartisan probe into the tech giants' market conduct.</p><p>\"If someone wants to show me some empirical data, instead of some alt-right member's paranoid claims, I'd appreciate it,\" Cicilline said in a statement Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBCHRN-395486807TBCJ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJC-K7P1-F08C-60GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437301</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1121\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Chronicle Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Chronicle Journal</publicationName><edition>Web Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Barr indicated major companies were facing extortion pressures to do lobbying for Beijing, arguing China was 'hiding behind American voices' and interfering in domestic politics.   He warned business had to disclose any lobbying on behalf of foreign governments, under regulations known as FARA. Failure to do so could lead to prosecution.  The attorney general directly accused some some of the biggest US technology companies, including Apple, of being 'all to willing to collaborate' with Beijing.   'Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of the communist Chinese drum will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade or the free exchange of ideas,' Barr said.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 12. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button. Markets this morning are lower. We are near -- well, we're off of the lows of the morning but certainly off of the highs as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow industrials down 65 points, Boeing is now another drag on the Dow this morning. S&amp;P 500 just went negative a few minutes ago, down a quarter point but the NASDAQ up, this morning up 8-1/2, up nine points right now on NASDAQ, on top of big gains yesterday. Stocks staged a late-day rally yesterday driven by technology stocks. DowIndustrials were up 200 points, three- quarters of a percent, the S&amp;P was up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>But take a look at the NASDAQ, it was up 150 points due to the strength in tech, better than two percent on the session yesterday. Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at the European indices where the FT- 100 is up 18 points, quarter of a percent but the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 15 and the DAX Index in Germany down 25. In Asia overnight, gains across-the-board the best performer was Japan, Nikkei Average up 1-3/4 percent.</p><p>Well, the groundings of Boeing 737 Max 8 jet are expanding across the world. Nearly half of all of the jets that have been delivered since May of '17 are now parked. The fallout coming up this morning for Boeing as the stock trades down another two percent as we speak. Carlos Ghosn replaced the Renault-Nissan alliance unveiling a new board structure as the automakers chart their path forward. As you know, Carlos Ghosn is now out of jail on bail.</p><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk fires back at regulators this morning. What he said about his tweeting habits later this hour. Stock is down again 1-1/2 percent. And the internet us turning 30 years old. Google celebrates with its doodle today but the man behind the World Wide Web has a warning about the future.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the author of Love Your Enemies and the president of AEI, Arthur Brooks is in studio this morning and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey bell. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Good morning.</p><p>ARTHUR BROOKS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Good morning.</p><p>BELL: Lots to cover today, from Brexit, to the budget and Boeing.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We should point out because you mentioned that nearly half of the planes delivered since May of 2017 have been ground by other nations but the Federal Aviation Administration has held off grounding Boeing planes after the crash waiting to see what they find out about this particular crash, although the FAA is expected by the end of next month to mandate a software fix for the automated-flight control system that did play a role in the first crash in Indonesia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Which is why -- what is it, southwest and American airlines have 737s, they haven't taken them out of the lineup, they're there as -- following the FAA's cues.</p><p>BELL: Well, and safety authorities here in the U.S. have been very careful on tying the Ethiopian Air accident just recently to the Lion Air accident that happened in October but you have China out there, their regulators saying that there could be a connection, it's really very uncertain, a lot of people here are saying it's too early to draw connection.</p><p>BROOKS: Their people -- the companies are very worried that the flying public is going to panic, and so that's why they're taking them off just in advance for that reason but there is no evidence at this point that there's a problem with the plane. I strongly suspect that it's -- it will be cleared quickly and Boeing is going to be fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, and China's reaction you have to look as Maria did yesterday at the backdrop of what's going on between the United States and China and some nations to suggest that China somehow knows more about a crash in Ethiopia than the U.S. safety regulators do and they were in the ground almost immediately in the country as part of the investigation of black boxes being -- have been recovered.</p><p>But there is that kind of rash move by some countries, potentially to make the United States look bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Boeing sells a third of all of that plane 737 to China. Obviously, China --</p><p>BROOKS: It's an incredible safe aircraft. It has incredible safety record. There's no evidence that something horrible were going wrong worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is what Dennis Muhlenberg told us the end of last year, the CEO of Boeing. Meanwhile, President Trump outlines his plans to defense and border spending in his 2020 budget. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning with the very latest there. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. This is third budget put forth by President Trump and his administration but the first time that they have put a budget forward in which Democrats control the appropriations process up on the Hill in the House of Representatives. The President wish list includes increasing defense spending by five percent, up to $750 billion.</p><p>While, also decreasing nondefense discretionary spending by that same amount, five percent. Pair that the request $8.6 billion for new funding for the border wall and it's why Democrats say this is going nowhere fast, dead on arrival. Senator Elizabeth Warren taking to Twitter last night, she wrote the following of the President's budget saying \"A budget is more about -- is about more than numbers, a budget is about values and the budge the President released today is another big wet kiss to the super rich and giant corporations and it guts programs for everyone else.\"</p><p>Now, she is echoing complaints from Democrats about the spending levels for Medicare and Medicaid but the Trump administration insists those levels are not being rolled back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSSELL VOUGHT, ACTING WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR: What we are doing is putting forward reforms that lower drug prices that because Medicare pays a very large share of drug prices in this country, has the impact of finding savings. We're also finding ways, fraud, and abuse but Medicare spending will go up every year by healthy margins and no structural changes for Medicare beneficiaries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The budget that was put forth yesterday, Maria, would balance in 15th year. It also includes deficits of somewhere between a trillion dollars, and $1.1 trillion for fiscal years '19, '20, '21, and '22. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big numbers there. Blake, thank you. Blake Burman at the White House. Joining us right now is the New Voice CEO, former Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain. Herman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE NEW VOICE: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not every president gets his budget proposals materialized, right? What's your view on all of this?</p><p>CAIN: At least, it's a budget. I don't think the Democrats put forth a budget that was balanced in the eight years that Obama was president. Second, it doesn't matter what budget the President puts forth, the Democrats are going to punch holes in it. One of the most impressive parts of the budget to me is the fact that he says there is going to be a five percent across the board cut in nondiscretionary spening.</p><p>And it's going to come from looking for savings. This is what a leader does. The leader mandates a target and it's up to those that are running the various departments to go out and find those savings. I've had to do that as the CEO and that's exactly what the President is doing.</p><p>BROOKS: Hello, Mr. Cain, Arthur Brooks here from EEI. It's nice to see you again. I worry a lot when I see this, you know, when I see $1.1 trillion deficit in the best economy in the past 35 years which I saw great but we can't be running deficits like this when the thing is -- when we're an expansion, we're going to -- we're going to -- governments always do this, you know, we're going to -- we're balance this thing in the out- years.</p><p>We don't exactly know how but we're really going to do it and I know you've got to be skeptical about this too. So give some hard advice and some real criticism to your brother Republicans.</p><p>CAIN: The hard advice would be go find those savings, get serious about restraining spending. That would be the hard advice. The problem of it is that they never get serious about it. Republicans or Democrats.</p><p>BROOKS: Right.</p><p>CAIN: You can't just -- you can't just blame President Trump and his administration who has been there now a little over two years for this mess that we are in. Secondly, no one has mentioned that revenues to the treasury because of the tax cuts are up. So you've got those going up which is a good thing but he is now also trying to put the brakes on spending, and all the Democrats can do is criticize, criticize, criticize and say we're not going to approve any money fort wall,</p><p>I think the President has taken bold step and at least putting this directional budget on the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But he hasn't taken a step towards bold spending cuts because again what two-thirds of Federal spending, Herman, are on autopilot or because of entitlement programs. And there's no evidence -- again, President Trump ran on it, I'm not going to touch Social Security, I'm not going to touch Medicare, that's fine and dandy, I know he's got to run for reelection in 2020 again. But if you keep -- again, this never gets discussed and never gets talked about by anybody.</p><p>CAIN: You are right. Dagen. The non-- the discretionary portion hasn't been touched because it's to require central changes. The President has not addressed that yet. I agree with you. But if the President can't get a few measly billions of dollars for a wall, do you think that the Democrats and the liberals and the lunatics are going to let him get away within structural recommendations? No. Not yet. I don't know when he is going to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CAIN: But I do believe that before his first term is up he is going to get around to proposing some structural changes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, they're going to be pushing back and they are pushing the Democratic National Committee looking into 2020 announcing that its chosen Milwaukee, Wisconsin to host the 2020 convention. Republicans were quick to point out that the socialist history is pretty alive and well in Milwaukee, the town has elected three socialist mayors in the past. The Wisconsin GOP tweeted this yesterday, with the 2020 Democrat presidential primary field currently stumbling over each other in a race for the radical left.</p><p>It makes sense that their party would choose to hold its convention and the only American city that has elected three socialist mayors. It feels like this 2020 election is going to be a very clear choice between socialism versus capitalism, Herman.</p><p>CAIN: I would absolutely agree with you. Let's not forget, Milwaukee is in Wisconsin and it's a big mea culpa on behalf of Hillary Clinton because she did not go there when she ran for president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CAIN: That is the other factor I think is at play and trying to go and show some love to the State of Wisconsin. But a bigger point --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Herman, it can be summed up in two words.</p><p>CAIN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Cheese curds.</p><p>CAIN: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS: The Democratic Party is doing an epic trolling --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS: -- by actually going to the state where she didn't -- she didn't campaign. They're just trolling their own candidate. This is the most amazing thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And why would -- do they not realize that? Do they not get it? What about the issue of socialism versus capitalism? Are people clear on the differences? Do you think -- I mean, because, you know, you've got all of these ideas, the Green New Deal, you've got the Medicare for all, the tax on wealth, 70 percent tax rate. Do people understand what this means and what these Federal programs look like, socialist, federal government takeovers?</p><p>CAIN: Some people don't understand the difference between capitalism and socialism but the good news is most people know that socialism has never worked in a country, in the history of the world. So the Republicans and the conservatives and all the voices out there, the big challenge is to make sure that people understand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CAIN: I am a firm believer that if people have the right information and the right understanding, they will make the right decision. That is no contest between capitalism and socialism. All you have to do is look at the success of the United States of America and make sure that the people understand that and they will not be swayed by these empty socialist promises coming from all the Democrat presidential wanna-bes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see, we'll see. All right, Herman. Great to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>CAIN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we didn't even get to Nancy Pelosi saying she doesn't want to impeach the President, Herman. We'll save that for next time. Herman Cain.</p><p>CAIN: OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up right after this, global backlash over Boeing this morning. More countries across the world moving to suspend the 737 Max 8 jet in the aftermath of the deadly crash in Ethiopia. We're breaking down the fallout. And then internet revolution. The World Wide Web turns 30 years old but its creator is issuing a warning sign. What he is saying. Back in a minute.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA. I'm Cheryl Casone with some top headlines. We're following more countries are grounding Boeing's 737 Max 8 jet. Malaysia and Australia, the latest country to suspend the aircraft from their airports after the deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday. The countries follow similar moves in China, South Africa, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico.</p><p>But here in the United States the FAA says it has no plans to ground the aircraft for now but it has ordered Boeing to make urgent improvements to it. Boeing confirming it will deploy a software upgrade to the 737 Max 8. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg defended the airplane's safety to Maria after the Lion Air crash.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MUILENBURG: The real bottom line here, the key is that the 737 Max is very safe and we're very confident in that. Safety is a core value for our industry and for our company. Always has been, it always will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But was there a change in terms of this model, the 737 that wasn't articulated to the pilots at the airlines that they did not know how to respond in the event of a change. That's what the charges are.</p><p>MUILENBURG: Yes. The 737 Max has some new capabilities that are embedded in it and that's included in the training process that we go through. You know, the airplane has gone through thousands and thousands of hours of testing and simulation, working with our pilots ensuring that they have all the information they need to safely operate the airplane. And in some cases, those new systems are designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane.</p><p>We've already issued a couple of follow-up bulletins coming out of the ongoing investigation pointing pilots to existing flight procedures to handle with the kind of scenarios that we're talking about in this incident. So we're going to continue to do that. It's very important that we provide all of the information need to safely operate these airplanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, Boeing stock down more than five percent yesterday. It is now lower again in the premarket today down 3-1/4 percent as you can see here. Well, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan is going to testify before House Financial Services today, he's going to be grilled on the bank's fake account scandal. First time a bank CEO is going to appear before the committee that is now led by Democrats but Sloan's future is in question.</p><p>Regulators are seeking answers on whether he can repair the bank's image. Over the last year Wells Fargo stock down nearly 15 percent. Well, automakers Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi have created a new board of directors that excludes former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn. The new board will oversee the French-Japanese partnership meeting every month in Tokyo or Paris. Ghosn is still one of eight members of Nissan's board but his recent request to attend the Nissan board meeting was rejected by a judge.</p><p>Ghosn released last week from the Tokyo jail for $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days behind bars. He is accused of underreporting a salary at Nissan which he still denies. And then there is this, the internet 30 turns 30 today. Google celebrating with this doodle. You can see it if you go to Google. But the creator of the World Wide Web has a warning for all of us. In a blog post Tim Berners-Lee writes, the web has brought a lot of good but also dysfunction.</p><p>And he says it's time for everyone to work towards trying to change the web for the better. All right. We've got a lot more coming up. Investors eyeing U.S.-China trade as the top negotiators reportedly hold a call overnight. Plus, Elon Musk goes fighting back. The Tesla chief suggesting the SEC is infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court. We are breaking down the fallout when we come right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets were mixed today. A lot of questions about the U.S.-China trade story. Top officials from both countries holding a phone conversation last night, there still uncertainty since the meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping has not been set which leaves investors anxious about the deal's future. Joining us right now is Market Compass LLC founder and CEO, Amelia Bourdeau. Good to see you, Amelia. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>AMELIA BOURDEAU, FOUNDER AND CEO, MARKET COMPASS LLC: Great to see you. Thanks for the invite.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of uncertainties from the standpoint of a -- of a market adviser like your firm is. From China to Brexit, how you invest right now and what's most important in terms of allocating capital?</p><p>BOURDEAU: What's most important right now in terms of allocating capital volatility, if volatility stays low, meaning we have certain outcomes on today especially with the Brexit vote if we get an actual outcome that they take the deal, you will see sterling rally because markets like certainty, you see equities up in the U.K., you would see the sterling rally. If we continue with some sort of uncertainty in terms of China trade and also Brexit, that's going to ride volatility, that could weigh on, you know, U.S. equities because equities don't like uncertainty and any country.</p><p>And so what we're really looking for is some certainty from the market and both the China traded negotiations and Brexit today with their vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even without these two things you've got an economy that's lucky if it grows one percent in Europe for 2019.</p><p>BROOKS: That's true. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So how have you been advising your clients on that story?</p><p>BOURDEAU: To be sure, the Euro, we've always -- we've already seen a great loss in the Euro but I think it will go to parity actually with the dollar. Last week's ECB meeting, Draghi did a very interesting thing the ECB did. They introduced the new loan facility, they said the economy is slowing, they slashed their growth forecast but they said the risks are still waited to the downside which is highly unusual for the ECB after taking all those measures and the reason they said it was still waited to the downside in Europe was because of Brexit and trade negotiations. The ECB has no policy control over those --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lindsey?</p><p>BELL: Well, the political environment over there really is also --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU: It is. Yes.</p><p>BELL: And the OECD you saw come out asking or telling the ECB, the European Commission that look, you probably need to inject more stimulus into the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU: Yes.</p><p>BELL: -- really to stabilize things there. Is that what you expect? What do you think the next move is over there?</p><p>BOURDEAU: I do. It's very tough, we have European Parliamentary elections coming up at the end of May and some populist parties are coming to the forefront. And why that's dangerous for the Euro especially is because these populist parties are anti-Euro, and so that's also going to weigh on the European sentiment. It's also going to affect European government's ability to pass measures to stimulate the economy as well.</p><p>BROOKS: What are you telling your clients about the odds of going into recession either in Europe and/or in the United States in the next 18 months?</p><p>BOURDEAU: I think the odds are quite high that Europe will go into recession and the next -- I think even six months, I don't see the U.S. economy in recession at least for the next 12 months. Just because, growth has been so strong in jobs and wages I know we just had a disappointing jobs number for February, but I think it's a bit of an aberration.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The wages were not disappointing.</p><p>BROOKS: Yes.</p><p>BOURDEAU: No, the wages were not disappointing, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The best was April 2009. And finally people are making more money.</p><p>BOURDEAU: Yes. They are and that's great. And so I don't see, you know, consumers halting their consumer spending at all. I think it will just, you know, keep on going, we'll see a little, you know, drop-off in the housing sector but, you know, the U.S. economy is strong especially relative to the rest of the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Amelia, great to have your insights. Thank you so much.</p><p>BOURDEAU: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Amelia Bourdeau joining us there. Coming up next. We are talking about a forewarning from the U.S. as it tells Germany to drop Huawei Technology. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke the news with me here first just a few weeks ago. U.S. Army Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy will join us in an exclusive interview weighing in next.</p><p>Then Musk slams this SEC. The Tesla chief suggesting regulators are infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court. The fallout coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 12th. Your top stories right now 8:30 am on the East Coast. We have breaking news right now. The February consumer price index is out. It is up two-tenths of a percent right in line with the expectations. In fact, year-over-year is actually lower than the estimate. Year-over-year, the February CPI is up 1-1/2 percent versus an estimate of 2.2 percent year-over-year. So, the inflation numbers are out this morning, they are either in line, if you look month-over-month, to lower than expected if you look year-over-year on consumer price inflation. So, once again, we do have a CPI that shows very little or no inflation.</p><p>Markets this morning not really reacting, although the Dow Industrial Average has been -- has been lower all morning, because of Boeing. Boeing's stock is down again. The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are higher this morning. The S&amp;P just turned higher again after the CPI number, which shows no inflation. The NASDAQ up 13 points, it's adding on to big rally yesterday, up 150 points on the day yesterday on the NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, European indices are also mixed, take a look at the FT-100 which is higher by eight points, off of the highs of the morning through. The CAC Quarante in Paris is down though, 12 points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down 24. In Asia overnight, gains across the board. Best performer was Japan. Nikkei Average up 1-3/4 percent. Hang Seng in Hong Kong up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Breaking news from American Airlines this morning. It says it has confidence in the safe operation of its aircraft, including the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet after reviewing extensive flight data. So here we are with American Airlines taking a cue from the FAA, which has deemed this plane safe. Many countries trying, China including -- included, have ground the 737 after the crash in Ethiopia.</p><p>Big tech today, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and the hopeful, 2020 hopeful Liz Warren, lays out her vision for regulation. The fallout from one of technology's biggest conferences, she wants to break these companies up. We're going to get into it. And then there's this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk firing back at regulators. What he said about his tweeting habits later this hour as he continues to push back on the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Meanwhile, our top story this morning is the 2020 budget proposal from the President. The White House revealed a $4.7 trillion budget, highlights include $8.6 billion for a border wall, $750 billion for National Defense, with $718 billion going to the Pentagon, giving the military a $33 billion increase. The President's budget also cuts $818 billion from projected Medicare spending over 10 years. And joining me right now to talk about all of this is the Undersecretary of the United States Army, Ryan McCarthy. Secretary, it's great to have you on this program.</p><p>RYAN MCCARTHY, UNDERSECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY: Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is an honor to have you. Thank you for your great service in our wonderful U.S. army.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about the budget, here we have $22 trillion debt that we're all talking about and calls to pull it back, and yet the President proposes adding more to the defense side of the budget. You're here on the front lines. You're going to talk to us about where the priorities are.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you do that?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Absolutely. Maria, the world is a very complex and dangerous place. The U.S. Army has been in sustained combat operations for 17 years. And all the while, other nations and around the world have studied our operating capabilities, our weapon systems, and have made the vast investments, both economically and militarily, to counter these capabilities. So, the reflection of the overall DoD Topline, as well as the U.S. army budget, it is aggressive, it is substantial, we're very grateful for the FY '18-'19 deal that we got, but we have to keep going to rebalance the institution and to be able to pursue national objectives worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now one priorities is rebuilding readiness, right? Tell me about that, as well as strengthening alliances and partnerships and improving perform and affordability through reform. How are you doing that? Tell us where you see this money being allocated.</p><p>MCCARTHY: So readiness is a term that we use pretty liberally. Readiness is just like a professional athlete getting thousands of repetitions the summer before, an NFL season, or a NBA season taking free throw shots. So, our soldiers have to be ready. That mean -- when you have over 60 percent of the requirements worldwide to support national objectives militarily, it's filled by the U.S. Army. So, readies will always be our number one priority, and over half of our budget is personnel and operating and maintenance. So, we have to do what we must to have our people as ready as they can be.</p><p>The rest of the investments are in modernization. Our modernization budget, it's been -- is going to be very aggressive, but we have signaled that with FY '18 and '19 by realigning billions of dollars of our SNC portfolio, about 80 percent against six signature priorities, Long Range Precision Fires, next generation combat vehicles, futuristic helicopters, our networks, our integrated air missile defenses and soldier lethality, ballistic helmets, machine guns, things like that. So, these substantial moves were necessary because most of our systems are old. Over 40 years old in most cases for our signature weapon systems and our formations, so we have to make these choices to move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the modernization that you are in the middle of (INAUDIBLE) has a command, new command, army futures command, tell me about that. How does that help the modernization?</p><p>MCCARTHY: So along with the moves of investments, we had to look at our ourselves and how we do business and they -- what the army recognize was that it was disparate. The people involved with the decisions, what are the requirement, what is it, the how fast is the weapon system, are the range or the capabilities necessary, that's the customer or the war fighters. Then we have experimentation, we have acquisition, they were spread across this million-person organization, so what we need to do is bring it all under one roof.</p><p>So, we went through restructuring, one of the most complex that we've done since 1973 and developed a four-star command that became the bridge to academia and business to get us back to the entrepreneurial spirit of the country where we've developed some of the finest systems that our war fighters have ever used in the history of the Department of Defense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: And we -- and we headquartered in Austin, Texas, it's a four- star headquarters, they operate in civilian clothes, they have a footprint and accelerator hub on the campuses of University of Texas in Austin, and a four-star commanders' building is in the University of Texas System.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And while you've done that to try to centralize things, you've also been making real cuts in the army, right? Up against --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- lots of --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- priorities to spend less money.</p><p>MCCARTHY: So we wanted to show two things in this budget, was really fiscal discipline so look at -- every program was a zero-based budget approach. The Army Leadership Secretary Esper, General Milley, our Chief of Staff, Vice Chief General McConville, our major commanders, all our four-star generals and select what we call staff codes. So, it was a principles only exercise. And of course the army staff has a sense of humor, they called it night court.</p><p>And so we sat there for about 70 plus hours, principals only, everybody had to do their own homework and then propose their budgets, and over time, we would look at how it laid in against the priorities, and if you couldn't defend it in that room, slap the table, and we either take the money or finance those efforts. It was very, very aggressive, long, hot summer but we made some very complex choices, realigning over $31 billion across the five-year futures defense plan. So, in the Department of Defense, we're really big. We do it over a five-year horizon, so the moves that are made because you have to develop most of the weapon systems and scale it to an institution of over a million people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. All of this while some of the threats out there are trying hard to keep up or even beat the U.S. military. I understand that China, for example, has more navy ships than an U.S. has navy ships, major concern for the U.S. government has been Huawei, and the telecom Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was here a few weeks ago. Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei technology. Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We've been out around the world just making sure everybody had the same information, that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei technology into their I.T. systems. We can't forget these systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside, Chinese PLA, their military in China. They are creating a real risk for these countries and their systems, the security of their people. If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: we talk a lot about the economic warfare going on between the U.S. and China, but there's real military aggressions as well. Is this a concern for the army?</p><p>MCCARTHY: It is. We have looked at a couple things from an investment standpoint, as well as our operating concept. The army had four -- over 40 years at -- operating business model what we called AirLand battle, and we're in the process of developing what we call multi-demand operations, is you would still have those AirLand components to (INAUDIBLE) of combat that we would fight together as a joint force, but adding cyberspace in space. So this is going to change the way we do business coupled with the army network as our investment priority, laying in over $20 billion across the five-year future defense plan. So, substantial investment and coupled with a new enterprise data strategy and how we'll protect our information.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tell me about that because technology is really critical here, and a lot of countries are using A.I. and many people say that they're ahead of the U.S. in terms of A.I. Are we using A.I. within the military? What -- how would you characterize technology in the U.S. army?</p><p>MCCARTHY: So we developed an Artificial Intelligence Task Force retiring - - we're tying in with some world-class academic outlets, as well as companies. But a lot of the challenge with A.I. is as much cultural conditioning of how we will use that in our operating model as well as the technologies that will invest against. A.I. will be quite frankly the technology that will change warfare in the future and whoever gets their first will dominate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And do you feel like you have the tools needed to become number one?</p><p>MCCARTHY: We're put -- we're putting our best and brightest forward, we're investing substantially, and it will be a priority for us in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Before you go, real quick in terms of the priorities for the U.S. army today.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Readiness, it'll always be number one. We have 180,000 troops deployed in over 140 countries on our 17th year sustained combat operations in the Middle East, so we will always be focused there, to put our men and women the best position they can when they deployed, but substantial moves in modernization and more coming here in the near future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary, it's great to have you on the program. Thanks so much.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy joining us, U.S. army. Thank you so much sir.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break and then an alarming new poll says millennials embracing are socialism as freshman politicians like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bring it to the forefront. Stuart Varney weighs in on that. And then mounting privacy problems, we are taking you live to the South by Southwest Conference, taking a look at how big tech is tackling major privacy concerns, all ahead, but first, a special update from the Tennis Channel.</p><p>JESSICA VILCHIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, guys, welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report for FOX Business, I'm Jessica Vilchis. The WTA's newest star, Naomi Osaka, was under the spotlight at the BNP Paribas Open today as she American, Danielle Collins. After a tight first set of 6-4, Osaka ran away with things, 6-2 in the second set to seal the match and book her spot in the round of 16. Up next for Osaka will be Belinda Bencic who won recently won a title in Dubai.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAOMI OSAKA, TENNIS PLAYER: Yes, I mean I just kind of realized that there's nothing else I'd rather do, and I'm really privileged to be here in the first place, so I might as well, you know, enjoy every step of the way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VILCHIS: A huge upset happened in the men's draw, as number three seed Alexander Zverev loss to the unseeded Jan-Lennard Struff. It was only the second time in his career Struff had beaten a player in the top five. And don't forget, you can watch all the action from The Fifth Major on Tennis Channel, our live daily coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A new Harris Poll shows that young Americans are embracing socialist policies more than past generations. Joining us now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Incredible, huh, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I think it's a problem for Republicans --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY: -- actually these views, social -- the millennials and the Generation Z people, 38 and under, that's the group we're talking about, this is the largest voting bloc in the 2020 elections, millennials and Generation Z. This bloc firmly approves of socialistic policies. In this Harris Poll, 73 percent approved of the government providing universal government-provided healthcare. That essentially is socialized medicine. 67 percent approved of tuition-free college, that's another policy essentially out of the socialist playbook. So, we have got this large voting bloc heavily in favor of socialist style policies and the Republicans are nowhere to be found on these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY: I mean I think it's a problem for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: And the President has, you know, Breitbart interview, he understands this. He says, \"Look, it's easy to campaign on socialism, you offer free stuff, and you probably get, you know, you're going to win, not necessarily going to win, but you're going to do well. Then he says 10 years later, \"Your country's destroyed,\" but that message is not getting through to millennials. They support socialistic policies, problem for Republicans in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Wait until the 16-year-olds start voting.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, stop it, Maria. Don't want to ruin my day even though it's only Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm sorry.</p><p>BROOKS: I think we should the voting age to 40. What do you think --</p><p>VARNEY: What was that?</p><p>BROOKS: Stuart, Stuart, this is Arthur. How are you doing?</p><p>VARNEY: How are -- is that Arthur Brooks?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>VARNEY: The man (INAUDIBLE) you want to move the voting age to 40?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, I figure --</p><p>VARNEY: I'm OK. I'm 70. I'll vote.</p><p>BROOKS: You're 70?</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BROOKS: Oh, I want to look like Stuart when I'm 70. You know --</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, I love you, Arthur. Love you.</p><p>BROOKS: Stu, you know, you and I have talked about this for years and, you know, you and I agree on everything as you know. I'm less worried about young people saying they're socialists today, and maybe I'm just a Pollyanna.</p><p>VARNEY: Good.</p><p>BROOKS: But, you know, what young people call themselves has very much to do with their sense of dignity and aspiration and opportunity and optimism.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BROOKS: And it seems -- I mean I've seen it.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BROOKS: You know, in 1976, two-thirds of young people 18 to 30 voted for Jimmy Carter by 1984, two-thirds voter for Ronald Reagan, they're very -- young people are --</p><p>VARNEY: It's fascinating.</p><p>BROOKS: -- very, you know, promiscuous in their -- sorry. In their voting patterns and --</p><p>VARNEY: But will you --</p><p>BROOKS: And the way they see themselves.</p><p>VARNEY: Will you please come on my show tomorrow?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, come on, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're going to use that for --</p><p>VARNEY: -- I'm going to steal him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're going to use this time for that?</p><p>VARNEY: I'm going to steal him off you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Come on, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: I am. I'm stealing him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll see you in about 10 minutes, Stuart. Top of the show, \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join -- we will see you then, Stuart. Thank You. Coming up, Musk versus the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Tesla CEO taking on regulators over his tweeting. The details coming up. And then global privacy concerns, we are take a live look at how big tech is battling mounting privacy issues. We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Shares of DICK'S Sporting Goods tumbling this morning despite a double beat on earnings and revenue.</p><p>Gerri Willis on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange with more. Hey, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, Dagen. That's right. So DICK'S coming in beating on both the top and the bottom line, coming in at $1.22 on earnings versus $1.06, 2.49 billion in revenues versus 2.48 billion, even those that -- those shares slumping this morning and why? It's same-store sales. They came in 3.7 percent below, lower versus expecting of down 3.3 percent. Now the company is optimistic in its conversation, its projections for next year. If you remember, it's been a year since this company banned the sales of assault style rifles and limited -- halted sales of firearms to customers under 21. Customers have been taking it out on DICK'S and trimming their visits to the store.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla, Elon Musk must sing in the court filings. He did not file a terms of a fraud settlement that restricted his social media use, this to a federal judge who could hold him in contempt of court. The SEC has required preapprovals of Elon Musk's tweets, but apparently, there is one tweet that got through directly from Mr. Musk which said that they would make 500,000 cars in 2019. So, it was a production estimate that the SEC has trouble with. We know that -- we know that Elon's problems with the SEC go way back. He's called them a short-seller exchange commission, and the SEC obviously entrenched here on this idea that he is violating terms of his settlement. The original tweet that offended he said he had secured funding to take the company private. Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Gerri Willis at the New York Stock Exchange. Still ahead, mounting privacy problems. We're taking you live to South by Southwest, that conference for a look at how big tech is tackling privacy concerns. Stay with us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Big tech companies facing backlash at South by Southwest. Hillary Vaughn in Austin with the details. Hey, Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, Dagen. Well, Instagram Cofounder, Mike Krieger, responding to Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan to cut Facebook down to size by having regulators retroactively reject Facebook's acquisition of Instagram.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE KRIEGER, COFOUNDER, INSTAGRAM: I'm imagining the sci-fi version of this which is like the time traveler had to go back and unwind the Instagram acquisition, you prevent it from happening to like make sure it happens (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You heard it first, Elizabeth Warren time traveler.</p><p>KRIEGER: You know, the cliche that every company is a tech company is increasingly true. So, like, breaking up tech or, like, having those kinds of conversations, I just -- I think the conversation will go better and lead to better policy if we're really specific on the problems that we're trying to solve, and then specific on, like, what the implementation would be.</p><p>VAUGHN: Warren is also targeting Google and Amazon, saying that they too need to be cut down to size because she thinks they'll be held accountable more easily that way. Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Hillary. Hillary Vaughn in Austin. Lindsey, thank you. Arthur, so good to see you.</p><p>BROOKS: Nice to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Book again. Love Your Enemies.</p><p>BROOKS: Love Your Enemies. It's on sale today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We need to do a podcast just based on our conversations in the commercial break sometime without having to --</p><p>BROOKS: I would love that.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 12.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.  Markets this morning are lower.  We are near -- well, we're off of the lows of the morning but certainly off of the highs as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow industrials down 65 points, Boeing is now another drag on the Dow this morning.  S&amp;P 500 just went negative a few minutes ago, down a quarter point but the NASDAQ up, this morning up 8-1/2, up nine points right now on NASDAQ, on top of big gains yesterday.  Stocks staged a late-day rally yesterday driven by technology stocks.  DowIndustrials were up 200 points, three- quarters of a percent, the S&amp;P was up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>But take a look at the NASDAQ, it was up 150 points due to the strength in tech, better than two percent on the session yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices where the FT-100 is up 18 points, quarter of a percent but the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 15 and the DAX Index in Germany down 25.  In Asia overnight, gains across-the-board the best performer was Japan, Nikkei Average up 1-3/4 percent.</p><p>Well, the groundings of Boeing 737 Max 8 jet are expanding across the world.  Nearly half of all of the jets that have been delivered since May of '17 are now parked.  The fallout coming up this morning for Boeing as the stock trades down another two percent as we speak.  Carlos Ghosn replaced the Renault-Nissan alliance unveiling a new board structure as the automakers chart their path forward.  As you know, Carlos Ghosn is now out of jail on bail.</p><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk fires back at regulators this morning.  What he said about his tweeting habits later this hour.  Stock is down again 1-1/2 percent.  And the internet us turning 30 years old.  Google celebrates with its doodle today but the man behind the World Wide Web has a warning about the future.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the author of Love Your Enemies and the president of AEI, Arthur Brooks is in studio this morning and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey bell.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>ARTHUR BROOKS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Good morning.</p><p>BELL:  Lots to cover today, from Brexit, to the budget and Boeing.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We should point out because you mentioned that nearly half of the planes delivered since May of 2017 have been ground by other nations but the Federal Aviation Administration has held off grounding Boeing planes after the crash waiting to see what they find out about this particular crash, although the FAA is expected by the end of next month to mandate a software fix for the automated-flight control system that did play a role in the first crash in Indonesia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Which is why -- what is it, southwest and American airlines have 737s, they haven't taken them out of the lineup, they're there as -- following the FAA's cues.</p><p>BELL:  Well, and safety authorities here in the U.S. have been very careful on tying the Ethiopian Air accident just recently to the Lion Air accident that happened in October but you have China out there, their regulators saying that there could be a connection, it's really very uncertain, a lot of people here are saying it's too early to draw connection.</p><p>BROOKS:  Their people -- the companies are very worried that the flying public is going to panic, and so that's why they're taking them off just in advance for that reason but there is no evidence at this point that there's a problem with the plane.  I strongly suspect that it's -- it will be cleared quickly and Boeing is going to be fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and China's reaction you have to look as Maria did yesterday at the backdrop of what's going on between the United States and China and some nations to suggest that China somehow knows more about a crash in Ethiopia than the U.S. safety regulators do and they were in the ground almost immediately in the country as part of the investigation of black boxes being -- have been recovered.</p><p>But there is that kind of rash move by some countries, potentially to make the United States look bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Boeing sells a third of all of that plane 737 to China.  Obviously, China --</p><p>BROOKS:  It's an incredible safe aircraft.  It has incredible safety record.  There's no evidence that something horrible were going wrong worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is what Dennis Muhlenberg told us the end of last year, the CEO of Boeing.  Meanwhile, President Trump outlines his plans to defense and border spending in his 2020 budget.  Blake Burman is at the White House this morning with the very latest there.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This is third budget put forth by President Trump and his administration but the first time that they have put a budget forward in which Democrats control the appropriations process up on the Hill in the House of Representatives.  The President wish list includes increasing defense spending by five percent, up to $750 billion.</p><p>While, also decreasing nondefense discretionary spending by that same amount, five percent.  Pair that the request $8.6 billion for new funding for the border wall and it's why Democrats say this is going nowhere fast, dead on arrival.  Senator Elizabeth Warren taking to Twitter last night, she wrote the following of the President's budget saying \"A budget is more about -- is about more than numbers, a budget is about values and the budge the President released today is another big wet kiss to the super rich and giant corporations and it guts programs for everyone else.\"</p><p>Now, she is echoing complaints from Democrats about the spending levels for Medicare and Medicaid but the Trump administration insists those levels are not being rolled back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSSELL VOUGHT, ACTING WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR:  What we are doing is putting forward reforms that lower drug prices that because Medicare pays a very large share of drug prices in this country, has the impact of finding savings.  We're also finding ways, fraud, and abuse but Medicare spending will go up every year by healthy margins and no structural changes for Medicare beneficiaries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The budget that was put forth yesterday, Maria, would balance in 15th year.  It also includes deficits of somewhere between a trillion dollars, and $1.1 trillion for fiscal years '19, '20, '21, and '22.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big numbers there.  Blake, thank you.  Blake Burman at the White House.  Joining us right now is the New Voice CEO, former Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  Herman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE NEW VOICE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not every president gets his budget proposals materialized, right?  What's your view on all of this?</p><p>CAIN:  At least, it's a budget.  I don't think the Democrats put forth a budget that was balanced in the eight years that Obama was president.  Second, it doesn't matter what budget the President puts forth, the Democrats are going to punch holes in it.  One of the most impressive parts of the budget to me is the fact that he says there is going to be a five percent across the board cut in nondiscretionary spening.</p><p>And it's going to come from looking for savings.  This is what a leader does.  The leader mandates a target and it's up to those that are running the various departments to go out and find those savings.  I've had to do that as the CEO and that's exactly what the President is doing.</p><p>BROOKS:  Hello, Mr. Cain, Arthur Brooks here from EEI.  It's nice to see you again.  I worry a lot when I see this, you know, when I see $1.1 trillion deficit in the best economy in the past 35 years which I saw great but we can't be running deficits like this when the thing is -- when we're an expansion, we're going to -- we're going to -- governments always do this, you know, we're going to -- we're balance this thing in the out-years.</p><p>We don't exactly know how but we're really going to do it and I know you've got to be skeptical about this too.  So give some hard advice and some real criticism to your brother Republicans.</p><p>CAIN:  The hard advice would be go find those savings, get serious about restraining spending.  That would be the hard advice.  The problem of it is that they never get serious about it.  Republicans or Democrats.</p><p>BROOKS:  Right.</p><p>CAIN:  You can't just -- you can't just blame President Trump and his administration who has been there now a little over two years for this mess that we are in.  Secondly, no one has mentioned that revenues to the treasury because of the tax cuts are up.  So you've got those going up which is a good thing but he is now also trying to put the brakes on spending, and all the Democrats can do is criticize, criticize, criticize and say we're not going to approve any money fort wall,</p><p>I think the President has taken bold step and at least putting this directional budget on the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he hasn't taken a step towards bold spending cuts because again what two-thirds of Federal spending, Herman, are on autopilot or because of entitlement programs.  And there's no evidence -- again, President Trump ran on it, I'm not going to touch Social Security, I'm not going to touch Medicare, that's fine and dandy, I know he's got to run for reelection in 2020 again.  But if you keep -- again, this never gets discussed and never gets talked about by anybody.</p><p>CAIN:  You are right. Dagen.  The non-- the discretionary portion hasn't been touched because it's to require central changes.  The President has not addressed that yet.  I agree with you.  But if the President can't get a few measly billions of dollars for a wall, do you think that the Democrats and the liberals and the lunatics are going to let him get away within structural recommendations?  No.  Not yet.  I don't know when he is going to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CAIN:  But I do believe that before his first term is up he is going to get around to proposing some structural changes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, they're going to be pushing back and they are pushing the Democratic National Committee looking into 2020 announcing that its chosen Milwaukee, Wisconsin to host the 2020 convention.  Republicans were quick to point out that the socialist history is pretty alive and well in Milwaukee, the town has elected three socialist mayors in the past.  The Wisconsin GOP tweeted this yesterday, with the 2020 Democrat presidential primary field currently stumbling over each other in a race for the radical left.</p><p>It makes sense that their party would choose to hold its convention and the only American city that has elected three socialist mayors.  It feels like this 2020 election is going to be a very clear choice between socialism versus capitalism, Herman.</p><p>CAIN:  I would absolutely agree with you.  Let's not forget, Milwaukee is in Wisconsin and it's a big mea culpa on behalf of Hillary Clinton because she did not go there when she ran for president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CAIN:  That is the other factor I think is at play and trying to go and show some love to the State of Wisconsin.  But a bigger point --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, it can be summed up in two words.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cheese curds.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS:  The Democratic Party is doing an epic trolling --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS:  -- by actually going to the state where she didn't -- she didn't campaign.  They're just trolling their own candidate.  This is the most amazing  thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why would -- do they not realize that?  Do they not get it?  What about the issue of socialism versus capitalism?  Are people clear on the differences?  Do you think -- I mean, because, you know,  you've got all of these ideas, the Green New Deal, you've got the Medicare for all, the tax on wealth, 70 percent tax rate.  Do people understand what this means and what these Federal programs look like, socialist, federal government takeovers?</p><p>CAIN:  Some people don't understand the difference between capitalism and socialism but the good news is most people know that socialism has never worked in a country, in the history of the world.  So the Republicans and the conservatives and all the voices out there, the big challenge is to make sure that people understand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CAIN:  I am a firm believer that if people have the right information and the right understanding, they will make the right decision.  That is no contest between capitalism and socialism.  All you have to do is look at the success of the United States of America and make sure that the people understand that and they will not be swayed by these empty socialist promises coming from all the Democrat presidential wanna-bes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see, we'll see.  All right, Herman.  Great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we didn't even get to Nancy Pelosi saying she doesn't want to impeach the President, Herman. We'll save that for next time.  Herman Cain.</p><p>CAIN:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up right after this, global backlash over Boeing this morning.  More countries across the world moving to suspend the 737 Max 8 jet in the aftermath of the deadly crash in Ethiopia.  We're breaking down the fallout.  And then internet revolution.  The World Wide Web turns 30 years old but its creator is issuing a warning sign.  What he is saying.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  I'm Cheryl Casone with some top headlines.  We're following more countries are grounding Boeing's 737 Max 8 jet.  Malaysia and Australia, the latest country to suspend the aircraft from their airports after the deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday.  The countries follow similar moves in China, South Africa, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico.</p><p>But here in the United States the FAA says it has no plans to ground the aircraft for now but it has ordered Boeing to make urgent improvements to it.  Boeing confirming it will deploy a software upgrade to the 737 Max 8.  Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg defended the airplane's safety to Maria after the Lion Air crash.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MUILENBURG:  The real bottom line here, the key is that the 737 Max is very safe and we're very confident in that.  Safety is a core value for our industry and for our company.  Always has been, it always will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But was there a change in terms of this model, the 737 that wasn't articulated to the pilots at the airlines that they did not know how to respond in the event of a change.  That's what the charges are.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.  The 737 Max has some new capabilities that are embedded in it and that's included in the training process that we go through.  You know, the airplane has gone through thousands and thousands of hours of testing and simulation, working with our pilots ensuring that they have all the information they need to safely operate the airplane.  And in some cases, those new systems are designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane.</p><p>We've already issued a couple of follow-up bulletins coming out of the ongoing investigation pointing pilots to existing flight procedures to handle with the kind of scenarios that we're talking about in this incident.  So we're going to continue to do that.  It's very important that we provide all of the information need to safely operate these airplanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, Boeing stock down more than five percent yesterday.  It is now lower again in the premarket today down 3-1/4 percent as you can see here.  Well, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan is going to testify before House Financial Services today, he's going to be grilled on the bank's fake account scandal.  First time a bank CEO is going to appear before the committee that is now led by Democrats but Sloan's future is in question.</p><p>Regulators are seeking answers on whether he can repair the bank's image.  Over the last year Wells Fargo stock down nearly 15 percent.  Well, automakers Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi have created a new board of directors that excludes former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn.  The new board will oversee the French-Japanese partnership meeting every month in Tokyo or Paris.  Ghosn is still one of eight members of Nissan's board but his recent request to attend the Nissan board meeting was rejected by a judge.</p><p>Ghosn released last week from the Tokyo jail for $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days behind bars.  He is accused of underreporting a salary at Nissan which he still denies.  And then there is this, the internet 30 turns 30 today.  Google celebrating with this doodle.  You can see it if you go to Google.  But the creator of the World Wide Web has a warning for all of us.  In a blog post Tim Berners-Lee writes, the web has brought a lot of good but also dysfunction.</p><p>And he says it's time for everyone to work towards trying to change the web for the better.  All right.  We've got a lot more coming up.  Investors eyeing U.S.-China trade as the top negotiators reportedly hold a call overnight.  Plus, Elon Musk goes fighting back.  The Tesla chief suggesting the SEC is infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court.  We are breaking down the fallout when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets were mixed today.  A lot of questions about the U.S.-China trade story.  Top officials from both countries holding a phone conversation last night, there still uncertainty since the meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping has not been set which leaves investors anxious about the deal's future.  Joining us right now is Market Compass LLC founder and CEO, Amelia Bourdeau.  Good to see you, Amelia.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>AMELIA BOURDEAU, FOUNDER AND CEO, MARKET COMPASS LLC:  Great to see you.  Thanks for the invite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of uncertainties from the standpoint of a -- of a market adviser like your firm is.  From China to Brexit, how you invest right now and what's most important in terms of allocating capital?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  What's most important right now in terms of allocating capital volatility, if volatility stays low, meaning we have certain outcomes on today especially with the Brexit vote if we get an actual outcome that they take the deal, you will see sterling rally because markets like certainty, you see equities up in the U.K., you would see the sterling rally.  If we continue with some sort of uncertainty in terms of China trade and also Brexit,  that's going to ride volatility, that could weigh on, you know, U.S. equities because equities don't like uncertainty and any country.</p><p>And so what we're really looking for is some certainty from the market and both the China traded negotiations and Brexit today with their vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even without these two things you've got an economy that's lucky if it grows one percent in Europe for 2019.</p><p>BROOKS:  That's true.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how have you been advising your clients on that story?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  To be sure, the Euro, we've always -- we've already seen a great loss in the Euro but I think it will go to parity actually with the dollar.  Last week's ECB meeting, Draghi did a very interesting thing the ECB did.  They introduced the new loan facility, they said the economy is slowing, they slashed their growth forecast but they said the risks are still waited to the downside which is highly unusual for the ECB after taking all those measures and the reason they said it was still waited to the downside in Europe was because of Brexit and trade negotiations.  The ECB has no policy control over those --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey?</p><p>BELL:  Well, the political environment over there really is also --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU:  It is.  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  And the OECD you saw come out asking or telling the ECB, the European Commission that look, you probably need to inject more stimulus into the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  -- really to stabilize things there.  Is that what you expect?  What do you think the next move is over there?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  I do.  It's very tough, we have European Parliamentary elections coming up at the end of May and some populist parties are coming to the forefront.  And why that's dangerous for the Euro especially is because these populist parties are anti-Euro, and so that's also going to weigh on the European sentiment.  It's also going to affect European government's ability to pass measures to stimulate the economy as well.</p><p>BROOKS:  What are you telling your clients about the odds of going into recession either in Europe and/or in the United States in the next 18 months?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  I think the odds are quite high that Europe will go into recession and the next -- I think even six months, I don't see the U.S. economy in recession at least for the next 12 months.  Just because, growth has been so strong in jobs and wages I know we just had a disappointing jobs number for February, but I think it's a bit of an aberration.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The wages were not disappointing.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  No, the wages were not disappointing, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The best was April 2009.  And finally people are making more money.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Yes.  They are and that's great.  And so I don't see, you know, consumers halting their consumer spending at all.  I think it will just, you know, keep on going, we'll see a little, you know, drop-off in the housing sector but, you know, the U.S. economy is strong especially relative to the rest of the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Amelia, great to have your insights.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amelia Bourdeau joining us there.  Coming up next.  We are talking about a forewarning from the U.S. as it tells Germany to drop Huawei Technology.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke the news with me here first just a few weeks ago.  U.S. Army Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy will join us in an exclusive interview weighing in next.</p><p>Then Musk slams this SEC.  The Tesla chief suggesting regulators are infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court.  The fallout coming up.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 12th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 am on the East Coast.  We have breaking news right now.  The February consumer price index is out.  It is up two-tenths of a percent right in line with the expectations.  In fact, year-over-year is actually lower than the estimate.  Year-over-year, the February CPI is up 1-1/2 percent versus an estimate of 2.2 percent year-over-year.  So, the inflation numbers are out this morning, they are either in line, if you look month-over-month, to lower than expected if you look year-over-year on consumer price inflation.  So, once again, we do have a CPI that shows very little or no inflation.</p><p>Markets this morning not really reacting, although the Dow Industrial Average has been -- has been lower all morning, because of Boeing.  Boeing's stock is down again.  The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are higher this morning.  The S&amp;P just turned higher again after the CPI number, which shows no inflation.  The NASDAQ up 13 points, it's adding on to big rally yesterday, up 150 points on the day yesterday on the NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, European indices are also mixed, take a look at the FT-100 which is higher by eight points, off of the highs of the morning through.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is down though, 12 points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down 24.  In Asia overnight, gains across the board.  Best performer was Japan.  Nikkei Average up 1-3/4 percent.  Hang Seng in Hong Kong up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Breaking news from American Airlines this morning.  It says it has confidence in the safe operation of its aircraft, including the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet after reviewing extensive flight data.  So here we are with American Airlines taking a cue from the FAA, which has deemed this plane safe.  Many countries trying, China including -- included, have ground the 737 after the crash in Ethiopia.</p><p>Big tech today, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and the hopeful, 2020 hopeful Liz Warren, lays out her vision for regulation.  The fallout from one of technology's biggest conferences, she wants to break these companies up.  We're going to get into it.  And then there's this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk firing back at regulators.  What he said about his tweeting habits later this hour as he continues to push back on the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Meanwhile, our top story this morning is the 2020 budget proposal from the President.  The White House revealed a $4.7 trillion budget, highlights include $8.6 billion for a border wall, $750 billion for National Defense, with $718 billion going to the Pentagon, giving the military a $33 billion increase.  The President's budget also cuts $818 billion from projected Medicare spending over 10 years.  And joining me right now to talk about all of this is the Undersecretary of the United States Army, Ryan McCarthy.  Secretary, it's great to have you on this program.</p><p>RYAN MCCARTHY, UNDERSECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY:  Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is an honor to have you.  Thank you for your great service in our wonderful U.S. army.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the budget, here we have $22 trillion debt that we're all talking about and calls to pull it back, and yet the President proposes adding more to the defense side of the budget.  You're here on the front lines.  You're going to talk to us about where the priorities are.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you do that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Absolutely.  Maria, the world is a very complex and dangerous place.  The U.S. Army has been in sustained combat operations for 17 years.  And all the while, other nations and around the world have studied our operating capabilities, our weapon systems, and have made the vast investments, both economically and militarily, to counter these capabilities.  So, the reflection of the overall DoD Topline, as well as the U.S. army budget, it is aggressive, it is substantial, we're very grateful for the FY '18-'19 deal that we got, but we have to keep going to rebalance the institution and to be able to pursue national objectives worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now one priorities is rebuilding readiness, right?  Tell me about that, as well as strengthening alliances and partnerships and improving perform and affordability through reform.  How are you doing that?  Tell us where you see this money being allocated.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So readiness is a term that we use pretty liberally.  Readiness is just like a professional athlete getting thousands of repetitions the summer before, an NFL season, or a NBA season taking free throw shots.  So, our soldiers have to be ready.  That mean -- when you have over 60 percent of the requirements worldwide to support national objectives militarily, it's filled by the U.S. Army.  So, readies will always be our number one priority, and over half of our budget is personnel and operating and maintenance.  So, we have to do what we must to have our people as ready as they can be.</p><p>The rest of the investments are in modernization.  Our modernization budget, it's been -- is going to be very aggressive, but we have signaled that with FY '18 and '19 by realigning billions of dollars of our SNC portfolio, about 80 percent against six signature priorities, Long Range Precision Fires, next generation combat vehicles, futuristic helicopters, our networks, our integrated air missile defenses and soldier lethality, ballistic helmets, machine guns, things like that.  So, these substantial moves were necessary because most of our systems are old.  Over 40 years old in most cases for our signature weapon systems and our formations, so we have to make these choices to move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the modernization that you are in the middle of (INAUDIBLE) has a command, new command, army futures command, tell me about that.  How does that help the modernization?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So along with the moves of investments, we had to look at our ourselves and how we do business and they -- what the army recognize was that it was disparate.  The people involved with the decisions, what are the requirement, what is it, the how fast is the weapon system, are the range or the capabilities necessary, that's the customer or the war fighters.  Then we have experimentation, we have acquisition, they were spread across this million-person organization, so what we need to do is bring it all under one roof.</p><p>So, we went through restructuring, one of the most complex that we've done since 1973 and developed a four-star command that became the bridge to academia and business to get us back to the entrepreneurial spirit of the country where we've developed some of the finest systems that our war fighters have ever used in the history of the Department of Defense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And we -- and we headquartered in Austin, Texas, it's a four-star headquarters, they operate in civilian clothes, they have a footprint and accelerator hub on the campuses of University of Texas in Austin, and a four-star commanders' building is in the University of Texas System.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And while you've done that to try to centralize things, you've also been making real cuts in the army, right?  Up against --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- lots of --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- priorities to spend less money.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So we wanted to show two things in this budget, was really fiscal discipline so look at -- every program was a zero-based budget approach.  The Army Leadership Secretary Esper, General Milley, our Chief of Staff, Vice Chief General McConville, our major commanders, all our four-star generals and select what we call staff codes.  So, it was a principles only exercise.  And of course the army staff has a sense of humor, they called it night court.</p><p>And so we sat there for about 70 plus hours, principals only, everybody had to do their own homework and then propose their budgets, and over time, we would look at how it laid in against the priorities, and if you couldn't defend it in that room, slap the table, and we either take the money or finance those efforts.  It was very, very aggressive, long, hot summer but we made some very complex choices, realigning over $31 billion across the five-year futures defense plan.  So, in the Department of Defense, we're really big.  We do it over a five-year horizon, so the moves that are made because you have to develop most of the weapon systems and scale it to an institution of over a million people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  All of this while some of the threats out there are trying hard to keep up or even beat the U.S. military.  I understand that China, for example, has more navy ships than an U.S. has navy ships, major concern for the U.S. government has been Huawei, and the telecom Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was here a few weeks ago.  Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei technology.  Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We've been out around the world just making sure everybody had the same information, that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei technology into their I.T. systems.  We can't forget these systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside, Chinese PLA, their military in China.  They are creating a real risk for these countries and their systems, the security of their people.  If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  we talk a lot about the economic warfare going on between the U.S. and China, but there's real military aggressions as well.  Is this a concern for the army?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It is.  We have looked at a couple things from an investment standpoint, as well as our operating concept.  The army had four -- over 40 years at -- operating business model what we called AirLand battle, and we're in the process of developing what we call multi-demand operations, is you would still have those AirLand components to (INAUDIBLE) of combat that we would fight together as a joint force, but adding cyberspace in space.  So this is going to change the way we do business coupled with the army network as our investment priority, laying in over $20 billion across the five-year future defense plan.  So, substantial investment and coupled with a new enterprise data strategy and how we'll protect our information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell me about that because technology is really critical here, and a lot of countries are using A.I. and many people say that they're ahead of the U.S. in terms of A.I.  Are we using A.I. within the military?  What -- how would you characterize technology in the U.S. army?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So we developed an Artificial Intelligence Task Force retiring -- we're tying in with some world-class academic outlets, as well as companies.  But a lot of the challenge with A.I. is as much cultural conditioning of how we will use that in our operating model as well as the technologies that will invest against.  A.I. will be quite frankly the technology that will change warfare in the future and whoever gets their first will dominate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you feel like you have the tools needed to become number one?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  We're put -- we're putting our best and brightest forward, we're investing substantially, and it will be a priority for us in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Before you go, real quick in terms of the priorities for the U.S. army today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Readiness, it'll always be number one.  We have 180,000 troops deployed in over 140 countries on our 17th year sustained combat operations in the Middle East, so we will always be focused there, to put our men and women the best position they can when they deployed, but substantial moves in modernization and more coming here in the near future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's great to have you on the program.  Thanks so much.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy joining us, U.S. army.  Thank you so much sir.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break and then an alarming new poll says millennials embracing are socialism as freshman politicians like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bring it to the forefront.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that.  And then mounting privacy problems, we are taking you live to the South by Southwest Conference, taking a look at how big tech is tackling major privacy concerns, all ahead, but first, a special update from the Tennis Channel.</p><p>JESSICA VILCHIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, guys, welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report for FOX Business, I'm Jessica Vilchis.  The WTA's newest star, Naomi Osaka, was under the spotlight at the BNP Paribas Open today as she American, Danielle Collins.  After a tight first set of 6-4, Osaka ran away with things, 6-2 in the second set to seal the match and book her spot in the round of 16.  Up next for Osaka will be Belinda Bencic who won recently won a title in Dubai.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAOMI OSAKA, TENNIS PLAYER:  Yes, I mean I just kind of realized that there's nothing else I'd rather do, and I'm really privileged to be here in the first place, so I might as well, you know, enjoy every step of the way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VILCHIS:  A huge upset happened in the men's draw, as number three seed Alexander Zverev loss to the unseeded Jan-Lennard Struff.  It was only the second time in his career Struff had beaten a player in the top five.  And don't forget, you can watch all the action from The Fifth Major on Tennis Channel, our live daily coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A new Harris Poll shows that young Americans are embracing socialist policies more than past generations.  Joining us now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Incredible, huh, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I think it's a problem for Republicans --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- actually these views, social -- the millennials and the Generation Z people, 38 and under, that's the group we're talking about, this is the largest voting bloc in the 2020 elections, millennials and Generation Z.  This bloc firmly approves of socialistic policies.  In this Harris Poll, 73 percent approved of the government providing universal government-provided healthcare.  That essentially is socialized medicine.  67 percent approved of tuition-free college, that's another policy essentially out of the socialist playbook.  So, we have got this large voting bloc heavily in favor of socialist style policies and the Republicans are nowhere to be found on these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean I think it's a problem for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And the President has, you know, Breitbart interview, he understands this.  He says, \"Look, it's easy to campaign on socialism, you offer free stuff, and you probably get, you know, you're going to win, not necessarily going to win, but you're going to do well.  Then he says 10 years later, \"Your country's destroyed,\" but that message is not getting through to millennials.  They support socialistic policies, problem for Republicans in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait until the 16-year-olds start voting.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, stop it, Maria.  Don't want to ruin my day even though it's only Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BROOKS:  I think we should the voting age to 40.  What do you think --</p><p>VARNEY:  What was that?</p><p>BROOKS:  Stuart, Stuart, this is Arthur.  How are you doing?</p><p>VARNEY:  How are -- is that Arthur Brooks?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  The man (INAUDIBLE) you want to move the voting age to 40?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, I figure --</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm OK.  I'm 70.  I'll vote.</p><p>BROOKS: You're 70?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS: Oh, I want to look like Stuart when I'm 70.  You know --</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, I love you, Arthur.  Love you.</p><p>BROOKS: Stu, you know, you and I have talked about this for years and, you know, you and I agree on everything as you know.  I'm less worried about young people saying they're socialists today, and maybe I'm just a Pollyanna.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good.</p><p>BROOKS:  But, you know, what young people call themselves has very much to do with their sense of dignity and aspiration and opportunity and optimism.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  And it seems -- I mean I've seen it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  You know, in 1976, two-thirds of young people 18 to 30 voted for Jimmy Carter by 1984, two-thirds voter for Ronald Reagan, they're very -- young people are --</p><p>VARNEY:  It's fascinating.</p><p>BROOKS:  -- very, you know, promiscuous in their -- sorry.  In their voting patterns and --</p><p>VARNEY:  But will you --</p><p>BROOKS:  And the way they see themselves.</p><p>VARNEY:  Will you please come on my show tomorrow?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to use that for --</p><p>VARNEY:  -- I'm going to steal him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to use this time for that?</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm going to steal him off you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I am.  I'm stealing him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see you in about 10 minutes, Stuart.  Top of the show, \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join -- we will see you then, Stuart.  Thank You.  Coming up, Musk versus the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Tesla CEO taking on regulators over his tweeting.  The details coming up.  And then global privacy concerns, we are take a live look at how big tech is battling mounting privacy issues.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shares of DICK'S Sporting Goods tumbling this morning despite a double beat on earnings and revenue.</p><p>Gerri Willis on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Hey, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  That's right.  So DICK'S coming in beating on both the top and the bottom line, coming in at $1.22 on earnings versus $1.06, 2.49 billion in revenues versus 2.48 billion, even those that -- those shares slumping this morning and why?  It's same-store sales.  They came in 3.7 percent below, lower versus expecting of down 3.3 percent.  Now the company is optimistic in its conversation, its projections for next year.  If you remember, it's been a year since this company banned the sales of assault style rifles and limited -- halted sales of firearms to customers under 21.  Customers have been taking it out on DICK'S and trimming their visits to the store.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla, Elon Musk must sing in the court filings.  He did not file a terms of a fraud settlement that restricted his social media use, this to a federal judge who could hold him in contempt of court.  The SEC has required preapprovals of Elon Musk's tweets, but apparently, there is one tweet that got through directly from Mr. Musk which said that they would make 500,000 cars in 2019.  So, it was a production estimate that the SEC has trouble with.  We know that -- we know that Elon's problems with the SEC go way back.  He's called them a short-seller exchange commission, and the SEC obviously entrenched here on this idea that he is violating terms of his settlement.  The original tweet that offended he said he had secured funding to take the company private.  Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Gerri Willis at the New York Stock Exchange.  Still ahead, mounting privacy problems.  We're taking you live to South by Southwest, that conference for a look at how big tech is tackling privacy concerns.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Big tech companies facing backlash at South by Southwest.  Hillary Vaughn in Austin with the details.  Hey, Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, Instagram Cofounder, Mike Krieger, responding to Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan to cut Facebook down to size by having regulators retroactively reject Facebook's acquisition of Instagram.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE KRIEGER, COFOUNDER, INSTAGRAM:  I'm imagining the sci-fi version of this which is like the time traveler had to go back and unwind the Instagram acquisition, you prevent it from happening to like make sure it happens (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You heard it first, Elizabeth Warren time traveler.</p><p>KRIEGER:  You know, the cliche that every company is a tech company is increasingly true.  So, like, breaking up tech or, like, having those kinds of conversations, I just -- I think the conversation will go better and lead to better policy if we're really specific on the problems that we're trying to solve, and then specific on, like, what the implementation would be.</p><p>VAUGHN:  Warren is also targeting Google and Amazon, saying that they too need to be cut down to size because she thinks they'll be held accountable more easily that way.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  Hillary Vaughn in Austin.  Lindsey, thank you.  Arthur, so good to see you.</p><p>BROOKS:  Nice to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Book again.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 12.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.  Markets this morning are lower.  We are near -- well, we're off of the lows of the morning but certainly off of the highs as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow industrials down 65 points, Boeing is now another drag on the Dow this morning.  S&amp;P 500 just went negative a few minutes ago, down a quarter point but the NASDAQ up, this morning up 8-1/2, up nine points right now on NASDAQ, on top of big gains yesterday.  Stocks staged a late-day rally yesterday driven by technology stocks.  DowIndustrials were up 200 points, three- quarters of a percent, the S&amp;P was up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>But take a look at the NASDAQ, it was up 150 points due to the strength in tech, better than two percent on the session yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices where the FT-100 is up 18 points, quarter of a percent but the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 15 and the DAX Index in Germany down 25.  In Asia overnight, gains across-the-board the best performer was Japan, Nikkei Average up 1-3/4 percent.</p><p>Well, the groundings of Boeing 737 Max 8 jet are expanding across the world.  Nearly half of all of the jets that have been delivered since May of '17 are now parked.  The fallout coming up this morning for Boeing as the stock trades down another two percent as we speak.  Carlos Ghosn replaced the Renault-Nissan alliance unveiling a new board structure as the automakers chart their path forward.  As you know, Carlos Ghosn is now out of jail on bail.</p><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk fires back at regulators this morning.  What he said about his tweeting habits later this hour.  Stock is down again 1-1/2 percent.  And the internet us turning 30 years old.  Google celebrates with its doodle today but the man behind the World Wide Web has a warning about the future.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the author of Love Your Enemies and the president of AEI, Arthur Brooks is in studio this morning and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey bell.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>ARTHUR BROOKS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Good morning.</p><p>BELL:  Lots to cover today, from Brexit, to the budget and Boeing.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We should point out because you mentioned that nearly half of the planes delivered since May of 2017 have been ground by other nations but the Federal Aviation Administration has held off grounding Boeing planes after the crash waiting to see what they find out about this particular crash, although the FAA is expected by the end of next month to mandate a software fix for the automated-flight control system that did play a role in the first crash in Indonesia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Which is why -- what is it, southwest and American airlines have 737s, they haven't taken them out of the lineup, they're there as -- following the FAA's cues.</p><p>BELL:  Well, and safety authorities here in the U.S. have been very careful on tying the Ethiopian Air accident just recently to the Lion Air accident that happened in October but you have China out there, their regulators saying that there could be a connection, it's really very uncertain, a lot of people here are saying it's too early to draw connection.</p><p>BROOKS:  Their people -- the companies are very worried that the flying public is going to panic, and so that's why they're taking them off just in advance for that reason but there is no evidence at this point that there's a problem with the plane.  I strongly suspect that it's -- it will be cleared quickly and Boeing is going to be fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and China's reaction you have to look as Maria did yesterday at the backdrop of what's going on between the United States and China and some nations to suggest that China somehow knows more about a crash in Ethiopia than the U.S. safety regulators do and they were in the ground almost immediately in the country as part of the investigation of black boxes being -- have been recovered.</p><p>But there is that kind of rash move by some countries, potentially to make the United States look bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Boeing sells a third of all of that plane 737 to China.  Obviously, China --</p><p>BROOKS:  It's an incredible safe aircraft.  It has incredible safety record.  There's no evidence that something horrible were going wrong worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is what Dennis Muhlenberg told us the end of last year, the CEO of Boeing.  Meanwhile, President Trump outlines his plans to defense and border spending in his 2020 budget.  Blake Burman is at the White House this morning with the very latest there.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This is third budget put forth by President Trump and his administration but the first time that they have put a budget forward in which Democrats control the appropriations process up on the Hill in the House of Representatives.  The President wish list includes increasing defense spending by five percent, up to $750 billion.</p><p>While, also decreasing nondefense discretionary spending by that same amount, five percent.  Pair that the request $8.6 billion for new funding for the border wall and it's why Democrats say this is going nowhere fast, dead on arrival.  Senator Elizabeth Warren taking to Twitter last night, she wrote the following of the President's budget saying \"A budget is more about -- is about more than numbers, a budget is about values and the budge the President released today is another big wet kiss to the super rich and giant corporations and it guts programs for everyone else.\"</p><p>Now, she is echoing complaints from Democrats about the spending levels for Medicare and Medicaid but the Trump administration insists those levels are not being rolled back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSSELL VOUGHT, ACTING WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR:  What we are doing is putting forward reforms that lower drug prices that because Medicare pays a very large share of drug prices in this country, has the impact of finding savings.  We're also finding ways, fraud, and abuse but Medicare spending will go up every year by healthy margins and no structural changes for Medicare beneficiaries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The budget that was put forth yesterday, Maria, would balance in 15th year.  It also includes deficits of somewhere between a trillion dollars, and $1.1 trillion for fiscal years '19, '20, '21, and '22.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big numbers there.  Blake, thank you.  Blake Burman at the White House.  Joining us right now is the New Voice CEO, former Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  Herman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE NEW VOICE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not every president gets his budget proposals materialized, right?  What's your view on all of this?</p><p>CAIN:  At least, it's a budget.  I don't think the Democrats put forth a budget that was balanced in the eight years that Obama was president.  Second, it doesn't matter what budget the President puts forth, the Democrats are going to punch holes in it.  One of the most impressive parts of the budget to me is the fact that he says there is going to be a five percent across the board cut in nondiscretionary spening.</p><p>And it's going to come from looking for savings.  This is what a leader does.  The leader mandates a target and it's up to those that are running the various departments to go out and find those savings.  I've had to do that as the CEO and that's exactly what the President is doing.</p><p>BROOKS:  Hello, Mr. Cain, Arthur Brooks here from EEI.  It's nice to see you again.  I worry a lot when I see this, you know, when I see $1.1 trillion deficit in the best economy in the past 35 years which I saw great but we can't be running deficits like this when the thing is -- when we're an expansion, we're going to -- we're going to -- governments always do this, you know, we're going to -- we're balance this thing in the out-years.</p><p>We don't exactly know how but we're really going to do it and I know you've got to be skeptical about this too.  So give some hard advice and some real criticism to your brother Republicans.</p><p>CAIN:  The hard advice would be go find those savings, get serious about restraining spending.  That would be the hard advice.  The problem of it is that they never get serious about it.  Republicans or Democrats.</p><p>BROOKS:  Right.</p><p>CAIN:  You can't just -- you can't just blame President Trump and his administration who has been there now a little over two years for this mess that we are in.  Secondly, no one has mentioned that revenues to the treasury because of the tax cuts are up.  So you've got those going up which is a good thing but he is now also trying to put the brakes on spending, and all the Democrats can do is criticize, criticize, criticize and say we're not going to approve any money fort wall,</p><p>I think the President has taken bold step and at least putting this directional budget on the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he hasn't taken a step towards bold spending cuts because again what two-thirds of Federal spending, Herman, are on autopilot or because of entitlement programs.  And there's no evidence -- again, President Trump ran on it, I'm not going to touch Social Security, I'm not going to touch Medicare, that's fine and dandy, I know he's got to run for reelection in 2020 again.  But if you keep -- again, this never gets discussed and never gets talked about by anybody.</p><p>CAIN:  You are right. Dagen.  The non-- the discretionary portion hasn't been touched because it's to require central changes.  The President has not addressed that yet.  I agree with you.  But if the President can't get a few measly billions of dollars for a wall, do you think that the Democrats and the liberals and the lunatics are going to let him get away within structural recommendations?  No.  Not yet.  I don't know when he is going to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CAIN:  But I do believe that before his first term is up he is going to get around to proposing some structural changes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, they're going to be pushing back and they are pushing the Democratic National Committee looking into 2020 announcing that its chosen Milwaukee, Wisconsin to host the 2020 convention.  Republicans were quick to point out that the socialist history is pretty alive and well in Milwaukee, the town has elected three socialist mayors in the past.  The Wisconsin GOP tweeted this yesterday, with the 2020 Democrat presidential primary field currently stumbling over each other in a race for the radical left.</p><p>It makes sense that their party would choose to hold its convention and the only American city that has elected three socialist mayors.  It feels like this 2020 election is going to be a very clear choice between socialism versus capitalism, Herman.</p><p>CAIN:  I would absolutely agree with you.  Let's not forget, Milwaukee is in Wisconsin and it's a big mea culpa on behalf of Hillary Clinton because she did not go there when she ran for president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CAIN:  That is the other factor I think is at play and trying to go and show some love to the State of Wisconsin.  But a bigger point --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, it can be summed up in two words.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cheese curds.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS:  The Democratic Party is doing an epic trolling --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS:  -- by actually going to the state where she didn't -- she didn't campaign.  They're just trolling their own candidate.  This is the most amazing  thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why would -- do they not realize that?  Do they not get it?  What about the issue of socialism versus capitalism?  Are people clear on the differences?  Do you think -- I mean, because, you know,  you've got all of these ideas, the Green New Deal, you've got the Medicare for all, the tax on wealth, 70 percent tax rate.  Do people understand what this means and what these Federal programs look like, socialist, federal government takeovers?</p><p>CAIN:  Some people don't understand the difference between capitalism and socialism but the good news is most people know that socialism has never worked in a country, in the history of the world.  So the Republicans and the conservatives and all the voices out there, the big challenge is to make sure that people understand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CAIN:  I am a firm believer that if people have the right information and the right understanding, they will make the right decision.  That is no contest between capitalism and socialism.  All you have to do is look at the success of the United States of America and make sure that the people understand that and they will not be swayed by these empty socialist promises coming from all the Democrat presidential wanna-bes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see, we'll see.  All right, Herman.  Great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we didn't even get to Nancy Pelosi saying she doesn't want to impeach the President, Herman. We'll save that for next time.  Herman Cain.</p><p>CAIN:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up right after this, global backlash over Boeing this morning.  More countries across the world moving to suspend the 737 Max 8 jet in the aftermath of the deadly crash in Ethiopia.  We're breaking down the fallout.  And then internet revolution.  The World Wide Web turns 30 years old but its creator is issuing a warning sign.  What he is saying.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  I'm Cheryl Casone with some top headlines.  We're following more countries are grounding Boeing's 737 Max 8 jet.  Malaysia and Australia, the latest country to suspend the aircraft from their airports after the deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday.  The countries follow similar moves in China, South Africa, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico.</p><p>But here in the United States the FAA says it has no plans to ground the aircraft for now but it has ordered Boeing to make urgent improvements to it.  Boeing confirming it will deploy a software upgrade to the 737 Max 8.  Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg defended the airplane's safety to Maria after the Lion Air crash.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MUILENBURG:  The real bottom line here, the key is that the 737 Max is very safe and we're very confident in that.  Safety is a core value for our industry and for our company.  Always has been, it always will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But was there a change in terms of this model, the 737 that wasn't articulated to the pilots at the airlines that they did not know how to respond in the event of a change.  That's what the charges are.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.  The 737 Max has some new capabilities that are embedded in it and that's included in the training process that we go through.  You know, the airplane has gone through thousands and thousands of hours of testing and simulation, working with our pilots ensuring that they have all the information they need to safely operate the airplane.  And in some cases, those new systems are designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane.</p><p>We've already issued a couple of follow-up bulletins coming out of the ongoing investigation pointing pilots to existing flight procedures to handle with the kind of scenarios that we're talking about in this incident.  So we're going to continue to do that.  It's very important that we provide all of the information need to safely operate these airplanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, Boeing stock down more than five percent yesterday.  It is now lower again in the premarket today down 3-1/4 percent as you can see here.  Well, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan is going to testify before House Financial Services today, he's going to be grilled on the bank's fake account scandal.  First time a bank CEO is going to appear before the committee that is now led by Democrats but Sloan's future is in question.</p><p>Regulators are seeking answers on whether he can repair the bank's image.  Over the last year Wells Fargo stock down nearly 15 percent.  Well, automakers Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi have created a new board of directors that excludes former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn.  The new board will oversee the French-Japanese partnership meeting every month in Tokyo or Paris.  Ghosn is still one of eight members of Nissan's board but his recent request to attend the Nissan board meeting was rejected by a judge.</p><p>Ghosn released last week from the Tokyo jail for $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days behind bars.  He is accused of underreporting a salary at Nissan which he still denies.  And then there is this, the internet 30 turns 30 today.  Google celebrating with this doodle.  You can see it if you go to Google.  But the creator of the World Wide Web has a warning for all of us.  In a blog post Tim Berners-Lee writes, the web has brought a lot of good but also dysfunction.</p><p>And he says it's time for everyone to work towards trying to change the web for the better.  All right.  We've got a lot more coming up.  Investors eyeing U.S.-China trade as the top negotiators reportedly hold a call overnight.  Plus, Elon Musk goes fighting back.  The Tesla chief suggesting the SEC is infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court.  We are breaking down the fallout when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets were mixed today.  A lot of questions about the U.S.-China trade story.  Top officials from both countries holding a phone conversation last night, there still uncertainty since the meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping has not been set which leaves investors anxious about the deal's future.  Joining us right now is Market Compass LLC founder and CEO, Amelia Bourdeau.  Good to see you, Amelia.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>AMELIA BOURDEAU, FOUNDER AND CEO, MARKET COMPASS LLC:  Great to see you.  Thanks for the invite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of uncertainties from the standpoint of a -- of a market adviser like your firm is.  From China to Brexit, how you invest right now and what's most important in terms of allocating capital?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  What's most important right now in terms of allocating capital volatility, if volatility stays low, meaning we have certain outcomes on today especially with the Brexit vote if we get an actual outcome that they take the deal, you will see sterling rally because markets like certainty, you see equities up in the U.K., you would see the sterling rally.  If we continue with some sort of uncertainty in terms of China trade and also Brexit,  that's going to ride volatility, that could weigh on, you know, U.S. equities because equities don't like uncertainty and any country.</p><p>And so what we're really looking for is some certainty from the market and both the China traded negotiations and Brexit today with their vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even without these two things you've got an economy that's lucky if it grows one percent in Europe for 2019.</p><p>BROOKS:  That's true.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how have you been advising your clients on that story?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  To be sure, the Euro, we've always -- we've already seen a great loss in the Euro but I think it will go to parity actually with the dollar.  Last week's ECB meeting, Draghi did a very interesting thing the ECB did.  They introduced the new loan facility, they said the economy is slowing, they slashed their growth forecast but they said the risks are still waited to the downside which is highly unusual for the ECB after taking all those measures and the reason they said it was still waited to the downside in Europe was because of Brexit and trade negotiations.  The ECB has no policy control over those --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey?</p><p>BELL:  Well, the political environment over there really is also --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU:  It is.  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  And the OECD you saw come out asking or telling the ECB, the European Commission that look, you probably need to inject more stimulus into the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  -- really to stabilize things there.  Is that what you expect?  What do you think the next move is over there?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  I do.  It's very tough, we have European Parliamentary elections coming up at the end of May and some populist parties are coming to the forefront.  And why that's dangerous for the Euro especially is because these populist parties are anti-Euro, and so that's also going to weigh on the European sentiment.  It's also going to affect European government's ability to pass measures to stimulate the economy as well.</p><p>BROOKS:  What are you telling your clients about the odds of going into recession either in Europe and/or in the United States in the next 18 months?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  I think the odds are quite high that Europe will go into recession and the next -- I think even six months, I don't see the U.S. economy in recession at least for the next 12 months.  Just because, growth has been so strong in jobs and wages I know we just had a disappointing jobs number for February, but I think it's a bit of an aberration.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The wages were not disappointing.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  No, the wages were not disappointing, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The best was April 2009.  And finally people are making more money.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Yes.  They are and that's great.  And so I don't see, you know, consumers halting their consumer spending at all.  I think it will just, you know, keep on going, we'll see a little, you know, drop-off in the housing sector but, you know, the U.S. economy is strong especially relative to the rest of the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Amelia, great to have your insights.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amelia Bourdeau joining us there.  Coming up next.  We are talking about a forewarning from the U.S. as it tells Germany to drop Huawei Technology.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke the news with me here first just a few weeks ago.  U.S. Army Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy will join us in an exclusive interview weighing in next.</p><p>Then Musk slams this SEC.  The Tesla chief suggesting regulators are infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court.  The fallout coming up.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 12th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 am on the East Coast.  We have breaking news right now.  The February consumer price index is out.  It is up two-tenths of a percent right in line with the expectations.  In fact, year-over-year is actually lower than the estimate.  Year-over-year, the February CPI is up 1-1/2 percent versus an estimate of 2.2 percent year-over-year.  So, the inflation numbers are out this morning, they are either in line, if you look month-over-month, to lower than expected if you look year-over-year on consumer price inflation.  So, once again, we do have a CPI that shows very little or no inflation.</p><p>Markets this morning not really reacting, although the Dow Industrial Average has been -- has been lower all morning, because of Boeing.  Boeing's stock is down again.  The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are higher this morning.  The S&amp;P just turned higher again after the CPI number, which shows no inflation.  The NASDAQ up 13 points, it's adding on to big rally yesterday, up 150 points on the day yesterday on the NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, European indices are also mixed, take a look at the FT-100 which is higher by eight points, off of the highs of the morning through.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is down though, 12 points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down 24.  In Asia overnight, gains across the board.  Best performer was Japan.  Nikkei Average up 1-3/4 percent.  Hang Seng in Hong Kong up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Breaking news from American Airlines this morning.  It says it has confidence in the safe operation of its aircraft, including the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet after reviewing extensive flight data.  So here we are with American Airlines taking a cue from the FAA, which has deemed this plane safe.  Many countries trying, China including -- included, have ground the 737 after the crash in Ethiopia.</p><p>Big tech today, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and the hopeful, 2020 hopeful Liz Warren, lays out her vision for regulation.  The fallout from one of technology's biggest conferences, she wants to break these companies up.  We're going to get into it.  And then there's this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk firing back at regulators.  What he said about his tweeting habits later this hour as he continues to push back on the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Meanwhile, our top story this morning is the 2020 budget proposal from the President.  The White House revealed a $4.7 trillion budget, highlights include $8.6 billion for a border wall, $750 billion for National Defense, with $718 billion going to the Pentagon, giving the military a $33 billion increase.  The President's budget also cuts $818 billion from projected Medicare spending over 10 years.  And joining me right now to talk about all of this is the Undersecretary of the United States Army, Ryan McCarthy.  Secretary, it's great to have you on this program.</p><p>RYAN MCCARTHY, UNDERSECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY:  Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is an honor to have you.  Thank you for your great service in our wonderful U.S. army.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the budget, here we have $22 trillion debt that we're all talking about and calls to pull it back, and yet the President proposes adding more to the defense side of the budget.  You're here on the front lines.  You're going to talk to us about where the priorities are.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you do that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Absolutely.  Maria, the world is a very complex and dangerous place.  The U.S. Army has been in sustained combat operations for 17 years.  And all the while, other nations and around the world have studied our operating capabilities, our weapon systems, and have made the vast investments, both economically and militarily, to counter these capabilities.  So, the reflection of the overall DoD Topline, as well as the U.S. army budget, it is aggressive, it is substantial, we're very grateful for the FY '18-'19 deal that we got, but we have to keep going to rebalance the institution and to be able to pursue national objectives worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now one priorities is rebuilding readiness, right?  Tell me about that, as well as strengthening alliances and partnerships and improving perform and affordability through reform.  How are you doing that?  Tell us where you see this money being allocated.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So readiness is a term that we use pretty liberally.  Readiness is just like a professional athlete getting thousands of repetitions the summer before, an NFL season, or a NBA season taking free throw shots.  So, our soldiers have to be ready.  That mean -- when you have over 60 percent of the requirements worldwide to support national objectives militarily, it's filled by the U.S. Army.  So, readies will always be our number one priority, and over half of our budget is personnel and operating and maintenance.  So, we have to do what we must to have our people as ready as they can be.</p><p>The rest of the investments are in modernization.  Our modernization budget, it's been -- is going to be very aggressive, but we have signaled that with FY '18 and '19 by realigning billions of dollars of our SNC portfolio, about 80 percent against six signature priorities, Long Range Precision Fires, next generation combat vehicles, futuristic helicopters, our networks, our integrated air missile defenses and soldier lethality, ballistic helmets, machine guns, things like that.  So, these substantial moves were necessary because most of our systems are old.  Over 40 years old in most cases for our signature weapon systems and our formations, so we have to make these choices to move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the modernization that you are in the middle of (INAUDIBLE) has a command, new command, army futures command, tell me about that.  How does that help the modernization?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So along with the moves of investments, we had to look at our ourselves and how we do business and they -- what the army recognize was that it was disparate.  The people involved with the decisions, what are the requirement, what is it, the how fast is the weapon system, are the range or the capabilities necessary, that's the customer or the war fighters.  Then we have experimentation, we have acquisition, they were spread across this million-person organization, so what we need to do is bring it all under one roof.</p><p>So, we went through restructuring, one of the most complex that we've done since 1973 and developed a four-star command that became the bridge to academia and business to get us back to the entrepreneurial spirit of the country where we've developed some of the finest systems that our war fighters have ever used in the history of the Department of Defense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And we -- and we headquartered in Austin, Texas, it's a four-star headquarters, they operate in civilian clothes, they have a footprint and accelerator hub on the campuses of University of Texas in Austin, and a four-star commanders' building is in the University of Texas System.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And while you've done that to try to centralize things, you've also been making real cuts in the army, right?  Up against --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- lots of --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- priorities to spend less money.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So we wanted to show two things in this budget, was really fiscal discipline so look at -- every program was a zero-based budget approach.  The Army Leadership Secretary Esper, General Milley, our Chief of Staff, Vice Chief General McConville, our major commanders, all our four-star generals and select what we call staff codes.  So, it was a principles only exercise.  And of course the army staff has a sense of humor, they called it night court.</p><p>And so we sat there for about 70 plus hours, principals only, everybody had to do their own homework and then propose their budgets, and over time, we would look at how it laid in against the priorities, and if you couldn't defend it in that room, slap the table, and we either take the money or finance those efforts.  It was very, very aggressive, long, hot summer but we made some very complex choices, realigning over $31 billion across the five-year futures defense plan.  So, in the Department of Defense, we're really big.  We do it over a five-year horizon, so the moves that are made because you have to develop most of the weapon systems and scale it to an institution of over a million people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  All of this while some of the threats out there are trying hard to keep up or even beat the U.S. military.  I understand that China, for example, has more navy ships than an U.S. has navy ships, major concern for the U.S. government has been Huawei, and the telecom Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was here a few weeks ago.  Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei technology.  Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We've been out around the world just making sure everybody had the same information, that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei technology into their I.T. systems.  We can't forget these systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside, Chinese PLA, their military in China.  They are creating a real risk for these countries and their systems, the security of their people.  If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  we talk a lot about the economic warfare going on between the U.S. and China, but there's real military aggressions as well.  Is this a concern for the army?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It is.  We have looked at a couple things from an investment standpoint, as well as our operating concept.  The army had four -- over 40 years at -- operating business model what we called AirLand battle, and we're in the process of developing what we call multi-demand operations, is you would still have those AirLand components to (INAUDIBLE) of combat that we would fight together as a joint force, but adding cyberspace in space.  So this is going to change the way we do business coupled with the army network as our investment priority, laying in over $20 billion across the five-year future defense plan.  So, substantial investment and coupled with a new enterprise data strategy and how we'll protect our information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell me about that because technology is really critical here, and a lot of countries are using A.I. and many people say that they're ahead of the U.S. in terms of A.I.  Are we using A.I. within the military?  What -- how would you characterize technology in the U.S. army?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So we developed an Artificial Intelligence Task Force retiring -- we're tying in with some world-class academic outlets, as well as companies.  But a lot of the challenge with A.I. is as much cultural conditioning of how we will use that in our operating model as well as the technologies that will invest against.  A.I. will be quite frankly the technology that will change warfare in the future and whoever gets their first will dominate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you feel like you have the tools needed to become number one?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  We're put -- we're putting our best and brightest forward, we're investing substantially, and it will be a priority for us in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Before you go, real quick in terms of the priorities for the U.S. army today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Readiness, it'll always be number one.  We have 180,000 troops deployed in over 140 countries on our 17th year sustained combat operations in the Middle East, so we will always be focused there, to put our men and women the best position they can when they deployed, but substantial moves in modernization and more coming here in the near future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's great to have you on the program.  Thanks so much.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy joining us, U.S. army.  Thank you so much sir.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break and then an alarming new poll says millennials embracing are socialism as freshman politicians like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bring it to the forefront.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that.  And then mounting privacy problems, we are taking you live to the South by Southwest Conference, taking a look at how big tech is tackling major privacy concerns, all ahead, but first, a special update from the Tennis Channel.</p><p>JESSICA VILCHIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, guys, welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report for FOX Business, I'm Jessica Vilchis.  The WTA's newest star, Naomi Osaka, was under the spotlight at the BNP Paribas Open today as she American, Danielle Collins.  After a tight first set of 6-4, Osaka ran away with things, 6-2 in the second set to seal the match and book her spot in the round of 16.  Up next for Osaka will be Belinda Bencic who won recently won a title in Dubai.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAOMI OSAKA, TENNIS PLAYER:  Yes, I mean I just kind of realized that there's nothing else I'd rather do, and I'm really privileged to be here in the first place, so I might as well, you know, enjoy every step of the way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VILCHIS:  A huge upset happened in the men's draw, as number three seed Alexander Zverev loss to the unseeded Jan-Lennard Struff.  It was only the second time in his career Struff had beaten a player in the top five.  And don't forget, you can watch all the action from The Fifth Major on Tennis Channel, our live daily coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A new Harris Poll shows that young Americans are embracing socialist policies more than past generations.  Joining us now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Incredible, huh, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I think it's a problem for Republicans --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- actually these views, social -- the millennials and the Generation Z people, 38 and under, that's the group we're talking about, this is the largest voting bloc in the 2020 elections, millennials and Generation Z.  This bloc firmly approves of socialistic policies.  In this Harris Poll, 73 percent approved of the government providing universal government-provided healthcare.  That essentially is socialized medicine.  67 percent approved of tuition-free college, that's another policy essentially out of the socialist playbook.  So, we have got this large voting bloc heavily in favor of socialist style policies and the Republicans are nowhere to be found on these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean I think it's a problem for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And the President has, you know, Breitbart interview, he understands this.  He says, \"Look, it's easy to campaign on socialism, you offer free stuff, and you probably get, you know, you're going to win, not necessarily going to win, but you're going to do well.  Then he says 10 years later, \"Your country's destroyed,\" but that message is not getting through to millennials.  They support socialistic policies, problem for Republicans in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait until the 16-year-olds start voting.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, stop it, Maria.  Don't want to ruin my day even though it's only Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BROOKS:  I think we should the voting age to 40.  What do you think --</p><p>VARNEY:  What was that?</p><p>BROOKS:  Stuart, Stuart, this is Arthur.  How are you doing?</p><p>VARNEY:  How are -- is that Arthur Brooks?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  The man (INAUDIBLE) you want to move the voting age to 40?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, I figure --</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm OK.  I'm 70.  I'll vote.</p><p>BROOKS: You're 70?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS: Oh, I want to look like Stuart when I'm 70.  You know --</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, I love you, Arthur.  Love you.</p><p>BROOKS: Stu, you know, you and I have talked about this for years and, you know, you and I agree on everything as you know.  I'm less worried about young people saying they're socialists today, and maybe I'm just a Pollyanna.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good.</p><p>BROOKS:  But, you know, what young people call themselves has very much to do with their sense of dignity and aspiration and opportunity and optimism.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  And it seems -- I mean I've seen it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  You know, in 1976, two-thirds of young people 18 to 30 voted for Jimmy Carter by 1984, two-thirds voter for Ronald Reagan, they're very -- young people are --</p><p>VARNEY:  It's fascinating.</p><p>BROOKS:  -- very, you know, promiscuous in their -- sorry.  In their voting patterns and --</p><p>VARNEY:  But will you --</p><p>BROOKS:  And the way they see themselves.</p><p>VARNEY:  Will you please come on my show tomorrow?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to use that for --</p><p>VARNEY:  -- I'm going to steal him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to use this time for that?</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm going to steal him off you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I am.  I'm stealing him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see you in about 10 minutes, Stuart.  Top of the show, \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join -- we will see you then, Stuart.  Thank You.  Coming up, Musk versus the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Tesla CEO taking on regulators over his tweeting.  The details coming up.  And then global privacy concerns, we are take a live look at how big tech is battling mounting privacy issues.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shares of DICK'S Sporting Goods tumbling this morning despite a double beat on earnings and revenue.</p><p>Gerri Willis on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Hey, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  That's right.  So DICK'S coming in beating on both the top and the bottom line, coming in at $1.22 on earnings versus $1.06, 2.49 billion in revenues versus 2.48 billion, even those that -- those shares slumping this morning and why?  It's same-store sales.  They came in 3.7 percent below, lower versus expecting of down 3.3 percent.  Now the company is optimistic in its conversation, its projections for next year.  If you remember, it's been a year since this company banned the sales of assault style rifles and limited -- halted sales of firearms to customers under 21.  Customers have been taking it out on DICK'S and trimming their visits to the store.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla, Elon Musk must sing in the court filings.  He did not file a terms of a fraud settlement that restricted his social media use, this to a federal judge who could hold him in contempt of court.  The SEC has required preapprovals of Elon Musk's tweets, but apparently, there is one tweet that got through directly from Mr. Musk which said that they would make 500,000 cars in 2019.  So, it was a production estimate that the SEC has trouble with.  We know that -- we know that Elon's problems with the SEC go way back.  He's called them a short-seller exchange commission, and the SEC obviously entrenched here on this idea that he is violating terms of his settlement.  The original tweet that offended he said he had secured funding to take the company private.  Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Gerri Willis at the New York Stock Exchange.  Still ahead, mounting privacy problems.  We're taking you live to South by Southwest, that conference for a look at how big tech is tackling privacy concerns.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Big tech companies facing backlash at South by Southwest.  Hillary Vaughn in Austin with the details.  Hey, Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, Instagram Cofounder, Mike Krieger, responding to Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan to cut Facebook down to size by having regulators retroactively reject Facebook's acquisition of Instagram.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE KRIEGER, COFOUNDER, INSTAGRAM:  I'm imagining the sci-fi version of this which is like the time traveler had to go back and unwind the Instagram acquisition, you prevent it from happening to like make sure it happens (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You heard it first, Elizabeth Warren time traveler.</p><p>KRIEGER:  You know, the cliche that every company is a tech company is increasingly true.  So, like, breaking up tech or, like, having those kinds of conversations, I just -- I think the conversation will go better and lead to better policy if we're really specific on the problems that we're trying to solve, and then specific on, like, what the implementation would be.</p><p>VAUGHN:  Warren is also targeting Google and Amazon, saying that they too need to be cut down to size because she thinks they'll be held accountable more easily that way.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  Hillary Vaughn in Austin.  Lindsey, thank you.  Arthur, so good to see you.</p><p>BROOKS:  Nice to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Book again.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 12.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.  Markets this morning are lower.  We are near -- well, we're off of the lows of the morning but certainly off of the highs as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dow industrials down 65 points, Boeing is now another drag on the Dow this morning.  S&amp;P 500 just went negative a few minutes ago, down a quarter point but the NASDAQ up, this morning up 8-1/2, up nine points right now on NASDAQ, on top of big gains yesterday.  Stocks staged a late-day rally yesterday driven by technology stocks.  DowIndustrials were up 200 points, three- quarters of a percent, the S&amp;P was up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>But take a look at the NASDAQ, it was up 150 points due to the strength in tech, better than two percent on the session yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mixed.  Take a look at the European indices where the FT-100 is up 18 points, quarter of a percent but the CAC Quarante in Paris is down 15 and the DAX Index in Germany down 25.  In Asia overnight, gains across-the-board the best performer was Japan, Nikkei Average up 1-3/4 percent.</p><p>Well, the groundings of Boeing 737 Max 8 jet are expanding across the world.  Nearly half of all of the jets that have been delivered since May of '17 are now parked.  The fallout coming up this morning for Boeing as the stock trades down another two percent as we speak.  Carlos Ghosn replaced the Renault-Nissan alliance unveiling a new board structure as the automakers chart their path forward.  As you know, Carlos Ghosn is now out of jail on bail.</p><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk fires back at regulators this morning.  What he said about his tweeting habits later this hour.  Stock is down again 1-1/2 percent.  And the internet us turning 30 years old.  Google celebrates with its doodle today but the man behind the World Wide Web has a warning about the future.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network Dagen McDowell, the author of Love Your Enemies and the president of AEI, Arthur Brooks is in studio this morning and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey bell.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>ARTHUR BROOKS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Good morning.</p><p>BELL:  Lots to cover today, from Brexit, to the budget and Boeing.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We should point out because you mentioned that nearly half of the planes delivered since May of 2017 have been ground by other nations but the Federal Aviation Administration has held off grounding Boeing planes after the crash waiting to see what they find out about this particular crash, although the FAA is expected by the end of next month to mandate a software fix for the automated-flight control system that did play a role in the first crash in Indonesia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Which is why -- what is it, southwest and American airlines have 737s, they haven't taken them out of the lineup, they're there as -- following the FAA's cues.</p><p>BELL:  Well, and safety authorities here in the U.S. have been very careful on tying the Ethiopian Air accident just recently to the Lion Air accident that happened in October but you have China out there, their regulators saying that there could be a connection, it's really very uncertain, a lot of people here are saying it's too early to draw connection.</p><p>BROOKS:  Their people -- the companies are very worried that the flying public is going to panic, and so that's why they're taking them off just in advance for that reason but there is no evidence at this point that there's a problem with the plane.  I strongly suspect that it's -- it will be cleared quickly and Boeing is going to be fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and China's reaction you have to look as Maria did yesterday at the backdrop of what's going on between the United States and China and some nations to suggest that China somehow knows more about a crash in Ethiopia than the U.S. safety regulators do and they were in the ground almost immediately in the country as part of the investigation of black boxes being -- have been recovered.</p><p>But there is that kind of rash move by some countries, potentially to make the United States look bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Boeing sells a third of all of that plane 737 to China.  Obviously, China --</p><p>BROOKS:  It's an incredible safe aircraft.  It has incredible safety record.  There's no evidence that something horrible were going wrong worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is what Dennis Muhlenberg told us the end of last year, the CEO of Boeing.  Meanwhile, President Trump outlines his plans to defense and border spending in his 2020 budget.  Blake Burman is at the White House this morning with the very latest there.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This is third budget put forth by President Trump and his administration but the first time that they have put a budget forward in which Democrats control the appropriations process up on the Hill in the House of Representatives.  The President wish list includes increasing defense spending by five percent, up to $750 billion.</p><p>While, also decreasing nondefense discretionary spending by that same amount, five percent.  Pair that the request $8.6 billion for new funding for the border wall and it's why Democrats say this is going nowhere fast, dead on arrival.  Senator Elizabeth Warren taking to Twitter last night, she wrote the following of the President's budget saying \"A budget is more about -- is about more than numbers, a budget is about values and the budge the President released today is another big wet kiss to the super rich and giant corporations and it guts programs for everyone else.\"</p><p>Now, she is echoing complaints from Democrats about the spending levels for Medicare and Medicaid but the Trump administration insists those levels are not being rolled back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSSELL VOUGHT, ACTING WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR:  What we are doing is putting forward reforms that lower drug prices that because Medicare pays a very large share of drug prices in this country, has the impact of finding savings.  We're also finding ways, fraud, and abuse but Medicare spending will go up every year by healthy margins and no structural changes for Medicare beneficiaries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The budget that was put forth yesterday, Maria, would balance in 15th year.  It also includes deficits of somewhere between a trillion dollars, and $1.1 trillion for fiscal years '19, '20, '21, and '22.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big numbers there.  Blake, thank you.  Blake Burman at the White House.  Joining us right now is the New Voice CEO, former Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  Herman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE NEW VOICE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not every president gets his budget proposals materialized, right?  What's your view on all of this?</p><p>CAIN:  At least, it's a budget.  I don't think the Democrats put forth a budget that was balanced in the eight years that Obama was president.  Second, it doesn't matter what budget the President puts forth, the Democrats are going to punch holes in it.  One of the most impressive parts of the budget to me is the fact that he says there is going to be a five percent across the board cut in nondiscretionary spening.</p><p>And it's going to come from looking for savings.  This is what a leader does.  The leader mandates a target and it's up to those that are running the various departments to go out and find those savings.  I've had to do that as the CEO and that's exactly what the President is doing.</p><p>BROOKS:  Hello, Mr. Cain, Arthur Brooks here from EEI.  It's nice to see you again.  I worry a lot when I see this, you know, when I see $1.1 trillion deficit in the best economy in the past 35 years which I saw great but we can't be running deficits like this when the thing is -- when we're an expansion, we're going to -- we're going to -- governments always do this, you know, we're going to -- we're balance this thing in the out-years.</p><p>We don't exactly know how but we're really going to do it and I know you've got to be skeptical about this too.  So give some hard advice and some real criticism to your brother Republicans.</p><p>CAIN:  The hard advice would be go find those savings, get serious about restraining spending.  That would be the hard advice.  The problem of it is that they never get serious about it.  Republicans or Democrats.</p><p>BROOKS:  Right.</p><p>CAIN:  You can't just -- you can't just blame President Trump and his administration who has been there now a little over two years for this mess that we are in.  Secondly, no one has mentioned that revenues to the treasury because of the tax cuts are up.  So you've got those going up which is a good thing but he is now also trying to put the brakes on spending, and all the Democrats can do is criticize, criticize, criticize and say we're not going to approve any money fort wall,</p><p>I think the President has taken bold step and at least putting this directional budget on the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he hasn't taken a step towards bold spending cuts because again what two-thirds of Federal spending, Herman, are on autopilot or because of entitlement programs.  And there's no evidence -- again, President Trump ran on it, I'm not going to touch Social Security, I'm not going to touch Medicare, that's fine and dandy, I know he's got to run for reelection in 2020 again.  But if you keep -- again, this never gets discussed and never gets talked about by anybody.</p><p>CAIN:  You are right. Dagen.  The non-- the discretionary portion hasn't been touched because it's to require central changes.  The President has not addressed that yet.  I agree with you.  But if the President can't get a few measly billions of dollars for a wall, do you think that the Democrats and the liberals and the lunatics are going to let him get away within structural recommendations?  No.  Not yet.  I don't know when he is going to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CAIN:  But I do believe that before his first term is up he is going to get around to proposing some structural changes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, they're going to be pushing back and they are pushing the Democratic National Committee looking into 2020 announcing that its chosen Milwaukee, Wisconsin to host the 2020 convention.  Republicans were quick to point out that the socialist history is pretty alive and well in Milwaukee, the town has elected three socialist mayors in the past.  The Wisconsin GOP tweeted this yesterday, with the 2020 Democrat presidential primary field currently stumbling over each other in a race for the radical left.</p><p>It makes sense that their party would choose to hold its convention and the only American city that has elected three socialist mayors.  It feels like this 2020 election is going to be a very clear choice between socialism versus capitalism, Herman.</p><p>CAIN:  I would absolutely agree with you.  Let's not forget, Milwaukee is in Wisconsin and it's a big mea culpa on behalf of Hillary Clinton because she did not go there when she ran for president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CAIN:  That is the other factor I think is at play and trying to go and show some love to the State of Wisconsin.  But a bigger point --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, it can be summed up in two words.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cheese curds.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS:  The Democratic Party is doing an epic trolling --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS:  -- by actually going to the state where she didn't -- she didn't campaign.  They're just trolling their own candidate.  This is the most amazing  thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why would -- do they not realize that?  Do they not get it?  What about the issue of socialism versus capitalism?  Are people clear on the differences?  Do you think -- I mean, because, you know,  you've got all of these ideas, the Green New Deal, you've got the Medicare for all, the tax on wealth, 70 percent tax rate.  Do people understand what this means and what these Federal programs look like, socialist, federal government takeovers?</p><p>CAIN:  Some people don't understand the difference between capitalism and socialism but the good news is most people know that socialism has never worked in a country, in the history of the world.  So the Republicans and the conservatives and all the voices out there, the big challenge is to make sure that people understand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CAIN:  I am a firm believer that if people have the right information and the right understanding, they will make the right decision.  That is no contest between capitalism and socialism.  All you have to do is look at the success of the United States of America and make sure that the people understand that and they will not be swayed by these empty socialist promises coming from all the Democrat presidential wanna-bes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see, we'll see.  All right, Herman.  Great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we didn't even get to Nancy Pelosi saying she doesn't want to impeach the President, Herman. We'll save that for next time.  Herman Cain.</p><p>CAIN:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up right after this, global backlash over Boeing this morning.  More countries across the world moving to suspend the 737 Max 8 jet in the aftermath of the deadly crash in Ethiopia.  We're breaking down the fallout.  And then internet revolution.  The World Wide Web turns 30 years old but its creator is issuing a warning sign.  What he is saying.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  I'm Cheryl Casone with some top headlines.  We're following more countries are grounding Boeing's 737 Max 8 jet.  Malaysia and Australia, the latest country to suspend the aircraft from their airports after the deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday.  The countries follow similar moves in China, South Africa, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico.</p><p>But here in the United States the FAA says it has no plans to ground the aircraft for now but it has ordered Boeing to make urgent improvements to it.  Boeing confirming it will deploy a software upgrade to the 737 Max 8.  Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg defended the airplane's safety to Maria after the Lion Air crash.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MUILENBURG:  The real bottom line here, the key is that the 737 Max is very safe and we're very confident in that.  Safety is a core value for our industry and for our company.  Always has been, it always will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But was there a change in terms of this model, the 737 that wasn't articulated to the pilots at the airlines that they did not know how to respond in the event of a change.  That's what the charges are.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.  The 737 Max has some new capabilities that are embedded in it and that's included in the training process that we go through.  You know, the airplane has gone through thousands and thousands of hours of testing and simulation, working with our pilots ensuring that they have all the information they need to safely operate the airplane.  And in some cases, those new systems are designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane.</p><p>We've already issued a couple of follow-up bulletins coming out of the ongoing investigation pointing pilots to existing flight procedures to handle with the kind of scenarios that we're talking about in this incident.  So we're going to continue to do that.  It's very important that we provide all of the information need to safely operate these airplanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, Boeing stock down more than five percent yesterday.  It is now lower again in the premarket today down 3-1/4 percent as you can see here.  Well, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan is going to testify before House Financial Services today, he's going to be grilled on the bank's fake account scandal.  First time a bank CEO is going to appear before the committee that is now led by Democrats but Sloan's future is in question.</p><p>Regulators are seeking answers on whether he can repair the bank's image.  Over the last year Wells Fargo stock down nearly 15 percent.  Well, automakers Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi have created a new board of directors that excludes former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn.  The new board will oversee the French-Japanese partnership meeting every month in Tokyo or Paris.  Ghosn is still one of eight members of Nissan's board but his recent request to attend the Nissan board meeting was rejected by a judge.</p><p>Ghosn released last week from the Tokyo jail for $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days behind bars.  He is accused of underreporting a salary at Nissan which he still denies.  And then there is this, the internet 30 turns 30 today.  Google celebrating with this doodle.  You can see it if you go to Google.  But the creator of the World Wide Web has a warning for all of us.  In a blog post Tim Berners-Lee writes, the web has brought a lot of good but also dysfunction.</p><p>And he says it's time for everyone to work towards trying to change the web for the better.  All right.  We've got a lot more coming up.  Investors eyeing U.S.-China trade as the top negotiators reportedly hold a call overnight.  Plus, Elon Musk goes fighting back.  The Tesla chief suggesting the SEC is infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court.  We are breaking down the fallout when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets were mixed today.  A lot of questions about the U.S.-China trade story.  Top officials from both countries holding a phone conversation last night, there still uncertainty since the meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping has not been set which leaves investors anxious about the deal's future.  Joining us right now is Market Compass LLC founder and CEO, Amelia Bourdeau.  Good to see you, Amelia.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>AMELIA BOURDEAU, FOUNDER AND CEO, MARKET COMPASS LLC:  Great to see you.  Thanks for the invite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of uncertainties from the standpoint of a -- of a market adviser like your firm is.  From China to Brexit, how you invest right now and what's most important in terms of allocating capital?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  What's most important right now in terms of allocating capital volatility, if volatility stays low, meaning we have certain outcomes on today especially with the Brexit vote if we get an actual outcome that they take the deal, you will see sterling rally because markets like certainty, you see equities up in the U.K., you would see the sterling rally.  If we continue with some sort of uncertainty in terms of China trade and also Brexit,  that's going to ride volatility, that could weigh on, you know, U.S. equities because equities don't like uncertainty and any country.</p><p>And so what we're really looking for is some certainty from the market and both the China traded negotiations and Brexit today with their vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even without these two things you've got an economy that's lucky if it grows one percent in Europe for 2019.</p><p>BROOKS:  That's true.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how have you been advising your clients on that story?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  To be sure, the Euro, we've always -- we've already seen a great loss in the Euro but I think it will go to parity actually with the dollar.  Last week's ECB meeting, Draghi did a very interesting thing the ECB did.  They introduced the new loan facility, they said the economy is slowing, they slashed their growth forecast but they said the risks are still waited to the downside which is highly unusual for the ECB after taking all those measures and the reason they said it was still waited to the downside in Europe was because of Brexit and trade negotiations.  The ECB has no policy control over those --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey?</p><p>BELL:  Well, the political environment over there really is also --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU:  It is.  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  And the OECD you saw come out asking or telling the ECB, the European Commission that look, you probably need to inject more stimulus into the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  -- really to stabilize things there.  Is that what you expect?  What do you think the next move is over there?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  I do.  It's very tough, we have European Parliamentary elections coming up at the end of May and some populist parties are coming to the forefront.  And why that's dangerous for the Euro especially is because these populist parties are anti-Euro, and so that's also going to weigh on the European sentiment.  It's also going to affect European government's ability to pass measures to stimulate the economy as well.</p><p>BROOKS:  What are you telling your clients about the odds of going into recession either in Europe and/or in the United States in the next 18 months?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  I think the odds are quite high that Europe will go into recession and the next -- I think even six months, I don't see the U.S. economy in recession at least for the next 12 months.  Just because, growth has been so strong in jobs and wages I know we just had a disappointing jobs number for February, but I think it's a bit of an aberration.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The wages were not disappointing.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  No, the wages were not disappointing, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The best was April 2009.  And finally people are making more money.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Yes.  They are and that's great.  And so I don't see, you know, consumers halting their consumer spending at all.  I think it will just, you know, keep on going, we'll see a little, you know, drop-off in the housing sector but, you know, the U.S. economy is strong especially relative to the rest of the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Amelia, great to have your insights.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amelia Bourdeau joining us there.  Coming up next.  We are talking about a forewarning from the U.S. as it tells Germany to drop Huawei Technology.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke the news with me here first just a few weeks ago.  U.S. Army Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy will join us in an exclusive interview weighing in next.</p><p>Then Musk slams this SEC.  The Tesla chief suggesting regulators are infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court.  The fallout coming up.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 12th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 am on the East Coast.  We have breaking news right now.  The February consumer price index is out.  It is up two-tenths of a percent right in line with the expectations.  In fact, year-over-year is actually lower than the estimate.  Year-over-year, the February CPI is up 1-1/2 percent versus an estimate of 2.2 percent year-over-year.  So, the inflation numbers are out this morning, they are either in line, if you look month-over-month, to lower than expected if you look year-over-year on consumer price inflation.  So, once again, we do have a CPI that shows very little or no inflation.</p><p>Markets this morning not really reacting, although the Dow Industrial Average has been -- has been lower all morning, because of Boeing.  Boeing's stock is down again.  The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are higher this morning.  The S&amp;P just turned higher again after the CPI number, which shows no inflation.  The NASDAQ up 13 points, it's adding on to big rally yesterday, up 150 points on the day yesterday on the NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, European indices are also mixed, take a look at the FT-100 which is higher by eight points, off of the highs of the morning through.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is down though, 12 points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down 24.  In Asia overnight, gains across the board.  Best performer was Japan.  Nikkei Average up 1-3/4 percent.  Hang Seng in Hong Kong up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Breaking news from American Airlines this morning.  It says it has confidence in the safe operation of its aircraft, including the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet after reviewing extensive flight data.  So here we are with American Airlines taking a cue from the FAA, which has deemed this plane safe.  Many countries trying, China including -- included, have ground the 737 after the crash in Ethiopia.</p><p>Big tech today, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and the hopeful, 2020 hopeful Liz Warren, lays out her vision for regulation.  The fallout from one of technology's biggest conferences, she wants to break these companies up.  We're going to get into it.  And then there's this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk firing back at regulators.  What he said about his tweeting habits later this hour as he continues to push back on the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Meanwhile, our top story this morning is the 2020 budget proposal from the President.  The White House revealed a $4.7 trillion budget, highlights include $8.6 billion for a border wall, $750 billion for National Defense, with $718 billion going to the Pentagon, giving the military a $33 billion increase.  The President's budget also cuts $818 billion from projected Medicare spending over 10 years.  And joining me right now to talk about all of this is the Undersecretary of the United States Army, Ryan McCarthy.  Secretary, it's great to have you on this program.</p><p>RYAN MCCARTHY, UNDERSECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY:  Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is an honor to have you.  Thank you for your great service in our wonderful U.S. army.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the budget, here we have $22 trillion debt that we're all talking about and calls to pull it back, and yet the President proposes adding more to the defense side of the budget.  You're here on the front lines.  You're going to talk to us about where the priorities are.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you do that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Absolutely.  Maria, the world is a very complex and dangerous place.  The U.S. Army has been in sustained combat operations for 17 years.  And all the while, other nations and around the world have studied our operating capabilities, our weapon systems, and have made the vast investments, both economically and militarily, to counter these capabilities.  So, the reflection of the overall DoD Topline, as well as the U.S. army budget, it is aggressive, it is substantial, we're very grateful for the FY '18-'19 deal that we got, but we have to keep going to rebalance the institution and to be able to pursue national objectives worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now one priorities is rebuilding readiness, right?  Tell me about that, as well as strengthening alliances and partnerships and improving perform and affordability through reform.  How are you doing that?  Tell us where you see this money being allocated.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So readiness is a term that we use pretty liberally.  Readiness is just like a professional athlete getting thousands of repetitions the summer before, an NFL season, or a NBA season taking free throw shots.  So, our soldiers have to be ready.  That mean -- when you have over 60 percent of the requirements worldwide to support national objectives militarily, it's filled by the U.S. Army.  So, readies will always be our number one priority, and over half of our budget is personnel and operating and maintenance.  So, we have to do what we must to have our people as ready as they can be.</p><p>The rest of the investments are in modernization.  Our modernization budget, it's been -- is going to be very aggressive, but we have signaled that with FY '18 and '19 by realigning billions of dollars of our SNC portfolio, about 80 percent against six signature priorities, Long Range Precision Fires, next generation combat vehicles, futuristic helicopters, our networks, our integrated air missile defenses and soldier lethality, ballistic helmets, machine guns, things like that.  So, these substantial moves were necessary because most of our systems are old.  Over 40 years old in most cases for our signature weapon systems and our formations, so we have to make these choices to move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the modernization that you are in the middle of (INAUDIBLE) has a command, new command, army futures command, tell me about that.  How does that help the modernization?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So along with the moves of investments, we had to look at our ourselves and how we do business and they -- what the army recognize was that it was disparate.  The people involved with the decisions, what are the requirement, what is it, the how fast is the weapon system, are the range or the capabilities necessary, that's the customer or the war fighters.  Then we have experimentation, we have acquisition, they were spread across this million-person organization, so what we need to do is bring it all under one roof.</p><p>So, we went through restructuring, one of the most complex that we've done since 1973 and developed a four-star command that became the bridge to academia and business to get us back to the entrepreneurial spirit of the country where we've developed some of the finest systems that our war fighters have ever used in the history of the Department of Defense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And we -- and we headquartered in Austin, Texas, it's a four-star headquarters, they operate in civilian clothes, they have a footprint and accelerator hub on the campuses of University of Texas in Austin, and a four-star commanders' building is in the University of Texas System.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And while you've done that to try to centralize things, you've also been making real cuts in the army, right?  Up against --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- lots of --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- priorities to spend less money.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So we wanted to show two things in this budget, was really fiscal discipline so look at -- every program was a zero-based budget approach.  The Army Leadership Secretary Esper, General Milley, our Chief of Staff, Vice Chief General McConville, our major commanders, all our four-star generals and select what we call staff codes.  So, it was a principles only exercise.  And of course the army staff has a sense of humor, they called it night court.</p><p>And so we sat there for about 70 plus hours, principals only, everybody had to do their own homework and then propose their budgets, and over time, we would look at how it laid in against the priorities, and if you couldn't defend it in that room, slap the table, and we either take the money or finance those efforts.  It was very, very aggressive, long, hot summer but we made some very complex choices, realigning over $31 billion across the five-year futures defense plan.  So, in the Department of Defense, we're really big.  We do it over a five-year horizon, so the moves that are made because you have to develop most of the weapon systems and scale it to an institution of over a million people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  All of this while some of the threats out there are trying hard to keep up or even beat the U.S. military.  I understand that China, for example, has more navy ships than an U.S. has navy ships, major concern for the U.S. government has been Huawei, and the telecom Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was here a few weeks ago.  Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei technology.  Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We've been out around the world just making sure everybody had the same information, that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei technology into their I.T. systems.  We can't forget these systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside, Chinese PLA, their military in China.  They are creating a real risk for these countries and their systems, the security of their people.  If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  we talk a lot about the economic warfare going on between the U.S. and China, but there's real military aggressions as well.  Is this a concern for the army?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It is.  We have looked at a couple things from an investment standpoint, as well as our operating concept.  The army had four -- over 40 years at -- operating business model what we called AirLand battle, and we're in the process of developing what we call multi-demand operations, is you would still have those AirLand components to (INAUDIBLE) of combat that we would fight together as a joint force, but adding cyberspace in space.  So this is going to change the way we do business coupled with the army network as our investment priority, laying in over $20 billion across the five-year future defense plan.  So, substantial investment and coupled with a new enterprise data strategy and how we'll protect our information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell me about that because technology is really critical here, and a lot of countries are using A.I. and many people say that they're ahead of the U.S. in terms of A.I.  Are we using A.I. within the military?  What -- how would you characterize technology in the U.S. army?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So we developed an Artificial Intelligence Task Force retiring -- we're tying in with some world-class academic outlets, as well as companies.  But a lot of the challenge with A.I. is as much cultural conditioning of how we will use that in our operating model as well as the technologies that will invest against.  A.I. will be quite frankly the technology that will change warfare in the future and whoever gets their first will dominate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you feel like you have the tools needed to become number one?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  We're put -- we're putting our best and brightest forward, we're investing substantially, and it will be a priority for us in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Before you go, real quick in terms of the priorities for the U.S. army today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Readiness, it'll always be number one.  We have 180,000 troops deployed in over 140 countries on our 17th year sustained combat operations in the Middle East, so we will always be focused there, to put our men and women the best position they can when they deployed, but substantial moves in modernization and more coming here in the near future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's great to have you on the program.  Thanks so much.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy joining us, U.S. army.  Thank you so much sir.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break and then an alarming new poll says millennials embracing are socialism as freshman politicians like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bring it to the forefront.

The WTA's newest star, Naomi Osaka, was under the spotlight at the BNP Paribas Open today as she American, Danielle Collins.  After a tight first set of 6-4, Osaka ran away with things, 6-2 in the second set to seal the match and book her spot in the round of 16.  Up next for Osaka will be Belinda Bencic who won recently won a title in Dubai.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAOMI OSAKA, TENNIS PLAYER:  Yes, I mean I just kind of realized that there's nothing else I'd rather do, and I'm really privileged to be here in the first place, so I might as well, you know, enjoy every step of the way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VILCHIS:  A huge upset happened in the men's draw, as number three seed Alexander Zverev loss to the unseeded Jan-Lennard Struff.

A new Harris Poll shows that young Americans are embracing socialist policies more than past generations.  Joining us now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Incredible, huh, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I think it's a problem for Republicans --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- actually these views, social -- the millennials and the Generation Z people, 38 and under, that's the group we're talking about, this is the largest voting bloc in the 2020 elections, millennials and Generation Z.  This bloc firmly approves of socialistic policies.  In this Harris Poll, 73 percent approved of the government providing universal government-provided healthcare.  That essentially is socialized medicine.  67 percent approved of tuition-free college, that's another policy essentially out of the socialist playbook.  So, we have got this large voting bloc heavily in favor of socialist style policies and the Republicans are nowhere to be found on these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean I think it's a problem for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And the President has, you know, Breitbart interview, he understands this.  He says, \"Look, it's easy to campaign on socialism, you offer free stuff, and you probably get, you know, you're going to win, not necessarily going to win, but you're going to do well.  Then he says 10 years later, \"Your country's destroyed,\" but that message is not getting through to millennials.  They support socialistic policies, problem for Republicans in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait until the 16-year-olds start voting.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, stop it, Maria.  Don't want to ruin my day even though it's only Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BROOKS:  I think we should the voting age to 40.  What do you think --</p><p>VARNEY:  What was that?</p><p>BROOKS:  Stuart, Stuart, this is Arthur.  How are you doing?</p><p>VARNEY:  How are -- is that Arthur Brooks?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  The man (INAUDIBLE) you want to move the voting age to 40?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, I figure --</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm OK.  I'm 70.  I'll vote.</p><p>BROOKS: You're 70?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS: Oh, I want to look like Stuart when I'm 70.  You know --</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, I love you, Arthur.  Love you.</p><p>BROOKS: Stu, you know, you and I have talked about this for years and, you know, you and I agree on everything as you know.  I'm less worried about young people saying they're socialists today, and maybe I'm just a Pollyanna.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good.</p><p>BROOKS:  But, you know, what young people call themselves has very much to do with their sense of dignity and aspiration and opportunity and optimism.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  And it seems -- I mean I've seen it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  You know, in 1976, two-thirds of young people 18 to 30 voted for Jimmy Carter by 1984, two-thirds voter for Ronald Reagan, they're very -- young people are --</p><p>VARNEY:  It's fascinating.</p><p>BROOKS:  -- very, you know, promiscuous in their -- sorry.  In their voting patterns and --</p><p>VARNEY:  But will you --</p><p>BROOKS:  And the way they see themselves.</p><p>VARNEY:  Will you please come on my show tomorrow?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to use that for --</p><p>VARNEY:  -- I'm going to steal him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to use this time for that?</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm going to steal him off you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I am.

Hey, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  That's right.  So DICK'S coming in beating on both the top and the bottom line, coming in at $1.22 on earnings versus $1.06, 2.49 billion in revenues versus 2.48 billion, even those that -- those shares slumping this morning and why?  It's same-store sales.  They came in 3.7 percent below, lower versus expecting of down 3.3 percent.  Now the company is optimistic in its conversation, its projections for next year.  If you remember, it's been a year since this company banned the sales of assault style rifles and limited -- halted sales of firearms to customers under 21.  Customers have been taking it out on DICK'S and trimming their visits to the store.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla, Elon Musk must sing in the court filings.  He did not file a terms of a fraud settlement that restricted his social media use, this to a federal judge who could hold him in contempt of court.

So, like, breaking up tech or, like, having those kinds of conversations, I just -- I think the conversation will go better and lead to better policy if we're really specific on the problems that we're trying to solve, and then specific on, like, what the implementation would be.</p><p>VAUGHN:  Warren is also targeting Google and Amazon, saying that they too need to be cut down to size because she thinks they'll be held accountable more easily that way.

It is used by over 4,000 firms including IBM, Google and Ericsson.</p><p>The court said Safe Harbour did not sufficiently protect EU citizens' personal data since the requirements of American national security, public interest and law enforcement trumped the privacy safeguards contained in the framework.</p><p>In addition, EU citizens have no means of legal recourse against the misuse of their data in the United States, the court said. A bill is currently winding its way through the US Congress to give Europeans the right to legal redress.</p><p>The ECJ in its ruling referred to revelations from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, which included that the Prism programme allowed US authorities to harvest private information directly from big tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google.</p><p>IBM said the ruling created commercial uncertainty and jeopardised the flow of data across borders.</p><p>\"The free movement of data across borders is the foundation of the global economy, facilitating everything from financial services and manufacturing to shipping and retail,\" said Christopher Padilla, vice president of Government and Regulatory Affairs at IBM.</p><p>Any company with a centralised HR database in the United States would need to transfer personal data there, and companies that do not have data centres in Europe often ship the data from their European clients across the Atlantic, lawyers said.</p><p>However, they also said most multinationals, such as Facebook and Microsoft, would probably be able to continue with business as usual as they already had alternative legal channels for transferring data to the United States.</p><p>The ECJ ruling became effective immediately and the European Commission said it would continue to work with the United States on a revamped data transfer deal to fill the void.</p><p>\"In the light of the ruling, we will continue this work towards a new and safe framework for the transfer of personal data across the Atlantic,\" Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans told a news conference.</p><p>US loses adequate protection status</p><p>Without Safe Harbour, the United States loses its status in the EU as a country that provides \"adequate protection\" for personal data.</p><p>The EU has granted that status to only 11 countries worldwide. For transfers to any other country, such as Japan, companies have to draw up contracts establishing privacy protections between groups or seek approval from data protection authorities, something they will now be required to do for transfers to the United States.</p><p>\"The EU's highest court has pulled the rug under the feet of thousands of companies that have been relying on Safe Harbour, \"said Monika Kuschewsky, special counsel at law firm Covington.\" All these companies are now forced to find an alternative mechanism for their data transfers to the US\"</p><p>The group of EU data protection authorities, known as the Article 29 Working Party, said it would hold discussions this week to \"determine the consequences on transfers\" of data and schedule an extraordinary meeting shortly.</p><p>The court case stemmed from a complaint by Austrian law student Max Schrems, who challenged Facebook's transfers of European users' data to its American servers because of the risk of US snooping, in light of Snowden's revelations in 2013.</p><p>The European Commission separately demanded a review of Safe Harbour to ensure that US authorities' access to Europeans' data would be proportionate and limited to what is absolutely necessary.</p><p>Schrems filed his complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, as Facebook's European headquarters is in Ireland.</p><p>The case eventually wound its way up to the Luxembourg-based ECJ, which was asked to rule on whether national data privacy watchdogs could unilaterally suspend the Safe Harbour framework if they had concerns about US privacy safeguards.</p><p>\"The judgement makes it clear that US businesses cannot simply aid US espionage efforts in violation of European fundamental rights,\" said 28-year-old Schrems.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NTION-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTION2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H3K-S7G1-JCBN-04H1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Nation News Network Co., Ltd.

Big tech is under fire and facing increasing scrutiny as state attorneys general - including Utah's Sean Reyes - line up behind federal agencies for potential actions while a new investigation opens in the European Union.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The three lawyers and one economist from the big four U.S. tech interests all claimed Tuesday that their employers are in industries where they face \"fierce\" competition and are forced to constantly innovate to stay viable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Columbia University legal scholar Tim Wu characterized that testimony as something that could have \"come from a hearing in 2005 or a fantasy zone\" and said big tech's control over markets is having an undeniable chilling effect on new innovation.</p><p>\"I think we face a vitally important question here,\" Wu said. \"Whether the United States will remain the place that new industries start ... where inventors think they have a chance to challenge the dominant firms of their day, where innovation flourishes.</p><p>\"I think that is something that has come into question. I think that we face, across the economy, an overconsolidation and overconcentration of many industries, and I think this is particularly evident, and in fact extreme, in the tech industries.\"</p><p>All four of the companies invited to testify before the panel have remarkable success arcs, though each began humbly in dorm rooms or garages, and have amassed enormous economic clout. As of the end of June, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google occupied four of the top five slots for U.S. businesses when ranked by market capitalization, and two of them, Amazon and Apple, have spent brief moments north of the $1 trillion mark in the last year.</p><p>Representatives of the companies touted their contributions to the U.S. economy in their testimony, with Adam Cohen, Google's director of economic policy, detailing some of his company's investments and noting tech companies collectively employ some 12 million, accounting for 8% of the total U.S. workforce.</p><p>\"Google's products and services create signficant value, generating an estimated $335 billion in economic activity in 2018,\" Cohen said. \"Last year we hired more than 10,000 people and invested over $9 billion in data centers and offices across the country.\"</p><p>Subcommittee Chairman Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., acknowledged the contributions made by the four companies called to testify but noted some of the mechanisms that helped pave the way for the growth of the digital economy, and big tech concerns, were now failing to address market issues.</p><p>\"In an effort to promote and continue this new economy, Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,\" Cicilline said. \"As a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open and grown hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.\"</p><p>Reyes shares concerns about the impacts of big tech on the competitive landscape, as well as how dominant digital platforms are accruing and commodifying troves of personal data gathered on individuals who use their products.</p><p>Reyes and over 40 other state attorneys general co-signed a letter last month outlining issues they share with how big tech firms operate, following a conference on antitrust issues in Omaha, Nebraska. The 27-page document went to the Federal Trade Commission, which along with the U.S. Department of Justice, is tasked with antitrust oversight in the U.S.</p><p>It notes that companies like Google and Facebook, that give away their products, have created new challenges for enforcement and regulation under current statute.</p><p>\"Recent antitrust enforcement in technology markets has often failed to meaningfully evaluate non-price aspects of competition such as innovation, consumer choice and privacy,\" the letter reads. \"Recent comments by Makan Delrahim, antitrust chief at the United States Department of Justice, reaffirm the commitment of government antitrust enforcers to utilize current antitrust doctrine to address consumer harm in zero-price markets.\"</p><p>The letter also notes that mega-platforms can leverage power acquired via so-called \"network effects,\" wherein the more users who engage the product/platform the more useful, and valuable and influential it becomes. One of the potential outgrowths of that power of scale is being able to identify which new companies may represent competitive threats before they get big enough to actually compete.</p><p>\"Because network effects tend to produce a winner-take-all market, winners tend to monitor the landscape for startups with the potential to unseat them,\" the letter reads. \"Competition concerns arise when dominant platforms can leverage their unique access to data to identify these nascent competitors and acquire or exclude them.\"</p><p>When asked about the current status of any actions aimed at big tech companies and possible anti-competitive conduct, Reyes said he could not \"confirm or deny the existence of any specific investigations at this time,\" but did say that it's typical for investigations to stay under wraps in complex cases.</p><p>\"As conversations about these issues develop, Utah will continue to actively participate,\" Reyes said in a prepared response. \"It is also worth noting that antitrust investigations into complex industries frequently take a year or longer before they become public or result in a lawsuit being filed.\"</p><p>Reyes noted that Utah, which has an explicit free market clause within its state constitution, has a more robust statutory mandate to enforce on antitrust issues than some other states.</p><p>\"The existence of a constitutional provision makes antitrust enforcement a clearer priority in Utah than it may be in some states, particularly the few that lack specific antitrust laws,\" Reyes said. \"Utah has a history of vigorous antitrust enforcement that benefits both consumers and innovative small businesses.\"</p><p>Some industry watchers say congressional action to revamp both the regulatory realm and standing antitrust laws is necessary to take any meaningful action against perceived antitrust activity in the tech realm.</p><p>But Wu and others, including University of Utah S.J. Quinney School of Law professor Jorge Contreras, believe there is sufficient basis in a 130-year-old piece of federal legislation.</p><p>\"The 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act is fine,\" Contreras said. \"It conceivably covers any of this conduct. Where we've drifted away is with the court's interpretation of the Sherman Act.\"</p><p>That drift, which many attribute to legal scholar and former U.S. Solicitor General Robert Bork, was fomented by the idea that antitrust enforcement should be focused on consumer harm rather than competitive issues.</p><p>Contreras said even acknowledging the Bork-influenced shift toward a consumer-centric interpretation of antitrust statute, he and other legal experts where taken aback by the lack of a federal response to Facebook's $1 billion acquisition of image sharing app Instagram in 2012. The move was seen by many as a case of Facebook simply buying up a potential competitor before it grew big enough to pose a business risk.</p><p>\"I think the Facebook-Instagram merger, with almost no opposition from the government, really sent off alarm bells, at least among academics and observers,\" Contreras said. \"The collective response was, 'What is going on here? We expected at least a good fight about this.'\"</p><p>While U.S. law enforcement and regulatory agencies ponder which fights they're willing to wage, European regulators are stepping into the ring.</p><p>On Wednesday, the European Union announced it is investigating whether Amazon uses data from independent retailers to gain an unfair advantage, a decision that could lead to changes in how the internet's biggest marketplace works.</p><p>The move echoes similar antitrust actions against Google and Microsoft that have led to billions in fines.</p><p>The EU's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, said she's taking a \"very close look at Amazon's business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer.\"</p><p>In addition to selling its own products, Amazon allows third-party retailers to sell their goods through its site. Last year, more than half of the items sold on Amazon worldwide were from third-party sellers.</p><p>In doing so, Amazon collects data about activity on its platform that, the EU says, it might be able to use to favor its own products for sale. In particular, the EU will look at how Amazon determines which trader is selected as the default seller of an item that a customer wants to buy.</p><p>Contributing: Associated Press</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p><p>Twitter: DNTechHive</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-44791395</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKN-WTV1-DY6J-M012-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That\u2019s what our investigation intends to uncover and reveal \u2014 whether Google is playing by the rules and acting fairly.\u201d</p><p>The massive bipartisan investigation, which includes 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, will look at Google\u2019s business practices to see if it violates state or federal antitrust laws, specifically looking at whether its dominance of online advertising and searches harms consumers.</p><p>\u201cThere's a fine line sometimes between aggressive business practices and illegal ones.\u201d Reyes said Monday. \u201cUsually the line is very clear. And again our investigation will determine whether Google has crossed that line.\u201d</p><p>The multistate probe could also touch on how Google ranks searches and how it protects users' personal information.</p><p>The investigation \u2014 a fairly unprecedented move that brings together, in some cases, ideologically opposed forces \u2014 comes as big tech companies face increased scrutiny from states and the federal government over their control of the internet and the potential to block upstarts and innovation.</p><p>\u201cMany consumers believe that the internet is free. Certainly we know from Google\u2019s profits of $117 billion that it is not free,\u201d said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who is leading the investigation with D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, a Democrat. \u201cAnd this is a company that dominates all aspects of advertising on the internet and searching on the internet, as they dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side and even the video side with YouTube. This investigation is not a lawsuit. It is an investigation to determine the facts.\u201d</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In a blog post, Kent Walker, Google\u2019s senior vice president for global affairs, said last week that the company\u2019s services support thousands of jobs and help small businesses.</p><p>\u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s of course right that governments should have oversight to ensure that all successful companies, including ours, are complying with the law,\u201d Walker wrote, adding that Google has answered many of the questions raised over many years in the United States and abroad. \u201cWe have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so. We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition.\u201d</p><p>Monday's announcement is not the first foray into probing the massive provider of internet products, though it might mark one of the largest investigations into its operations.</p><p>Utah\u2019s Reyes and Racine, the D.C. attorney general, sent a letter to Google more than two years ago seeking to understand how it ranks links related to its own businesses.</p><p>\u201cThere used to be a day when we search Google that we would be presented with links unrelated to the Google businesses,\u201d Racine said Monday. \u201cThere's a very compelling analysis to suggest that the overwhelming number of query responses relate to Google businesses and or advertisers that pay for that slot within those links.\u201d</p><p>The European Commission has also brought three antitrust actions against Google.</p><p>The tech giant is also under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the former of which recently made its first legal demand for Google records, The Washington Post reported.</p><p>Only California, which is home to Google\u2019s headquarters, and Alabama did not join their fellow state attorneys general in the probe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomnewspolitics20190909utahattygenseanreyes</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X15-0YJ1-JCB3-X291-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

John Curtis, R-Utah, introduced a consumer data privacy protection bill Monday that would require manufacturers to disclose whether smart appliances and devices are equipped with audio or visual capabilities.</p><p>The Informing Consumers about Smart Devices Act, which Curtis introduced alongside Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts, and Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Florida, states that \"each manufacturer of a covered device shall disclose whether the covered device manufactured by the manufacturer contains a camera or microphone as a component of the covered device\" and that failing to do so \"shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice\" prescribed in the Federal Trade Commission Act.</p><p> \"Any person who violates this Act or a regulation promulgated under this Act shall be subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act,\" the text of the bill states.</p><p> The bill specifically targets smart appliances like refrigerators and pet feeders and would not apply to cell phones, laptops, tablets \"or any device that a consumer would reasonably expect to have a microphone or camera\" or a device that is \"specifically marketed as a camera, telecommunications device, or microphone.\"</p><p> The bipartisan bill comes a year after reports that Amazon employees listen to voice recordings captured by Echo speakers to improve the device's speech recognition, as the Associated Press reported in April 2019, leading to increased scrutiny over the ways smart devices impact personal privacy.</p><p> \"We should be allowed to make informed decisions about the electronic eavesdroppers we invite into our homes,\" Moulton said in a press release. \"But we can't do it if big tech hides microphones and cameras that are always listening in refrigerators, toasters and other household gadgets.\"</p><p> Moulton introduced a related bill in July 2019, the Automatic Listening Exploitation Act, that would \"limit the use, record or transmission of any speech or sound captured by a smart speaker, or any video image captured by a video doorbell, and to prohibit \u2026 such use, recording or transmission without the express consent of the consumer.\"</p><p> Curtis said the bill \"balances protecting American consumers with continuing to foster innovation\" and would \"allow regulatory flexibility without hamstringing the technological pioneers who are developing smart technologies, while ensuring consumers are aware of the capabilities of items they are putting in their homes.\"</p><p> The disclosure requirement would not apply to devices manufactured or sold before the bill passed and would require the Federal Trade Commission to work with manufactures to establish guidelines for how to disclose whether products are equipped with cameras or microphones.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKUT-e342d748885bdc24753fa1aa48abc0125e19f6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C87D78E2008 NWBKUT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C3-5091-JBCN-451D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Daily Herald.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The sector's quiet strength highlights similarly constructive action in other traditionally defensive[1] market groups, including bonds and precious metals. Taken together, investors may love big tech but are hedging their bets with safe havens that should outperform if the broad averages turn lower in coming months. </p><p>Even so, choose exposure wisely due to broad regulatory, corporate and resource variations, with self-regulated companies performing better than those forced through legislative channels to increase rates. Utilities more tightly levered[2] to commodities are lagging as well, with lower natural gas and crude oil prices undermining profits. As a result, it makes sense to stick with industry leaders while limiting exposure to broad-based sector funds.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE[3]) topped out at $73.75 in 2007 and sold off to $33.81 in 2008. It completed a round trip into the prior high in 2012 and broke out one year later, entering a strong uptrend that's continued into 2017. However, volatility has risen sharply since 2014, with deep corrections and vigorous bounces defining two-sided action, in which bulls have withstood mounting selling pressure. The stock topped out[4] at $132 in July 2016 and sold off in multiple waves that reached a seven-month low at $110 after the November election. It turned higher into January, reaching the prior high in March and pulled a back in the last phase of a cup and handle pattern, ahead of a May breakout that continues to add points at a rapid pace. Given technically overbought[5] readings, market players should wait for a pullback to new support at $134 before getting on board. The company pays a 2.62% dividend.American Electric Power, Inc. (AEP[6]) stalled in the low-50s in 1998 following a long uptrend and reversed at that resistance level in 2001 and 2007. A 2013 test yielded a multi-decade breakout, followed by a strong uptrend that's eased into a rising channel[7] with support in the upper-50s and resistance in the mid-70s. A bounce that started at channel support in December 2016 has now reached within 4-points of channel resistance. Also, the stock has just completed a 100% retracement into resistance at the July 2016 high at $71.32, raising odds for a multi week reversal and pullback that could offer a lower-risk entry price. The 200-day EMA rising through the mid-60s looks like a natural downside target, with that level offering more favorable reward: risk than buying a breakout. The company pays a 3.20% dividend.Nisource, Inc. (NI[8]) topped out in the lower teens in 1998 and reversed at that level in 2001. It took more than a decade for the next return trip, with price reaching resistance in 2013 following a 10-point rally off the 2009 bear market low. It broke out into 2014, grinding higher in a narrow rising channel that paused in the second half of 2015. It reentered the pattern at year's end and continued to gain ground into the July 2016 high at $26.94. A decline into December dropped the stock to an 8-month low at $21.17 ahead of a recovery wave that stalled above $24 in March 2017. It broke out above that resistance level about two weeks ago and charged higher, lifting within a point of resistance this week. On Balance Volume (OBV)[9] has matched bullish price action, setting the stage for a breakout, perhaps after a final reversal yields a test at new support (blue line). The company pays a 2.61% dividend.The Bottom LineUtilities have attracted steady buying pressure in recent months, despite the media's narrow focus on growth stocks, and could post new highs in coming months. &lt;Disclosure: the author held no positions in aforementioned stocks at the time of publication. &gt;

During the 1994 Rwandan genocide it was radio, where the word &amp; cockroach&amp; took on a deadly meaning.</p><p>There's been an unfortunate evolution of such nefarious use of popular media. In 2019, the propaganda frontier has expanded to the mass media of our day: YouTube, social media and smartphone apps.</p><p>The world is experiencing a terrifying backlash against rationality and science. This is especially true when it comes to vaccinating children.</p><p>&amp; Antivaxxing&amp; stems from one of the worst scientific frauds of all time. Now-disbarred British doctor Andrew Wakefield falsified research and had it published in The Lancet in 1998. The journal later retracted the paper, claiming it had been &amp; deceived&amp; by Wakefield's &amp; utterly false&amp; assertion that autism was caused by the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.</p><p>Two decades of research has failed to find any link. But this hasn't stopped Wakefield's claims from becoming lore for the conspiratorially minded.</p><p>YouTube is rife with antivaxxers spreading irrationality and fearmongering.</p><p>But vaccinating all children against these dread diseases protects all society. It's called herd immunity for a reason.</p><p>In recent years there have been numerous outbreaks of measles - including a &amp; record-breaking&amp; one in Europe, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). This for a disease that was once all but eradicated. &amp; Approximately 110,000 people died from measles in 2017 - mostly children under the age of five years - despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine,&amp; the WHO states.</p><p>The disinformation plague has now extended to apps, which are a powerful form of communication.</p><p>A popular children's developmental app, The Wonder Weeks, is based on a book of the same name. It claims a child's development follows predictable &amp; leaps&amp; usually prefaced by grumpiness - and catalogues what developmental stage the child is experiencing.</p><p>But its founder, professor Frans Plooij, was dismissed from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands when research by one of his own PhD students negated the book's claims and he tried to quash publication of her findings. The app is still for sale and has been downloaded more than 500,000 times on Android alone.</p><p>Another recent case is the Femm app, which purports to be about female health and fertility, but is &amp; funded and led by anti-abortion, anti-gay Catholic campaigners&amp; The Guardian newspaper revealed last month. Downloaded more than 400,000 times, the &amp; popular women's health and fertility app sows doubt about birth control [and] features claims from medical advisers who are not licensed to practise in the US&amp; Other regular fodder includes conspiracy theories that the moon landing was faked, that US school shootings such as Sandy Hook (2012) and Parklands (2018) didn't happen, and that the Earth is flat.</p><p>Right-wing hatemonger Alex Jones, whom Facebook finally banned last year, claimed on his InfoWars channel that the shooting at Sandy Hook was a hoax created by the gun-control lobby. His supporters started harassing the parents of these deceased children - and social networks did nothing.</p><p>It took Twitter six years of appeals by one of those parents, Leonard Pozner, to suspend the account of a regular InfoWars interview guest, Wolfgang Halbig, who claimed the massacre hadn't happened. Halbig badgered parents and demanded records for the tragedy. &amp; Wolfgang does not wish to speak with you unless you exhume Noah's body and prove to the world you lost your son,&amp; a fellow hoaxer e-mailed Pozner, according to The New York Times.</p><p>Then there's a 104-minute documentary on YouTube, Conspiracy Theories with Shane Dawson, which includes all the usual paranoid theories, including that the Earth is flat.

The bigger problem is that its recommendation algorithm suggests increasingly controversial content, as multiple surveys have found.</p><p>Guillaume Chaslot, who worked as a YouTube software engineer, created the AlgoTransparency.org website to show how this algorithm works. He found viral hoaxes and conspiracy theories are the top recommended videos on about 1,000 popular YouTube channels.</p><p>Almost too little too late, YouTube announced in January that it would alter its recommendations algorithm to prevent spreading &amp; borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways&amp; This includes &amp; videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the Earth is flat or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11&amp; These conspiracy theories are what researchers Danah Boyd and Michael Golebiewski call a &amp; data void&amp; which can be &amp; exploited by those with ideological, economic, or political agendas&amp; Unfortunately, national regulators have failed to pick up on these issues.

It's allowed conspiracy theories and disinformation to flourish because it attracts viewers - and therefore advertising</p><p>It's common cause that Leni Riefenstahl was a gifted filmmaker, her movies well shot and hugely evocative. The problem is, those films were almost pure Nazi propaganda. Their odious content was a covert message, selling the Third Reich's nonsense - that Aryans were superior to other races - under titles such as Triumph des Willens, or Triumph of the Will.</p><p>Sadly, this is just one example of insidious propaganda that uses the medium of the day for its own ends. During the 1994 Rwandan genocide it was radio, where the word &amp; cockroach&amp; took on a deadly meaning.</p><p>There's been an unfortunate evolution of such nefarious use of popular media. In 2019, the propaganda frontier has expanded to the mass media of our day: YouTube, social media and smartphone apps.</p><p>The world is experiencing a terrifying backlash against rationality and science. This is especially true when it comes to vaccinating children.</p><p>&amp; Antivaxxing&amp; stems from one of the worst scientific frauds of all time. Now-disbarred British doctor Andrew Wakefield falsified research and had it published in The Lancet in 1998. The journal later retracted the paper, claiming it had been &amp; deceived&amp; by Wakefield's &amp; utterly false&amp; assertion that autism was caused by the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.</p><p>Two decades of research has failed to find any link. But this hasn't stopped Wakefield's claims from becoming lore for the conspiratorially minded.</p><p>YouTube is rife with antivaxxers spreading irrationality and fearmongering.</p><p>But vaccinating all children against these dread diseases protects all society. It's called herd immunity for a reason.</p><p>In recent years there have been numerous outbreaks of measles - including a &amp; record-breaking&amp; one in Europe, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). This for a disease that was once all but eradicated. &amp; Approximately 110,000 people died from measles in 2017 - mostly children under the age of five years - despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine,&amp; the WHO states.</p><p>The disinformation plague has now extended to apps, which are a powerful form of communication.</p><p>A popular children's developmental app, The Wonder Weeks, is based on a book of the same name. It claims a child's development follows predictable &amp; leaps&amp; usually prefaced by grumpiness - and catalogues what developmental stage the child is experiencing.</p><p>But its founder, professor Frans Plooij, was dismissed from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands when research by one of his own PhD students negated the book's claims and he tried to quash publication of her findings. The app is still for sale and has been downloaded more than 500,000 times on Android alone.</p><p>Another recent case is the Femm app, which purports to be about female health and fertility, but is &amp; funded and led by anti-abortion, anti-gay Catholic campaigners&amp; The Guardian newspaper revealed last month. Downloaded more than 400,000 times, the &amp; popular women's health and fertility app sows doubt about birth control [and] features claims from medical advisers who are not licensed to practise in the US&amp; Other regular fodder includes conspiracy theories that the moon landing was faked, that US school shootings such as Sandy Hook (2012) and Parklands (2018) didn't happen, and that the Earth is flat.</p><p>Right-wing hatemonger Alex Jones, whom Facebook finally banned last year, claimed on his InfoWars channel that the shooting at Sandy Hook was a hoax created by the gun-control lobby. His supporters started harassing the parents of these deceased children - and social networks did nothing.</p><p>It took Twitter six years of appeals by one of those parents, Leonard Pozner, to suspend the account of a regular InfoWars interview guest, Wolfgang Halbig, who claimed the massacre hadn't happened. Halbig badgered parents and demanded records for the tragedy. &amp; Wolfgang does not wish to speak with you unless you exhume Noah's body and prove to the world you lost your son,&amp; a fellow hoaxer e-mailed Pozner, according to The New York Times.</p><p>Then there's a 104-minute documentary on YouTube, Conspiracy Theories with Shane Dawson, which includes all the usual paranoid theories, including that the Earth is flat. It &amp; kind of makes sense&amp; Dawson has previously said of this pre-Copernicus bunkum. He has 20-million followers, while this video got 30-million views.</p><p>Researchers at the Flat Earthers annual conference for the past two years found that attendees asked: &amp; Where is the curve?&amp; and &amp; Why is the horizon always at eye level?&amp; Lead researcher Asheley Landrum, from Texas Tech University, says: &amp; Their algorithms make it easy to end up going down the rabbit hole, by presenting information to people who are going to be more susceptible to it.&amp; YouTube's business model requires its viewers to spend as much time as possible watching videos, and therefore watching adverts. The bigger problem is that its recommendation algorithm suggests increasingly controversial content, as multiple surveys have found.</p><p>Guillaume Chaslot, who worked as a YouTube software engineer, created the AlgoTransparency.org website to show how this algorithm works. He found viral hoaxes and conspiracy theories are the top recommended videos on about 1,000 popular YouTube channels.</p><p>Almost too little too late, YouTube announced in January that it would alter its recommendations algorithm to prevent spreading &amp; borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways&amp; This includes &amp; videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the Earth is flat or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11&amp; These conspiracy theories are what researchers Danah Boyd and Michael Golebiewski call a &amp; data void&amp; which can be &amp; exploited by those with ideological, economic, or political agendas&amp; Unfortunately, national regulators have failed to pick up on these issues. But, then, they have failed to identify most of the problems associated with the consolidation of power by Big Tech and social media firms.</p><p>Hobby-sharing site Pinterest, of all platforms, has managed to solve the antivaxxing problem. All it has done differently is ban antiscientific nonsense outright. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, in contrast, &amp; downrank&amp; or &amp; de-emphasise&amp; such posts - but don't remove them. Since February, if you searched for antivaxx info on Pinterest no search results were returned.</p><p>YouTube, Facebook and Twitter could just as easily do the same but they say they aren't the arbiters of what's true and what's not.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg infamously said in July 2018 that, even though he finds Holocaust deniers &amp; deeply offensive&amp; he doesn't think &amp; they're intentionally getting it wrong&amp; What he didn't say is that Facebook gets enormous traffic out of such drivel. And, the greater the number of eyeballs on the app, the more advertising revenue it's getting.</p><p>It's about profit.</p><p>But, like other social networks, Facebook also fears a backlash from the alt-right and conservatives in the US who claim they are being censored. Controversial content plus controversy equals even more advertising opportunities.</p><p>As Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month, the tech sector has a lot to answer for: &amp; This industry is becoming better known for a less noble innovation: the belief that you can claim credit without accepting responsibility.&amp; For social media users wary of being caught up in all this, the rule is simple: if it seems too good to be true, it likely isn't true at all. The same goes for stories with headlines that include: &amp; left him speechless&amp; and &amp; you won't believe what happened next&amp; When in doubt, turn to fact-checking website Snopes.</p><p>Caption</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFF-80P1-JCB2-W2BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1308\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

It's allowed conspiracy theories and disinformation to flourish because it attracts viewers - and therefore advertising</p><p>It's common cause that Leni Riefenstahl was a gifted filmmaker, her movies well shot and hugely evocative. The problem is, those films were almost pure Nazi propaganda. Their odious content was a covert message, selling the Third Reich's nonsense - that Aryans were superior to other races - under titles such as Triumph des Willens, or Triumph of the Will.</p><p>Sadly, this is just one example of insidious propaganda that uses the medium of the day for its own ends. During the 1994 Rwandan genocide it was radio, where the word &amp; cockroach&amp; took on a deadly meaning.</p><p>There's been an unfortunate evolution of such nefarious use of popular media. In 2019, the propaganda frontier has expanded to the mass media of our day: YouTube, social media and smartphone apps.</p><p>The world is experiencing a terrifying backlash against rationality and science. This is especially true when it comes to vaccinating children.</p><p>&amp; Antivaxxing&amp; stems from one of the worst scientific frauds of all time. Now-disbarred British doctor Andrew Wakefield falsified research and had it published in The Lancet in 1998. The journal later retracted the paper, claiming it had been &amp; deceived&amp; by Wakefield's &amp; utterly false&amp; assertion that autism was caused by the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.</p><p>Two decades of research has failed to find any link. But this hasn't stopped Wakefield's claims from becoming lore for the conspiratorially minded.</p><p>YouTube is rife with antivaxxers spreading irrationality and fearmongering.</p><p>But vaccinating all children against these dread diseases protects all society. It's called herd immunity for a reason.</p><p>In recent years there have been numerous outbreaks of measles - including a &amp; record-breaking&amp; one in Europe, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). This for a disease that was once all but eradicated. &amp; Approximately 110,000 people died from measles in 2017 - mostly children under the age of five years - despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine,&amp; the WHO states.</p><p>The disinformation plague has now extended to apps, which are a powerful form of communication.</p><p>A popular children's developmental app, The Wonder Weeks, is based on a book of the same name. It claims a child's development follows predictable &amp; leaps&amp; usually prefaced by grumpiness - and catalogues what developmental stage the child is experiencing.</p><p>But its founder, professor Frans Plooij, was dismissed from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands when research by one of his own PhD students negated the book's claims and he tried to quash publication of her findings. The app is still for sale and has been downloaded more than 500,000 times on Android alone.</p><p>Another recent case is the Femm app, which purports to be about female health and fertility, but is &amp; funded and led by anti-abortion, anti-gay Catholic campaigners&amp; The Guardian newspaper revealed last month. Downloaded more than 400,000 times, the &amp; popular women's health and fertility app sows doubt about birth control [and] features claims from medical advisers who are not licensed to practise in the US&amp; Other regular fodder includes conspiracy theories that the moon landing was faked, that US school shootings such as Sandy Hook (2012) and Parklands (2018) didn't happen, and that the Earth is flat.</p><p>Right-wing hatemonger Alex Jones, whom Facebook finally banned last year, claimed on his InfoWars channel that the shooting at Sandy Hook was a hoax created by the gun-control lobby. His supporters started harassing the parents of these deceased children - and social networks did nothing.</p><p>It took Twitter six years of appeals by one of those parents, Leonard Pozner, to suspend the account of a regular InfoWars interview guest, Wolfgang Halbig, who claimed the massacre hadn't happened. Halbig badgered parents and demanded records for the tragedy. &amp; Wolfgang does not wish to speak with you unless you exhume Noah's body and prove to the world you lost your son,&amp; a fellow hoaxer e-mailed Pozner, according to The New York Times.</p><p>Then there's a 104-minute documentary on YouTube, Conspiracy Theories with Shane Dawson, which includes all the usual paranoid theories, including that the Earth is flat. It &amp; kind of makes sense&amp; Dawson has previously said of this pre-Copernicus bunkum. He has 20-million followers, while this video got 30-million views.</p><p>Researchers at the Flat Earthers annual conference for the past two years found that attendees asked: &amp; Where is the curve?&amp; and &amp; Why is the horizon always at eye level?&amp; Lead researcher Asheley Landrum, from Texas Tech University, says: &amp; Their algorithms make it easy to end up going down the rabbit hole, by presenting information to people who are going to be more susceptible to it.&amp; YouTube's business model requires its viewers to spend as much time as possible watching videos, and therefore watching adverts. The bigger problem is that its recommendation algorithm suggests increasingly controversial content, as multiple surveys have found.</p><p>Guillaume Chaslot, who worked as a YouTube software engineer, created the AlgoTransparency.org website to show how this algorithm works. He found viral hoaxes and conspiracy theories are the top recommended videos on about 1,000 popular YouTube channels.</p><p>Almost too little too late, YouTube announced in January that it would alter its recommendations algorithm to prevent spreading &amp; borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways&amp; This includes &amp; videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the Earth is flat or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11&amp; These conspiracy theories are what researchers Danah Boyd and Michael Golebiewski call a &amp; data void&amp; which can be &amp; exploited by those with ideological, economic, or political agendas&amp; Unfortunately, national regulators have failed to pick up on these issues. But, then, they have failed to identify most of the problems associated with the consolidation of power by Big Tech and social media firms.</p><p>Hobby-sharing site Pinterest, of all platforms, has managed to solve the antivaxxing problem. All it has done differently is ban antiscientific nonsense outright. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, in contrast, &amp; downrank&amp; or &amp; de-emphasise&amp; such posts - but don't remove them. Since February, if you searched for antivaxx info on Pinterest no search results were returned.</p><p>YouTube, Facebook and Twitter could just as easily do the same but they say they aren't the arbiters of what's true and what's not.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg infamously said in July 2018 that, even though he finds Holocaust deniers &amp; deeply offensive&amp; he doesn't think &amp; they're intentionally getting it wrong&amp; What he didn't say is that Facebook gets enormous traffic out of such drivel. And, the greater the number of eyeballs on the app, the more advertising revenue it's getting.</p><p>It's about profit.</p><p>But, like other social networks, Facebook also fears a backlash from the alt-right and conservatives in the US who claim they are being censored. Controversial content plus controversy equals even more advertising opportunities.</p><p>As Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month, the tech sector has a lot to answer for: &amp; This industry is becoming better known for a less noble innovation: the belief that you can claim credit without accepting responsibility.&amp; For social media users wary of being caught up in all this, the rule is simple: if it seems too good to be true, it likely isn't true at all. The same goes for stories with headlines that include: &amp; left him speechless&amp; and &amp; you won't believe what happened next&amp; When in doubt, turn to fact-checking website Snopes.</p><p>Caption</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFW-3B41-JCB2-W3M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1308\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

Following those initial hearings and the lines of questioning on display, I thought Congress was on the cusp of an important realization: that these companies are simply too broad in scope, too large in scale, to address any of these issues effectively. Our representatives haven't gotten there yet.</p><p>Almost a year later, nothing has changed. After other hearings of varying seriousness this year - witnesses ran the gamut from Facebook President and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to YouTube stars Diamond and Silk - Congress and Big Tech now perpetually recycle the same dialogue in each meeting.. The tech companies say they are aware of the problems, could've done better, and will do more. The Congressional representatives respond with veiled threats of regulation: moves like breaking up the companies, or revisiting the shield laws that limit platform liability for user-submitted content. And then little happens and everything resets on the next go around. This is because both the interrogators and those being interrogated like to speak of these issues in vague terms, either because they don't entirely grasp the issue or because they want to avoid saying anything too definitive.</p><p>Today in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey fielded questions ostensibly about foreign election meddling but, as the hearings always tend to go, were actually about a kludge of messy issues (Google was invited but didn't appear, earning condemnation from the committee). For Sandberg, the hearing was about expressing Facebook's commitment to stopping - and being transparent about - \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-ssandberg-090518.pdf\"> inauthentic behavior </url>.\" For Dorsey, it was about emphasizing Twitter's commitment to bolstering the \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jdorsey-090518.pdf\"> health of conversation </url>\" on his platform.</p><p>What do these terms even mean? It's unclear. \"Inauthentic behavior,\" according to Sandberg's opening statement, means that the accounts \"misled others about who they were and what they were doing.\" That is, by design, an unspecific definition. It's what lets Facebook try to ferret out sock-puppet accounts from Russia without also shutting down the page for<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> The Onion </emphasis>. Trying to judge whether behavior is \"inauthentic\" is a lot like trying to determine whether one of Trump's falsehoods is a \"lie\"\" - it's difficult to determine intent. If the only difference between an American and a foreign user posting the same Black Lives Matter meme is intent, then maybe the metric needs to be reconsidered.</p><p>Dorsey's endorsement of \"healthy conversation\" is similarly vague. A healthy conversation could mean exposing democratic socialists to alt-right Twitter users and vice-versa, or it could mean siloing each group entirely. Does showing users more factual news, even if personally distressing, count as healthy or harmful? Dorsey didn't really say and the Senators didn't push him on it.</p><p>One of the many problems with regulating big tech is that nobody seems sure about what aspect to regulate (speech? algorithmic fairness? competition?), and neither side wants to say. Politicians don't want to push for regulating speech, and tech companies don't want to openly state that they can arbitrarily limit speech at any time for any reason they want. Similarly, neither party wants to admit that that commitment to freedom of speech is what allows toxicity, foreign meddling, malevolent bots, and so-called \"inauthentic behavior\" to proliferate.</p><p>Eventually something has to break. Maybe the tech companies eventually assert their rights as private businesses to self-govern their platforms. Maybe regulators get tired of waiting and act without the cooperation of these companies. But trying to walk the line between these options is only shedding more light on how enormous these platforms are, how difficult online interaction can be to parse and how tough fair enforcement can be to execute. In other words, the longer this stalemate drags on, the more likely Congress is to arrive at the conclusion that the platforms are simply too big to exist.</p><p>Compounding the nebulously defined problems from Sandberg and Dorsey are the solutions that Facebook and Twitter are emphasizing to combat them: Artificial intelligence and strictly enforced sets of rules. They are trying to judge the fuzziness of human interaction in terms of 1s and 0s. Even the humans making moderation calls must do so at a machine-like pace, spending just seconds on each deliberation. The amorphous problem and the cold, technical solution don't exactly align.</p><p>By deploying this rhetoric in the Senate, Sandberg and Dorsey put regulators in a tight spot. Nobody wants to seem like they are endorsing \"inauthentic behavior\" and nobody wants to be against \"healthy conversation and debate.\" And so we are left with a stalemate - in which complex problems are boiled down to metrics then analyzed by machines and machine-like humans.</p><p>Maybe we are using the wrong metrics to evaluate social media and its many problems. The next time these companies appear before Congress, it's probably worth asking if \"inauthentic behavior\" is the right problem to tackle, or if whatever defines \"healthy conversation\" is the right outcome to work towards.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6G-K3F1-DYWJ-M2JM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">296337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"929\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 New York Magazine Holdings LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New York Magazine</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 5, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>jack dorsey</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>twitter</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sheryl sandberg</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001333</classCode><className>PLATFORMS &amp; ISSUES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000271</classCode><className>CENSORSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D0V7</classCode><className>USER GENERATED CONTENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>PE000DFE4</classCode><className>JACK DORSEY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>PE000C9M7</classCode><className>SHERYL SANDBERG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000C5PB</classCode><className>MARK ZUCKERBERG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It will examine how digital developments can contribute to health and wellbeing across the board but will have a particular focus on children and young people from low and middle-income countries. </p><p>Underpinning its deliberations is an awareness that much remains to be done if AI is not to introduce a new form of inequality, in which its potential is fully realised only in richer countries.</p><p>The backdrop is unforgiving. Health workers are in short supply everywhere, even in rich nations, as governments and other health providers struggle to keep up with the scale of demand driven by population ageing and technological advances.</p><p>But a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thelancet.com/gbd\"> Global Burden of Disease </url>report, published in The Lancet two years ago, highlighted not only scarce numbers but the unequal distribution of staff, which it suggested could undermine the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>It found that only half of all countries had the workers required to deliver good quality healthcare, estimated at 30 physicians, 100 nurses or midwives, and five pharmacists per 10,000 people.</p><p>Countries across sub-Saharan Africa, south-east Asia, south Asia, and some in Oceania were estimated to have the greatest shortfalls.</p><p>The commission will focus in particular on the toll this asymmetry is taking on the health of younger people. In an article in <url normalizedValue=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/4/e000798.info\"> the BMJ medical journal</url> last year, a number of experts in childhood wellbeing, including Stefan Germann, chief executive of Fondation Botnar \u2014 one of the funders of the commission \u2014 raised ownership of patient data as a key area that must be tackled \u201cbefore global health governance and equity can be secured\u201d.</p><p>While there were many reasons to be optimistic that AI could prove transformative for healthcare, including in resource-poor settings, \u201cthe extent to which everyone will benefit remains to be seen\u201d, Mr Germann wrote, alongside Fondation board member Flavia Bustreo and Siddhartha Jha, its AI programme manager.</p><p>The potential is enormous \u2014 and unprecedented. Through the ubiquity of mobile phones in the developing world, an opportunity exists for the first time to collect patient data at scale in regions where there was previously limited understanding of different patterns of need and demand.</p><p>But, as the BMJ writers acknowledged, this goal could clash with the determination of big tech companies to keep the data private to maximise commercial returns.</p><p>A key conundrum for the commission, therefore, is how to assure that the value created with health data flows back to society, to strengthen the health system for everyone.</p><p>Data can show people the relationship between their own behaviour and the costs to the system overall. By showing patterns of need and demand, it could also help to target resources where they are most needed but in a way that would command public support. </p><p>Reliance on information generated by patients will undoubtedly trigger concerns about privacy and data ownership. But it might also raise questions about whether privacy concerns loom as large if the corollary is greatly improved healthcare \u2014 or healthcare where none was previously available.</p><p>In other words, while it is easy to assume that a desire to protect and even profit from data are common to all societies, this proposition, although accepted in the western hemisphere, has yet to be fully tested in the developing world.</p><p>Other key questions will be who protects and regulates the data for the good of all, and whether big tech companies are partners in, or threats to, that process.</p><p>How to collect the right data for effective decision making \u2014 both about an individual\u2019s treatment and to understand the burden of disease at population level \u2014 and the capacity of people to enter and send data correctly, are also challenges to be debated and resolved.</p><p>Nor is the commission alone in pondering how best to realise the potential of technological advances. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/25-10-2019-who-expert-panel-on-digital-health-meets-for-first-time\">World Health Organization</url> last week held the first meeting of a group of global experts to develop a \u201croad map\u201d to advance digital health. </p><p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organisation\u2019s director-general, said the plan \u201cfocuses our efforts on helping the world benefit from digital health technologies and solutions while safeguarding the misuse of people\u2019s data and protecting their health.\u201d</p><p>Gaining maximum advantage from AI will call for new skills, particularly in procurement. Governments in the developing world are used to striking hard bargains to acquire a pill, or other immutable objects or goods \u2014 but acquiring tech solutions, which are constantly evolving, may require a very different approach if the best value is to be obtained.</p><p>The process of paying for care could also be transformed by cashless and paperless digital payment, which could render far less significant the question of whether care is provided by public or private institutions. This could increase capacity significantly while removing capital expenditure from the balance sheet of public health systems.</p><p>As the commission embarks on its work, the opportunities to harness AI for good in the developing world have never been greater \u2014 but the solutions it will be considering have never been more urgently needed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://survey.ft.com/jfe/form/SV_8ddxpVNPkytWyRT\"> Tell us about the possibilities and pitfalls of digital health </url></emphasis></p><p>How is digital health helping tackle disease? Do the hidden biases in artificial intelligence discriminate? Will limited bandwidth leave the poor further behind? The FT is exploring how technologies, products and applications can improve the health of the poorest and hardest to reach young people and children in the world. </p><p>We are looking for examples that should already \u2014 or have the potential to \u2014 improve outcomes in low and middle income countries. We also want to hear instances of and broader concerns about technology; and proposals for governance, regulation and pricing to limit the risks.

Bespoke Investment Group noted Monday that the technology stocks that dominate the growth stock indexes are underperforming the S&amp;P 500's 9.3-per-cent return since June 30, while value-oriented sectors ,like materials and industrials, have jumped well over 10 per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Previous periods of value stock outperformance in recent years have been short-lived, and Kai Wu, founder of New York-based investment firm Sparkline Capital, believes this will continue to be the case.</p><h>Texte/Text</h><p>Mr. Wu argues that value investors will never overcome their inherent short position in the disruptive, innovative power of technology stocks. He notes that the Russell 1000 Value Index has a 9.7-per-cent weighting in information technology, while the growth index is 44.4-per-cent technology.</p><p>The author writes, \"Value investors are making an epic 34.7 per cent short bet against the technology sector... Value has a meagre 1.4 per cent position in FAANG+M [Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Co.] compared to Growth's 39.4 per cent. Not only are value investors short tech, but they are short Big Tech. And in a big way.\"</p><p>There are a few reasons why value investors would object to this framing of the issue. For one, there is a difference between being underweight technology and actively short the sector.</p><p>More importantly, the key short position for value investors is less technology than human psychology. The value strategy's focus on hard numbers - valuations primarily - allows them to sidestep the hype, buzzwords and excessive optimism that can drive growth stocks into prohibitively expensive and financially dangerous territory. More attractively valued stocks have also historically protected invested capital much better than growth stocks during downturns.</p><p>Mr. Wu is right to call out the extended failure of value investing strategies. He does, however, grant that the trend has left value stocks extraordinarily attractive (by their own criteria), \"Value companies are trading at their deepest discount since the peak of the tech bubble. The relative price-to-book ratio of Fama-French valueis now two standard deviations cheap compared to its historical average.\"</p><p>Separately, BofA Securities (formerly Merrill Lynch) quantitative strategist Savita Subramanian has been definitively recommending value stocks to clients. Ms. Subramanian noted that value stocks had underperformed growth stocks by 31 per cent as of the end of July - the widest margin since 1979 - and were due for a bounceback. She added, \"we prefer value - which is underowned, inexpensive, and poised to outperform in the coming months.\"</p><p>I'm not about to declare a permanent end to the rally in technology stocks at this time. Still, value stocks are exceedingly attractive in the current market for a portion of investor portfolios, providing not only potential outperformance, but also diversification and downside protection.</p><p>-- Scott Barlow, Globe and Mail market strategist</p><p>This is the Globe Investor newsletter, published three times each week.

I looked at putting the money into another GIC, but the return would be even less. I don't need the money for at least 10 years.</p><p>Can you suggest somewhere safe to put it in the meantime? Most of my investments are in mutual funds and stocks, so I'd like to have a little cushion in something that won't lose money. Thank you for your time.</p><p>Answer:An investment that won't lose money over 10 years? If you take inflation risk into account, even GICs and high-interest savings accounts could lose purchasing power over that time. A 10-year Government of Canada bond is only yielding about 0.5 per cent, so you probably don't want to go that route either.</p><p>With a 10-year time horizon, I suggest you consider taking on a small amount of risk with your money. If you don't own them already, some good utility stocks or a fund that invests in them would be worth considering. These would include companies like Fortis Inc. (FTS-T), Canadian Utilities Ltd. (CU-T) and Emera Inc. (EMA-T). Because most of their income is regulated, the downside risk is minimal, and the dividends appear to be secure.</p><p>--Gordon Pape</p><p>What's up in the days ahead</p><p>Power Corp. shares are trading at a curiously large discount to the underlying value of the company's international financial assets.

Vanguard collects $1.4 billion in fees annually on the half-trillion dollars it invests. What might that stream of cash be worth on the stock market?</p><p>Newly public mutual fund purveyors BlackRock, Neuberger Berman and Federated each trade at triple their yearly revenues. Better-known brands T. Rowe Price and Franklin Resources (Franklin/Templeton Funds) fetch about 3 1/2 times revenues.</p><p>At those ratios, Vanguard would be worth $4.2 billion to $4.9 billion - less than, say, Summit Bank, but more than Rite Aid.</p><p>Mellon Bank and Merrill Lynch each manage roughly as much money as Vanguard does while commanding stock-market values in the neighborhood of $20 billion. But for them, mutual funds are just a sideline; their pretax profits alone are bigger than Vanguard's revenues.</p><p>So if Vanguard were public, at current market valuations, the Merrills and Mellons of this world - not to mention real giants such as Citicorp or AIG - could afford to buy it in a Wall Street minute.</p><p>* It's one thing to buy a money management firm. It's something else to keep the hotshots on board - as First Union was reminded last week when the previously merger-proof team that ran Meridian Bank's Conestoga Funds and CoreStates' growth-stock shop jumped over the side.</p><p>Former First UnionMeridian Investments president Philip Brown 2d, chief investment officer Joseph Stocke, and portfolio managers Daniel Cooke and Lester Rich are the new owner/operators of StoneRidge Investment Partners L.L.C.</p><p>Their tastes still run to \"technology companies like AOL, specialty retailers like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, broadcasting companies like USA Networks, pharmaceuticals like American Home Products, and communications companies like MCIWorldcom,\" according to Brown.</p><p>But now the men can \"control our destiny\" while providing \"a greater degree of assurance and continuity\" than under a corporate owner, Brown said.</p><p>There are plenty of role models nearby. StoneRidge's Upper Main Line neighbors include tech-heavy Turner Investment Partners, where ex-Meridianite Bob Turner's team has attracted more than $3 billion since 1990, and Chartwell Investment Partners, a squad of ex-Delaware Group officers who have raised almost as much in just two years.</p><p>Over in Radnor, Peter Havens' Baldwin Management L.L.C. has hired a dozen of his former Bryn Mawr Trust Co. investment underlings since his new firm opened in July.</p><p>Havens' firm - named for Philadelphia's vanished Baldwin Locomotive Co., which his family controlled - focuses on \"big tech stocks, your Microsofts, Intels and AOLs, in addition to a fairly good representation of some foreign household names like Royal Dutch/Shell, Sony and Telmex,\" Havens said.</p><p>Havens takes partial credit for tripling Bryn Mawr Trust's asset management arm, to $2.25 billion, during his three years in charge there.</p><p>Of course, Bryn Mawr has also benefited from backlash among those upset by the disappearance of the city's traditional banks. Count former CoreStates chairman Morris Dorrance among those spotted writing checks recently on a Bryn Mawr Trust account.</p><p>* Philadelphia's Jefferson Bank is slated to become junior-most partner in a three-way merger with Dime Bank and Hudson United. But the Cohen family, which started Jefferson almost a generation ago, has no plans to exit banking.</p><p>Edward Cohen, husband of Jefferson chairman Betsy Zubrow Cohen and head of mini-conglomerate Resource America Inc., has filed to create an independent, Delaware-based online banking company, Bancorp.com, which will set up Web banking sites for membership groups and businesses.</p><p>Frank Mastrangelo, Jefferson's chief information officer, will be president of the new bank, pending approval by Delaware and federal regulators. Directors include the Cohens' son Daniel.</p><p>Elsewhere online: In Pottstown, Patriot Bank Corp. has unveiled BankZip.com, a subsidiary that plans a network of community banks with a common Web site and an ATM-sharing agreement.</p><p>Patriot chairman Joseph W. Major says he's going to take BankZip.com public next spring, and use the proceeds for a national ad campaign.</p><p>* Investors in the former Meritor Savings Bank (better known as Philadelphia Savings Fund Society) get their day in court this week when a federal judge in Washington considers their claim that state and federal regulators broke a promise when they closed the venerable Philadelphia thrift in 1990.</p><p>Among the witnesses for the defense: former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William Isaac, who in a previous affidavit supported Meritor's claim that it had reason to believe it was adequately capitalized when the Feds moved in.</p><p>Whatever the decision, don't expect a payout in the next year or two. Given contradictory judgements in similar cases, investors Frank Slattery and Gary Hindes said the case is likely to be appealed.</p><p>* The Securities and Exchange Commission has ordered Wilmington money manager Marvin &amp; Palmer Associates and founder David F. Marvin to pay more than $1 million for \"materially false statements\" that hid his use of customer money to pay a Kent, Ohio, firm, MacThom Associates, for \"introductions and referrals\" that helped Marvin &amp; Palmer build its $7 billion foreign-investments business.</p><p>Joseph N.

I'm Van Jones welcome to \"The Van Jones Show\". We got an important show tonight. Tomorrow is exactly four years since Donald Trump came down that escalator in Trump Tower and changed this country bigly as he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So tonight, we're going to take a big step back and try to get our bearings and dig into some of the big issues, the key challenges that are facing all of us in the Trump era. #1, what are we going to do about the rising tide of hatred and White Supremacist violence in the country?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And #2, what are we going to do about the way that social media is tearing us apart? Now, tonight we've got great guests to help us sort this stuff out. Two Democratic Congresswoman coming are coming together, one Muslim, one Jewish to stand against White Supremacist violence.</p><p>Tonight, we're going to hear from Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky and Ilhan Omar on my show. I'm excited about that. You can let -- we can welcome like that. But first, let's talk.</p><p>I want to shine a light on some of the positive signs of health and hope in the country, and I need to do this for myself, because next week trump is announcing his big re-election bid too soon. It's too soon. I still haven't recovered from the first announcement. Okay? From that day until now I have just hated trump's tone on immigrants and refugees. I've just hated his flippant disregard for the idea of fair elections, free from foreign influence.</p><p>This week the Chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission had to actually come out and make it clear to the President of the United States that it's illegal to get help from foreign nationals in a U.S. election after trump's comments saying, \"He would happily take dirt on his political opponents from other countries\". Now, that's just terrible.</p><p>And the big danger to me has always been that the rest of us would eventually start adopting his views, forgetting that we can welcome and accept people and celebrate diversity instead of locking up people in detention centers and separating kids from parents, forgetting that the 4th of July is called Independence Day for a reason. There have always been foreign powers that would love to dominate us and have our leaders do their bidding. And my fear has been that America will become too tough on foreign people, but too soft on foreign powers and just too callous overall.</p><p>But luckily this week I saw some signs of help, I saw some antibody starting to kick in. First, I found myself very touched by former Vice President Joe Biden making these campaign appearances in Iowa.</p><p>Now the storyline was Biden versus Trump. They're trading blows. Yes, Biden was going after Trump, but in the very best possible way. He said essentially we are better than this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He says, \"Let's Make America Great Again\", \"Let's Make America America Again\".</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: I love that. I love it. It may be out of fashion, maybe a little bit corny to truly believe in the best of our country. No, that's sentimental crap, no that's out. It's all about snarky and cynicism these days. Not for me -- not for me. I am still a 2008 Barack Obama hope and changer. I'm proud of it and I was happy to see somebody rising above the cynicism and sticking up for those values.</p><p>Now, I may not vote for him in the primary, but I sure appreciate him. And honestly, the same with Jon Stewart, I love the guy. He's a retired comedian and he's usually known for all his sarcasm. But he's made it his personal mission to passionately and emotionally defend the heroic 9/11 first responders who are suffering still from illnesses and he did it in front of Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JON STEWART, 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS ADVOCATE &amp; COMEDIAN: They responded in five seconds. They did their jobs with courage, grace, tenacity, humility. 18 years later do yours.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: He didn't have to do that. And the next day the House Judiciary Committee unanimously passed the 9/11 Victim Compensation Bill.</p><p>And I was also thrilled by the way to see four former heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, both Republicans and Democrats, joining forces, speaking out about the current EPA. Saying stop ignoring science, stop rolling back major protections for our planets, that's three beautiful acts.</p><p>And when we get off track we need those brave bold people to call us back to our best selves and we also got to do a better job of fighting back against this rising tide of hatred that we are now facing.</p><p>Now luckily an unlikely duo of Congresswomen are making that their mission now. I spoke to Representatives Ilhan Omar and Jan Schakowsky about that fight and about the latest Trump controversy. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Is Donald Trump begging for impeachment? I heard you say that Donald Trump, because he says he'll take any foreign dirt from being foreign dirty dealer, he's begging for impeachment. True or false?</p><p>[19:05:00] REP. JAN SCHAKOWSKY (D-IL): I think it is true. Although, it's not part of a larger strategy, because Donald Trump does not have any strategy. He wakes up every day and tries to figure out how to handle feeling good about himself.</p><p>But this is so amazing. It really is. I mean, it reminded me of, like, when your child is in trouble and then they're trying to get out of that trouble, and then they get themselves in more trouble. And I was like, \"Oh, honey\".</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: But, I mean, we've been saying, a lot of us, that it wasn't -- this has not been about when -- if he was going to get impeachment. It's when. And I think the clock is just ticking now.</p><p>JONES: One thing I think about sometimes the way that TV comes after you, they sometimes say well you're not very patriotic or whatever, whatever. They challenge you to not being patriotic. Do you feel that Trump is being patriotic when he says, I'll take foreign dirt in their campaign?</p><p>REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): No. This is I think one of the most un- American things you could say.</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: It's just shocking -- really. I mean, the thing about Donald Trump is, he doesn't really hide it. The question is, what are people going to say, and I hope they will soon, when they hear more. That's it. It is finally enough.</p><p>OMAR: He's so bold in the most on lawlessness thoughts that go through his head. And I think for so long we've just said that that's kind of what Trump does. It's time to take him serious and it's time for us to make this a constitutional matter and protect our nation.</p><p>JONES: Speaking of time. It's been four years since Trump came down the escalator. We've had a lot of hatred that's been rising. I think part of reason you guys are coming together is because of that.</p><p>Talk a little bit about the impact on the -- of the Trump presidency on America and what's going on when it comes to this rise of hatred?</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: So I am so happy to be here with my colleague. But you know what, you could set up more chairs. You could have the LGBT community over here, you could have the immigrant community over here. What about Hispanics? What about African-Americans? And you could fill this stage with -- JONES: With group of people that are being buffeted by hatred.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Directly. I mean, again, there's no subtlety about this. Those were very -- some very fine people in Charlottesville who were yelling the Jews will not replace us and marching with torches. It's so blatant.</p><p>JONES: But what do you say to people? Listen, I think that if you are at the -- if you are the target of this, it's really big. But if you're not, it's just another news story. What is it like right now to be a young Muslim trying to raise a family in an America where there seems to be a license for more hatred?</p><p>OMAR: There's constant fear, right, of being other. Do we know what being other leads to. It's very dangerous.</p><p>JONES: What does it mean other? What does that mean?</p><p>OMAR: To not be seen as being part of your community, as being part of your city, your state, your country, constantly being viewed as an invader. And I think I know that it has an impact on our mental health.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: What we have seen this tremendous uptick in acts of violence in all kinds of attacks on both of our communities since Donald Trump is the President of the United States, because I believe he has just unleashed a permission for people to talk with such contempt towards each other.</p><p>JONES: You are coming together -- you wrote this op-ed.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yes.</p><p>JONES: You're trying to figure out some way towards each other. It seems like there's efforts to divide people.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: When we are fighting against each other, if Muslims and Jews, that's a victory for white supremacist -- that's a victory for white supremacist. And so I think what we're trying to do is just to articulate that we, in order to fight that, need to be together.</p><p>OMAR: And the thing, I think, that makes this country exceptional is it's not that it is homogenic in race or faith, is that it's homogenic in values.</p><p>JONES: I hear the clarion call. You want more unity, you want us to come together. What do you think can be done? What steps should be taken? What do you want the Trump Administration to do, what do you want government to do. What besides just pointing to the problem --</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I want the Trump administration to be gone.</p><p>JONES: Well --</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: -- that's what. Well, I mean, it's 17 months. The big decision. And so, I think, the American people have to decide who are we as a country? What are the values that make America great?</p><p>[19:10:00] OMAR: The bigger thing that we must do, right, to fight this cancer really is go after the cure. And the cure is to be in conversation. We have to all engage in this generational project to have this --</p><p>JONES: I think it's important and you say that, because -- listen, as frustrated as I get with Trump and as frustrated as I feel there with Trump, this is a global thing it's happening. Why do you think that people are open this type of stuff in this day and age right now? Is there something happening?</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: You know, I think the income inequality actually plays into this when people feel really fragile and they're looking for someone to blame, pointing to a minority group. Pointing to immigrants who are coming and people are taking our job. They're getting benefits that I'm not getting, which of course isn't true.</p><p>But -- and so I think that this fundamental economic fact that so many people are living on the edge makes them susceptible to this kind of nationalism.</p><p>JONES: I want to play a video from Rashida Tlaib. She is in in Congress, in a hearing, speaking to an FBI Director and listen to the pain in her voice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): I was totally excited and pleased when I heard about 49 Muslims were killed and many -- many more women did in New Zealand. This is a great start. Let's hope and pray that it continues here in the good old USA. The only good Muslim is a dead one. How is that enough -- not enough to fall under domestic terrorism?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Now this was after the horrific massacre in New Zealand. And that that was a hateful letter directed to her and to you.</p><p>OMAR: I mean it's a daily occurrence for Rashida and I.</p><p>JONES: What is?</p><p>OMAR: This. This this kind of hate that the terror, the threats. Just yesterday a man in Florida pled guilty to saying he wanted to throw me of the Empire State Building.</p><p>JONES: You said somebody in court --</p><p>OMAR: Yes.</p><p>JONES: Pled guilty to want to throw you physically off of a building?</p><p>OMAR: Yes, the Empire State Building. He called my office. That wasn't enough. He called three other Members of Congress and left voicemails telling them that's what he wanted to do to me. I, at a very young age, survived a little militia standing in front of my house trying to annihilate my family. And so I understand what that kind of fear looks like and I don't like to give space to it.</p><p>I think what is more important to me is that we understand that as a Member of Congress I have protection. But there are Ilhans and Rashidas and Jans out there in the public, trying to live their normal life --</p><p>JONES: Just trying to get --</p><p>OMAR: Without the protection and the notoriety, right. And the resources that we might have who are going to a grocery store, going to their place of worship that might have a run-in with that person who will harm them.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Let me just say on a more mundane level. The Trump administration actually eliminated a grant program that could go to communities to help protect themselves, disbanded an intelligence gathering unit that was focused on white supremacy and the danger that it poses to several communities.</p><p>So the mechanisms to help that could really do something are being eroded quite deliberately by this President.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Representative Omar sparked controversy earlier this year with comments and tweets that many viewed as anti-Semitic. What does she take away from that experience and what were some of those tough conversations like with her Jewish colleagues like Jan Schakowsky, that's next.</p><p>[19:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES: All right. Welcome back to \"The Van Jones Show\". Freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has been a lightning rod almost since she got sworn in.</p><p>Now in February she faced a bipartisan backlash for tweets that were critical of Israel and an Israeli lobby group that used language that many people consider an Anti-Semitic. Now, Omar apologized unequivocally that has not stopped some people on the Right, including the President and some people from Fox News from taking her words out of context and vilifying her.</p><p>So I talked to Representative Omar and her colleague Jan Schakowsky about all of this. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: I think your heart is so -- obvious anybody watching this show can see the heart that you have and yet you had those big moments where suddenly like you were the most controversial person in the world, and she must hate Jewish people and that kind of stuff. What did you learn from that? OMAR: What you learn is that, like I said, you have to always pause. You can never really understand what you do what you say, your demeanor, actions what any of those things could mean for someone, and the kind of feelings that it could unearth for them.</p><p>So I had to stop and say right, what does it mean to you? Why are these particular words impactful for you when they are not that impactful for me when I say them? And I think in that process really is about opening up a door to having a greater understanding of the kind of generational traumas we all carry.</p><p>I know that some of my Jewish constituents when they come visit me, they will say, \"You don't understand my grandmother or great- grandmother had to hide under the bed to survive that night\".</p><p>And I would say, well, you didn't do any research on who I am, because I deeply understand what it means to be eight and seven and hide under a bed for survival. And for my shortcomings of not understanding what certain words could mean to your particular community doesn't mean that I don't understand the pain and the generational trauma that might --</p><p>[19:20:00] SCHAKOWSKY: Let me just say. We had we had a conversation about some of the things that that Ilhan said. But I want to tell you that the majority of reaction that I got to are -- to get doing the op-ed together was positive.</p><p>There were a few people within my Jewish community who were infuriated that why aren't you doing more to condemn her? So because we've had this talk and it is important to say, these are the things that touch a nerve. These are the things that do hurt.</p><p>She totally heard that, totally understood that. We are both victims of the kind of discrimination that's going on and the kind of hate talk that is going on. Do you want to keep that going or want to perpetuate that? No.</p><p>This this is the person I know. Now I know on a very personal relationship and we can work together, of course we can.</p><p>OMAR: I mean, so I want to say, there are people who are genuinely interested in fighting anti-Semitism and then there are --</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Of course, yes.</p><p>OMAR: There are those that are interested in weaponizing anti-Semitism to shut down debate on whatever they might not agree on and vilify anybody that they might not want to have any kind of platform to have influence.</p><p>And so with many of my colleagues, they understand that, one of my first acts after I won my general election was to write an op-ed in my local newspaper about the rise of anti-Semitism when the FBI report came out and the work that we have to do.</p><p>Because it's really important that you're not only talking about the threats that you face, you're talking about the threats that others face. I'm someone that always sees that there is a connection to your oppression to mine.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Well, let me just say though I think some of the people who were upset about what they heard as anti-Semitism keyed in to were not necessarily trying to weaponize them. That this was this was a genuine feeling. So in part my --</p><p>OMAR: Not just some, but a lot of the people. It's a genuine feeling.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yes. This is genuine feeling and a genuine concern and --</p><p>OMAR: There's a lot of very loud people who may not have a genuine concern.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: But one of the motivations for me to be public along with Ilhan was to help those people understand where I was coming from, but even more importantly, where she's coming from.</p><p>OMAR: I'm getting the same criticism. I just joined the Jewish Black Caucus and people were like, why would you do that? Because there are members who have not been the kindest Muslims and African-Americans and black folk in in this country.</p><p>But I know that this gives us an opportunity to have that conversation, to hold each other accountable to say if we're interested in creating a better world, we have to hold hands, we have to educate one another.</p><p>JONES: Yes. I'm trying to raise my kids in this society as well. I'm trying to find a way forward and it's very, very difficult to hold the principle, but also to be criticized. And I see you struggling with that.'</p><p>One of the countries that you have or people you've expressed concern for are the people at Palestine. Take a moment to express and explain to my audience why you're so concerned about what's happening in Palestine? We've chastised you for the way you've talked about it, possibly justifiably. But why do you care so much about what's happening in Palestine?</p><p>OMAR: Yes. I think I believe that it's within the principles of every human to believe we're all created equal. We all should have access to all full rights as humans. And so when you see a group of people that might not have their full rights intact, then you have to speak up for them, if you truly believe that.</p><p>I don't think because there is a challenge you shouldn't speak.</p><p>JONES: Right.</p><p>OMAR: I know a lot of people will say, Ilhan, this isn't politically expedient. Why are you taking so many hits for people who others have given up on? And for me, I believe, I'm only alive because people didn't give up on -- right -- saving me. And I have to use the opportunities that I have to speak up for the people that I actually believe people might have given up on.</p><p>[19:25:00] And I don't think that the world has done justice when it comes to Palestinians. And I don't believe that we can continue to walk around and tiptoe around the Palestinian-Israeli issue, and not talk about the injustice that's taking place and how we urgently need to remedy it.</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: So I feel so strongly about justice for Palestinians, partly because of my lifelong love for the State of Israel, and the idea of a Jewish State and a Democratic State at the same time.</p><p>And I think as long as we are supporting a two-state solution and full rights for Palestinians and to have their self-determination and to have a state that we're on the right path for Israel.</p><p>JONES: We have the most diverse Congress we've ever had. You represent the most diverse incoming class we've ever had. And I tell you what if you don't believe in having different voices at the table it's going to change the conversation. You just have to listen to what you just said and the conversation that you're having across lines across generations.</p><p>I think it's beautiful. I think it's exciting. I appreciate what you're doing, keep going. We're proud to have you out on \"The Van Jones Show\".</p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Powerful, powerful conversation. We got more coming up. YouTube CEO was on the defensive this week. She's defending her decision to keep videos with anti-gay slurs up on the site. At the same time she's apologizing to people who are outraged by that policy.</p><p>What is the balance between free speech and hate speech for big tech? We're going to talk about that with the person who sparked this whole conversation, his name is Carlos Maza. He's going to join us for an exclusive interview when we get back.</p><p>[19:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES: Welcome back to \"The Van Jones Show\". Look, we're facing a major cultural debate in this country around speech, especially on social media. On one hand we all want to stamp out hatred and harassment. On the other hand, we want to prevent censorship and protect our First Amendment rights.</p><p>Sometimes these values just seem to clash and these tech companies now are having to walk a real tightrope on the issue. Here's a closer look at the problem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES (voice-over): There are now more than 126 million active users on Twitter every day. YouTube, meanwhile, has 1.9 billion users per month and people watch more than a billion hours of video on that site every day. Facebook is the biggest of them all, with more 2 billion active users per month and that company also owns a social media giant Instagram.</p><p>With numbers like that, it's no wonder these companies are now struggling with how to manage all that content. Some content restrictions are created by the government. Think about copyright laws for example.</p><p>But much of it is left of the companies to just govern themselves, and they've got a lot to wrestle with, including deciding just how strict their guidelines for banned speech should be.</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER: Any suspension, whether it be a permanent one or a temporary one, make someone think about their actions.</p><p>SUSAN WOJCICKI, CEO, YOUTUBE: We see all these benefits of openness. But we also see that that needs to be married with responsibility.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): But the efforts in these social media giants to clean up their sites is actually angered a lot of people. Many Democrats are still troubled by Facebook and their role in Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: The big social media platforms know their systems are being manipulated by foreign and domestic actors to sow division, promote extremism and spread misinformation. But they won't get serious about cleaning up their platforms unless consumers demand it.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): And they say the company still is not doing enough to stop the spread of fake news and doctored videos.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: This is a top priority to make sure that people aren't spreading misinformation or trying to interfere in elections on Facebook.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): Other critics say, social media giants like YouTube, are just not doing enough to stamp out hate speech.</p><p>CARLOS MAZA, HOST, STRIKETHROUGH, VOX.COM: They're making excuses to avoid doing the difficult thing, which is dealing with a monster that they spent years creating.</p><p>JONES: But some conservatives say they're being unfairly banned. They argue their content is wrongly being flagged as hate speech.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Names are taken off, people aren't getting through. And it seems to be if they're conservative, if they're Republicans, there's discrimination and big discrimination.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Joining us now we've got two men who got a personal stake in this whole fight, Roger McNamee is a longtime venture capitalist. He's one of the early investors in Facebook. He actually advised Mark Zuckerberg. But now he says that Facebook is doing serious damage to our society.</p><p>We've also got Carlos Maza. He's a host of the series \"Strikethrough\" on Vox.com. He says he's been harassed for years by this controversial YouTuber named Steven Crowder. He recently tweeted a whole montage of offensive, so-called, jokes about his race and sexuality.</p><p>And he asked YouTube to do something about it. After some back-and- forth, the company decided to leave the videos up, but demonetize Crowder's account so we can't make money off of it.</p><p>And I want to thank you both for being here. Now Carlos you've been through a lot. I want to show so people will know what we're talking about. A part of this montage is very offensive -- very offensive and then they we're going to talk about it. But please show this horrific montage you put together the attacks against him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN CROWDER, AMERICAN-CANADIAN COMMENTATOR: Oh, OK. So really that name is \"little queer\". You, by the way, the \"gay Mexican guy\". The \"Gay Latino V-Neck\". \"Gay Mexican\". A \"Mexican gay guy\" used to work. \"Mexican gay Latino\" there at Vox.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Now this was on for years, this guy singling you out over and over and over again. When was enough, enough and why do you decide to finally take some action.</p><p>MAZA: Well, it happened for about two and a half years, basically since I started making my web show. And then about two years in, I was out shopping for a lamp with my mom and I got doxxed, which means one of his supporters found my phone number and just bombarded my phone with tech messages from different phone numbers all at once. And I had to alert our security team that someone had my number.</p><p>I started personally flagging to YouTube that this was happening and asking them to enforce their policy and got zero response. And then a couple weeks ago it happened again where he made another video, making fun of me for being gay and Hispanic.</p><p>And I just been frustrated that -- it felt like nothing I had done was working. And so I was on my couch by myself, and I just said, I think I'm done and edited altogether and tweeted about -- not about what he had been doing, because there are always going to be jerks like him.</p><p>[19:35:00] But about how YouTube was about to start \"Pride Month\" and \"Rock the Rainbow Colors\" and claimed to care about LGBT people. And they were helping this guy build an audience base of 4 million subscribers whose only real content was making fun of me for being queer and Hispanic.</p><p>JONES: YouTube kind of did this thing, well, they said well we're going to leave it up, but he can't make money off of it. Is that a good decision, a bad decision? What do you think about their decision?</p><p>MAZA: No the people who make this content aren't using YouTube for ad revenue, that's not how they make their living. They make their living by using YouTube's technology to find people who will be drawn to them.</p><p>YouTube will find people who are attracted to bigotry and attracted to hate speech, recommend those videos to them and then build this huge audience that you do can profit off of.</p><p>And then these bad actors when they get demonetized say, \"YouTube is discriminating against me. I'm a victim. I'm a martyr, please buy my merch. Go to my Patreon and donate\". And so they make millions of dollars by claiming that they're a victim.</p><p>JONES: Well I want to give people on the other side of thing a chance to be heard. Obviously, Steven Crowder, sees it very differently and the CEO of YouTube sees it differently. Let's hear from them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CROWDER: Make no mistake. This isn't about me versus some guy at Vox, OK. This is an example of a giant corporate media entity trying to silence voices that they don't like.</p><p>WOJCICKI: It's just that from a policy standpoint we need to be consistent, because if we -- look, if we took down that content, there would be so many other -- so much other content that we would need to take down.</p><p>And we are not -- we don't want it just being kneejerk. We need to think about in a very thoughtful way, be able to speak with everyone. We'll speak to people from the LGBTQ community, make sure that we're incorporating that going forward in terms of how we think about harassment, and then make sure that we are implementing that in a fair and consistent way going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: You were at the start of this whole thing with social media technology. I was at an adequate answer from your point of view. Do these companies get it or how do you see it?</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ELEVATION PARTNERS: The answer is no. That is completely hopeless and it is utter nonsense.</p><p>JONES: Why do you say?</p><p>MCNAMEE: So think about this. They're trying to position this as an issue of freedom of speech, and Renee DiResta, the great researcher has made the point that no, no, this is about freedom of reach. This is about the amplification of the most hostile voices. That the business model of YouTube, the business model of Facebook and Instagram and many other the online products are based on capturing our attention and keeping us active on the site.</p><p>And sadly, the best way to do that is to appeal to the most base human instincts, things like fear and outrage. So hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories are the catnip for the business models of these companies.</p><p>MAZA: Can I say that, YouTube's argument is essentially that if you ban people from saying things -- like this this guy called me \"Lispy Queer\" over many years. That if you banned the word queer then you would have to ban gay content producers who identify as queer, which is, only an argument, if you don't have a brain. And YouTube knows it's not a real argument, because YouTube knows that hate speech is very engaging. Bullies always dominate the playground.</p><p>JONES: Aren't you on a slippery slope I mean do we really want the corporation's then deciding who gets to speak, how they get to speak?</p><p>MAZA: Here's the problem with that argument. The alternative to the corporation's doing it, is you have 80 year old white guys in Congress who don't know how to use the internet trying to do it, and that's worse for everybody.</p><p>It is true that any rule has a potential drawback of it getting misused. I don't always trust cops, but I don't make an argument that you should have no laws. I have an argument for why we should keep cops accountable and make aggressive critiques when rule enforcers enforce them poorly, and that's what's happening here.</p><p>JONES: What about what President Trump says and other people say, which is that your definition of hate speech basically means if you're conservative, you're wrong. And that the Conservatives feel like this is really an agenda to silence them. How do you respond to that?</p><p>MAZA: This guy spent two years calling me a \"Lispy Queer\". If your idea of conservative ideology is that you should be able to use hate speech, you should rethink your conservative ideology.</p><p>But no serious person thinks that spending two years harassing someone for being Hispanic and gay is actually conservative thought. What they're trying to do is scare these platforms into being afraid of against enforcing their own rules.</p><p>It bothers me when someone spends two years calling me \"Lispy Queer\" and I have to wake up to an avalanche of homophobic and racist harassment in my inbox every single morning.</p><p>MCNAMEE: And it's not an issue of right and left, Van. This is an issue of right and wrong.</p><p>JONES: Well, listen I appreciate your courage for standing up. Thank you for being here, I want you to stick around Mr. McNamee. When we come back I want you to hear his story. There is a growing concern about Tech's impact on literally everything -- on democracy, on personal health, on privacy. And now both political parties are calling for antitrust investigations and government intervention. Is that a good thing? What needs to change? We'll talk about when we get back.</p><p>[19:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES: All right. Welcome back to \"The Van Jones Show\". It really feels like a moment of reckoning for Big Tech. I mean, we got President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren coming at you at the same time, you know you got a problem.</p><p>Leaders in both parties are saying that companies like Amazon, a Google's parent company, Alphabet; Facebook; Apple. They all have too much power. They're abusing their influence. And this week the House Judiciary Committee began hearings on the topic.</p><p>And it looks like the Justice Department and the FTC are gearing up for their own investigations with the urging from 43 state attorney generals, all asking the feds to take some kind of action on these tech tycoons over privacy and competition, so many things.</p><p>What does all this mean? Is it good for us? Is it bad for us? We're going to discuss this whole thing with tech investor Roger McNamee. He's the author of Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe. I am glad that you are here.</p><p>Listen, of all these issues that are coming up, I mean there are so many. I have a whole list. You got a market manipulation, privacy concerns, filter bubbles, addiction issues, radicalization online, free speech versus hate speech and more and more and more. What is the biggest concern that you have about where we're going with this Big Tech?</p><p>MCNAMEE: So there's a professor at Harvard named Shoshana Zuboff who has studied Google's business model for 20 years, and has really framed this perfectly.</p><p>[19:45:00] Which is that, Google and Facebook behave as though they believe that democracy is really inefficient and that we should replace it with algorithms that control -- they basically they want to convert our lives into data, everything in our experience, and then just use it to make the world more efficient. I think that is morally wrong.</p><p>JONES: But, listen, in my daily life I don't feel like I have fewer choices. I have like an app for everything. It's like I feel so happy with my little phone. Why are you taking my joy away?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Here's what the issue is, Van, is that they have built a little date of voodoo doll of each and every one of us. They know literally everything that we've ever touched digitally. They have all of that data. So they know everything that we're thinking.</p><p>JONES: What's wrong with that? MCNAMEE: So here's where the issue is. They have perfect information about us. So their customers, who are marketers, know everything what do we. We only know what they choose to tell us.</p><p>So that same data voodoo doll informs the search results, it informs our Facebook and Instagram news feeds. And so we think we're seeing the full range of choices available to us, but we're not. We're only seeing the ones they give.</p><p>And they're in the business of selling certainty. They're not in the business of like targeting us with ads. They're giving these guys, I know that that woman is pregnant and she doesn't know it yet.</p><p>JONES: So your concern is, they are kind of putting these digital breadcrumbs in front of us leading us to the certain direction.</p><p>MCNAMEE: And when you get to the end point, you're living in the matrix. And my point is, you don't want to wait till you're in the matrix before you do something about it. You want to do something about it, the minute you've figured out there's a problem. And now we can see there's a problem.</p><p>JONES: So let's talk about, well, what can be done? Because they're saying they should break up these companies.</p><p>MCNAMEE: There are basically two classes of issues we have to deal with. One of them is the competition issue, which is that -- essentially if you're -- if you want to present something that doesn't harm people, if you want to create a YouTube competitor today, you can't do that, because they block your access to customers. They control the ad networks. So you use antitrust law to do that.</p><p>The other thing you got to do is go after that business model. You have to go after the data voodoo dolls. The question is, why should banks be allowed to sell our financial data? Why should credit card processors be allowed to sell our credit card transaction? Why should Google be allowed to scan e-mail? Why is any of that invasion of our personal space legitimate?</p><p>What I really feel is the essential point is that -- that it's not enough to own your own data. There are certain kinds of data that just shouldn't be commercialized at all. I don't think people should be buying and selling their data. I just think that that results in too many bad outcomes.</p><p>JONES: Well, listen, a lot of tech companies are actually defending themselves. They say that they know they got some issues and they're on it. And they also say they believe in competition. They're open to some regulation, but they're pushing back against calls to break up their companies.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post saying in part, \"By updating the rules for the internet, we can preserve what's best about it, the freedom people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things -- while also protecting society from broader harms. From what I've learned, I believe we need new regulation in four areas: harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability\".</p><p>And other execs are also speaking out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, GOOGLE: I think it's important to make sure that we are also able to create a healthy competitive ecosystem in which other companies are able to emerge and that's the important question. And I think the scrutiny is right, and we will participate constructively in these discussions.</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK: You could break us up, you could break other tech companies up, but you actually don't address the underlying issues people are concerned about. We know at Facebook that we have a real responsibility to do better and to earn back people's trust.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: So what do you say? They say, \"Hey, Van, give us a shot. (CROSSTALK) This is not good.</p><p>MCNAMEE: So, Mark, I really admire him for engaging in a political conversation.</p><p>JONES: And, yes, it's your fault, you invested in Mark. You introduced Mark Zuckerberg, this Sheryl Sandberg, man.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Yes, I know, and that's exactly right. And I'm guilty.</p><p>JONES: Looking good.</p><p>MCNAMEE: So I'm doing my penance now, OK. So here's the thing, with Carlos we were talking about the fact that the business models themselves caused and encourage bad behavior, and we have to solve that problem, that's why --</p><p>JONES: I mean, I think a lot of people are just now learning some of this stuff. In other words --</p><p>MCNAMEE: Exactly.</p><p>JONES: In other words --</p><p>MCNAMEE: It's complicated.</p><p>JONES: Well, you think you you're programming your phone, but really your phone is programming you.</p><p>MCNAMEE: That's right.</p><p>JONES: Because once you like a couple things and swipe on a couple things, that algorithm figures you out and they just start targeting you with stuff that you think is the world, but it's really just their plan. But isn't there some personal responsibility?</p><p>MCNAMEE: We've learned a lot of lessons and we need -- the personal responsibility does matter. But the most important thing people can do now is to talk to people who are running for elective office, and say, \"Hang on, you need to protect me. You need to make sure that my life is not being spied upon by corporations for profit\".</p><p>That people need a sanctuary. They need to know that when they're home, they're actually safe. That Alexa is not listening all the time. My point to you, Van, is a very simple thing. I want to have an open honest conversation.</p><p>[19:50:00] Those clips use us played were not open and honest. Those were their right to defend their position, right. So it's a political argument, they're making a political case, and I'm just saying I'm not going to letting them get away with it.</p><p>And you got a great book that's out that is -- I hope everybody will check out is called, Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe. It's available now. It's with -- this conversation is just getting started. I'm so glad you've been a part of it.</p><p>Speaking of social media, why are so many social media accounts going blue this week? There's a very important reason. It's not getting enough attention. I'm going to explain that to you when we get back.</p><p>JONES: Welcome back now. You may see some people on social media making their profiles blue this weekend in solidarity with Sudan, and I want to take a moment to shed a light on an international human tragedy that's really gone under the radar screen for way too many people.</p><p>More than a 100 people have been killed so far this month in Sudan -- hundreds more been wounded and there's fear that the violence is just getting started. Now what makes this all even more heartbreaking is that it comes after decades of oppression, civil war and dictatorship. Sudan, finally was starting to see some real hope earlier this year.</p><p>[19:55:00] In April, citizens, led by women, rose up and they ousted a terrible 30-year dictator, a man who slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people. He is accused of genocide and war crimes in Darfur, so there was all this joy, people dancing in the streets, hoping that democracy was on the horizon.</p><p>But instead, the military in Sudan took control of the country, supposedly temporarily, agreeing to a three-year transition. People there are saying, look, we want elections now. They want democracy. And so they had nation-wide demonstrations. And for that the military is now gunning down peaceful protestors.</p><p>Activists say that at least 118 people were killed at a sit-in this month and there are reports of rape and other kinds of violence against the demonstrators. The UN says that the situation is sliding into a human rights abyss, all because people want to vote.</p><p>Now you think about that. People are being shot and killed just so they can have a chance to cast a ballot. It is a good reminder for all of us not to take our country and our right to vote in free and fair elections for granted, and why all of us should fight to preserve them from anyone who would try to undermine them.</p><p>All right. Now my season finale for my other show, \"The Redemption Project\", it airs tomorrow at 9 p.m. on CNN. Please check it out, it's amazing. I'm Van Jones. This is \"The Van Jones Show\" peace and love for one another.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019061501CNV70</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC7-FGV1-JB20-G1TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7080\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 15, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Ilhan Omar</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jan Schakowsky</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Anti-Semitic</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Palestine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Big Tech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Roger McNamee</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Carlos Maza</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sudan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Civilian Protests</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Composition</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM4NkI4M0M2OUEzNDY3M0E1RjhFMDM5RUNBODAxMkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIwQjUyMTIwMkE5NDc3Qjk5ODQyMUI1OThGMzk2OTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISM &amp;

The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner.</p><p>Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options.</p><p>On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Michigan, plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons their Facebook page, and their website lists faux edgy flavors.</p><p>But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\"</p><p>The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval which its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse.</p><p>Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, New York. \"After the mom-and-pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria.</p><p>Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said.</p><p>Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated items as tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transport challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the U.S., according to figures from the book American Breweries II provided by the Brewers Association.</p><p>But the rise of lager-syle beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers. In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained.</p><p>\"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association. \"The companies that survived were the ones that were able to rapidly shift markets and weather the storm.\" He pointed that, Yuengling, for example, entered the ice cream business during the lean years.</p><p>Those bigger players swung back into the industry when prohibition lifted, because they were positioned to navigate costly state and local regulations that proliferated in the wake of repeal. It consolidated their advantage. By 1978, there were just 89 brewers in the country.</p><p>In that same year, regulations finally eased. President Jimmy Carter signed a bill that legalized home-brewing. In the years that followed, states relaxed their brewpub bans, Watson said. There were more than 1,500 U.S. breweries by the year 2000, and by 2018 there were 7,450.</p><p>There's an important caveat, however. A few enormous corporations still sell six out of every seven U.S. beers, leaving about 7,447 craft brewers to split  14% of the market.</p><p>\"These regulatory decisions that were made a long time ago have very long historical trajectories,\" Watson said.</p><p>Brown said that age restrictions and better enforcement could keep flavored vape juices out of kids' hands without threatening his  livelihood.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPRESS-VA0102943221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPRESS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4N-9YP1-JBM5-R52M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173096</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1074\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Press, Inc.

But in the data, they're something else: a miraculous small-business success story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mom-and-pop vape shops are the fastest-growing retail segment of the past decade, as well as the one with the highest share of employees at small businesses. But a government ban on flavored vapes and increased regulation could wipe them out and leave an opening for Big Tobacco and big tech to dominate the fast-growing industry.</p><p>Tobacconists - the broader category that includes vape shops - have lapped every other retail segment since 2009 thanks to an explosion of tiny businesses, Labor Department data show.</p><p>Two thirds of vape-shop workers are employed by the 93 percent of businesses with fewer than 10 employees - a higher rate than for any other retail segment.</p><p>Yelp's vast databases, which allow us to break out segments not yet tracked by the government, agree. Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing retail segment of the 70 largest tracked by Yelp. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state.</p><p>The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping-related, has killed at least seven people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net.</p><p>In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis> The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner.</p><p>Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options.</p><p>On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Mich., plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons its Facebook page, and its website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet, tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine).</p><p>But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\"</p><p>The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. </p><p>In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval which its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse.</p><p>Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, N.Y. \"After the mom-and-pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria.</p><p>Juul declined to comment. </p><p>Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said.</p><p>Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated itemsas tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transport challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the United States, according to figures from the book American Breweries II provided by the Brewers Association.</p><p>But the rise of lager-style beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers.</p><p>In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained.</p><p>\"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association.   </p><p>Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  </p><p>But while adult smokers seem to have benefited from the vaping boom, officials point to a worrying spike in teen use. A 2018 survey found 37.3 percent of high school seniors had vaped at some point in the prior year, up from 27.8 percent in 2017. Only 3.6 percent of them reported smoking cigarettes daily.</p><p>Brown said age restrictions and better enforcement could keep flavored vape juices out of kids' hands without threatening his mission and livelihood.</p><p>\"I know the governor is worried about kids.\" Brown said. \"What about my kids? I've got two kids at home. I'm going to lose my job if they ban flavored vape juice.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:andrew.vandam@washpost.com\">andrew.vandam@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-fd81e026de3c11e9b199f638bf2c340f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X44-VR01-JCDY-T1D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><timeReceived>GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 128 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0029: Unparseable date: \"0029\"EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 24, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002FVJ</classCode><className>IRON MOUNTAIN INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS561990 ALL OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

But in the data, they're something else: a miraculous small-business success story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mom-and-pop vape shops are the fastest-growing retail segment of the past decade, as well as the one with the highest share of employees at small businesses. But a government ban on flavored vapes and increased regulation could wipe them out and leave an opening for Big Tobacco and big tech to dominate the fast-growing industry.</p><p>Tobacconists - the broader category that includes vape shops - have lapped every other retail segment since 2009 thanks to an explosion of tiny businesses, Labor Department data show.</p><p>Two thirds of vape-shop workers are employed by the 93 percent of businesses with fewer than 10 employees - a higher rate than for any other retail segment.</p><p>Yelp's vast databases, which allow us to break out segments not yet tracked by the government, agree. Since the end of 2012, vape shops have been the fastest-growing retail segment of the 70 largest tracked by Yelp. The shops are concentrated in the West and South, Yelp data show, with Nevada and Oklahoma competing for the title of vapingest state.</p><p>The entire industry has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as an unidentified lung illness, thought to be vaping-related, has killed at least seven people and sickened more than 500. Investigators have focused on black-market products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, but they are casting a wide net.</p><p>In response to alarm over those mystery illnesses, as well as to broader concerns about vaping's growing appeal to high school students, the Trump administration has announced plans to ban all flavored vaping liquids, or juices .  The federal ban may not kick in for months, but the governors of two large states - Michigan and New York - have announced similar bans. Those will hit much sooner.</p><p>Vape shops in those states are reeling. Customers are racing to stock up on flavored liquids while store owners and employees ponder an uncertain future. Vape juice refills, which e-cigarettes heat to the point of vaporization, make up the bulk of these shops' businesses, multiple managers said - and their adult customers overwhelmingly prefer flavored options.</p><p>On the surface, Da Vape Escape in Iron Mountain, Mich., plays to stereotype. Goofy head-shop-meets-heavy-metal imagery festoons its Facebook page, and its website lists faux edgy flavors such as Alien Piss (blue raspberry lemonade) and Your Mom (sweet, tangy strawberry yogurt topped with nectarine).</p><p>But in this town of about 7,000 residents on the Upper Peninsula, they are a pillar of the community, manager Ryan Brown said. They contribute to local events and even helped rehabilitate the disc golf course. The flavored-juice ban, though, could yank that pillar right out. \"It's going to affect our town,\" he said. \"They rely on mom-and-pop stores to keep these mining towns going when the mines are gone. Imagine how much tax revenue they're going to lose.\"</p><p>The impending flavored-juice bans are just the first major hurdle facing the country's thousands upon thousands of mom-and-pop vape shops. </p><p>In May of next year, the FDA will require approval for vape liquids already on the market, an approval which its site says could cost between $117,000 and $466,000. The date has been moved several times by FDA officials and a court ruling, but vape-shop employees still know it by heart - they say it will mark the vape-pocalypse.</p><p>Most agree regulation is necessary, but expensive barriers like these will tilt the balance of the industry toward the big-money players, said Travis Pritchard, manager at Vaporz in Whitesboro, N.Y. \"After the mom-and-pop stores are essentially flushed out of New York, the only devices you'll find are Juuls,\" he said. Juul, a svelte device available in many convenience stores and bodegas, is based in San Francisco. Its largest investor is Marlboro maker Altria.</p><p>Juul declined to comment. </p><p>Rules that make running a vape shop more expensive will accelerate a classic cycle in which a few major players muscle out their small-business competition as an industry matures, Notre Dame economist Benjamin Pugsley said. \"When you have regulations that are increasing the entry cost of any particular industry, that tends to favor the large incumbents,\" he said.</p><p>Vape shops already previewed the process once, in August 2016, when the FDA began regulating e-cigarettes and associated itemsas tobacco products. The change coincided with a sharp drop in vape-shop employment. The industry later resumed its growth, albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>Hints of vaping's future may be seen in beer's past. In 1873, when transport challenges limited competition and regulation was light, there were more than 4,000 breweries in the United States, according to figures from the book American Breweries II provided by the Brewers Association.</p><p>But the rise of lager-style beers, railroads and refrigeration, combined with expensive technological advancements such as pasteurization and bottling, squeezed out smaller brewers.</p><p>In 1920, Prohibition dealt a death blow to many of the operations that remained.</p><p>\"Smaller-scale producers are less likely to be diversified, less likely to have capital reserves, less likely to be able to use influence to move into other markets or find exceptions,\" said Bart Watson, chief economist at the Brewers Association.</p><p>Vape-shop managers like Pritchard and Brown say they got into the industry to help people stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>But while adult smokers seem to have benefited from the vaping boom, officials point to a worrying spike in teen use. A 2018 survey found 37.3 percent of high school seniors had vaped at some point in the prior year, up from 27.8 percent in 2017. Only 3.6 percent of them reported smoking cigarettes daily.</p><p>Brown said age restrictions and better enforcement could keep flavored vape juices out of kids' hands without threatening his mission and livelihood.</p><p>\"I know the governor is worried about kids.\" Brown said. \"What about my kids? I've got two kids at home. I'm going to lose my job if they ban flavored vape juice.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:andrew.vandam@washpost.com\">andrew.vandam@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-fd81e026-de3c-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X45-0H71-DXXY-3224-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 24, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002FVJ</classCode><className>IRON MOUNTAIN INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS561990 ALL OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

For the first 20 marketplaces, the onboarding process has already been completed and the conditions required for further growth in 2019 have now been fulfilled. \"With total assets of almost 700 million euros we may be one of the smaller banks. In future, however, assessing the attractiveness and viability of a financial company will be reflected in other parameters. All regulatory requirements must of course be met, and with a Tier 1 capital ratio of around 15 percent, we have built a rock-solid capital base. But the race for market share will be determined by how well the services and products on offer fit the necessities of customers as well as how user-friendly and how easily accessible they are,\" says Dr. Bernhard Fuhrmann, Member of the bank's Board of Managing Directors. He says this with reference to both the value and the role of start-ups in the financial ecosystem. Over the past few months, the bank has laid out its strategic direction and, together with its shareholders and business partners, defined how it intends to position itself in the changing financial sector. The outcome is clear: to be a partner of Fintechs, and of lending platforms in particular. To put this plan into practice, the capital increase undertaken this summer has ensured a significant increase in business volume and further strengthened the company's growth prospects for 2019. \"In terms of competition, transparency and availability, large marketplaces have almost all the advantages on their side, in real life and online. They are the ideal framework for a meaningful cooperation between smart Fintech solutions and established banking expertise and are also a key element in the renewal of the financial sector,\" says Fuhrmann, explaining the new strategy, whilst also implying that he does not want to cede this area entirely to the big tech players. The synergies of industry-internal approaches are obvious: banks bring regulatory expertise and financial resources to the table and, as licence partners, can get business models, which are optimised in theory, up and running in real terms. Fintechs have a near infinite creative ability to rethink financial services from a customer perspective, set a decent pace and, without any IT legacy burden, are streets ahead technologically.Significantly expanding the Marketplace Banking business  Fuhrmann is together with his fellow board member Frank Otten the driving force behind the bank's change of course. The Marketplace Banking business area, a team of some 20 members, is now dedicated to the screening of loan platforms, due diligence as well as all aspects of relationship management. \"To help us decide which platforms we can collaborate with, we have developed our own assessment model. In this process, we benefit from our prior engagement with the lending sector which began in 2013,\" says Otten, explaining how his company deals with the fact that there are no consistent standards for assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers or the risk of credit default within Europe. The bank's well-thought-out approach is proving successful - 20 marketplaces are already ongoing partners of Varengold. Each onboarding process is designed individually and the team actively and directly participates from an early stage of a platform's formation. In 2017, around 3.8 billion euros of credit were brokered through platforms throughout Europe. Given the spread of digital financial solutions and the implementation of the PSD2 guideline, which is conducive to the expansion of marketplaces, Varengold Bank expects this volume to triple by 2022. \"The PSD2 guideline is a good example of how the intelligent and secure use of data can enhance the performance of new technologies while at the same time greatly simplifying the process,\" says Otten, who recently represented the bank and its new focus as a panellist at the LendIt conference in London.Modernisation in a decent way  \"We tend to prefer to just do our job and not talk too much about it. But we want to be more visible in the market, and so we decided to communicate more actively,\" says Otten, describing the changed and more offensive market presence. The new website recently went online. \"For us, putting the focus on customers means clearly presenting what we offer and being easily accessible in our collaborations. The faces you see in the video are the same faces you will see in the personal conversations.\" In addition to the new digital presence, the branch in Sofia, Bulgaria was inaugurated at the end of November. The choice of location confirms the potential that Varengold sees in Southern and Eastern Europe.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"608\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><tbody><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col2\" namest=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">About Varengold Bank AG</entry></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col2\" namest=\"col1\" valign=\"top\">Varengold Bank AG is a German bank founded in 1995, which acquired its full banking licence in 2013.

For the first 20 marketplaces, the onboarding process has already been completed and the conditions required for further growth in 2019 have now been fulfilled.  \"With total assets of almost 700 million euros we may be one of the smaller banks. In future, however, assessing the attractiveness and viability of a financial company will be reflected in other parameters. </p><p>All regulatory requirements must of course be met, and with a Tier 1 capital ratio of around 15 percent, we have built a rock-solid capital base. But the race for market share will be determined by how well the services and products on offer fit the necessities of customers as well as how user-friendly and how easily accessible they are,\" says Dr. Bernhard Fuhrmann, Member of the bank's Board of Managing Directors. He says this with reference to both the value and the role of start-ups in the financial ecosystem.  Over the past few months, the bank has laid out its strategic direction and, together with its shareholders and business partners, defined how it intends to position itself in the changing financial sector. The outcome is clear: to be a partner of Fintechs, and of lending platforms in particular. To put this plan into practice, the capital increase undertaken this summer has ensured a significant increase in business volume and further strengthened the company's growth prospects for 2019.  \"In terms of competition, transparency and availability, large marketplaces have almost all the advantages on their side, in real life and online. They are the ideal framework for a meaningful cooperation between smart Fintech solutions and established banking expertise and are also a key element in the renewal of the financial sector,\" says Fuhrmann, explaining the new strategy, whilst also implying that he does not want to cede this area entirely to the big tech players. The synergies of industry-internal approaches are obvious: banks bring regulatory expertise and financial resources to the table and, as licence partners, can get business models, which are optimised in theory, up and running in real terms. Fintechs have a near infinite creative ability to rethink financial services from a customer perspective, set a decent pace and, without any IT legacy burden, are streets ahead technologically.  Significantly expanding the Marketplace Banking business  Fuhrmann is together with his fellow board member Frank Otten the driving force behind the bank's change of course. The Marketplace Banking business area, a team of some 20 members, is now dedicated to the screening of loan platforms, due diligence as well as all aspects of relationship management. \"To help us decide which platforms we can collaborate with, we have developed our own assessment model. In this process, we benefit from our prior engagement with the lending sector which began in 2013,\" says Otten, explaining how his company deals with the fact that there are no consistent standards for assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers or the risk of credit default within Europe.  The bank's well-thought-out approach is proving successful - 20 marketplaces are already ongoing partners of Varengold. Each onboarding process is designed individually and the team actively and directly participates from an early stage of a platform's formation.  In 2017, around 3.8 billion euros of credit were brokered through platforms throughout Europe. Given the spread of digital financial solutions and the implementation of the PSD2 guideline, which is conducive to the expansion of marketplaces, Varengold Bank expects this volume to triple by 2022. \"The PSD2 guideline is a good example of how the intelligent and secure use of data can enhance the performance of new technologies while at the same time greatly simplifying the process,\" says Otten, who recently represented the bank and its new focus as a panellist at the LendIt conference in London. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN698065620181219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0P-76H1-DXCW-D3XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 19, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

For the first 20 marketplaces, the onboarding process has already been completed and the conditions required for further growth in 2019 have now been fulfilled.   \"With total assets of almost 700 million euros we may be one of the smaller banks.

Over the past few months, the bank has laid out its strategic direction and, together with its shareholders and business partners, defined how it intends to position itself in the changing financial sector. The outcome is clear: to be a partner of Fintechs, and of lending platforms in particular. To put this plan into practice, the capital increase undertaken this summer has ensured a significant increase in business volume and further strengthened the company's growth prospects for 2019.  \"In terms of competition, transparency and availability, large marketplaces have almost all the advantages on their side, in real life and online.

The synergies of industry-internal approaches are obvious: banks bring regulatory expertise and financial resources to the table and, as licence partners, can get business models, which are optimised in theory, up and running in real terms.

Significantly expanding the Marketplace Banking business  Fuhrmann is together with his fellow board member Frank Otten the driving force behind the bank's change of course. The Marketplace Banking business area, a team of some 20 members, is now dedicated to the screening of loan platforms, due diligence as well as all aspects of relationship management. \"To help us decide which platforms we can collaborate with, we have developed our own assessment model. In this process, we benefit from our prior engagement with the lending sector which began in 2013,\" says Otten, explaining how his company deals with the fact that there are no consistent standards for assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers or the risk of credit default within Europe.  The bank's well-thought-out approach is proving successful - 20 marketplaces are already ongoing partners of Varengold. Each onboarding process is designed individually and the team actively and directly participates from an early stage of a platform's formation.  In 2017, around 3.8 billion euros of credit were brokered through platforms throughout Europe. Given the spread of digital financial solutions and the implementation of the PSD2 guideline, which is conducive to the expansion of marketplaces, Varengold Bank expects this volume to triple by 2022. \"The PSD2 guideline is a good example of how the intelligent and secure use of data can enhance the performance of new technologies while at the same time greatly simplifying the process,\" says Otten, who recently represented the bank and its new focus as a panellist at the LendIt conference in London.

For the first 20 marketplaces, the onboarding process has already been completed<br/> and the conditions required for further growth in 2019 have now been fulfilled.</p><p>\"With total assets of almost 700 million euros we may be one of the smaller banks. In future,<br/> however, assessing the attractiveness and viability of a financial company will be reflected<br/> in other parameters. All regulatory requirements must of course be met, and with a Tier 1<br/> capital ratio of around 15 percent, we have built a rock-solid capital base. But the race<br/> for market share will be determined by how well the services and products on offer fit the<br/> necessities of customers as well as how user-friendly and how easily accessible they are,\"<br/> says Dr. Bernhard Fuhrmann, Member of the bank's Board of Managing Directors. He says this<br/> with reference to both the value and the role of start-ups in the financial ecosystem.<br/> Over the past few months, the bank has laid out its strategic direction and, together with<br/> its shareholders and business partners, defined how it intends to position itself in the changing<br/> financial sector. The outcome is clear: to be a partner of Fintechs, and of lending platforms<br/> in particular. To put this plan into practice, the capital increase undertaken this summer<br/> has ensured a significant increase in business volume and further strengthened the company's<br/> growth prospects for 2019.<br/> \"In terms of competition, transparency and availability, large marketplaces have almost all<br/> the advantages on their side, in real life and online. They are the ideal framework for a<br/> meaningful cooperation between smart Fintech solutions and established banking expertise and<br/> are also a key element in the renewal of the financial sector,\" says Fuhrmann, explaining<br/> the new strategy, whilst also implying that he does not want to cede this area entirely to<br/> the big tech players. The synergies of industry-internal approaches are obvious: banks bring<br/> regulatory expertise and financial resources to the table and, as licence partners, can get<br/> business models, which are optimised in theory, up and running in real terms. Fintechs have<br/> a near infinite creative ability to rethink financial services from a customer perspective,<br/> set a decent pace and, without any IT legacy burden, are streets ahead technologically.</p><p>Significantly expanding the Marketplace Banking business<br/> Fuhrmann is together with his fellow board member Frank Otten the driving force behind the<br/> bank's change of course. The Marketplace Banking business area, a team of some 20 members,<br/> is now dedicated to the screening of loan platforms, due diligence as well as all aspects<br/> of relationship management. \"To help us decide which platforms we can collaborate with, we<br/> have developed our own assessment model. In this process, we benefit from our prior engagement<br/> with the lending sector which began in 2013,\" says Otten, explaining how his company deals<br/> with the fact that there are no consistent standards for assessing the creditworthiness of<br/> borrowers or the risk of credit default within Europe.<br/> The bank's well-thought-out approach is proving successful - 20 marketplaces are already ongoing<br/> partners of Varengold. Each onboarding process is designed individually and the team actively<br/> and directly participates from an early stage of a platform's formation.<br/> In 2017, around 3.8 billion euros of credit were brokered through platforms throughout Europe.<br/> Given the spread of digital financial solutions and the implementation of the PSD2 guideline,<br/> which is conducive to the expansion of marketplaces, Varengold Bank expects this volume to<br/> triple by 2022. \"The PSD2 guideline is a good example of how the intelligent and secure use<br/> of data can enhance the performance of new technologies while at the same time greatly simplifying<br/> the process,\" says Otten, who recently represented the bank and its new focus as a panellist<br/> at the LendIt conference in London.</p><p>Modernisation in a decent way<br/> \"We tend to prefer to just do our job and not talk too much about it. But we want to be more<br/> visible in the market, and so we decided to communicate more actively,\" says Otten, describing<br/> the changed and more offensive market presence. The new website recently went online. \"For<br/> us, putting the focus on customers means clearly presenting what we offer and being easily<br/> accessible in our collaborations. The faces you see in the video are the same faces you will<br/> see in the personal conversations.\" In addition to the new digital presence, the branch in<br/> Sofia, Bulgaria was inaugurated at the end of November. The choice of location confirms the<br/> potential that Varengold sees in Southern and Eastern Europe.<br/> About Varengold Bank AG<br/>Varengold Bank AG is a German bank founded in 1995, which acquired its full banking<br/> licence<br/> in 2013.

Between them, the so-called 'FAANG' stocks - Facebook (US:FB), Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - and their colossal peers span industries from social media, to online retail, to subscription-based TV. And the sector is only becoming larger and more multifaceted as new players enter the fray. Disney's (US:DIS) plan to launch its own streaming platform offers a case in point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such variety creates a plethora of opportunities for those seeking to buy into big tech. But it also makes for a complex investment universe.

However, further disruption may now be kept in check amidst heightened regulatory scrutiny. While Facebook has endured headline-grabbing privacy issues, Alphabet - Google's parent entity - was fined (EURO)50m (\u00a343m) in France in January 2019 under the European Union's new data protection rules (GDPR). The search-engine giant has, additionally, been penalised by the EU for breaching antitrust regulations. And in April 2019, the UK government issued its Online Harms white paper - proposing \"ambitious plans for a system of accountability and oversight for tech companies, moving far beyond self-regulation\".</p><p>                     Slowing down?                   </p><p>We have also seen hints of slower growth in certain markets - something brought to the fore by Apple's shock first-quarter revenue warning. The group cited lower-than-expected iPhone sales, \"economic deceleration\" in China and fewer iPhone upgrades than it had anticipated.</p><p>                     Promising themes                   </p><p>Notwithstanding its challenges, Big Tech still constitutes very positive trends in younger, rapidly-developing markets - as exemplified by Apple's services offering, which enjoyed record revenues of $10.9bn (\u00a38.4bn) for the three months to December 2018 (up by 19 per cent year on year).

But there will also be a foreign exchange charge on trades, and - even if the shares are held in an individual savings account (Isa) - they won't necessarily have the same tax benefits.</p><p>                     Diversification                   </p><p>Funds and trusts can offer greater diversification than straight-up share ownership. The level of diversification does, of course, depend on multiple factors.</p><p>By way of illustration, Baillie Gifford's Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (SMT) - a global equity fund - invests in multiple sectors, but has a high allocation to technology. Amazon, Netflix and e-commerce specialist Alibaba (US:BABA) sat among its top 10 constituents as at 31 March 2019. And its annual share price performance to the same date came in at 16.5 per cent, against the benchmark's 10.7 per cent. That said, as the standard warning goes, past performance is by no means a guide to future performance.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Polar Capital Technology Trust (PCT)*, managed by Ben Rogoff, \"aims to maximise long-term capital growth through investing in a diversified portfolio of technology companies around the world\". The fund's cumulative share price performance sat below its benchmark on a one-year basis as at March, but outperformed over two and five years. The Allianz Technology Trust (ATT)*, run by Walter Price, constitutes another tech-focused strategy. It has outpaced its benchmark over one, three and five years.</p><p>Beyond diversification, funds and fund-like vehicles can enable investors to gain exposure to the more encouraging, faster-growing parts of big tech companies indirectly, through ownership of other stocks.</p><p>For example, Microsoft's (US:MSFT) 'Azure' cloud-computing division is arguably its most exciting and high-potential offering. And fund manager Jeremy Gleeson notes that the AXA Framlington Global Technology Fund (GB00B4W52V57) has been able to access this business without owning Microsoft in its entirety.</p><p>The fund's holdings include Arista Networks (US:ANET) - a provider of cloud-networking software, which supplies equipment to Microsoft for Azure. It also has shares in Proofpoint (US:PFPT) and Mimecast (US:MIME), both of which are helping to secure Microsoft's 'Outlook 365' cloud-based email customers against cyber threats.</p><p>Another holding, Red Hat (US:RHT), is the world's leading provider of enterprise open-source software solutions, and is benefiting from companies coming off their own data centres and moving onto the cloud - whether that's Microsoft's platform, or other peers'. That said, IBM (US:IBM) announced its acquisition of Red Hat last October, in a deal valuing the latter at around $34bn. This is expected to complete in the second half of 2019.</p><p>                     UK plays                   </p><p>Some might prefer to invest in UK-listed companies that have exposure to, or that could benefit from, positive trends in US big tech. The content market comprises one such arena.</p><p>Netflix's first-quarter numbers - released earlier this month - offered encouraging glimmers. The streaming giant enjoyed record paid net adds (new subscribers) of 9.6m, up 16 per cent. But it also guided towards an 8 per cent decline in year-on-year net adds in the second quarter, coming in at 5m.</p><p>On top of this, would-be shareholders may balk at the prospect of intensifying competition. Aside from Disney, Apple has also announced its own subscription video platform - although, in fairness, Netflix said it was \"excited to compete\" with both, and that it didn't expect these to \"materially affect\" its expansion, partly because of their different offerings.</p><p>In any case, those yet to be convinced could look elsewhere. Netflix itself noted that \"the clear beneficiaries will be content creators and consumers who will reap the rewards of many companies vying to provide a great video experience for audiences\". And that's where IC buy tip Entertainment One (ETO) - whose content library stood at $2bn at last count - could reap rewards. As more streaming channels emerge, the group's transition away from third-party distribution and towards production should stand it in good stead.</p><p>                     Favourites                   </p><p>IC buy tip Microsoft's third-quarter results are out on 24 April (as we go to press), and its Azure business is likely to garner particular attention. Azure's revenues grew by 76 per cent in the second quarter, although this was the same rate as the prior three months. Broker RBC Capital Markets cites tough growth comparatives and moderating corporate IT spending among the cyclical factors for investors to be aware of. True, the shares trade at a not inexpensive 29 times forecast earnings (based on a share price of $124 and JPMorgan's EPS estimate of $4.33 for 2019). But, for now, we remain positive. We also believe Entertainment One retains takeover appeal in a growing online streaming market. Full-year results are due in May.</p><p>                     Outsiders                   </p><p>At its keynote event in March 2019, Apple announced various launches including that of its Apple TV+ streaming platform, and its \"new kind of credit card\" - proving its ability to enter or extend its reach in non-traditional markets. The next quarterly numbers are due out on 30 April. While iPhone sales declined by 15 per cent in the first quarter, the pressure is on - but with investors braced for a less-than-exhilarating performance here, there's scope to exceed expectations. The shares currently trade at 18 times JPMorgan's estimates; not too demanding - but in the circumstances, we remain neutral. </p><p>                     *IC Top 100 Fund                   </p><p>                     Big tech drives sectoral changes                   </p><p>The line between telecoms, media and internet companies has become so blurred that US indices providers opted to switch up their sector classifications last year. Indeed, S&amp;PDow Jones and MSCI introduced changes to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) structure in 2018 - entailing the migration of certain tech-orientated companies out of their existing categories, and the establishment of a new sector - 'Communications Services'.</p><p>Back in November 2017, the index organisations explained that: \"The last several years have seen an evolution in the way we communicate and access entertainment content and other information. This evolution is a result of integration between telecommunications, media, and internet companies\" - a move accelerated by M&amp;A activity. Many companies \"now offer bundled services such as cable, internet services, and telephone services\".</p><p>The new communications services sector includes companies that \"facilitate communication and offer related content and information through various media\". Members include Comcast (US:CMCSA) and Netflix - both previous constituents of the consumer discretionary club - along with companies previously classified under information technology, including Alphabet and Facebook. Apple stayed put in the IT bracket.</p><p>To all intents and purposes, in an increasingly digital world, it is becoming harder to define exactly what constitutes a tech company. It doesn't seem beyond the realms of possibility that index-providers will see the need to create more sectors over time - with a view to accommodating larger and even more convoluted tech giants. That is, unless regulators see fit to start breaking such companies up. </p><p>As the FAANGs and co offer up their latest quarterly numbers in the coming days and weeks, investors will be able to weigh up whether to buy directly into these stocks, to buy indirectly via so-called 'pick and shovel' plays, or to steer clear of them altogether. To the last point, some may also opt to avoid, or reconsider, their indirect exposure to the slower-growing or more vulnerable areas of big tech. Apple's disappointing numbers in January - and the reasoning behind them, including China's economic slowdown - knocked not only its own shares, but also those in chipmaker suppliers and certain luxury-goods companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-52967880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYS-BTR1-F021-62NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1883\"/><timeReceived>11:04 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Between them, the so-called 'FAANG' stocks - Facebook (US:FB), Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - and their colossal peers span industries from social media, to online retail, to subscription-based TV. And the sector is only becoming larger and more multifaceted as new players enter the fray. Disney's (US:DIS) plan to launch its own streaming platform offers a case in point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such variety creates a plethora of opportunities for those seeking to buy into big tech. But it also makes for a complex investment universe. And that's before considering the intensifying political, social, economic and internal pressures facing these companies today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     Greater scrutiny                   </p><p>America's tech titans made a name for themselves as fast-growing, disruptive innovators. However, further disruption may now be kept in check due to heightened regulatory scrutiny. While Facebook has endured headline-grabbing privacy issues, Alphabet - Google's parent entity - was fined (EURO)50m (\u00a343m) in France in January 2019 under the European Union's new data protection rules (GDPR). The search-engine giant has, additionally, been penalised by the EU for breaching antitrust regulations. And in April 2019, the UK government issued its Online Harms white paper - proposing \"ambitious plans for a system of accountability and oversight for tech companies, moving far beyond self-regulation\".</p><p>                     Slowing down?                   </p><p>We have also seen hints of slower growth in certain markets - something brought to the fore by Apple's shock first-quarter revenue warning. The group cited lower-than-expected iPhone sales, \"economic deceleration\" in China and fewer iPhone upgrades than it had anticipated.</p><p>                     Promising themes                   </p><p>Notwithstanding its challenges, Big Tech still constitutes very positive trends in younger, rapidly-developing markets - as exemplified by Apple's services offering, which enjoyed record revenues of $10.9bn (\u00a38.4bn) for the three months to December 2018 (up by 19 per cent year over year). As another earnings season gets under way, all eyes are likely to be on these more positive themes.</p><p>                     Another earnings season under way                   </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Facebook's first-quarter earnings are due on 24 April 2019 (2pm Pacific Time)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Apple's second-quarter earnings are due 30 April 2019 (2pm PT)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Amazon's first-quarter earnings are due on 25 April 2019 (2:30pm PT)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Netflix reported its first-quarter earnings on 16 April 2019</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Google's (Alphabet's) first-quarter results are due on 29 April 2019 (1:30pm PT)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Microsoft's third-quarter results were due on 24 April 2019 (2pm PT)</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>                     NB: At the time of writing, only Netflix had reported its latest earnings figures                   </p><p>                     Big Tech direct                   </p><p>Some may simply prefer to buy the shares directly - although such an approach is, of course, high risk. To hold US stocks, UK residents must fill in a 'W-8BEN' form.This enables investors to save up to 30 per cent tax on income from their respective shares. But there will also be a foreign-exchange charge on trades, and - even if the shares are held in an individual savings account (Isa) - they won't necessarily have the same tax benefits.</p><p>                     Diversification                   </p><p>Funds and trusts can offer greater diversification than straight-up share ownership. The level of diversification does, of course, depend on multiple factors.</p><p>By way of illustration, Baillie Gifford's Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (SMT) - a global equity fund - invests in multiple sectors, but has a high allocation towards technology. Amazon, Netflix and e-commerce specialist Alibaba (US:BABA) sat among its top 10 constituents as at 31 March 2019. And its annual share price performance to the same date came in at 16.5 per cent, against the benchmark's 10.7 per cent. That said, as the standard warning goes, past performance is by no means a guide to future performance.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Polar Capital Technology Trust (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=PCT:LSE\">PCT</url>)*, managed by Ben Rogoff, \"aims to maximise long-term capital growth through investing in a diversified portfolio of technology companies around the world\". The fund's cumulative share price performance sat below its benchmark on a one-year basis as at March, but outperformed over two and five years. The Allianz Technology Trust (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=PCT:LSE\">ATT</url>)*, run by Walter Price, constitutes another tech-focused strategy. It has outpaced its benchmark over one, three and five years.</p><p>                     Indirect investment                   </p><p>Beyond diversification, funds and fund-like vehicles can enable investors to gain exposure to the more encouraging, faster-growing parts of big tech companies indirectly, through ownership of other stocks.</p><p>For example, Microsoft's (US:MSFT) 'Azure' cloud-computing division is arguably its most exciting and high-potential offering. And fund manager Jeremy Gleeson notes that the AXA Framlington Global Technology Fund (GB00B4W52V57) has been able to access this business without owning Microsoft in its entirety.</p><p>                      Big Tech still constitutes very positive trends in younger, rapidly-developing markets                    </p><p>The fund's holdings include Arista Networks (US:ANET) - a provider of cloud-networking software, which supplies equipment to Microsoft for Azure. It also has shares in Proofpoint (US:PFPT) and Mimecast (US:MIME), both of which are helping to secure Microsoft's 'Outlook 365' cloud-based email customers against cyber threats.</p><p>Another holding, Red Hat (US:RHT), is the world's leading provider of enterprise open-source software solutions, and is benefiting from companies coming off their own data centres and moving onto the cloud - whether that's Microsoft's platform, or other peers'. That said, IBM (US:IBM) announced its acquisition of Red Hat last October, in a deal valuing the latter at around $34bn. This is expected to complete in the second half of 2019.</p><p>                     UK plays                   </p><p>Some might prefer to invest in UK-listed companies that have exposure to, or that could benefit from, positive trends in US big tech. The content market comprises one such arena.</p><p>Netflix's first-quarter numbers - released earlier this month - offered encouraging glimmers. The streaming giant enjoyed record paid net adds (new subscribers) of 9.6m, up 16 per cent. But it also guided towards an 8 per cent decline in year-on-year net adds in the second quarter, coming in at 5m.</p><p>On top of this, would-be shareholders may balk at the prospect of intensifying competition. Aside from Disney, Apple has also announced its own subscription-video platform - although, in fairness, Netflix said it was \"excited to compete\" with both, and that it didn't expect these to \"materially affect\" its expansion, partly because of their different offerings.</p><p>In any case, those yet to be convinced could look elsewhere. Netflix itself noted that \"the clear beneficiaries will be content creators and consumers who will reap the rewards of many companies vying to provide a great video experience for audiences\". And that's where IC buy tip Entertainment One (<url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=PCT:LSE\">ETO</url>) - whose content library stood at $2bn at last count - could reap rewards. As more streaming channels emerge, the group's transition away from third-party distribution and towards production should stand it in good stead.</p><p>                        Favourites: IC buy tip Microsoft's third-quarter results are out on 24 April (as we go to press), and its Azure business is likely to garner particular attention. Azure's revenues grew by 76 per cent in the second quarter, although this was the same rate as the prior three months. Broker RBC Capital Markets cites tough growth comparatives and moderating corporate IT spending among the cyclical factors for investors to be aware of. True, the shares trade at a not inexpensive 29 times forecast earnings (based on a share price of $124 and JPMorgan's EPS estimate of $4.33 for 2019). But, for now, we remain positive. We also believe Entertainment One retains takeover appeal amidst a growing online streaming market. Full-year results are due in May.</p><p>                     Outsiders: At its keynote event in March 2019, Apple announced various launches including that of its Apple TV+ streaming platform, and its \"new kind of credit card\" - proving its ability to enter or extend its reach in non-traditional markets. The next quarterly numbers are due out on 30 April. While iPhone sales declined by 15 per cent in the first quarter, the pressure is on - but with investors braced for a less-than-exhilarating performance here, there's scope to exceed expectations. The shares currently trade at 18 times JPMorgan's estimates; not too demanding - but in the circumstances, we remain neutral. </p><p>                     Big tech drives sectoral changes                   </p><p>The line between telecoms, media and internet companies has become so blurred that US indices providers opted to switch up their sector classifications last year. Indeed, S&amp;PDow Jones and MSCI introduced changes to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) structure in 2018 - entailing the migration of certain tech-orientated companies out of their existing categories, and the establishment of a new sector - 'Communications Services'.</p><p>Back in November 2017, the index organisations explained that: \"The last several years have seen an evolution in the way we communicate and access entertainment content and other information. This evolution is a result of integration between telecommunications, media, and internet companies\" - a move accelerated by M&amp;A activity. Many companies \"now offer bundled services such as cable, internet services, and telephone services\".</p><p>The new communications services sector includes companies that \"facilitate communication and offer related content and information through various media\". Members include Comcast (US:CMCSA) and Netflix - both previous constituents of the consumer discretionary club - along with companies previously classified under information technology, including Alphabet and Facebook. Apple stayed put in the IT bracket.</p><p>To all intents and purposes, in an increasingly digital world, it is becoming harder to define exactly what constitutes a tech company. It doesn't seem beyond the realms of possibility that index-providers will see the need to create more sectors over time - with a view to accommodating larger and even more convoluted tech giants. That is, unless regulators see fit to start breaking such companies up. </p><p>*IC Top 100 Fund</p><p>As the FAANGs and co offer up their latest quarterly numbers in the coming days and weeks, investors will be able to weigh up whether to buy directly into these stocks, to buy indirectly via so-called 'pick and shovel' plays, or to steer clear of them altogether. To the last point, some may also opt to avoid, or reconsider, their indirect exposure to the slower-growing or more vulnerable areas of big tech. Apple's disappointing numbers in January - and the reasoning behind them, including China's economic slowdown - knocked not only its own shares, but also those in chipmaker suppliers and certain luxury-goods companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-52967880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYS-J1C1-F021-64JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1904\"/><timeReceived>11:04 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Between them, the so-called 'FAANG' stocks - Facebook (US:FB), Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - and their colossal peers span industries from social media, to online retail, to subscriptionbased TV. And the sector is only becoming larger and more multifaceted as new players enter the fray. Disney's (US:DIS) plan to launch its own streaming platform offers a case in point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such variety creates a plethora of opportunities for those seeking to buy into big tech. But it also makes for a complex investment universe. And that's before considering the intensifying political, social, economic and internal pressures facing these companies today.</p><p>Greater scrutiny America's tech titans made a name for themselves as fast-growing, disruptive innovators. However, further disruption may now be kept in check due to heightened regulatory scrutiny. While Facebook has endured headline-grabbing privacy issues, Alphabet - Google's parent entity - was fined (EURO)50m (\u00a343m) in France in January 2019 under the European Union's new data protection rules (GDPR). The searchengine giant has, additionally, been penalised by the EU for breaching antitrust regulations. And in April 2019, the UK government issued its Online Harms white paper - proposing \"ambitious plans for a system of accountability and oversight for tech companies, moving far beyond self-regulation\".</p><p>Slowing down? We have also seen hints of slower growth in certain markets - something brought to the fore by Apple's shock first-quarter revenue warning. The group cited lower-than-expected iPhone sales, \"economic deceleration\" in China and fewer iPhone upgrades than it had anticipated.</p><p>Promising themes Notwithstanding its challenges, Big Tech still constitutes very positive trends in younger, rapidly-developing markets - as exemplified by Apple's services offering, which enjoyed record revenues of $10.9bn (\u00a38.4bn) for the three months to December 2018 (up by 19 per cent year on year). As another earnings season gets under way, all eyes are likely to be on these more positive themes.</p><p>Some may simply prefer to buy the shares directly - although such an approach is, of course, high risk. To hold US stocks, UK residents must fill in a 'W-8BEN' form. This enables investors to save up to 30 per cent tax on income from their respective shares. But there will also be a foreign exchange charge on trades, and - even if the shares are held in an individual savings account (Isa) - they won't necessarily have the same tax benefits.</p><p>Funds and trusts can offer greater diversification than straight-up share ownership. The level of diversification does, of course, depend on multiple factors.</p><p>By way of illustration, Baillie Gifford's Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (SMT) - a global equity fund - invests in multiple sectors, but has a high allocation to technology. Amazon, Netflix and e-commerce specialist Alibaba (US:BABA) sat among its top 10 constituents as at 31 March 2019. And its annual share price performance to the same date came in at 16.5 per cent, against the benchmark's 10.7 per cent. That said, as the standard warning goes, past performance is by no means a guide to future performance.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Polar Capital Technology Trust (PCT)*, managed by Ben Rogoff, Another earnings season under way \u00a6 Facebook's first-quarter earnings were due on 24 April 2019 (2pm Pacific Time).</p><p>\u00a6 Apple's second-quarter earnings are due 30 April 2019 (2pm Pacific Time).</p><p>\u00a6 Amazon's first-quarter earnings were due on 25 April 2019 (2:30pm Pacific Time).</p><p>\u00a6 Netflix reported its first-quarter earnings on 16 April 2019.</p><p>\u00a6 Google's (Alphabet's) first-quarter results are due on 29 April 2019 (1:30pm Pacific Time).</p><p>\u00a6 Microsoft's third-quarter results were due on 24 April 2019 (2pm Pacific Time).</p><p>NB: At the time of writing, only Netflix had reported its latest earnings figures \"aims to maximise long-term capital growth through investing in a diversified portfolio of technology companies around the world\". The fund's cumulative share price performance sat below its benchmark on a one-year basis as at March, but outperformed over two and five years. The Allianz Technology Trust (ATT)*, run by Walter Price, constitutes another techfocused strategy. It has outpaced its benchmark over one, three and five years.</p><p>Beyond diversification, funds and fund-like vehicles can enable investors to gain exposure to the more encouraging, faster-growing parts of big tech companies indirectly, through ownership of other stocks.</p><p>For example, Microsoft's (US:MSFT) 'Azure' cloud-computing division is arguably its most exciting and high-potential offering. And fund manager Jeremy Gleeson notes that the AXA Framlington Global Technology Fund (GB00B4W52V57) has been able to access this business without owning Microsoft in its entirety.</p><p>The fund's holdings include Arista Networks (US:ANET) - a provider of cloud-networking software, which supplies equipment to Microsoft for Azure. It also has shares in Proofpoint (US:PFPT) and Mimecast (US:MIME), both of which are helping to secure Microsoft's 'Outlook 365' cloudbased email customers against cyber threats.</p><p>Another holding, Red Hat (US:RHT), is the world's leading provider of enterprise opensource software solutions, and is benefiting from companies coming off their own data centres and moving onto the cloud - whether that's Microsoft's platform, or other peers'. That said, IBM (US:IBM) announced its acquisition of Red Hat last October, in a deal valuing the latter at around $34bn. This is expected to complete in the second half of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.2019.UK\">www.2019.UK</url> plays Some might prefer to invest in UK-listed companies that have exposure to, or that could benefit from, positive trends in US big tech. The content market comprises one such arena.</p><p>Netflix's first-quarter numbers - released earlier this month - offered encouraging glimmers. The streaming giant enjoyed record paid net adds (new subscribers) of 9.6m, up 16 per cent. But it also guided towards an 8 per cent decline in year-on-year net adds in the second quarter, coming in at 5m.</p><p>On top of this, would-be shareholders may balk at the prospect of intensifying competition. Aside from Disney, Apple has also announced its own subscription video platform - although, in fairness, Netflix said it was \"excited to compete\" with both, and that it didn't expect these to \"materially affect\" its expansion, partly because of their different offerings.</p><p>In any case, those yet to be convinced could look elsewhere. Netflix itself noted that \"the clear beneficiaries will be content creators and consumers who will reap the rewards of many companies vying to provide a great video experience for audiences\". And that's where IC buy tip Entertainment One (ETO) - whose content library stood at $2bn at last count - could reap rewards. As more streaming channels emerge, the group's transition away from third-party distribution and towards production should stand it in good stead.</p><p>*IC Top 100 Fund As the FAANGs and co offer up their latest quarterly numbers in the coming days and weeks, investors will be able to weigh up whether to buy directly into these stocks, to buy indirectly via so-called 'pick and shovel' plays, or to steer clear of them altogether. To the last point, some may also opt to avoid, or reconsider, their indirect exposure to the slower-growing or more vulnerable areas of big tech. Apple's disappointing numbers in January - and the reasoning behind them, including China's economic slowdown - knocked not only its own shares, but also those in chipmaker suppliers and certain luxury-goods companies.</p><p>Favourites IC buy tip Microsoft's thirdquarter results are out on 24 April (as we go to press), and its Azure business is likely to garner particular attention. Azure's revenues grew by 76 per cent in the second quarter, although this was the same rate as the prior three months. Broker RBC Capital Markets cites tough growth comparatives and moderating corporate IT spending among the cyclical factors for investors to be aware of. True, the shares trade at a not inexpensive 29 times forecast earnings (based on a share price of $124 and JPMORgan's EPS estimate of $4.33 for 2019). But, for now, we remain positive. We also believe Entertainment One retains takeover appeal in a growing online streaming market. Full-year results are due in May.</p><p>Outsiders At its keynote event in March 2019, Apple announced various launches including that of its Apple TV+ streaming platform, and its \"new kind of credit card\" - proving its ability to enter or extend its reach in non-traditional markets. The next quarterly numbers are due out on 30 April. While iPhone sales declined by 15 per cent in the first quarter, the pressure is on - but with investors braced for a less-thanexhilarating performance here, there's scope to exceed expectations. The shares currently trade at 18 times JPMORGAN's estimates; not too demanding - but in the circumstances, we remain neutral.</p><p>'Big Tech still constitutes very positive trends in younger, rapidlydeveloping  ;

The so-called 'Rome Call for AI Ethics[1]' promises to develop technologies that protect the planet and all its people by honoring six principles: transparency, inclusion, responsibility, impartiality, reliability, and security and privacy. These noble values are already common in corporate AI ethics initiatives,including Microsoft's own[2]. Butcritics argue[3]that these programs are designed to avoid government regulation by showing that tech giants can police themselves through volunteering to follow codes of practice that they've come up with themselves. </p><p>The Rome Call was cosigned by Microsoft president Brad Smith, IBM executive vice-president John Kelly, and president of the Pontifical Academy for Life Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia. [Read:Pentagon unveils toothless ethical principles for using AI in war[4]] Archbishop Paglia said[5] their partnership emerged from the friendships he had developed with the leaders of the tech giants. The Rome Call suggests that their views onAI ethics are conveniently well-aligned. The document does encourage 'new forms of regulation'for AI but proposes no specific mechanisms to do this, nor any restrictions on high-risk technologies, such as facial recognition. This approach reflects big tech's growing recognition that new rules are inevitable but can still be molded to fit the needs of the industry. The recent public pronouncement of Facebookfounder Mark Zuckerberg epitomizes this shift in stance. As news spread that the EU was preparing new regulations on AI[6]and US lawmakers were threatening to break up Facebook[7], Zuckerberg publically called for more regulation of Big Tech[8], with his own helpful suggestions on the form this could take. US Congressman David Cicilline respondedin a tweet[9] that 'Mark Zuckerberg doesn't get to make the rules anymore.'More AI ethics-washing?AI ethics programs have become widespread in Silicon Valley, but theguidelines are typically comprised of vague promises rather than clear rules and mechanisms to enforce them This has led to accusations thatthe initiatives are primarily attempts at 'ethics washing' that candeflect criticism and ward off government regulation. The transparency that they ostensibly aim to uphold is often lacking in their internal operations.Microsoft, for example, claims that as a result of recommendations from its AI ethics committee,[10]'significant sales have been cut off,' but the company offered details on whichtechnologies had been curtailed. If their initiatives are to provide any true ethical benefit, they must include practical mechanisms that turn principles into practices, independent external oversight, and true transparency into decision-making procedures. In a message read to participants in a workshop titled 'The 'Good' Algorithm?' Pope Francis said that 'a critical contribution can be made by the principles of the Church's social teaching' to the ethical development of AI. The Vatican may be able to give IBM and Microsoft moral guidance, but unless they're enforced by legal restrictions, trusting that the principles are followed would be an act of blind faith.You're here because you want to learn more about artificial intelligence.

But\u00a0critics arguethat these programs are designed to avoid government regulation by showing that tech giants can police themselves through volunteering to follow codes of practice that they've come up with themselves.<br/>The Rome Call was cosigned by Microsoft president Brad Smith, IBM executive vice-president John Kelly, and president of the Pontifical Academy for Life Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Archbishop Paglia said their partnership emerged from the friendships he had developed with the leaders of the tech giants. The Rome Call suggests that their views on\u00a0AI ethics are conveniently well-aligned.<br/>The document does encourage \"new forms of regulation\"\u00a0for AI but proposes no specific mechanisms to do this, nor any restrictions on high-risk technologies, such as facial recognition.<br/>This approach reflects big tech's growing recognition that new rules are inevitable but can still be molded to fit the needs of the industry.<br/>The recent public pronouncement of Facebook\u00a0founder Mark Zuckerberg epitomizes this shift in stance.<br/>As news spread that the EU was preparing new regulations on AI\u00a0and US lawmakers were threatening to break up Facebook, Zuckerberg publically called for more regulation of Big Tech, with his own helpful suggestions on the form this could take. US Congressman David Cicilline responded\u00a0in a tweet that \"Mark Zuckerberg doesn't get to make the rules anymore.\"<br/>More AI ethics-washing?AI ethics programs have become widespread in Silicon Valley, but the\u00a0guidelines are typically comprised of vague promises rather than clear rules and mechanisms to enforce them<br/>This has led to accusations that\u00a0the initiatives are primarily attempts at \"ethics washing\" that can\u00a0deflect criticism and ward off government regulation.<br/>The transparency that they ostensibly aim to uphold is often lacking in their internal operations.\u00a0Microsoft, for example, claims that as a result of recommendations from its AI ethics committee,\u00a0\"significant sales have been cut off,\" but the company offered details on which\u00a0technologies had been curtailed.\u00a0<br/>If their initiatives are to provide any true ethical benefit, they must include practical mechanisms that turn principles into practices, independent external oversight, and true transparency into decision-making procedures.<br/>In a message read to participants in a workshop titled \"The 'Good' Algorithm?\" Pope Francis said that \"a critical contribution can be made by the principles of the Church's social teaching\" to the ethical development of AI.<br/>The Vatican may be able to give IBM and Microsoft moral guidance, but unless they're enforced by legal restrictions, trusting that the principles are followed would be an act of blind faith.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-669395</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBJ-9041-DYDW-707B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 3, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In reality, Zuckerberg faced questions on any and all of lawmakers concerns regarding the social media giant.</p><p>In a particular heated exchange, Zuckerberg was questioned by neophyte Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on how Facebook handles fact-checking political advertisements; which they basically do not.</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez used the example of a hypothetical ad that would say Republican lawmakers are in favour of the Congresswoman's Green New Deal - a economic restructuring of the economy around the realities of climate change that members of the GOP are certainly not found of.</p><p>Zuckerberg's response to the hypothetical inaccurate ad was that they would not fact check the false statements because it is important that Facebook users see when politicians are lying or presenting doctored facts.</p><p>In essence, Facebook will not fact check misleading paid-for advertising from politicians- an obvious concern for western democracies given Facebook's nearly ubiquitous reach into our culture.</p><p>Zuckerberg's faith in the common person's ability to see through misleading advertisements is touching but is out of touch with the realities of a political world with high stakes.</p><p>Politicians on all sides of the political spectrum will absolutely misrepresent the truth to gain power and it is on gatekeepers, like Facebook, to ensure they are all held to account for misleading citizens of a democratic state.</p><p>The problem with this is that the interests of a private business with shareholders to please do not necessarily line up with those of the public good. This is why it is untenable for lawmakers to expect Facebook - and other tech giants - to police themselves.</p><p>This means federal oversight and expert third-party fact-checkers- in Canada, the U.S. and anywhere Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon and every other large tech companies operate - is necessary.</p><p>Yes, I understand that regulation is four-letter word 'round these parts, but the economic, social and political power that tech giants wield is potentially devastating for a free society.</p><p>The question is what does regulation look like?

Or is it a more measured regulation that allows third parties to ensure fact-checking compliance?</p><p>The latter seems to have more merit, as entirely breaking up a company like Facebook would mean the products millions of people rely on could potentially be watered down and thus affect the financial outcomes of millions more than just Facebook employees.</p><p>In any case, it is clear that our democracy needs to be protected online and tech companies need to work with elected legislative bodies in order to protect citizens from lies and misinformation.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:todd.vaughan@lacombeexpress.comLike\">todd.vaughan@lacombeexpress.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LACEXP-3893635</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LACEXP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCW-JCP1-JDH1-C4HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459603</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Black Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Lacombe Express</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 29, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Companies like Share-Chat, one of the most prominent in its portfolio that is valued at around $500 million, are now competing with Chinese ones, in this case Bytedance. The problem for these fledgling startups is two-fold, one of facing big technology firms, and then of raising capital while these foreign competitors pour a slug of cash to grow their business here.\"From the Indian perspective, there should be some sort of regulation so that the overall environment is conducive for homegrown champions because many of these startups are too small and vulnerable,\" Koh says.\"If you leave the gates wide open for foreigners to come in, it is easy for the whole ecosystem to be dominated by foreign players. </p><p>There needs to be an adequate balance. But shutting them up doesn't make sense.\" Koh, however, added that it is company- and individual-specific, and not a nationality issue. \"We cannot generalise, that would be risky.\" As for startups versus big tech, Koh said Bytedance, which was founded in 2010-11 and valued at $75 billion, was in its early days competing with Tencent and Weibo (a Chinese micro blogging site).\"ShareChat is differentiated from some of the other products as they focus on the vernacular market, which has a much larger audience to be targeted there. Competition is good and they will have to find their own niche.\" Interestingly, Shunwei was an investor in Bytedance, but exited the company through a secondary sale of shares. Its social portfolio in China includes YY, a video-based social network and Kwai, which is a short-video platform. Shunwei wants to come in early into Indian companies, gain conviction and then double down on them instead of entering at a later stage, Koh said.Out of its 16 investments so far, most are at the Series-A stage, with two new announcements on the anvil.Investors in India need to have a longterm view, and while the outcomes may not be as non-linear as those in China, India is the last big emerging market that cannot be ignored because of its demographics, Koh said. \"The acquisition of Flipkart by Walmart last year was a landmark event and set the benchmark for the startup ecosystem. With that, investors and founders had a great exit,\" he said. \"As an investor, I have to be realistic, if I am thinking of a 10-year exit window, the opportunity is a fraction of what we did in China. But we need to be patient and I hope to see more exits through acquisitions and IPOs.\"Having picked companies in sectors such as social network, social commerce and fintech, Shunwei is among a clutch of Chinese investors that have been aggressive in India.

Although the deal volume is still quite healthy by pre-2014 standards, this was the lowest quarter of deal funding since Q3 2014.</p><p>Funding trended downwards across the major venture hubs of North America, Europe, and Asia. The number of deals sunk lower in Asia and North America, though they rose in Europe. Europe also continued to see robust seed-stage activity, while seed deal shares dropped significantly in both North America and Asia.</p><p>\"Caution may still be the name of the game in the traditional VC market, but it's not all doom and gloom. There continues to be a lot of interest and activity coming from corporates who need to up their game when it comes to innovation, disruption and competition,\" said Brian Hughes, National Co-Lead Partner, KPMG in the US's Venture Capital Practice. \"And it's not just the big tech giants anymore. Heading into Q4 2016 and 2017, we expect to see more game-changing corporate investments in the automotive, healthcare and FinTech sectors.\"</p><p>Key Q3 highlights:</p><p>Global Q3 funding saw a 5-quarter low in mega-round deals (those over $100 million in size) - 34 in total versus 36 in Q2 2016 and 73 in Q3 2015. Regionally, Europe had just a single mega-round.<br/><br/>Global deal activity held essentially steady, with 1,983 deals for the quarter, compared to 1,978 deals in Q2 2016. In the absence of outsize deals like last quarter's financings to \"decacorns\" like Uber, Snap, and Didi Chuxing, financing fell from $28.1 billion in Q2 to $24.1 billion this quarter.<br/><br/>Total dollars in North America and Europe fell dramatically, with North America down 18 percent from the quarter prior to $14.4 billion, and Europe down 21 percent to $2.3 billion. Asia funding dropped a more modest 3 percent to $7.2 billion. However, the number of deals to Asian companies fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, down to 323.<br/><br/>After bouncing back in Q2 2016, seed rounds as a share of all global deals fell to 33 percent driven by declining seed activity in North America and Asia. Asian seed deal share dropped especially sharply, down to 29 percent from 40 percent the quarter prior.<br/><br/>Q3 2016 saw median late-stage deal sizes shrinking across all three major regions. The fall in Asia was the most dramatic, plunging to $30 million from $100 million the quarter prior, and down 80 percent from the $154 million median seen in Q3 2015.<br/><br/>After rocketing to a high of 25 new unicorns in Q3 2015, 2016 has yet to see a quarter with double-digit companies entering the VC-backed unicorn club (private companies valued at $1 billion+). Q3 2016 saw only 8 new unicorn births.</p><p>Anand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights, commented: \"Before everyone starts saying the sky is falling, it's worth noting that a bit of sobriety is a good thing. 2015 funding levels were irrationally high with a new unicorn being birthed every 3rd day as investors were keen to force-feed perceived startup winners with cash. That was not sustainable or healthy. We're seeing a reset in deal activity and mega-rounds but the levels still remain very high relative to historical levels. A renewed focus on unit economics and sustainability versus growth at all costs is not a bad thing, especially in Asia and North America as both markets got ahead of themselves. The re-introduction of rationality that we are seeing is positive.\"</p><p>In addition to presenting key global findings for Q3 2016, theVenture Pulsequarterly report series examines the state of venture capital investment on a regional basis, including key trends and analyses for Asia, North America, and Europe.\u00a0</p><p>$100 million+ financing activity has reset after 2015 peak</p><p>After topping out at 73 in Q3 2015, quarterly mega-round deals have ranged between 42 in Q1 2016 down to 34 this quarter. Q3 2016 saw well-established on-demand companies like Airbnb, Grab, and Deliveroo receiving large rounds, but investors as a whole continue to exercise caution with such commitments in 2016.</p><p>Asian companies outpaced their North American counterparts for the third-consecutive straight quarter in mega-round financings, with 17 mega-rounds compared to North America's 15. By contrast, Europe saw just a single mega-round in Q3 2016. The dearth of larger financings contributed to that continent's total drop in quarterly funding.</p><p>North America and Asia see pullback in funding; Europe sees deals rise but funding slip</p><p>North American VC-backed companies received the lion's share of funding this quarter with $14.4 billion invested. Compared to Q2 2016, deals were down 18 percent as the number of deals fell to 1,127. Whereas last quarter saw multiple billion-plus rounds, North America's largest deal this quarter was Didi Chuxing's $1 billion injection into Uber as part of Didi's takeover of Uber China.</p><p>Seed rounds continue to represent a diminishing slice of all North American deals, falling to 26 percent from 34 percent in Q3 last year. Meanwhile, median late-stage deal size shrank for the fourth-consecutive quarter. Q3 2016's figure of $22.4 million is down 34 percent from Q3 2015.</p><p>Deal activity in Asia continued to tumble. Asian VC-backed companies saw fewer deals and also fewer total funding dollars, with $7.2 billion invested across 323 deals. This compares to $7.4 billion and 339 deals in Q1 2016, and $15.4 billion over 437 deals in Q3 2015. Funding for the quarter was buoyed by large deals to Southeast Asian ride-hailing companies like Grab and Go-Jek.</p><p>Both seed activity and late-stage deal sizes fell precipitously in Asia. Seed-deal share had climbed to a 5-quarter high of 40 percent last quarter, but plunged to 29 percent in Q3 2016. Meanwhile, median late-stage deal size plummeted 70 percent to $30 million. That figure still outpaces late-stage medians in both North America and Europe, though it is much closer to the typical sizes experienced on the other continents.</p><p>Unlike the other major markets, Europe saw deal count rise to 468 for the quarter. However, this was accompanied by a second-consecutive funding decline, with a total of $2.3 billion going to VC-backed companies. After dropping sharply in Q1 2016, seed-stage deal share has remained strong for the past two quarters, representing nearly half of all European deals. However, strong seed activity has probably contributed to the drop in median early-stage deal size from $2 million in Q1 2016 to $1.5 million in Q3 2016.</p><p>Quarterly unicorn birth rate remains in single digits for 2016</p><p>Of the quarter's 8 new unicorns, 4 each were minted in Asia and North America, with none in Europe or elsewhere. Europe has not seen a new VC-backed unicorn for two straight quarters. Among Q3 2016's new unicorns were companies like Compass, Unity Technologies, and OfferUp.</p><p>Cybersecurity continues to be key VC focus</p><p>Despite a pullback in other key sectors, cybersecurity continues to attract attention from VC investors, with over $800 million in funding this quarter. While down compared to a peak of $1.1 billion in Q3'15, VC investment in cybersecurity has remained relatively stable quarter over quarter. The growing complexity of connectivity driving the business environment globally suggests cybersecurity will remain a key focus of investment in the near term.</p><p>\"Everything is connected these days: mobile devices, automobiles, pacemakers. As networks become more pervasive, companies have to rethink their cybersecurity solutions. That's why VC investment in cybersecurity technologies continues to be high. There's no silver bullet. No end game. Just a constant realization that cyber-terrorists will exploit any weakness,\" says Arik Speier, Head of Technology, KPMG in Israel. \"Because cybersecurity has been an issue for so long, companies are fatigued. This is where start-ups matter; they bring fresh ideas and solutions that reflect the shifting complexity of cyber threats.\"</p><p>Corporates accelerate global activity</p><p>Corporate deal participation continues to hit new highs as more large players either establish corporate venture capital (CVC) units or invest directly into VC-backed companies. Corporates participated in 28 percent of Q3 2016 deals, eclipsing last quarter's 26 percent. Corporate participation jumped to 45 percent in Asia, representing nearly half of all deals to VC-backed companies there. Corporate participation in North America also ticked up to a 5-quarter high of 26 percent.</p><p>Anand Sanwal of CB Insights said: \"Even as overall numbers trend down, corporations continue to access innovation and outsource R&amp;D by investing in startups. We also are continuing to see corporations invest across the funding spectrum investing not just in more mature later-stage companies but at the early stage as well. If early stage activity stays weak in North America and Asia, it's likely that corporate venture groups may pick up the slack.\"</p><p>*Note: all figures cited are in USD</p><p>About KPMG EnterpriseYou know KPMG, you might not know KPMG Enterprise.

During H1'20, M&amp;A accounted for just US$4 billion* of fintech investment (compared to $85.7 billion in H2'19), including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending. The stalled M&amp;A reflects both a general slowdown in deal activity and investors pressing pause on major deals in order to re-consider valuations and risk appetite given COVID-19.</p><p>Despite global uncertainty, VC investment was strong in all regions of the world - and is on track to surpass previous annual record highs should the trend continue. In H1'20, VC investment in fintech accounted for $20 billion, including $9.3 billion in the Americas, $6.7 billion in Asia, and $4 billion in EMEA. Indonesia-based Gojek raised $3 billion in the largest VC deal of the quarter - and the largest fintech deal overall. Gojek competitor Grab accounted for the second largest fintech VC deal ($886 million), followed by Stripe ($850 million). Late-stage deals accounted for a significant proportion of VC investment as mature fintechs continued to attract large funding rounds.</p><p>Given the long lead times for deal-making, many H1'20 deals were initiated in late 2019. COVID-19 saw new deal activity slow dramatically, except in high-priority sectors like payments. Despite the pandemic, investor interest in platform businesses remained incredibly strong in H1'20, particularly in less mature fintech markets. Platform business continued to see significant investment from investors and large techs.</p><p>\"The Gojek deal is a prime example of how the lines of fintech are blurring. The Indonesia-based platform provider, which also has a digital payment offering, attracted funding from tech giants Facebook, PayPal, Google and Tencent,\" said Ian Pollari, Global Fintech Co-leader, KPMG International.</p><p>\"The intermingling of big tech platform providers and fintech is only expected to grow as big techs work globally to extend their market reach and value propositions - particularly in markets like Southeast Asia.\"</p><p>2020 Key Highlights</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Global fintech investment is well behind 2019's total investment of $150.4 billion.

Plummeting M&amp;A investment was responsible for the decline as VC investment in the region was on record pace - with $9.3 billion raised by the end of H1'20. The US accounted for the vast majority of both total fintech investment in the Americas ($11.9 billion) and VC investment ($8.6 billion) - with large deals including the $1.3 billion reverse merger of Open Lending, an $850 million raise by Stripe, the $700 million acquisition of RDC, and a $700 million raise by Chime.</p><p>The payments space was the hottest sector for VC investment in the US. In addition to Stripe and Chime, B2B payments company AvidXchange raised $388 million. Late stage companies in other fintech sub-verticals also raised large megarounds, including wealthtech Robinhood ($430 million) which raised an additional $200 million in a separate round in mid-August 2020, cryptocurrency firm Bakkt ($300 million), and insurtech Duck Creek Technologies ($230 million).</p><p>Challenger banks raise big VC rounds in Europe<br/>Total fintech investment in EMEA declined significantly, given the lack of mega M&amp;A deals. During H1'20, the region saw $4.6 billion in fintech investment. VC investment in fintech remained strong in H1'20, accounting for US$4 billion in investment.</p><p>During H1'20, challenger banks attracted five of the 10 largest deals in EMEA, including Germany-based N26 ($570 million), UK-based Revolut ($500 million), Sweden-based Klarna ($200 million), UK-based Starling Bank ($123 million), and France-based Qonto (US$116 million).</p><p>Southeast Asia becomes hotspot for fintech activity<br/>ASPAC saw $8.1 billion in total fintech investment during H1'20, led by the US$3 billion funding round by Indonesia-based Gojek, an $886 million raise by Gojek's main competitor - Singapore-based Grab, and a $398 million raise by India-based Navi Technologies. Fintech investment in ASPAC was quite diverse from a regional perspective this quarter. In addition to Indonesia, Singapore and India, Japan (Paidy: $251 million), South Korean (KSNET: $237 million), and Australia (Airwallex: $160 million, Judo Bank: $147 million) also saw large fintech deals. Fintech investment in China remained suppressed, falling to a multi-quarter low in Q2'20.</p><p>Government regulatory efforts were a very strong trend in ASPAC. During H2'20, Australia re-opened submissions to its Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology in order to understand how COVID-19 has affected the fintech sector, while Singapore introduced a licensing program for digital asset exchanges and platforms and Hong Kong (SAR) introduced an 'opt-in' licensing program for digital assets exchanges.</p><p>Corporate fintech investment robust in face of COVID-19<br/>Corporate investment in fintech remained very strong in H1'20, accounting for $12.2 billion in investment across participating deals globally. The US was particularly notable as it saw a record high of over $2.4 billion in corporate investment in Q1'20 - a number almost matched in Q2'20. Corporate investment is expected to remain very strong heading into H2'20, in part due to the strategic nature of investments driven by corporates making investments in digital channels and products in order to serve their customers better in the COVID-19 era.</p><p>Accelerated digital trends will shape fintech's future<br/>COVID-19 will remain key driver of change for fintech investment heading into H2'20 given the strong acceleration of digital trends - such as the use of contactless payments and the demand for and use of digital service models. The ongoing acceleration of digital trends will drive fintech investment not only in direct fintech solutions, but also in related enabling technologies - such as cybersecurity, fraud prevention and digital identity management. Platform businesses will also continue to be a hot ticket for investors, particularly in less mature jurisdictions.</p><p>\"Over the remainder of 2020, we will likely see investors continuing to focus on late stage deals and safe bets given the current uncertainty. This will likely create challenges for less mature fintechs who could find themselves running out of cash and struggling to raise additional funding,\" said Anton Ruddenklau, Global Fintech Co-Leader, KPMG International.</p><p>\"In H2'20, there will likely be an increasing number of opportunistic investments by corporates and PE firms look for good deals.\"</p><p>*All figures referenced are in USD.</p><p>About KPMG International</p><p>KPMG is a global network of professional services firms providing Audit, Tax and Advisory services.
